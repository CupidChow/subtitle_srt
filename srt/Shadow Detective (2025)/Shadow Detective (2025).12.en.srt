Hello.

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,120
I just transferred here.

We'll be in the same class from now on.

What's your name?

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,880
My name is...

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,960
Ge Xin.

00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:37,770

15
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,940
Do you recognize them?

16
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,150
These two women—

17
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,840
did you kill them?

18
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,600
Just came in.

What does it say?

20
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,030
Tao Fan's rain boots—

21

all match the boot prints found
at the crime scene.

It's definitely her.

35
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,570
You'd better cooperate

36
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,430

Who did this?

52
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,630
Tao Fan, why are you so unhygienic?

53
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,070
You don't even throw away your trash.

54
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,870

He cares about everything in my life.

125

I've never met anyone who wanted to

know so much about my life.

This time it's definitely going to
work out.

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,030
I...

129
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,360
Lu Yizhen,

130
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,200
are you doing this on purpose?

131
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,260
Every time I try to talk to you,
you pretend to be asleep.

132
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,140
Inspector Guan.

133
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,270
The victim's head was submerged
in the toilet.

134

There's a wound on her abdomen.

135
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,800
Judging from the shape of the wound,

136
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,270
the murder weapon was likely
a dagger or a similar sharp object.

137
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,080
No other weapons were found at the scene—

138
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,410
only these footprints.

139
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,970
This is way too twisted.

140
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,470
The killer stabbed her once,

141
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,650
then dragged her to the bathroom,

142
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,050
which means they didn't want her
to die immediately.

143
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,250
They deliberately wanted her
to drown in the toilet.

144
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,750
The killer acted with clear intent.

145
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,000
We must have missed some information.

146
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,720
I noticed a very unusual case

147
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,630
in the list of bullied students.

148
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,340
Her name was Ge Xin.

149
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,810
She took her own life by jumping from
a building at the age of 15.

150
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,300
Yes.

151
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,270
They bullied Ge Xin

152
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,870
because they said
she had an unpleasant smell.

153
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,040
Some people said...

154
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,550
Ge Xin stole from Liu Xiaodan
and her friends

155
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,670
and was suspended.

156
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,150
Shortly after the suspension,
this happened.

157
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,480
But given Liu Xiaodan's behavior
at school,

158
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,360
no one would have wanted to offend her.

159
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,550
Ge Xin was framed.

160
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Any new findings?

161
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,300
Come look at these.

Guo Luyao

163
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,320

among rotting vegetables at the market.

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,000
Liu Xiaodan

165
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,200
was found dead in a bathtub full of filth.

166
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,400
Ma Hanqiao was found dead in the toilet.

167
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,510
Rotting vegetables,

168
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,030
a filthy bathtub,

169
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,790
a toilet—

170
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,790
the killer's crime scene choices

171
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,720
all symbolically relate to smell.

172
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,790
And Ge Xin was bullied

173
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,630
precisely because those three girls
mocked her

174
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,430
for having an unpleasant smell.

175
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
In other words,

176
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,480
the killer

177
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,910
was using
the victims' own bullying methods

178
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,080
to send a message:

179
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,160
I'm going to take revenge on you.

180
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,270
But...

181
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,560
she's been dead for so many years.

182
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,670
I discovered
from other classmates' statements

183
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,000
that Ge Xin had a brother

184
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,670
named Ge Yunchen.

185
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,080
Ge Yunchen.

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,510
You two,

190
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,440
stay here and collect evidence.

191
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
I'll drive.

192
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,320
What do you know about driving?

193
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,850
You're better off walking.

194
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,390
Just let me try!

195
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,770
What do you want to know?

196
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,590
Yes. I killed them.

197
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,850
You're surprisingly forthcoming.

198
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,720
To accomplish all this,

199
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,480
I've been planning for three years.

200
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,790
Because they bullied
your sister back then,

201
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,190
you decided to kill them?

202
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,030
Yes.

203
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,870
I wanted revenge on them

204
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,730
because they all deserved to die!

205
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,200
Xin was very unfortunate.

206
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,240
She had suffered from a strange illness
since childhood

207
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
that left a peculiar smell on her.

208
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,230
Just because of this,

209
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,080
she was humiliated by those people!

210
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,030
Ge Xin, why do you smell so bad?

211
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,150
Do you not take baths?

212
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,110
They mocked Xin in all kinds of ways.

213
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,820
They bullied Xin in every possible way!

214
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,510
Ge Xin

215
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,150
is so unhygienic.

216
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,390
She's seriously damaging
our school's reputation.

217
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,670
Why don't we all sign a petition

218
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,870
to have her expelled?

219
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,750
Good idea.

220
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,150
But I never imagined that...

221
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,460
I'd lost her...

222
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,030
I'd lost her just like that.

223
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,910
I was too careless.

224
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Am I not worthy of any friendship?

225
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,000
After Xin's death,

226
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,550
I found a diary

227
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,530
among her belongings.

228
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,790
She wrote

229
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,980
that she was constantly bullied

230
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,050
at school just because of her smell!

231
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,710
All these years...

232
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,120
whenever I thought about
what they did to Xin,

233
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,580
I couldn't suppress the rage inside me!

234
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,690
Ge Yunchen,

235
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,390
calm down.

236
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,720
Four months ago,

237
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,390
I learned they were going to have
a class reunion.

238
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,910
So I followed them to the hotel.

239
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,520
Everyone, listen up.

240
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,880
We only get to meet once a year
since graduation.

241
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,320
Tonight, we must drink till we drop!

242
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,030
Come on, cheers!

243
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,510
Drink till we drop!

244
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,870
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

245
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,830
Let's dig in.

246
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,150
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,080
I was held up at work at the restaurant.

248
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,320
Tao Fan, what a surprise!

249
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,390
Quickly, sit down!

250
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,300
Tao Fan, sit!

251
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,030
Hurry up and sit!

252
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,150
All the seats are taken.

253
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,510
Ask someone to bring you a chair!

254
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,710
Or you can eat standing up if you prefer.

255
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,030
Come on, let's drink.

256
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,270
-Let's have a drink.
-Come on, cheers!

257
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,240
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

258
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,069
Everyone...

259
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,240
must pay the price for their actions.

260
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,750
And their price...

261
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,160
is death.

262
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,310
Dong.

263
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,330
Do you know if Si Min was

264
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,460
in Liu Xiaodan's class

265
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,260
at Shanghai Girls' High School?

266
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,620
She wasn't.

267
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,750
Are you sure?

268
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,200
What's wrong?

269
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,590
What about when you spoke to
those students—

270
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,850
did no one mention her?

271
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,440
No.

272
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,730
I'm certain she wasn't.

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,590
Oh no.

274
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,030
I'm afraid Si Min might be in danger.

275
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,030
I need to go to her.

276
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,070
What's wrong?

277
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,210
Officer Lu called and said

278
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,030
they found Ge Yunchen's murder plan—

279
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,640
it has Si Min's name on it.

280
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,130
You know Si Min?

281
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,200
Who are you meeting, dressed like this?

282
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,320
If you hadn't stopped me today,

283
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,990
my plan would have succeeded by now.

284
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,780
What's the connection
between Si Min and them?

285
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,070
Si Min indeed had nothing to do

286
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,400
with those three women.

287
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,440
However, she was...

288
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,640
the straw that broke the camel's back
for Xin.

289
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,340
This bracelet of yours is so unique.

290
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,490
It's woven with gold thread.

291
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,920
If you like it...

292
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,970
you can try it on.

293
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,270
No, thanks.

294
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,780
It's okay.

295
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,070
My goodness, this is truly a rare sight.

296
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,760
Ge Xin actually has a friend?

297
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,830
Exactly.

298
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,850
You must be the new transfer student.

299
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,200
You don't know—

300
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,670
Ge Xin doesn't care much
about her hygiene.

301
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,160
She always smells.

302
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,790
We're worried
that if you stay friends with her,

303
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,650
you might pick up some bad habits.

304
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,310
That's right.

305
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,480
Be careful.

306
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,640
What is this?

307
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,680
That's mine.

308
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,680
It looks nice. Let me borrow it
for a couple of days.

309
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,750
What are you doing?

310
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,070
What are you doing?

311
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,310
What are you all doing?

312
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,440
Are you crazy?

313
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,640
You dare touch me now?

314
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,810
What are you doing?

315
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,720
Ma'am.

316
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,680
Ge Xin stole Si Min's bracelet.

317
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
We tried to get it back for her,

318
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,440
but she wouldn't return it.

319
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,640
Yes, ma'am.

320
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,480
I just saw it.

321
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,480
Si Min asked for it back,
but Ge Xin refused.

322
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,070
Right, I saw that too.

323
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,590
Xin was suspended
because of that incident.

324
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,200
Not long after...

325
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,330
she left this world.

326
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,910
[Xihua Alley]

327
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,970
Don't panic yet.

328
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,410
We have Ge Yunchen in custody.

329
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,720
Si Min should be fine.

330
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,310
No.

331
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,110
I have a really bad feeling right now.

332
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,960
Let's hurry to the hospital.

333
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,890
Give me the keys.

334
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,190
The patient's condition isn't
very good right now.

335
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,390
Do you think we should

336
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,920
report this to the inspectors again?

337
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,050
I just received news

338
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,750
that the case she's involved in

339
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,110
might not be her doing at all.

340
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,830
Another suspect has been arrested,

341
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,510
but they're still being interrogated,

342
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,840
so we can't provide accurate results yet.

343
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,480
Alright.

344
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,000
How did Tao Fan know
where you committed the crimes?

345
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,920
Did she deliberately mislead us

346
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,880
to buy you time

347
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,610
so you could continue killing?

348
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,130
She shouldn't have been dragged into this.

349
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,180
About a year ago,

350
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,750
I went to eat at the Ruyi Restaurant.

351
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,590
I accidentally ran into Tao Fan.

352
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
That was when I found out

353
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,690
she had a very serious illness.

354
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,570
She didn't want to burden her family,

355
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,590
so

356
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,560
she didn't seek treatment.

357
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,960
You saved my life.

358
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,000
Without you, I never would've made it
this far.

359
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,200
It's time for me to repay you.

360
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,440
Avenging Xin

361
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,550
is what I, as her brother, should do!

362
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,200
I can't drag you into this!

363
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,660
If you don't want my help,

364
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,360
I'll take this
to the police station right now

365
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,590
and report you for premeditated murder!

366
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,350
Tao Fan!

367
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,400
Just let me help you.

368
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,480
I...

369
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,900
You can't do this alone.

370
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,130
Let me do something for Xin.

371
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,450
We worked out what she'd say

372
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,510
in her confession if she got caught.

373
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,780
But I didn't tell her many details.

374
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,740
I don't want Tao Fan

375
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
to actually be convicted of murder.

376
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,900
Her health is getting worse.

377
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,840
I don't want her to spend

378
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,410
her final days in prison.

379
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,440
So,

380
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,200
when I learned
she had been taken away by you,

381
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,530
I did everything I could

382
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,740
to kill Ma Hanqiao

383
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,530
as quickly as possible.

384
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,400
Just to clear her of suspicion.

385
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,950
Even if you hadn't caught me,

386
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,280
after killing Si Min,

387
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,580
I'd have turned myself in anyway.

388
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,270
I'm going to answer the phone.

389
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,600
Don't do anything rash.

390
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,820
Ge Yunchen.

391
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,590
Where were you
originally planning to kill Si Min?

392
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,860
You'd better tell us the truth!

393
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,790
Ge Yunchen.

394
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,350
You're locked up here now.

395
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,640
You can't do anything.

396
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,380
But someone can act in your palce.

397
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,950
Don't you want to
stop Tao Fan from becoming a murderer

398
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,160
and ending up in prison?

399
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,550
She's escaped from the hospital now,

400
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,280
and she's going to kill for you!

401
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,290
How did this happen?

402
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,240
Tell me everything you know now,

403
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,680
and I can still stop her.

404
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,750
I just wanted to bring Si Min

405
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,590
to the place
where Xin jumped off the building

406
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,750
to make her feel

407
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,970
the same helplessness
and despair Xin felt.

408
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,480
Si Min never hurt Ge Xin.

409
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,640
I'll say it again—

410
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,240
Si Min never hurt Ge Xin!

411
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,370
What's wrong?

412
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,440
Dong, Officer Lu,

413
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,510
Tao Fan is missing!

414
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,400
Missing?

415
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,370
Go find her quickly.

416
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,160
Tao Fan somehow found out

417
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,090
that Ge Yunchen had been arrested.

418
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,550
She read Ge Yunchen's notebook before,

419
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,880
so now she's going to...

420
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,880
kill Si Min.

421
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,030
But Tao Fan is terminally ill.

422
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,920
How could she possibly do that?

423
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,720
Never underestimate a person

424
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,250
who's backed into a corner.

425
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,450
I'll check this room over here.

426
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,880
Hello.

427
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,370
Have you seen Dr. Si?

428
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,550
Dr. Si?

429
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,200
A patient just delivered a letter to her.

430
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,510
She read it and left.

431
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,390
Where did she go?

432
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,030
It seems her boyfriend

433
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,160
asked her to meet him on the rooftop.

434
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,830
Quite romantic, actually.

435
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,830
Where's the rooftop?

436
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,440
There are stairs over there.

437
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,790
Dong, I'll go up first!
You go back and report this!

438
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,110
Watch yourself!

439
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,960
Okay!

440
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,360
What are you doing? Let go of me!

441
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,440
Where is Ge Yunchen? Who are you?

442
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,880
It's normal that you don't remember me.

443
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,510
After all, you transferred out
not long after you transferred in.

444
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,640
And I was such an unremarkable nobody.

445
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,120
But there's someone you can't forget.

446
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,550
Shortly after you transferred out,

447
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
she jumped off a building.

448
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,280
Do you still remember her?

449
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,720
Ge Xin.

450
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,680
Ge Xin...

451
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
Ge Yunchen will never see you again.

452
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,000
How could he possibly want to see

453
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,640
his sister's murderer?

454
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,200
Ge Yunchen is Ge Xin's brother?

455
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,590
That's right.

456
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,070
We have no grudge against each other,

457
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,670
so I really shouldn't be treating you
this way.

458
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,110
But I must

459
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,750
make you

460
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,270
pay

461
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,750
in the same way—for Ge Yunchen and Ge Xin.

462
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,830
Get up.

463
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,570
What are you doing?

464
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,670
Let go of me!

465
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,900
Let go of me!

466
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,350
Move!

467
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,960
Help! Help!

468
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,900
Let me go!

469
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,350
Help! Help!

470
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,720
Don't move, Tao Fan!

471
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,790
Yizhen, save me!

472
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,750
Calm down.

473
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,880
Let Si Min come down.

474
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,270
Help...

475
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:41,920
Stop!

476
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:42,870
Yizhen...

477
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,590
Tao Fan.

478
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,030
I understand you.

479
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,000
Really.

480
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,240
I do.

481
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,350
I understand Ge Yunchen too.

482
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,080
I'm not trying to persuade you.

483
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,210
But I want you to think about this:

484
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,760
if Ge Xin were still here,

485
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,860
would she want her only friend

486
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,500
and her only family

487
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,130
to become a murderer because of her?

488
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,280
Of course not.

489
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,790
She was too kind.

490
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,270
It was because of her kindness

491
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,930
that she met such a tragic end.

492
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,640
Just like when I was diagnosed
with a terminal illness,

493
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,440
I asked myself countless times—

494
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,280
why did I end up like this

495
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,710
when I did nothing wrong?

496
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,490
Later, I figured it out.

497
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,610
Good people can turn evil
with one wrong thought,

498
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,720
while bad people can find redemption
by laying down their weapons.

499
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,920
This world was never fair to begin with.

500
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,600
Ge Xin and Ge Yunchen were
both good people.

501
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,270
I don't want to see good people

502
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,920
suffer any more injustice.

503
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,210
I'm a dying person anyway.

504
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,520
I might as well use
this worthless life of mine...

505
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
to seek justice.

506
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,480
Wait!

507
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,980
Yizhen! Yizhen, save me!

508
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,740
Yizhen...

509
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,440
Wait!

510
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,890
You... Stop!

511
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,030
Fine.

512
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,650
Even if everything you said is right,

513
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,010
what did Si Min do wrong?

514
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,680
She never hurt Ge Xin.

515
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,610
She's innocent!

516
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,750
Innocent?

517
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,750
Knowing evil and not opposing it

518
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,880
is another kind of evil!

519
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,590
I never meant to hurt Ge Xin!

520
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,590
I wanted to help her!

521
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,510
Ma'am.

522
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,310
Si Min,

523
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
what are you doing here?

524
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,920
Didn't you transfer to Yucai High School?

525
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,590
Ma'am, I heard Ge Xin was suspended.

526
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,890
But what happened that day

527
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,220
wasn't her fault at all.

528
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,350
It was those girls

529
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,610
who bullied her first.

530
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,110
It's already over,

531
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,820
and the punishment has been carried out.

532
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,350
Don't meddle in this anymore.

533
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,160
Ma'am,

534
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,460
but that's not what really happened.

535
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,000
If those who did nothing wrong
are punished,

536
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,040
won't those who actually did wrong

537
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,570
become even more arrogant?

538
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,330
Okay, I understand.

539
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,410
I'll speak to the school about it.

540
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,270
Ma'am.

541
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,680
I haven't been able to reach Ge Xin.

542
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
If she comes back,

543
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,920
please

544
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,800
give her this letter for me.

545
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,370
Alright, you should go home now.

546
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,920
How is that possible?

547
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,360
How is that possible?

548
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,350
Everything is clear now.

549
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,590
You need to let go of your obsession.

550
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,280
Come down.

551
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,990
Bring Si Min down too.

552
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,040
Listen to me.

553
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,480
Yizhen...

554
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,310
Come down first.

555
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,830
Yizhen!

556
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,310
You helped her.

557
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,830
You helped her?

558
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,880
But as her only friend,

559
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,230
I did nothing!

560
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,440
Si Min!

561
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,690
-Make way! Make way!
-Come on!

562
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,730
-Step back!
-Step back!

563
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,070
Turns out I'm the other kind of evil.

564
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,340
I'm the other kind of evil.

565
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,310
Tao Fan.

566
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Calm down.

567
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,180
Yizhen!

568
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,480
Si Min!

569
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,550
Si Min!

570
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,880
Si Min!

571
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,070
Si Min!

572
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,280
Be careful!

573
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,800
Hold on!

574
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,470
-Hold on!
-Stay strong!

575
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:55,930
Come on!

576
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,770
Si Min...

577
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,580
Alright. It's okay now.

578
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,890
Alright. You're fine now.

579
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,600
How are you? Are you alright?

580
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,480
Where does it hurt?

581
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,400
Say something, Si Min!

582
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,110
Everything hurts.

583
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
E-Everything...

584
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,100
Fortunately, she's just frightened.

585
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,100
No injuries.

586
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
What about you? Did you get checked?

587
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,240
How could anything be wrong with him?

588
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,170
My arm hurts, and my back hurts too.

589
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,770
Look, now that I mention it—
this spot right here.

590
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,970
My funny bone here...

591
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,740
Don't stay here any longer.

592
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,300
Go home.

593
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,930
I'll take her directly to my place later.

594
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,860
No need to worry.

595
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,460
Let me drive you home.

596
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,870
She's my sister.
Of course, I'll take them.

597
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,270
Lu Yizhen is my subordinate.

598
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,960
Then I'm...

599
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,540
Enough! Stop messing around! Go!

600
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:13,750
Go!

601
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,480
Go!

602
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,140
Hurry.

603
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,020
-I'm leaving, Si Min.
-Go! Hurry!

604
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,190
Those two

605
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,910
didn't come here to check on me at all.

606
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,300
They came to impress you.

607
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,450
How can you say
they weren't here to check on you?

608
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,170
No.

609
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,090
Isn't that obvious?

610
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,590
Their feelings for you

611
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,470
are crystal clear.

612
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,820
How long are you going to play dumb?

613
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,720
You just suffered for love yourself,

614
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,780
and now you want to drag me into it too?

615
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,280
I met the wrong person,

616
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,710
but at least you have my cousin's
genuine affection...

617
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,830
I'm serious.

618
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,270
Love is about mutual feelings.

619
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,160
Your cousin is a really, really nice man,

620
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,200
but I've never felt anything for him.

621
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,310
He's my superior.

622
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,980
After all this talk,

623
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:14,300
you've really fallen for Guan Cen...

624
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,350
You don't love me anymore...

625
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,240
Of course I love you.

626
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,640
When have I ever tried to sweet-talk him?

627
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,900
I only sweet-talk you.

628
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,840
Right? Okay.

629
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,450
Alright, let's go home.

630
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,270
Come on, I'll take you home.
