I've also verified the facts
with Mei from the nursing home.

Liu Jialiang and Zhou Yongjie

11

did embezzle all the charitable funds
meant for the nursing home.

12

Even the donations specifically

13

directed to each elderly resident

14

After compiling the information
from various sources,

21
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,190
I made the following deductions.

22
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,030
The deceased,
Liu Jialiang and Zhou Yongjie,

23
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,740
were well acquainted with each other
as friends.

24
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,240
They went to a casino together

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,430
in the hope of making a fortune
by cheating.

26
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,660
Unexpectedly, they were caught in the act.

27

Then, Long turned his back on them.

28
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,560
Liu and Zhou ended up owing massive debts.

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,690
To pay off the debts,

30
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,430
they started

31
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,030
targeting the nursing home.

32
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,190
Liu Jialiang even confined his own mother

33
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,140
in an attempt to extort more money.

34
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,840
Therefore, we have grounds for suspicion

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,380
that the killer of Liu and Zhou

36
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,380
is connected with the nursing home.

37
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,680
That doesn't sound right.

38

are elderly people

committed two murders in a row?

I know it sounds unbelievable.

Nut based on the evidence
found at the scenes

43
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,630
and the information we have,

44
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,290
this is a strong possibility.

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,560
First,
they had sufficient motive for murder.

Second,

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,710
we found large amounts

of sedatives in the victims' bodies,

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,240
which means the killer took their lives

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,400
when they were incapacitated.

51
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,560
Under those circumstances,

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,420
anyone could carry out a killing.

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,360
So, the killer could be

55
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,630

had no intention
to conceal his criminal acts.

189
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,960
Instead, he wanted them to be revealed.

190
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,220
That's a possibility.

191
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,549
But now we're not sure

192
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,870
if there are connections
between the nursing home

193
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,760
and both Lin Xuehui and her mother.

194
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,120
So, we need to reinvestigate

195
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,390
these victims' interpersonal relations.

196
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:48,870
Understood?

197
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,630
Understood.

198
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,330
Get to work.

199
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,420
Take a nap if you're tired.

200
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,400
Newcomers to the Police Station

201
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,290
usually find it hard to settle in.

202
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,490
I'm actually...

203
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,910
I'm actually adjusting well.

204
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,790
I can manage.

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Look into this.

206
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,450
Okay. Just a moment.

207
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,580
Lu Yizhen, pull yourself together.

208
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,020
Dong.

209
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,840
Do you have anything

210
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,670
that can refresh my mind?

211
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,540
Something refreshing...

212
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,800
A cup of coffee.

213
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,950
I've had cups of coffee.

214
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,480
I can't drink that anymore.

215
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,840
Why not go home and get some sleep?

216
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,570
This is going to be a long night.

217
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,990
How are you still so energetic?

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,710
Me?

219
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,870
After working for many years
in the police station,

220
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,800
I've got used to this work pattern.

221
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,680
You're new here.

222
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,510
It's understandable
that you haven't adjusted to it.

223
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,370
Just take a nap.

224
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,780
Maybe I should resort to drastic measures.

225
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,690
I forgot a document.

226
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,810
Get some sleep. It won't affect anything.

227
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,960
Inspector,

228
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,870
why not just let her go?

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,750
It'll take her several hours on the road
if she leaves now.

230
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,950
All that time will be wasted traveling.

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,730
That's true.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,080
Besides, she said she could adjust

233
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,680
and continue reading files.

234
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,090
Go ahead with your work.

235
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,150
Be gentle.

236
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,200
Hello?

237
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,890
This is the Police Station.

238
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,390
You're asking for Lu Yizhen?

239
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,450
Okay, please hold.

240
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,390
Lu Yizhen.

241
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,840
Lu Yizhen!

242
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,530
A call for you.

243
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,390
Thanks.

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,400
Hello, this is Lu Yizhen.

245
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,600
Mrs. Gao?

246
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,130
Okay. I'll be right there.

247
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,370
What happened?

248
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,660
It was a call from Fang Ruhai.

249
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,750
He said Mrs. Gao was at his place.

250
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,600
But she got sick,

251
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,720
and he couldn't send her back,
so he asked me to come over.

252
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,980
Any doubts about that?

253
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,390
Fang works for the China International
Famine Relief Commission.

254
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,360
This institute

255
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,440
has rendered help
to the nursing home before.

256
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,200
He could've asked

257
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,630
a colleague of his to send Mrs. Gao back.

258
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,430
Why did he call me in particular?

259
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,630
I'll go with you.

260
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,270
No need.

261
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,160
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

262
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,550
Dong,

263
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,790
in our files, is there information

264
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,600
about the China International
Famine Relief Commission?

265
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,530
I feel like I've seen it somewhere.

266
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,140
I'm looking for it.

267
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,650
Alright.

268
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,740
I'm leaving now.

269
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,160
It's a chance to investigate Fang Ruhai.

270
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,640
Dong,

271
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,150
go with Lu Yizhen.

272
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,210
I'll do the search.

273
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,600
Hurry up.

274
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,130
Okay, fine.

275
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,600
I thought

276
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,470
Officer Lu would come alone.

277
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,270
With the two of us here,

278
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,530
Mrs. Gao's safety can be better secured.

279
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,570
Where is she?

280
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,510
Come on in.

281
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,480
Why is it so cold

282
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,790
inside your house?

283
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,850
My mother is sensitive to heat.

284
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,850
So, I usually prepare large ice pieces
to cool the air

285
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,420
for her.

286
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,200
Have some water.

287
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,400
Thank you very much.

288
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,750
Thank you.

289
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,470
I was just getting a bit thirsty.

290
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,520
Your place is really hard to find.

291
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,270
Where's Mrs. Gao?

292
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,320
She's in her room.

293
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,510
I'll go get her for you.

294
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:39,910
Okay.

295
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:41,960

296
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,750
Thank you. Don't be so formal.

298
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,150

I need to see the inspector.

301
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,630
Ma'am, calm down.

302
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,720
Just tell me what happened.

303
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,840
I need to see the inspector. I need to...

304
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,170
I am the inspector here.

305
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,100
What emergency are you reporting?

306
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,030

Are you Mrs. Gao from the nursing home?

310
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,960
You know who I am?

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
Shouldn't you be at Fang Ruhai's place?

312
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,510
No, no. Meijuan is in danger!

313
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,000
Meijuan is in danger...

314
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,790
Who is Meijuan? What danger is she in?

315
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,120

316
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,320

00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,120
I'll read it.

319

Alright.

320
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,360
Take a seat. I'll read the note.

Yes.

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,920
Just now, I...

375
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,680
So, I...

376
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,350
I get it.

377
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,880
Are you alright?

378
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,830
I'm fine.

379
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,060
How is Dong?

380
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,830
He's fine. Don't worry.

381
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,760
You're awake?

382
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,000
Dr. Gu.

383
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,640
This is Gu Sinian,
an attending psychiatrist

384
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,770
at Nianci Hospital.

385
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,410
Dr. Gu has a good relationship

386
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,720
with our police station.

387
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,790
Some officers were traumatized
in the line of duty,

388
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,990
and Mr. Gu cured them.

389
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:04,490
Hello.

390
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,380
Nice to meet you, Dr. Gu.

391
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,670
Be seated. It's okay.

392
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,350
Traumatized?

393
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,830
Because I fired my gun?

394
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,360
Have a good talk with Dr. Gu.

395
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,120
Consider it an order.

396
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,940
I'll wait for you outside.

397
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,160
Rest assured.

398
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,750
Let's have a brief chat.

399
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,350
Judging from your condition,

400
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,740
I assume you still have a clear mind,

401
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,740
since you remember firing your gun.

402
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Dr. Gu, I...

403
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,260
When I was in Fang Ruhai's house,

404
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,190
I drank some water with drugs in it.

405
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,270
So, at that time, I might not have been

406
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,270
of sound mind...

407
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,070
I understand.

408
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,160
Inspector Guan already told me

409
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,360
what happened there.

410
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
How is Fang Ruhai?

411
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,440
He's in emergency surgery.

412
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,060
It's still unclear
whether he'll make it or not,

413
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,260
since he was shot in the femoral artery.

414
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,750
I didn't mean to kill him.

415
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,210
Do you regret it?

416
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,000
No.

417
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,450
I had no other option back then.

418
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,680
You believe...

419
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,350
you would've died

420
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,370
if you hadn't shot him at that time?

421
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,640
Yes.

422
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,410
But still, I didn't want him dead.

423
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,550
I understand.

424
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,760
Very good.

425
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,070
You're feeling guilt, remorse,

426
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,880
even fear, and a sense of dread.

427
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,930
This is completely normal.

428
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,110
Your counterattack

429
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,200
was an instinctive response to stress.

430
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,030
Though officers such as yourself
have received professional training,

431
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,880
and are more mentally resilient
than ordinary people,

432
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,590
the human will to live
can be stronger than you think,

433
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,590
especially in extreme situations.

434
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,890
It's fine to have those emotions,

435
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,450
but don't beat yourself up.

436
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,200
The will to live...

437
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,960
Perhaps it's related
to what I've been through.

438
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,480
I know.

439
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,000
I read your profile beforehand

440
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,590
and learned a bit about your past.

441
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,920
Don't hastily draw conclusions

442
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,400
on uncertain matters.

443
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,270
But this is not

444
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,930
a subject of today's session.

445
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,250
Regarding the shooting incident only...

446
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,590
would you feel better
if I said the following?

447
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,320
Here it goes.

448
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,130
Whether you had shot Fang Ruhai or not,

449
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
he wouldn't have lived much longer.

450
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,040
What do you mean?

451
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,840
Fang Ruhai was diagnosed

452
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,720
with a terminal illness a year ago.

453
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,920
He would probably...

454
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,320
only have a few more weeks to live.

455
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,300
It's okay. Relax. All is fine.

456
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,750
Take a break.

457
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,690
Eat an apple.

458
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,750
Dr. Gu,

459
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,900
don't you have other questions for me?

460
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,270
No.

461
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,200
Is the therapy over?

462
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,200
Yes.

463
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,640
For you,

464
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,570
this conversation was just a formality.

465
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,900
You'll be fine.

466
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,330
Trust yourself.

467
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:02,790
[Office]

468
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,800
How are you?

469
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,480
I'm quite well.

470
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,080
You didn't have to wait here.

471
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,240
I just came to tell you

472
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,010
the case is closed.

473
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,160
You can return to your post
when you're discharged from the hospital.

474
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,960
What's the deal with Fang Ruhai?

475
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,350
Actually, he started killing

476
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,060
as he became worried that after he died,

477
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,060
no one would take care of his mother.

478
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,500
Fang Ruhai's wife passed away early.

479
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,030
They didn't have children.

480
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,440
Fang is a rather rigid man

481
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,880
without any close friends.

482
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,270
The only solution

483
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,400
he could come up with

484
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,590
was to kill his own mother first

485
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,120
before taking his own life.

486
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,200
That way,

487
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,960
his mother wouldn't suffer for a lack of

488
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,690
caregivers.

489
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,300
Fang Ruhai’s mother

490
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,500
noticed something odd with her son

491
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,160
and wrote a letter to her good friend,

492
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,880
namely Mrs. Gao in the nursing home.

493
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,830
Unfortunately, Mrs. Gao has dementia.

494
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,750
Although she received the letter,

495
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,110
she forgot all the content,

496
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,570
except that she had to go see
her good friend.

497
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,920
But it was too late.

498
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,290
Fang Ruhai sedated his mother as planned

499
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,140
and ended her life at last.

500
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,200
He already planned to commit suicide.

501
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,480
What turned him into a serial killer?

502
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,960
Just when Fang Ruhai
was about to commit suicide,

503
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,290
at a fundraising event,

504
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,000
he met Liu Jialiang's mother,

505
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,440
who was there to make donations.

506
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,640
By chance, he learned

507
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,110
that Liu Jialiang had abused
his own mother.

508
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,870
That was when Fang Ruhai started

509
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,970
turning into a twisted person.

510
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,550
I believe

511
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,440
that after he murdered Liu Jialiang,

512
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,190
he decided to kill

513
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,310
as many unfilial children as possible

514
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,510
before his own death.

515
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,270
Just based on what he saw
in that brief moment,

516
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,110
he determined that I was unfilial,

517
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,170
so he had to kill me?

518
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,140
Maybe he wasn't like that
in the first place.

519
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,130
Major life changes

520
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,560
can impact one's state of mind.

521
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,320
I assume you know that well.

522
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,350
What do you mean?

523
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,520
Let me ask you.

524
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,930
Why did you want to become
a police officer?

525
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,680
I guess

526
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,000
you made up your mind
to find the killer from years ago

527
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,200
all by yourself.

528
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,500
So what if that's true?

529
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,330
This is my fault.

530
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,720
I apologize to you.

531
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,530
I don't expect you to forgive me,

532
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,920
or to understand my actions.

533
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,110
I admit I hate the idea
of you working in the police station.

534
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,640
But if you insist on
continuing with this job,

535
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,310
don't change yourself
for anyone else.

536
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,370
Juggernaut,

537
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,710
will the murderer
be identified in the end?

538
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,110
So far,
Jie seems to be the biggest suspect.

539
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
But there may be a twist.

540
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,130
The cleaner could also be a suspect.

541
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,370
Just keep reading and you'll find out.

542
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,070
The murderer isn't Jie,

543
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,240
but his girlfriend.

544
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,510
It's indicated at the end of chapter two.

545
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,240
Juggernaut,

546
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,960
are we thinking the same way?

547
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,200
Another murder case with no blood.

548
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,530
Juggernaut does have a consistent style.

549
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,140
Thank you for saving me
in Fang Ruhai's case.

550
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,800
It was you who saved yourself.

551
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,370
But I get to work
in the Police Station...

552
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,270
That decision was made by the higher-ups,

553
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,070
not me.

554
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,110
The Police Station is a place

555
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,680
that values individual ability.

556
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,940
If you don't think
you're suited for this place,

557
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,510
you may apply to be transferred back
to Inspector Zhu's team

558
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,140
and resume your old job
of buying breakfast

559
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,670
and doing archival search.

560
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,020
Don't ever expect me to thank you.

561
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,550
You're overthinking it.

562
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,030
As you're working here,

563
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,350
I have only one requirement for you.

564
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,750
That is to obey my orders.

565
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,720
Now, go buy me breakfast.

566
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,590
What?

567
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,200
Are you serious?

568
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,030
Of course.

569
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,800
Do I look like I'm joking?

570
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,890
Buy me some pan-fried buns

571
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,890
with crispy skin,

572
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,450
plus a bowl of tofu pudding.

573
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,560
What's so good
about the Police Station?

574
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,020
I still have to tofu pudding
for my boss here.

575
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,790
Inspector.

576
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,690
He's waited a long time for you.

577
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,160
Got it.

578
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,200
Director Huo.

579
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,160
I've transferred an officer
to your unit.

580
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,960
Thank you, Director Huo,

581
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,360
for adding manpower
to the Police Station.

582
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
This is the only place

583
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,490
where Lu's potential
can be fully realized.

584
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,580
What's your plan?

585
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,000
I'll give her chances to use her strengths

586
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,440
during case investigations.

587
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,510
I promise to help her live up

588
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,970
to your expectations for her,
Director Huo.

589
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,920
Really?

590
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,820
Don't think I'm clueless.

591
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,440
You're working on that old case again,
aren't you?

592
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,880
The suspect of that case

593
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,890
from years ago already vanished
without a trace.

594
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,990
Even the only survivor, Lu Yizhen,

595
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,960
can't remember anything.

596
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,000
She lost her memory!

597
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,720
What leads do you have? How to proceed?

598
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,160
That gang must be still doing
the same old evil stuff.

599
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,490
It's just what you say. Where's the proof?

600
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,510
Word has it

601
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,350
that the mastermind
behind this human trafficking case, Ghost,

602
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,480
has recently reappeared in Shanghai.

603
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,110
Ghost?

604
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,840
Didn't he flee Shanghai?

605
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
An informant said

606
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,460
the fire back then
was exactly caused by Ghost.

607
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,980
It was that very fire

608
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,680
that brought Lu Yizhen's case to light.

609
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,030
Nobody saw Ghost again after the fire.

610
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,440
People all thought he had fled Shanghai.

611
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,510
But a source claimed

612
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,590
to have seen Ghost in Shanghai lately.

613
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,990
And it's highly possible

614
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,920
that Ghost has never left the city
all this time.

615
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,980
That can't be true.

616
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,510
If he never left Shanghai,

617
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,030
we would have found him already!

618
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,440
What if
he's been concealing his real identity

619
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,500
and has cut ties with all his fellows?

620
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,280
We wouldn't know, would we?

621
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,730
I suppose that's possible.

622
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,030
I've also heard

623
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,660
that he was once put in jail

624
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,160
under a different identity.

625
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,020
That was why we couldn't find him.

626
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,350
He's got some nerve.

627
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Sometimes the most dangerous place

628
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,400
is the safest place.

629
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,110
Oh, Guan Cen,

630
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,990
you've been quite busy
behind my back, haven't you?

631
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,580
I need to give myself closure.

632
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,860
What closure?

633
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,600
What are you doing here?

634
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,550
I was worried
that your breakfast might get cold

635
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,310
before you ate it, so I brought it over.

636
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,970
I just overheard your conversation
by the door.

637
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,010
You're investigating that old case?

638
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,790
Didn't I make it clear

639
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,970
to you at the entrance just now?

640
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,830
I have only one requirement for you

641
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,680
as you work in the Police Station.

642
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,080
That is to obey my orders.

643
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,830
Sharing the superior's burden

644
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,070
is also part of my job.

645
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,950
Am I right, Director Huo?

646
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,220
Since Ghost is in Shanghai,

647
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,980
he has to interact with others.

648
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,480
Maybe we'll have useful findings

649
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,350
if we visit the place
where the informant saw Ghost

650
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,350
and ask around in the neighborhood.

651
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,310
Looks like Inspector Guan and I
have the same idea.

652
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,130
That being the case,

653
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,730
I request to join the investigation.

654
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,300
No way.

655
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,960
Then forget I was

656
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,420
ever in this office today.

657
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,640
Lu Yizhen.

658
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
What do you want?

659
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,490
Do you really want to join?

660
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,240
Yes.
