00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,310
Thank you.

5
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,870
Any new leads?

6
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,360
No.

7
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,870
These cases

8
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,400
have no connection
to that rape-murder case.

9
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,360

10
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,560
Inspector.

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,240
Taihua Restaurant
and West Taihua Restaurant

12
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,710
are actually owned by the same person.

13
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,680
So the owner
often travels between the two.

14
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,430
But the restaurants are too far apart,

15
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,550
so their customers

16
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,980
probably don't overlap.

17
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,660
But guess what I found.

18
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,600
Are you very thirsty?

19
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,270
Finish your words.

20
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,070
I found two people who frequently appear

21
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,840
at both restaurants
in their account books.

22
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,470
Look.

23
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,970
This is Salesman Wang.

24
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,590
He often goes to these 2 restaurants

25
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,120
to sell his tape recorders.

26
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,220
And Mr. Dong—

27
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,030
he's a rickshaw puller.

28
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,960
But he also frequently goes
to these 2 restaurants.

29
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,960
A rickshaw puller
can afford a meal at Taihua?

30
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah, I wonder about that too.

31
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,040
What's more,

32
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,710
after this case happened,

33
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,170
this person never appeared again.

34
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,770
We need to focus our investigation
on these 2 people.

Tomorrow, you'll go with me to Taihua.

36
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,080
You go to Director Huo

37
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,030
and see if there are any other files

38
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,150

39
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,560

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,890
I was impulsive.

189
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,630
Okay, Mr. Huo. I'll listen to you.

190
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,760
Alright. Go on then.

191
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,760
Do your best.

192
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,670
Sir,

193
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,280
a lady from the police station
asked me to give this to you.

194
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,100
[Thank you. I don't need them. -Lu Yizhen]

195
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,870
What beautiful roses.

196
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
It's a pity

197
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,680
they were sent to the wrong person.

198
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,420
Nice to meet you, Dr. Ding.

199
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Director Du, as expected of someone
from the Intelligence Department.

200
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,580
You're also impressive, Dr. Ding,

201
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,720
knowing who I am
without having met me before.

202
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,620
Your reputation precedes you, Director Du.

203
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,510
Plus,

204
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,530
after what you did at the Police Station,

205
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,930
it's hard not to know you.

206
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,630
We never had the chance to meet before.

207
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,720
Let me formally introduce myself today.

208
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,580
I'm Du Linfeng.

209
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,510
Looking forward to working with you.

210
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,330
You seem to be in quite good spirits.

211
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,240
You don't look like someone

212
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,690
who was just rejected.

213
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,970
Relationships are never smooth sailing.

214
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,080
A small suggestion for you.

215
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,090
Milk destroys the coffee's inherent aroma,

216
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,390
especially its acidity.

217
00:11:59,210 --> 00:11:59,800
The beans here

218
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,280
are all lightly roasted,

219
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,280
which preserves
the coffee's original flavor

220
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,670
and those floral and fruity notes
to the maximum extent,

221
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,150
especially
that quality and distinct acidity.

222
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Since you want to taste the acidity,

223
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,720
why add sugar?

224
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,700
Isn't that contradictory?

225
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,920
It seems contradictory, but it's not.

226
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,480
Sugar can instantly open up your palate

227
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,280
and heighten your sensitivity.

228
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,300
In other words,

229
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,280
adding sugar
is to better appreciate the acidity.

230
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,490
But I think

231
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,070
adding sugar

232
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,430
ruins the coffee's purity and mouthfeel.

233
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,540
The sugar, to this cup of coffee,

234
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,790
is like

235
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,160
those roses to you just now—

236
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,100
utterly superfluous.

237
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,200
Dr. Ding,
you have a deep misunderstanding of sugar.

238
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,960
It seems

239
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,650
you've drunk quite a few cups of coffee

240
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,300
ruined by sugar before.

241
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,740
When I was young and naive,
I didn't know how to appreciate things.

242
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,340
It's common
to drink a few cups of awful coffee.

243
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:05,910
Indeed.

244
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,970
Who can know their own taste preferences
from the start?

245
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,840
[Maintain Law and Discipline]

246
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,500
Wait for me.

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,530
Let's go.

248
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,440
According to the pattern
in the account books,

249
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,370
the salesman should be here today.

250
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,510
We'll split up.

251
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,370
I'll go meet Salesman Wang.

252
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,480
You go ask around

253
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,420
about Mr. Dong.

254
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,240
[Taihua Restaurant]

255
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,910
Absolutely worth every penny.

256
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,870
Then I'll buy one.

257
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,600
I'll buy one.

258
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,870
This gentleman is very decisive.

259
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,320
This tape recorder

260
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,120
absolutely matches your style.

261
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,000
Come.

262
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,670
I'm Guan Cen, an inspector
from the Police Station.

263
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,100
-The police station?
-I'm here to ask you about something.

264
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,060
I'm not buying it.

265
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,660
Wait. Sir, you...

266
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,480
E-Everyone,
this has n-nothing to do with me.

267
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,190
Wait, gentlemen, you...

268
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,440
Inspector Guan, right?

269
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,200
Aren't you being too presumptuous?

270
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,990
You...

271
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,120
You've scared all my customers away.

272
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,320
I'm running legitimate business here.

273
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,440
A murder occurred recently.

274
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,080
I'd like to ask for some information.

275
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,790
Murder?

276
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,450
D-Did one of my customers die?

277
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,480
No.

278
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,710
Then it has nothing to do with me.

279
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,630
Y-You think I'd abandon my business

280
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,690
to go kill someone?

281
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,720
We just want to know

282
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,600
where you were and what you were doing
on the evenings

283
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
of the third and the fifth of this month.

284
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,200
I was either at Taihua or West Taihua,

285
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,170
or at home.

286
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,730
Is there anyone who can verify that?

287
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,600
Everyone here can vouch for me.

288
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,120
You can also ask my parents at my place.

289
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,790
If you still don't believe them,
you can ask the neighbors.

290
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,120
What you said is very important to us.

291
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,990
Later we'll need to investigate
and collect evidence.

292
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,390
Please cooperate.

293
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,440
Later?

294
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,280
You want to disrupt my business again?

295
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,980
Salesman Wang,

296
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,120
what you said is very important to us.

297
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,180
It can help us solve the case quickly.

298
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,580
Solve the case?

299
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,680
Let me ask you, Inspector Guan,

300
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,400
if you solve the case
and find the murderer,

301
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,000
will you still arrest me?

302
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,830
If you haven't committed a crime,
why would we arrest you?

303
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,610
Maybe the criminal is very hard to catch,

304
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,130
or you want to close the case quickly,

305
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,280
so you want to find a scapegoat like me.

306
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,320
The Police Station handles cases
based on evidence.

307
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,790
We won't falsely accuse a good person,

308
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,080
nor will we let a bad one slip away.

309
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,030
I doubt that.

310
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,510
What if I were a general's son?

311
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,440
Even if I killed a few people,

312
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,770
you wouldn't dare arrest me, right?

313
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,720
As long as you commit a crime,

314
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,550
even if you're a general's son,

315
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,550
the Police Station won't let you off.

316
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,150
Thank you for your answer, Inspector Guan.

317
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,220
Since you're here,

318
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,600
I'd like to broaden your horizons as well.

319
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,200
Even if you haven't committed a crime,

320
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,260
the Police Station won't let you off.

321
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,420
Well... if he hasn't committed a crime,

322
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,840
why arrest him?

323
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,120
That's right!

324
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,440
What tricks did you play?

325
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,960
This is

326
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,030
the latest tape recorder
developed in America.

327
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,510
You can record

328
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,290
any sound you want.

329
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,600
The words just played

330
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,250
was said by Inspector Guan.

331
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,470
I hope everyone can bear witness for me.

332
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,840
What are you doing, Inspector Guan?

333
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,870
This is very valuable!

334
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,120
I'm telling you! You'll break it!

335
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,390
If you... you do that, you'll...

336
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,670
You're from the Police Station?

337
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,840
Inspector Guan.

338
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,660
Do you know British people

339
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,270
love coming to my restaurant most?

340
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,069
That's right.

341
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:06,849
Do you want me

342
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,349
to complain to your superior?

343
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:08,790
Exactly.

344
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,720
Shut your mouth!

345
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,150
Sorry.

346
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,920
Excuse me.

347
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,880
I can't believe
he had the nerve to do that.

348
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,080
He truly went too far.

349
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,310
Did they go too far?

350
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Or did you go too far?

351
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,040
Director Huo.

352
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
The whole concession is talking about it!

353
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,030
Whether someone is guilty or not,

354
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,310
the Police Station

355
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,880
won't let them off!

356
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,300
Did you go investigate the case

357
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,500
or cause trouble?

358
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,790
I was careless.

359
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,270
Careless?

360
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,520
Now I order you

361
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,350
to minimize the negative impact!

362
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,350
I don't want to hear

363
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,750
any more gossip about the Police Station!

364
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,920
Yes.

365
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,400
Go!

366
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,340
Give me the cup.

367
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,860
Inspector.

368
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,310
There are many reporters outside.

369
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,170
What happened?

370
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,220
Most likely
because of Salesman Wang's recording.

371
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,860
Salesman Wang?

372
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
It's a long story.

373
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,150
In short,
he's outside smearing the Police Station.

374
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,360
Then if we go out now,

375
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,120
we'll be surrounded.

376
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,530
Let's change into uniforms
and leave separately.

377
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,330
Split them up.

378
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,010
Inspector Guan is coming out!

379
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,550
[Shanghai Police Station]

380
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,110
-Inspector Guan!
-Inspector Guan!

381
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,370
Why did you say that at Taihua?

382
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,070
Inspector Guan,

383
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,510
what are your thoughts
on the Police Station's investigation?

384
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,090
Why aren't you saying anything?

385
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,090
What's your opinion on this matter?

386
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,510
-Inspector Guan!
-Inspector Guan!

387
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,370
Say something!

388
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,390
Inspector Guan!

389
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,450
-This isn't...
-No?

390
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,050
After him!

391
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,120
She seems to be over there.

392
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,580
Over there. Right ahead.

393
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,060
What about there?

394
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,260
-She's here!
-She's here!

395
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,660
She's here!

396
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,270
She's here! She's here!

397
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,920
Hello.

398
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,830
What's your view

399
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,200
on the current rumors
about the Police Station?

400
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,060
Please tell us.

401
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,720
Share your thoughts, okay?

402
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,550
Say something.

403
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,110
About the Police Station.

404
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,990
-Say something.
-Say something.

405
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,550
I'm a reporter
from The Republican Daily News.

406
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,680
You've got the wrong person.

407
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,810
She's my assistant.

408
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,240
What assistant?

409
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,960
Isn't she wearing a police uniform?

410
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,550
That's right.

411
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,030
Yes, isn't she from the police station?

412
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,460
I wanted her
to infiltrate the police station.

413
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,160
But now she hasn't even managed to get in,

414
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,550
and you've already surrounded her here.

415
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,310
Aren't you just wasting our time?

416
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,310
Let's go.

417
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,040
Let's go.

418
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,640
Thank you.

419
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,170
You're welcome.

420
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,970
It's been a long time since we met.

421
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,500
Let's have a meal together.

422
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,010
I think
I still have some work to do today.

423
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,270
It won't take too much of your time.

424
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,800
Your inspector won't mind.

425
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,310
Why did you come to me?

426
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,810
I simply want to treat you to a meal.

427
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,640
We've known each other for so many years,

428
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
yet this is our first meal together.

429
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,480
I was immature before.

430
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,040
I did many bad things.

431
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,300
I hope you won't take them to heart.

432
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,080
Let's not mention the past.

433
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,610
Have you been very busy lately?

434
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,680
Not really.

435
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,620
I understand.

436
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,750
It's the same for us reporters.

437
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,880
Running after news stories every day.

438
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
At the beginning,

439
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,440
I couldn't adapt at all.

440
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,070
I couldn't even get enough sleep,

441
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,680
let alone personal time.

442
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,890
We go wherever the news is.

443
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,720
Sometimes, for one story,

444
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,360
we have to stake out for a whole day.

445
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,250
Looking at it that way,

446
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,050
our jobs are quite similar.

447
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,030
No matter how tired we get,

448
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,150
we still can't compare
to you police officers.

449
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,630
Taihua Restaurant...

450
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,050
Was Inspector Guan there that day

451
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,540
investigating the recent 2 scalping cases?

452
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,680
If the suspect isn't the salesman,

453
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,060
who could it be?

454
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,540
Sorry.

455
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,480
I shouldn't be asking you about this.

456
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,740
Thank you

457
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,270
for getting me out of that situation.

458
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,030
My pleasure.

459
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,660
I've been looking for you.

460
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,640
Hello, Inspector Guan.

461
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,000
Have you finished eating?

462
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,530
Let's go.

463
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,310
I'm leaving then.

464
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,390
I'll see you out.

465
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,720
Sorry

466
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,850
for delaying your investigation.

467
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,530
We're leaving then.

468
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Good luck with your investigation.

469
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,400
Regarding this Salesman Wang,

470
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,480
I've asked his family

471
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,340
and neighbors.

472
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,680
It matches what he said.

473
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,010
We can basically rule him out
as a suspect.

474
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,510
But he disturbed public order

475
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,750
and slandered us from the police station.

476
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,150
Lock him up for a few days.

477
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay.

478
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,940
Any news on Mr. Dong?

479
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,200
Those rickshaw pullers

480
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,440
we met at Taihua before

481
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,730
aren't close to Mr. Dong.

482
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,590
They've only seen him a few times.

483
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,400
But he gave me a few addresses.

484
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
He said they are places
Mr. Dong frequently stays.

485
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,860
I plan to go check them out.

486
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:42,920
Okay.

487
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,760
I'll leave Mr. Dong to you then.

488
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,750
The information

489
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,820
Taihua Restaurant gave us
is still too little.

490
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,750
We don't know their shift schedules

491
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,550
or who they interact with daily.

492
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,240
We still have to go there again.

493
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,720
Dong.

494
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,160
Meeting adjourned.

495
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,170
Who are you thinking about?

496
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,350
Thinking about me?

497
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,270
Let me ask you.

498
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,180
What kind of people
love coming to Taihua Restaurant most?

499
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,540
Foreigners love coming most, right?

500
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,160
What do foreigners love most?

501
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,440
They love cleanliness the most,

502
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,550
right?

503
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Then look at that thick dust!

504
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,030
Hurry up and wipe it off!

505
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,770
Clean the tea caddies too!

506
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,380
The tea caddy on the right!

507
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,610
Not there.

508
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,790
Move a bit more to the side!

509
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,340
I can even see the dust!

510
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,070
Mr. Li.

511
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,090
Inspector Guan.

512
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,880
It's not that we at Taihua
don't welcome you.

513
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,050
It's just that you've already investigated
what needed to be investigated.

514
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,730
And you've caused a scene.

515
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,830
I can't stop doing business just because

516
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,690
the deceased worked here, right?

517
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,480
Mr. Li,

518
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,650
we are investigating the case

519
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,000
so that you can do better business here.

520
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,140
If the case isn't solved,

521
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,440
Taihua Restaurant

522
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,970
will remain
under the shadow of a murder case.

523
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,890
That would be worse for business, right?

524
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,320
But investigation is your duty.

525
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,520
What can we do?

526
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,700
We can't just close down
for your investigation.

527
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,850
Taihua Restaurant can't hold on

528
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,940
till the day you arrest the murderer.

529
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,030
Mr. Li,

530
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,320
I

531
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,200
just want you to provide

532
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,660
some useful information.

533
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,980
If the case is solved,

534
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,750
we'll all be happy.

535
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,520
If it's not solved,

536
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,340
none of us can have it easy.

537
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:47,960
Mr. Li,

538
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,340
show us your shift schedules.

539
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,640
Do you think my arms are that long?

540
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,830
Then hurry up and hand it over!

541
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,250
It's all here.

542
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,000
Thank you.

543
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,500
This is the date.

544
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,330
Inspector Guan,

545
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,790
you can take this back
to the Police Station

546
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,310
and look at it thoroughly.

547
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,030
Yes.

548
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Thank you, Mr. Li.

549
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,240
No big deal.

550
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,440
Mr. Li.

551
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,720
Tell everyone

552
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,640
our Taihua Restaurant

553
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,030
doesn't welcome anyone
from the Police Station.

554
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,590
Yes.

555
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,830
Miss, need a ride?

556
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,440
Not for now.
I'd like to ask you something.

557
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,580
Do you know Mr. Dong?

558
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,200
Dong?

559
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,900
I haven't seen him for a few days.

560
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Do you need him for something, Miss?

561
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,210
I'm from the Police Station.

562
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,650
I want to ask him about something.

563
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,170
What... What did he do?

564
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,410
No. Just a routine investigation.

565
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,240
If you have any information about him,

566
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,480
you can also report it
to the police station.

567
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:37,920
Okay.

568
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,240
Thank you.

569
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,170
You're welcome.

570
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,350
They're after Dong?

571
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,000
Have you found him?

572
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,590
Not yet.

573
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,510
And the other rickshaw pullers

574
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,240
haven't seen him for a few days.

575

Director Huo.

576
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,850
Inspector Guan,

577
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,310
you're finally back.

578
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,590
Director Huo has been waiting here

579
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,790
for over an hour.

580
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,770
See for yourselves.

581
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,280
As detailed as if they saw it
with their own eyes.

[A Heinous Murder Case: The Killer

583

Such detailed case information

584
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,510
must have been leaked
from within our own ranks!

585
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,310
Is this how you handle your work?

586
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,850
Inspector Guan,

587
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,960
how could you be so careless?

588
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,440
You're off this case.

589
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,000
Orders from above:

590
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,800
investigate yourselves first!

591
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,570
But we're only
halfway through the investigation.

592
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,020
Dong.

593
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,350
So you know
you're halfway through it, huh?

594
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,950
Since Inspector Zhu is here,

595
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,930
hand over all the case files to him.

596
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,930
Do it now!

597
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,720
How could you make such a big mistake?

598
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,760
Inspector Guan,

599
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,160
I'm really sorry.

600
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,960
It's what the higher-ups wanted.

601
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,640
I really couldn't refuse.

602
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,160
Guofeng.

603
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,820
Inspector.

604
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,240
Work on the handover with Inspector Guan.

605
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,640
Yes.

606
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,270
Why should we hand over a case
we're halfway through

607
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,170
to someone else?

608
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,310
We're the ones on the front lines usually.

609
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,240
And we're still the ones blamed
when things go wrong.

610
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,410
Inspector Guan.

611
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,160
Well, this...

612
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,550
Dong.

613
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,750
These are all the files we have here.

614
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,310
Thank you, Inspector Guan.

615
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,920
Wait.

616
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,320
You want to leave with the files
without signing?

617
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,910
Don't bring your bad habits
from the Laozha Patrol Room

618
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,560
to the Police Station.

619
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,200
Sign it.

620
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,440
Okay.

621
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,400
Is this okay?

622
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,510
I'm leaving then.
