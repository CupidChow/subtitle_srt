[Episode 3]

3
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,150
I'm here to deliver something to you.

4
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,960
What is it?

5
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,420
Something from Xiang Man.

6
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,690
Where is it?

7
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,320
On the ground.

8
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,470
In the bag.

9
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,240
It's some drawings she painted for you.

10
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,810
She wanted to go back to Suzhou with you.

11
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,120
After she graduated,

12
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,010
she'd become a teacher.

13
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,860
You would open a dye workshop.

14
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,610
You'd have 2 children.

15
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,280
You'd also...

16
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Stop talking!

17
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,930
Please stop.

18
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,180
Don't move!

19
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:11,970
-Let go of me!
-Are you okay?

20
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,770
-Behave yourself!
-Let go of me!

Zhang Zhiqiang.

22
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,400
That watch

23
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,590
is something Xiang Man saved
for your dye workshop.

24
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,920
She'd always worked hard for your future.

25
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,190
Life was so unfair to her.

26
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,980
It took almost everything from her.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,200
Yet she never gave up.

28
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,120
At her most desperate moment,

29
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,030
she met you.

30
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,440
She saw you as her lifeline.

31
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,410
Because she loved you,

32
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,310
she didn't want you

33
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,310
to see her all scarred and broken.

34
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,900
But what about you?

35
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,630
What did you do for her?

36
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,970
What did you do for your future?

37
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,700
You didn't have to love her.

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,840
But why did you kill her?

39
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,420
I love her!

40
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,680
That's why
I couldn't bear her being like that.

41
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,680
I thought

42
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,700
she was just a simple,
kind college student.

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,690
But I never expected

44
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,910
it was all fake.

45
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,900
If I hadn't gone to deliver goods
to Joy Pavilion that day,

46
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,270
I wouldn't have known this side of her.

47
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,620
She was cheap.

48
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,370
She was licentious!

49
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,800
She deceived me!

50
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,480
I couldn't accept her like that.

51
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,450
But I love her.

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,560
You don't love her!

53
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,120
You don't deserve to love her!

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,720
Do you even know what love is?

55
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,360

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,090

57

Move!

58
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,020
I'm sorry.

59

Who did this?

Why did you scream?

Is it better now?

71
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,420
Try moving it a bit.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,330
It still hurts a little,

73
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
but it's much better.

74
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,600
Relax.

You're fine now.

Take her to get the medicine.

Thank you, doctor.

but I haven't.

Don't mind it.

Why didn't you tell me?

91

I know you have amnesia.

I was worried it'd be too much for you.

94

You're much more capable than I imagined.

95
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,820
Your mental fortitude

96
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,120
and investigative reasoning skills
are very impressive.

that frail little girl from back then

99

to become who you are now.

100
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,000
Maybe it's because of interest.

101

how could I
not investigate your background?

Then from your professional perspective,
tell me,

107

But there is one thing
I'm really curious about.

112
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Why is it that at all the crime scenes

113
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,250
in your novels,

114
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,270
there are no descriptions of blood?

115
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,850
Who says a crime scene must have blood?

116
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,480
No one.

117
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,840
It's just common sense.

00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,390
This is not your business.

376
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,820
Don't interfere recklessly.

377
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,640
You have nothing to do with me either,

378
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,920
so please stay out of my business.
