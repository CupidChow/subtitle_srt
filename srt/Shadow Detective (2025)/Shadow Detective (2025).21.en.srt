[Episode 21]

3
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,590
You mean

4
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,470
someone was outside the dock

5
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,000
monitoring our operation?

6
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
That's right.

7
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,360
At that time, our people

8
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,450
were either chasing
Sasaki’s men inside the port

9
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,510
or searching for Sasaki’s whereabouts

10
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,570
together with you.

11
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,890
There was nobody outside the dock.

12
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,750
And our guys said

13
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,290
that car left in a hurry.

14
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,230
Our men couldn't catch up at all.

15
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,450
Could it be the Butcher?

16
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,840
It must be him.

17
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,000
You heard the conversation
between Sasaki and him.

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They must be fighting among themselves.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,680
The Butcher

20
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,590
pretended to make peace

21
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,400
but schemed behind our backs.

22
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,000
We

23
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,100
were just being used as his pawns.

24
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,680
Who exactly is this Butcher?

25
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,630
He's so devious and cunning.

26
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,030
I've had a suspect in mind all along.

27
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,000
Who?

28
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,280
Gu Sinian.

29
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,520
When we first entered Shop No. 7,

30
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,750
I heard the Butcher's voice

31
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,840
and it sounded familiar,

32
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,910
but I couldn't place
who it was at the time.

33
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,000
After thinking carefully,

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,190
that voice sounds
very similar to Gu Sinian's.

35
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,240
But many people have similar voices.

36
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,900
This doesn't prove anything.

37
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,079
There's something else that puzzles me.

38
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,910
Huang Kaiyuan was
at the Hongkou Police Room.

39
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,630
Only a few of us knew about this,

40
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,690
so how did Tang Jiahao find him there?

41
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,400
Then I realized,

42
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,230
there was someone else present.

43
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,020
Gu Sinian.

44
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,120
But he was injured too,

45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,850
and he's still in the hospital.

46
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,180
Could it be a self-inflicted injury?

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,840
Unfortunately,

48
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,800
none of this counts as

49
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,130
substantial evidence.

50
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,360
If we confront him without proof,

51
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,620
it would be too abrupt.

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,540
We don't need to alert him.

53
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,710
Let's just pretend we're visiting him.

54
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,150
It's quite a distance
from the dock to the hospital.

55
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,630
If he really is the Butcher,

56
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,750
he probably isn't in the hospital now.

57
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,000
Then let's go see

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
if this recovering Dr. Gu

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,730
is actually lying in his hospital bed.

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,980
Alright, let's go.

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,000
Sasaki's autopsy report is ready.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,750
Just leave it here.

63
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,390
We don't have time to read it.

64
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,970
We need to go to the hospital.

65
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,920
I'll ask you
if I have any questions later.

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,070
Can I join you?

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,409
I'd like to visit that girl
in the hospital too.

68
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,409
Sure, let's go.

Dr. Gu.

73
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,430
Well, this is unexpected.

74
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,230
You actually came to see me
so early in the morning.

75
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,430
We came to see

76
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,760
how you're recovering.

77
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,150
I'm recovering well.

78
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,480
Just can't fight getting old.

My physical recovery

80
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,370
isn't what it used to be.

81
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,590
You were injured because of us.

82
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,620
We were really worried,

83
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,020
so we came to check on you.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,160
It's my duty.

85
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,460

95

By the way, Lu.

98

Have you stopped taking the medicine
I gave you last time?

99
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,530
Yes, I have.

100
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,720
Have you told Inspector Guan

101
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,480
that someone might have
switched your medication?

Yes, she has.

103

After she told me,

105
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,930
I was very concerned.

106
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,680
I specifically called
the nurse to ask about it.

107

108

109

Dr. Gu, are you okay?

120

Where does it hurt?

121
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,880
Don't move me. It's fine.

At this hour,

126
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,480
you really shouldn't
be disturbing his rest.

127
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,190
If his condition worsens,

128
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,870
will you take responsibility?

129
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,930
We're truly sorry.

132
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,300

Well,

about the medication
being switched before?

149
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,260
I forgot.

150
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,340
You forgot?

something so important?

Alright, why so serious?

00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,560
I'll tell you everything
from now on, okay?

No matter how big or small,

Today we're checking on her condition.

168
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,630
But her emotional state
is still very unstable.

169
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,600
Don't upset her.

170
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,960

171
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,650
How old are you?

172
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,400
I don't know.

173
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,390
I don't know. I don't know.

174
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,550
Okay. Okay.

175

you were when you were taken.

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,240

179
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,020
we have the same experience.

180
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,550

when you were taken there?

185
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,550
So long ago.

186
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,020
So painful.

187
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,550
How much do you remember

188
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,080
about what happened there?

189
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,840

I was actually thinking about

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,780
how they select their human cargo

219
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,840

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,600
some leads.

222
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,840
There must be human cargo like her.

where their hideout is,

227
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,440
we don't even know

228
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,630
if the voices that girl heard

229
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,160
were from other survivors.

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,900

covered in scars,

232
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,330
and emotionally devastated.

233
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,150
They treated her like cargo.

234
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,380
How could they treat her well?

235
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,630
She's just a cash cow
for the Skylark Company.

When the tree loses its value,

237
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,290
they cut it down and plant another.

I can't even imagine

239
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,680
what they've been through.

240
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,670

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,200
Why would my Master look for me?

I'm here helping you

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,550
No, no, that's not it.

257
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,790
I'm just asking.

258
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,660
I don't know much about you.

259
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,530
You want to know me?

260
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,550
What do you want to know about me?

261
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,160
Let's eat.

262
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,840
Let's start by discussing
food preferences.

263
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,660
If she's still alive,

264
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,430
I don't know what kind
of treatment she's endured.

265
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,100
When I was rescuing
that person that day, I wondered

266
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,760
if that girl could be Jingning.

267
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,820
I really hope she's still alive.

268
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,400
Finding her

269
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,450
has been my obsession for all these years.

270
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
I really miss her.

271
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,850
But I'm also afraid of her being alive.

272
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,480
If she is still alive,

273
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,750
how much suffering has she endured

274
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,950
to survive until now?

275
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,480
What's wrong,

276
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,870
my great detective?

277
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,450
You're upset again?

278
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,390
Why the long face?

279
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,280
Do you have time these days?

280
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,970
Let's go out together.

281
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,150
I'm off tomorrow.

282
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,910
Let's go clear our minds.

283
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,960
Sure.

284
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:08,990

285
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,230
Linfeng, you're here.

286
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,600
I brought breakfast for you.

287
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,270
Thank you.

288
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,490
Come in.

289
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,140
Where is Lu Yizhen?

290
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,390
You're too late.

291
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,700
Guan Cen took her away early this morning.

292
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
I told you
that you're worrying for nothing.

293
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,380
They'll work things out themselves.

294
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,480
So this is where you
wanted to come to relax?

295
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,270
Yes.

296
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,839
This is my master's shop.

297
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,750
He's off today.

298
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,160
I borrowed it specially for today.

299
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
You even have a kite-making master?

300
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,940
I've been making kites for many years.

301
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,130
Why can't I get this right?

302
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,090
Hold the middle
and then tie the string around it.

303
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,010
I know exactly what you're thinking now.

304
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,580
What am I thinking?

305
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,960
You're thinking

306
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,680
"Why is Lu Yizhen so stupid?

307
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,060
She can't even do something this simple.

308
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,890
Why did we even hire her
to work at the patrol room?"

309
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,560
Are you a mind reader or what?

310
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,960
Is that what you really think?

311
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,090
You're thinking about strange things

312
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,110
and not focusing.

313
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,850
How can you tie it properly?

314
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,220
I'm not thinking about anything strange.

315
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,830
I'm just not good at this.

316
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,600

Dr. Ding?

Why are you so free today?

337
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,920
I was supposed to meet
Si Min and Lu Yizhen

338
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,640
to take them out for some fresh air.

339
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
But I was stood up.

340
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,410
What about you?

341
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,750
All dressed up. You must have plans.

342
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,110
Yes.

343
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
There's a youth social tonight.

344
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,240
They've invited me
to attend the dinner party.

345
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,130
Well, nothing much to do during the day,

346
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,730
so I came out to clear my head.

347
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,060
That's nice.

348
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,270
It's just a pity

349
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,910
I still need a dance partner.

350
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,750
Well,

351
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,380
maybe you shouldn't go
if you don't have a partner.

352
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,770
You don't want me to go?

353
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,110
No,

354
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,200
I... I mean it's a dance ball, right?

355
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,310
If you don't have a partner,

356
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,880
h-how can you go?

357
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,410
I think you'd be perfect.

358
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,640
Why don't you be my dance partner?

359
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,550
You look so troubled.

360
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,780
Forget it.

361
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
I'll go by myself.

362
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,110
All right.

363
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,840
It would be my honor

364
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,970
to be Dr. Ding's dance partner.

365
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,030
Great.

366
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,140
How long has this case
been under investigation?

367
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,800
Why hasn't it been solved yet?

368
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,440
We've been investigating continuously.

369
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,580
Everyone in the department

370
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,270
has been working on it for months.

371
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,960
We've had no leads

372
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,240
and no progress so far.

373
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,680
If you don't solve this case soon,

374
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680

It's up to you now.

376
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,570
Inspector Guan, you're here too.

377
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,580
Inspector Zhu.

378
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,410
How's the case you're working on?

379
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,810
No need for your concern, Inspector Zhu.

380
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,110
I'm about to report to Director Huo.

381
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,010
You don't need my concern now.

382
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,550
But perhaps later

383
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,850
you'll need it.

384
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,330
Just get used to it.

385
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,140
Since you don't want to share,

386
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,700
I won't ask further.

387
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,810
Inspector Zhu.

388
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,870
Why are you so slow?

389
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,790
Take it over quickly.

390
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,240
Yes.

391
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,070
What does he mean by saying
we'll need his concern later?

392
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,920
I don't know.

393
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,450
Take it away.

394
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,680
I don't need Inspector Zhu's kindness.

395
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,650
Take it away now.

396
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,830
Come in.

397
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,480
Director Huo.

398
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,960
Here's the Sasaki case file

399
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,890
for your review.

400
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,130
Just leave it there.

401
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,240
Is something wrong?

402
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,070
The Zhuo Chaoxiong case

403
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,030
is going nowhere.

404
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,110
And now

405
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,380
the Sasaki case is piling on top.

406
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,840
The British have given me an ultimatum.

407
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,730
If we don't catch the killer,

408
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,480
I'm out.

409
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,050
They want you to leave?

410
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,240
Then who will take your position
as Director of the Police Department?

411
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,270
Zhu Yunsong.

412
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,160
Inspector Zhu.

413
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,170
He's already sent flowers.

414
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,850
Good thing they weren't white flowers,

415
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,630
or I'd be furious.

416
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,580
No wonder.

417
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,720
Director Huo,

418
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,200
please rest assured.

419
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,510
We will do everything
in our power to catch the killer

420
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,410
and take down
the Skylark Company behind it

421
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,500
once and for all.

422
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,350
Yes,

423
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,550
we won't miss any clues.

424
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,920
I believe in your determination,

425
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,330
but this opponent

426
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,570
is no ordinary one.

427
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,480
I've held

428
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,080
this position for decades.

429
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,360
If I really have to leave,

430
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,070
I'll miss it.

[Shanghai Institute of Forensic Medicine]

432
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,720
Done with the examination?
You look so happy.

433
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,440
Master,

434
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,480
you scared me.

435
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,110
If you have nothing to hide,
why be scared?

436
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,030
Are you afraid I'll tell your father

437
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,030
about your date?

438
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,270
Is it that obvious?

439
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,350
It's almost written on your face.

please stop teasing me.

Why are you here so early?

443
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,880
It's for the task you assigned me.

444
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,850
Thank you, Master.

445
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,480
Master,

446
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,200
can this be repaired?

447
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,000
Almost done.

448
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,840
Just a few more hours.

449
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
This is Skylark Company's
human trafficking business.

450
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
The person we rescued last time

451
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,840
was their surviving victim.

452
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,330
The human trafficking business
belongs to the Butcher.

453
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,660
And the Butcher works for Zhuo Chaoxiong.

454
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,440
Zhuo Chaoxiong is in charge of contraband

455
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,000
and human trafficking
at Tianque Trading Company.

456
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,060
He's an important figure in the gang.

457
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,590
Zhuo Feng must be connected to them too.

458
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,990
We've been suspecting Gu Sinian all along.

459
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,460
Should we still
investigate in this direction?

460
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,860
Insufficient evidence. Let's start over.

461
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,900
The badge Yang Xiaolin gave us

462
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
was probably from Zhuo Feng, right?

463
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,110
When Yang Xiaolin gave you
the badge last time,

464
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,840
she said we have a common enemy.

465
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,960
She must be connected
to the kidnapping case from back then.

466
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
She's also looking for the Butcher?

467
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,390
Now Huang Kaiyuan,

468
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,570
Sasaki and Zhuo Chaoxiong are all dead.

469
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,110
The killer might be the same person.

470
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,840
Tang Jiahao.

471
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,790
He can't be the Butcher, can he?

472
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,240
No.

473
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,500
The Butcher wouldn't do it himself.

474
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,440
Then he must be working for the Butcher.

475
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,630
They pretended to cooperate with Sasaki,

476
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,490
but were secretly setting him up.

477
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,750
But they're all
from the Skylark Company.

478
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,750
What's their purpose in doing this?

479
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,240
According to our previous theory,

480
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,510
Tang Jiahao

481
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,550
murdered Zhuo Chaoxiong,

482
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,840
then worried Huang Kaiyuan
would leak information,

483
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,120
so he silenced him.

484
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,000
And now he's killed

485
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,270
the Captain who was on equal footing
with the Butcher.

486
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,280
-He wants to get promoted.
-He wants to get promoted.

487
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,610
Isn't Zhuo Feng in danger then?

488
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,960
I found it here.

489
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,910
Recurring colds and asthma.

490
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,410
This could actually be
our breakthrough to find him.

491
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,450
Dong, keep looking for clues.

492
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,310

this kind of medicine here?

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,310

00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,520

It's Yang Xiaolin.

505
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,000
When we were visiting that girl,

506
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,700
she was getting medicine for Zhuo Feng.

507
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,540
You saw her?

00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,960
I couldn't see her face
clearly at that time

509
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,160
because she was too heavily wrapped up.

510
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,440
But I'm certain

511
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,970

this medicine recently?

00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,440
Let us know when she comes.

561
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,570
I promise we won't arrest her here.

562
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,770
Alright.

563
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,220
Please have a seat.

564
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,600
[Zhengxing Teahouse]

565
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,070
The medicine I ordered last time.

566
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,450
Why are you back so late?

567
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,720
Did you get the medicine?

568
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,240
Run!

569
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,320
Did the Butcher send you?

570
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,820
Go to hell and ask your dad.

571
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,590
Don't kill me!

572
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,590
Don't move!

573
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,200
Stop!

574
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,130
Help!

575
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:35,750
Let him go.

576
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,470
Release him
and you'll still have a way out.

577
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,590
Let's go back and see.
