1
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,280
The higher-ups asked me to handle

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,940
some more important matters.

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,710
So I'll hand over

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,810
my current tasks to you.

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,580
You two shake hands first.

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,070
He's called Captain.

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,280
Butcher.

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:33,980
Remember,

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,920
from today on, you two will be

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,070
on an equal footing.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,470
You two are part of the Chamber

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,640
and also my people.

13
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,020
[Shadow Detective]

14
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,020
[Episode 15]

15
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,190
I bought it back.

16
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,280
Lu Yizhen, you've disappointed me so much.

17
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,470
You didn't keep your word.

18
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,670
I won't see you again.

19
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,240
Hello?

20
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,550
Hello?

21
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,079
No.

22
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,360
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

23
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,910
This is a good opportunity

24
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,120
for us to get the latest lead.

25
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,920
And it's currently
the only chance we have.

26
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,810
I remember her face.

27
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,080
She was the woman

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,800
who danced with Zhuo Feng
at the alumni gathering.

29
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,520
I didn't arrest her at the time

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,800
because I wanted to see

31
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,100
what she was really up to.

32
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,100
No.

33
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,190
What do you think?

34
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,210
We can give it a try.

35
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:29,910
Lu Yizhen.

36
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,310
Lu Yizhen.

37
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,000
-I'm sorry.
-Stop nagging.

38
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,560
Lu Yizhen.

39
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,960
I can't possibly let you go alone.

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,090
Besides, we don't even know who she is.

41
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,410
This woman is no ordinary person.

42
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,020
She even
knows counter-surveillance techniques.

43
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,680
Before meeting you,

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,030
she first checked
if you were being followed.

45
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,030
When she spotted a car following you,

46
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,230
she immediately canceled the meeting.

47
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,780
I acted on my own initiative.

48
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,870
The thought occurred to me suddenly,

49
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,130
so I didn't notify you.

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,400
We just had a glimmer of hope,
and it vanished again.

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Not necessarily.

52
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,520
This woman's tried to see you a few times.

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,150
She must have something important
she needs your help with.

54
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,960
Have your people look for her

55
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,080
and see if they can find her whereabouts.

56
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,140
Alright, I'll arrange it right away.

57
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,600
Don't worry.

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,630
I promise you

59
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,560
I will definitely find this woman.

60
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,500
Then you must promise me

61
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,070
you won't hide any details

62
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,430
about this case from me.

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,040
Okay.

64
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,020
Mr. Zhuo, here's what happened.

65
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,630
That day,

66
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,560
by the time I got into the prison,

67
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,390
I found our men

68
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,040
and Ghost
had already been killed by Tang Jiahao.

69
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
I was too late.

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,540
I... I couldn't do anything about it.

71
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,020
Why didn't you
tell me about this at the time?

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,600
Well, Tang Jiahao threatened me.

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
He threatened you?

74
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,830
He threatened you,
and you got scared of him?

75
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,530
No, it's not that I got scared of him.

76
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,130
It was because of their boss.

77
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,480
This matter
is getting more and more interesting.

78
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,800
I always thought there was something fishy

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,530
about that fire case back then.

80
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,950
Only Ghost escaped.

81
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,250
It's been so long,

82
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,480
but there are still some things

83
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,840
I can't figure out even now.

84
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,680
He must have some secrets.

85
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,390
Otherwise, he wouldn't have sent

86
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,480
Tang Jiahao into the prison

87
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,800
to kill Ghost so brazenly.

88
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,080
You must thoroughly investigate him.

89
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,380
Since you understand things so clearly,

90
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,350
you sit in this chair.

91
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,260
Mr. Zhuo, well...

92
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,840
I've said all I need to say.

93
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,830
If there's nothing else,

94
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,080
I'll take my leave first.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,720
Mr. Zhuo!

96
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
I've told you everything, Mr. Zhuo!

97
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,870
You made me lose face
in front of the Chamber.

98
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,000
Shouldn't you

99
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,750
help me vent my anger?

100
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,120
No, Mr. Zhuo!

101
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,360
Mr. Zhuo!

102
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,050
Mr. Zhuo, listen to me!

103
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,710
You can't go back on your word!

104
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,140
Mr. Zhuo!

105
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,920
Mr. Zhuo.

106
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Should we report this to the Chamber?

107
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
Report to the Chamber?

108
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,480
Do you want the Chamber to know

109
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,610
that I can't even handle my own people?

110
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,000
Do you know how many people in Shanghai

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,510
are eyeing my business?

112
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,270
Understood.

113
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,480
Tell everyone to load their guns.

114
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,480
If you see Tang Jiahao,

115
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920
shoot to kill!

116
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,680
Yes.

117
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,470
Wait, what's going on?

118
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,950
Whoever came in must be really tough.

119
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,470
I'm telling you.

120
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,580
This man is Tang Jiahao.

121
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,630
He's a mad dog. I know him!

122
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:44,870
I know him better than you do.

123
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,480
Let me go.

124
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,360
I'll help you.

125
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,430
He won't be able to hurt you.

126
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,560
This... This...

127
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,870
You want to kill me?

128
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
I'll stab you to death!

129
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,190
You understand?

130
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,510
Screw you!

131
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,960
Let's go!

132
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,550
Tang Jiahao!

133
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,120
Show yourself!

134
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,870
You coward!

135
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,940
Show yourself!

136
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,690
You and your boss betrayed the Chamber.

137
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,000
Do you think you can escape?

138
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,050
We won't escape.

139
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,650
We'll just kill all of you.

140
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,790
I'm Guan Cen, an inspector
from the Police Station.

141
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,550
You made the call?

142
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,200
Yes.

143
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
You're finally here.

144
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,300
What happened?

145
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,600
Please come in and take a look.

146
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,630
Our clinic seems to have been burglarized.

147
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,150
Hurry.

148
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,720
Come in.

149
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,360
Have you contacted your doctor,
Huang Kaiyuan?

150
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,270
I tried, but I couldn't reach him.

151
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,500
That's why I reported it
and called you here.

152
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,870
When did you lose contact with him?

153
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,120
This morning.

154
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,820
He said he wasn't feeling well

155
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,220
and told me
to cancel all his appointments.

156
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,530
Later, I found the room was burglarized,

157
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,860
and I haven't been able
to reach him since.

158
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,320
If it were theft,

159
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,800
they wouldn't have only searched one room.

160
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,480
You mean he messed it up himself?

161
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,750
Not necessarily.

162
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,480
But if it was him,

163
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,010
he must have left in a hurry.

164
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,360
Is this appointment register

165
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
yours?

166
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,720
Let me see.

167
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes.

168
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,600
But besides the people on the list,

169
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,790
there's also a regular client
who doesn't need an appointment.

170
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,510
He's been coming frequently lately.

171
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,440
What's his name?

172
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,700
Um...

173
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,240
Mr. Zhuo, Zhuo Chaoxiong.

174
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,770
The person who received me last time
wasn't you.

175
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,080
Is there another nurse?

176
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,750
There's another nurse surnamed Yang.

177
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,360
She started working here not long ago.

178
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,420
Why isn't she here?

179
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,670
I don't know.

180
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,440
She just suddenly didn't show up for work
without reason.

181
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
I don't have her contact information.

182
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,180
I don't know her home address either.

183
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
What's her name?

184
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,220
Yang Xiaolin.

185
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,120
Whose bracelet is this?

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,480
It's Ms. Yang's.

187
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,510
Why was it left there?

188
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,520

190
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
at the restaurant that day

191
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,550
was wearing an identical silver bracelet.

192
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,960
The woman who danced with Zhuo Feng?

193
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,480
Yes.

194
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Could she be Huang Kaiyuan's nurse?

195
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,360
So Huang Kaiyuan's nurse,

196
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,270
the woman who danced with Zhuo Feng,

197
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,390
and the woman who gave me the clue

198
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,520
are the same person?

199
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,030
Very likely.

200
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,920
But what clue would she want to give me?

201
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,990
One thing is certain though:

202
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,590
this person has been paying
close attention to you.

Young Master Zhuo,

207
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,510
were you at the crime scene?

208
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,840
Had your father made any enemies recently?

209
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,080
Take him to his room to rest.

210
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,270
Have someone keep an eye on him.

211
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:44,640
Okay.

212

00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:47,910
Yes.

Any findings?

216
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,360
There are signs of a fierce struggle
at the scene.

217
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,220
The killer was extremely brutal.

It's just that...

219

these men
were Zhuo Chaoxiong's personal bodyguards.

220
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,870
Their abilities were above average.

221
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,550
To be able to kill them like this

222
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,150
shows how terrifyingly capable
the killer is.

223
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,000
If the goal was just to kill,

224
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,080
there was no need to be so brutal.

225
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,840

something's off with these 2 walls.

The distance isn't right.

277
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,350
The distance from this door to that wall

278
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,350
is about 5 steps.

279
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,410
I just measured it.

280
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,700
But look at this one.

281
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,480
It's only about 2 steps.

282
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,960
The 3-step gap in the middle
can't be solid.

283
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,290
It can't all be the wall.

284
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,440

295
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,330
actually has such complete facilities?

296
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,880
These aren't the facilities

297
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,080

307
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,210

We know
the Police Station is looking for him.

343
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,400
So we contacted you

as soon as we found him.

345
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,720
It's just that
his current condition isn't good.

346

I'm really worried he might die here.

347

348

It's quite serious.

You know what?

When we found him,

351
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,640
he was already on the brink of death.

352
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,240
And he was barely conscious.

00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,920

00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,000
acting crazy.

361
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,240
Occasionally, he'd say something,

362
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,970
but we couldn't understand it.

363

366
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,100
I didn't kill anyone.

I'm a doctor.

369
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,640

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,400
Administer anesthesia.

374
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,200
It won't hurt.

375
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,930
It won't hurt.

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,990
Zhuo Chaoxiong is already dead.

378
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
I didn't kill anyone.

379
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't know.

380
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,770
I didn't kill him.

381
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,690
Huang Kaiyuan,

382
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,560
this was found at his house.

383
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,350
Did you kill Zhuo Chaoxiong?

384
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,830
I didn't kill anyone!

385
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,790
It wasn't me!

386
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,110
They're crazy!

387
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,750
Huang Kaiyuan, why were there

388
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,480
remains of women and children
behind your house?

389
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,480
They're all crazy.

390
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,590
I'm a doctor.

391
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,400
I treat patients.

392
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Butcher is crazy.

393
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,590
Who is Butcher?

394
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,550
I didn't kill anyone!

395
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,390
This is the Hongkou Patrol Room.

396
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,470
Please wait a moment.

397
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,950
Inspector Guan, there's a call for you!

398
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,680
Thank you.

399
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,750
Hello?

400
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,770
Inspector,

401
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,160
Director Du speculated earlier

402
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,560
there should be
more than one hiding place.

403
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,960
Based on our clues now,

404
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,760
we've identified a few places.

405
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,480
If we're going to arrest them,
we'll have to nab them all at once.

406
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,140
Otherwise, we'll alert them.

407
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,750
But we're short-handed right now,

408
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,510
so we don't dare act rashly.

409
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,920
Wait for me.

410
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,590
I'll bring people over now.

411
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,110
Seems we can't

412
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,170
get any useful information from him.

413
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,110
Judging from his condition,

414
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,150
it isn't just physical injuries.

415
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,530
The greater trauma is psychological.

416
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,830
He's in such a state of extreme fear,

417
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,980
so we can't
get any useful information from him.

418
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,970
Why don't we ask Dr. Gu for help?

419
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,990
He should
understand this condition better.

420
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,460
He might be able to help us.

421
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,200
That was Dong on the phone just now?

422
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:56,640
Yes.

423
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,270
They found a few suspected hiding places,

424
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,640
but they are short-handed
and don't dare act rashly.

425
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
I need to go check it out.

426
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,720
I'll tell Dr. Gu to come here
while I'm at it.

427
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,260
You go ahead.

428
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,260
I'll stay here and keep an eye on him.

429
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,270
I'll be back soon.

430
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,310
Be careful.

431
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,240
This...

432
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,270
Sir.

433
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,360
Sir,

434
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,820
we're closed.

435
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,030
Sir, you...

436
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,110
Sir, what... what are you looking for?

437
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,510
Just... Just tell me
and I'll get it for you.

438
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,030
Sir,

439
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,070
this is for my own use.

440
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,400
Sir,

441
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,590
this...

442
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,350
It's yours.

443
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,510
S-Sir.

444
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,920
Officer Lu.

445
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,610
Have some water.

446
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,960
Thank you.

447
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,540
If you get tired, just let us know.

448
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,560
We can help you
keep an eye on him for a while.

449
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,030
Okay.

450
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:00,010
Do you have wet towels
and medical kits here?

451
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,960
I'll go look for them for you in a moment.

452
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,400
Okay.

453
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,890
If our people arrive,

454
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,490
just bring them in directly.

455
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,350
No problem.

456
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,350
Give me the key to his handcuffs.

457
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,400
Officer Lu, the key...

458
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,030
Don't let his injuries fool you.

459
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,320
He can be quite terrifying
when he loses control.

460
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,920
It's fine.

461
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,920
Officer Lu,

462
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,980
there are more outside.

463
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,440
I can bring them in if you need.

464
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
These are enough.

465
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,510
Be careful then.

466
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,520
If anything happens, just call us.

467
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,430
Thank you.

468
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,350
You're welcome.
