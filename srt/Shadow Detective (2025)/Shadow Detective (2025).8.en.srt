166
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,830
Does that mean

00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,620

any evidence proving

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,550
I'll follow protocol.

If not,

172
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,480
we should continue working as usual.

173
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,790
After all, at the Shanghai Police Station,

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,600

188
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,200
For what?

189
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,670
Thank you for standing up for me.

190
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,960
I was just being responsible
for my officers.

191
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,160
I wasn't helping you.

192
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,430
I've been thinking back.

193
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,910
That day, Wu Xiaoxiao

194
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,630
was indeed trying to probe into
our investigation details.

195
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,090
I didn't reveal anything,

196
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,750
but

197
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,790
it's true that I had dinner with her.

198
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,380
I've caused trouble for everyone.

199
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:13,980
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,000
You don't need to explain anymore.

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,130
Everything must be based on evidence.

202
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,720
You don't need to
worry about this matter anymore.

203
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,550
I'll handle it.

204
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,410
Go back to work.

205
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,250
That Wu Xiaoxiao

206
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,550
really is a leopard
that can't change its spots.

207
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,240
Lu Yizhen,

208
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,090
someone's looking for you
at the reception desk!

209
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,240
Find out who it is for me.

210
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,640
Got it.

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,720
What?

212
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,510
Not happy to see me?

213
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,360
I don't have time
to talk to you right now.

214
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,320
Lu Yizhen.

215
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,670
Don't tell me you're still upset about

216
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,070
that article in The Republican Daily News.

217
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
How did you know?

218
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,480
I know everything that happens
in the International Settlement.

219
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,870
Those two cases we were working on
have been handed over

220
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,330
to the Laozha Patrol Room.

221
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,770
Everyone worked so hard on those cases.

222
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,080
We finally made some progress,

223
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,220
but then everyone got dragged down
because of me.

224
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,620
I feel terrible about it.

225
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,510
What did he say?

226
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,720
Guan Cen?

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,460
He's strictly impartial.

228
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,590
That sounds like him.

229
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,910
But you know,

230
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,550
Inspector Zhu is quite skilled at
taking credit for others' work.

231
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,270
For all these years,

232
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,150
your Shanghai Police Station
has always outranked him.

233
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,870
So once he sees an opening,

234
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,400
of course, he'll push hard.

235
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,980
So now that you know all this,

236
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,840
you need to adapt to these things.

237
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
After all, a job

238
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,000
isn't just about the job itself.

239
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,440
I'm definitely going to find Wu Xiaoxiao

240
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,500
and clear things up.

241
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,270
What's the point of finding her?

242
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,360
Someone like her

243
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,460
won't admit anything,

244
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,860
even if you confront her.

245
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,030
Maybe she wanted you to
take the blame all along.

246
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,750
But why?

247
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,720
Alright, Lu Yizhen.

248
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,760
These things aren't worth your concern.

249
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,070
Fresh out of the oven.

250
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,510
Thank you.

251
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,600
Trust me,

252
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,240
this will all blow over.

253
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,570
I wonder how those two cases are going.

254
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
That's none of your concern anymore.

255
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,960
But we worked so hard on them.

256
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Can't we even show a little concern?

257
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,360
Dong,

258
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,030
deliver this

259
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,290
to the Laozha Patrol Room
with Lu Yizhen.

260
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,360
Stop punching. Take a break.

261
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,510
Don't tell me
you dragged me out here this late

262
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,240
just to watch you hit a sandbag.

263
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,750
Did someone bully you?

264
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,160
No.

265
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,200
No...

266
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,900
Then...

267
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,670
Having trouble at work?

268
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,080
No.

269
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,750
Not that either.

270
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,440
I know what it is.

271
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,950
You failed to submit your novel on time?

272
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,520
I finished it.

273
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,840
Then what is it?

274
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,160
You don't seem like yourself.

275
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,800
You're not secretly seeing some guy
behind my back, are you?

276
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,550
No way! If you're dating someone,

277
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,720
you have to tell me!

278
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,400
I need to vet the guy for you!

279
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,360
Whose son is he?

280
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,080
Is he tall?

281
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,120
Is he handsome?

282
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,520
Is he good enough for you?

283
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,020
Dr. Gu...

284
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,120
Dr. Gu?

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,030
Yizhen, it's you.

286
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,450
How do you have time to come over today?

287
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,550
Yes.

288
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,720
I might have more free time lately.

289
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,250
Then, have a seat. Sit.

290
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,880
Let me get you some water.

291
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,480
Here.

292
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,480
Have some water.

293
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,150
Thank you.

294
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,840
You officers

295
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,240
rarely get any downtime.

296
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,030
Our cases have been

297
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,720
handed over to the Laozha Patrol Room,

298
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,120
so things will be a bit easier
for us lately.

299
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,870
Why?

300
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,600
If it's inconvenient to say, I won't ask.

301
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,300
No.

302
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,790
It's because I'm suspected of
leaking case details.

303
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,480
So...

304
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,380
That happened?

305
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,210
That won't affect your work, will it?

306
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,950
There is some impact.

307
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:58,840
But...

308
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,110
It's okay.

309
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,600
That's good.

310
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,040
I believe you wouldn't do such a thing.

311
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,480
Since there's no major impact,

312
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,960
why do you seem so down?

313
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,190
After taking the sedative medicine,

314
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,590
are you sleeping better?

315
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,870
I can fall asleep now.

316
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,850
That's good.

317
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,270
Dr. Gu.

318
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,080
I still want you to help me
recover my memories.

319
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,690
You should know that...

320
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,600
there might be something in those memories

321
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,150
that you cannot bear.

322
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,320
Or rather,

323
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,930
you might see a completely
unfamiliar version of yourself.

324
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,760
Are you really sure about this?

325
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,840
I'm sure.

326
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,280
I don't want to run away anymore.

327
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,350
All right.

328
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,750
I can face it with you.

329
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,150
Are you all right?

330
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,530
I'm fine. It's nothing.

331
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,750
I'm getting old,
and my eyesight isn't good.

332
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,810
I'll go bandage it.

333
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,770
Have some water first!

334
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,330
Inspector.

335
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,790
Here.

336
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,530
Thank you for your help.

337
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,870
She's really like a child.

338
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,960
All her thoughts are written on her face.

339
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,390
What?

340
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,270
I said

341
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,940
the weather is nice today.

342
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,430
Love might be
in the air for you, Inspector.

343
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,550
I'm off.

344
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,440
Come on, guys!

345
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,750
Let's see what the inspector brought us!

346
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,410
Dong, what goodies did he get?

347
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,490
Marron glacé.

348
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,480
Inspector Guan bought them
especially for us!

349
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:18,829
Here.

350
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,690
Try some.

351
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,829
Come on, dude!

352
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,849
Have some candy.

353
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Come on, Lu Yizhen! Have some candy!

354
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:27,829
What candy?

355
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,990
Marron glacé.

356
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,370
Inspector Guan went all the way
to Yufei Road to buy them.

357
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,060
Running that far early in the morning.

358
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,270
Maybe he didn't even go home
last night, huh?

359
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,160
Right?

360
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,830
Yeah.

361
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,310
Come on, share with the guys.

362
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,200
Alright. Have some.

363
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,770
Come on. Let's share. Share them.

364
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,290
Come on! Try some. It's delicious!

365
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,400
As if I can't afford them myself.

366
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,970
What's there to show off about?

367
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,630
What's gotten into you today?

368
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,400
I'm fine.

369
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,340
I'll answer it.

370
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,280
Shanghai Police Station,
this is Lu Yizhen.

371
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,940
This is she.

372
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,760
What's wrong?

373
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,370
They're going to question me
internally tomorrow.

374
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,160
You're so unlucky.

375
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,960
I'm really unlucky.

376
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,200
But they can't just

377
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,550
accuse you of leaking information

378
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,880
without any evidence.

379
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,600
Lu Yizhen!

380
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,170
Come with me.

381
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,090
Where are we going?

382
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,390
Laozha Patrol Room.

383
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,490
Laozha Patrol Room?

384
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,550
Go, go, go.

385
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,790
Let's go. Come on.

386
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,920
-Let's go!
-Come on.

387
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,070
No matter what difficulties you face
in the coming days,

388
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,480
you must overcome them all.

389
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:01,960
Yes.

390
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,790
Inspector Guan.

391
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,080
What do you mean by this?

392
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,030
Inspector Zhu, I'd like to ask you

393
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,400
to clarify the false accusation
made against Lu Yizhen.

394
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,960
Inspector Guan,

395
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,720
do you know what you're talking about?

396
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,550
The case leak

397
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,890
has nothing to do with
our Shanghai Police Station.

398
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,260
Whichever officer here

399
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,340
slandered my officer

400
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,030
had better come forward and apologize.

401
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,640
However, this has nothing to do with you.

402
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,440
I just hope you will
set an example, Inspector Zhu.

403
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,640
Guan Cen,

404
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,400
have you forgotten your place?

405
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,790
How dare you be so insolent to me?

406
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,240
I just want justice.

407
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,350
Justice?

408
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,030
What evidence do you have

409
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,530
to prove it wasn't Lu Yizhen who did it?

410
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,510
And yet you barge into my station

411
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,720
demanding justice?

412
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,920
What is this about?

413
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,520
Director Huo.

414
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,930
Director Huo.

415
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,430
I already know
who leaked the case details.

416
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
Let me see you out.

417
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,650
[To Reporter Wu]

418
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,530
At first, I was just suspicious.

419
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,640
I only realized

420
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,000
that Wu Xiaoxiao must have known

421
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,830
more people in the police force
than just Lu Yizhen.

422
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,580
She must have had other informants.

423
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,090
But at that time, I didn't suspect
Zhong Guofeng.

424
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,070
Because back then, Zhong Guofeng

425
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,270
wasn't involved in the investigation.

426
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
He shouldn't have known the case details.

427
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,200
Until...

428
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,610
Just think of it as doing me a favor.

429
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,000
You want my help?

430
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,580
When it comes to forensic verification,
you're the one to ask.

431
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,470
Since you're so interested,

432
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,250
why not come see for yourself?

433
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,310
Where?

434
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,240
My colleague is celebrating their birthday
in a few days.

435
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,640
I've been invited to dinner.

436
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,770
You should come too.

437
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,720
Sure.

438
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,960
But it's a gathering
of your Forensic Institute.

439
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,790
Would it be inappropriate for me
to attend?

440
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,590
Of course not.

441
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,270
With our relationship,

442
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,000
who would dare say anything?

443
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,400
Besides the police officers in my station,

444
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
the only others
who know the case details so clearly

445
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,750
are from the Forensic Institute.

446
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,020
So I asked Dr. Ding to help,

447
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,200
met with their people,
and collected evidence personally.

448
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,330
Everyone here today

449
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,890
helped you solve cases.

450
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,330
Have you thought about how to thank them?

451
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,320
Ding Eryi.

452
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,950
What is Zhong Guofeng doing

453
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,960
at your Forensic Institute's gathering?

454
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,640
Him?

455
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,830
He and Hua have been best friends
since childhood.

456
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,430
So, how could he have missed this?

457
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,090
Today is my buddy's birthday.

458
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,550
Let's all raise our glasses

459
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,640
and wish him a happy birthday.

460
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,830
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

461
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,590
Thank you all.

462
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,550
Let's drink till we drop!

463
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:31,950
Great.

464
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,240
I've confirmed with Dr. Ding

465
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,310
that Hua participated in the work
on these rape-murder cases.

466
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,440
That means

467
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,160
Zhong Guofeng had both
a source of information

468
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,720
and motivation to spread it.

469
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,830
Hua also admitted

470
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,000
that he leaked information
to Zhong Guofeng.

471
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,460
He also said Zhong Guofeng

472
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,350
had borrowed related

473
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,900
rape-murder case materials
in the name of the patrol room.

474
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,840
But he knew nothing about
Zhong leaking the information.

475
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,030
The Forensic Institute

476
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,830
has reported Hua's misconduct.

477
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,480
Inspector, it wasn't me. It wasn't.

478
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,440
After all that talk,

479
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,300
do you have any evidence?

480
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,060
Still refusing to admit it.

481
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,170
This is the letter from Zhong Guofeng
to Wu Xiaoxiao.

482
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,570
You should recognize
your subordinate's handwriting, right?

483
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,400
If this still isn't enough,

484
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,480
we can have the staff
from the Oriental Hotel

485
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,140
brought over and questioned.

486
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,100
Inspector,

487
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,240
I did this for you.

488
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,640
Nonsense.

489
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,800
What does this have to do with me?

490
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,000
You've always resented
the Shanghai Police Station,

491
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,460
so I wanted to help you
take them down a notch.

492
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,030
Nonsense.

493
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,000
You know full well

494
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,130
the dirty deeds you've done!

495
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,890
Enough!

496
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,400
I'll contact Dr. Ding

497
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,970
and report this matter together with her.

498
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,540
Zhong Guofeng.

499
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,350
You will be suspended
pending investigation.

500
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,150
Director Huo.

501
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,720
Now that the truth has come to light,

502
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,900
I have three requests

503
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,230
for you to consider.

504
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:18,640
First,

505
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,660
clear Lu Yizhen of all false accusations.

506
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,140
Second,

507
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,880
publicly disclose the truth about the leak
regarding the rape-murder cases.

508
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,440
Third,

509
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,550
return the cases to our police station.

510
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,660
I, Zhu, am a reasonable person.

511
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,290
Today,

512
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,240
on behalf of
the entire Laozha Patrol Room,

513
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,050
I apologize to you all.

514
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,200
Wait.

515
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,430
Lu Yizhen.

516
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,160
I'm sorry.

517
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,350
However...

518
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,240
we've made

519
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,970
a breakthrough on these cases.

520
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,550
Director Huo.

521
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,000
It's not appropriate to transfer them now.

522
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Time is of the essence.

523
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,310
Transferring the cases
would waste time and resources.

524
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,510
Since we all want to solve them quickly,

525
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,920
you will work on them together.

526
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,450
Inspector Zhu will take the lead,

527
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,350
and you, Inspector Guan, will assist.

528
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,280
Any objections?

529
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,710
No objections.

530
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,700
Thank you, Inspector Zhu.

531
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,880
Looking forward to working together.

532
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,400
Alright!

533
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,650
Everyone, get back to work.

534
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,190
Take care, Director Huo!

535
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:09,990
[Laozha Patrol Room]

536
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,480
Thank you.

537
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,340
This meal is on me.

538
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,960
No need to thank me.

539
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,750
I wanted to investigate the cases anyway.

540
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,680
But this meal...

541
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,270
you can pay for it.

542
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,240
I had no idea you asked Dr. Ding

543
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,170
for so much help behind the scenes.

544
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,690
I had no choice.

545
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,220
Right now,

546
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,040
only Dr. Ding can help me.

547
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,320
I've really benefited from your help.

548
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,310
If it weren't for your relationship
with her,

549
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,440
my name wouldn't have been cleared
so quickly.

550
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Keep that in mind.

551
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
I won't forget this great kindness.

552
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,750
Inspector, when you

553
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,240
and Dr. Ding

554
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,480
tie the knot,

555
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,680
I'll definitely give you
the most generous red envelope.

556
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,310
Lu Yizhen, what are you talking about?

557
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,970
Isn't it so?

558
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,740
She even took you

559
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,240
to the Forensic Institute's gathering.

560
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,700
Everyone thinks you two
are a perfect match.

561
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,810
What they think is their business.

562
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,030
Ding Eryi and I

563
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,160
just want to quickly clear up
the false accusation.

564
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,270
But you two can
read each other's thoughts—

565
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,600
that's real chemistry.

566
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,110
What are you looking at?

567
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,110
If you say that...

568
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,130
Dr. Ding's boyfriend will get angry.

569
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,980
She and I have been partners
for so many years.

570
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,240
How could we solve cases
without some chemistry?

571
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,440
Hurry up and eat. We have a meeting soon.

572
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,130
You're certainly fashionably late.

573
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,190
Let me make this clear first:

574
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,870
since I'm leading this case,

575
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,000
everything will be done my way.

576
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,610
Do you two have any problems with that?

577
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,800
No.

578
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,110
No.

579
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,090
The rickshaw puller who frequently visited

580
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,980
both Taihua Restaurants

581
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,100
has disappeared

582
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,720
since the murders occurred.

583
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,580
He is a major suspect in this case.

584
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,070
I've already sent informants out
and tracked him down.

585
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,790
I believe we'll have results soon.

586
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,000
Actually, the rickshaw puller was

587
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,800
already on our list of suspects.

588
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,880
The main issue was
that we lacked substantial evidence.

589
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,080
And according to the hotel duty roster,

590
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,270
someone on the inside

591
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,090
would have easier access to

592
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,500
the victims' movements.

593
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,550
So I think

594
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,280
we can split up
and investigate from both angles.

595
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,820
Inspector Guan.

596
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,270
Do I need to repeat

597
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,550
what I just said?

598
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,830
We will...

599
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,540
follow your lead, Inspector Zhu.

600
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,450
Solving the case is the priority.

601
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,240
Good.

602
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,600
Everyone, get ready.

603
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,570
Once we have a lead,

604
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,990
we move out immediately.

605
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,610
According to the informant,
the suspect's hangout

606
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,540
is still a street away from here.

607
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,960
So what's the point of us waiting here?

608
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,510
We just need to follow
Inspector Zhu's arrangements.

609
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,040
We're not in charge anyway.

610
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,200
Stop munching.

611
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,830
Inspector Guan,
Inspector Zhu wants to see you.

612
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,350
Okay.

613
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,890
I'm going over there for a moment.

614
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,680
Miss!

615
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,660
Who are you?

616
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,920
Don't you remember me?

617
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,750
Last time,

618
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,760
you asked me about Chef Dong.

619
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,160
Didn't you ask me about Chef Dong before?

620
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,920
What a coincidence—

621
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,120
I was just chatting with him.

622
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,740
Come on, I'll take you to him.

623
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,200
But...

624
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,750
It's not far, just over here.

625
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,750
Come on, let's go.

626
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,560
Let's go.

627
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,700
It's just around here.

628
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,780
It's just ahead. Almost there.

629
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,270
It's right ahead.

630
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,480
Where exactly?

631
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,310
Just ahead.

632
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,420
Where is he really?

633
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,250
You're here!

634
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,640
When you came asking about
Chef Dong last time,

635
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,030
I already felt something was off.

636
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,270
And then right after you left,

637
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,810
the newspaper published
an article smearing us.

638
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,140
Who else but you officers would know
the details of the case?

639
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,160
I hope you can calm down.

640
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,610
We're still investigating.

641
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,960
We'll give you an answer.

642
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,220
Still investigating?

643
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,130
Not only have you caused us
to lose business,

644
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,640
but we're being cursed at everywhere
we go!

645
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,400
You owe us an answer today

646
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,400
about what you're going to do about this!

647
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,310
Get her!

648
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,770
-Don't move!
-Don't move!

649
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,710
-Put your hands down!
-Don't move!

650
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,600
What are you doing here?

651
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,890
Playing knight in shining armor.

652
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,240
These men are suspects in my case.

653
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,370
They're involved in a smuggling case.

654
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,510
Chef Dong.

655
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,880
Come on, come on.

656
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,200
You just came back from Japan,

657
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,400
and now you're causing trouble
in Shanghai?

658
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,590
Chef Dong?

659
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,210
You're Chef Dong from Taihua Restaurant?

660
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:00,960
Yes.

661
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,420
Do you know

662
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,480
that you're involved in
a serial murder case?

663
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,920
Where have you been these past few days?

664
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,790
A murder case?

665
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,270
I've been at sea these past few days.

666
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,480
I didn't kill anyone.

667
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
On the 3rd and 5th of this month,

668
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,920
where were you? With whom?
What did you do?

669
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:15,880
The 3rd...

670
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,070
I can't remember.

671
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,640
They're probably not the people
you're looking for.

672
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,350
Our Intelligence Department
has been watching them.

673
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,790
If they had committed any other crimes,

674
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,720
we would know.

675
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,160
Lu Yizhen.

676
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,690
Are you alright?

677
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,250
I'm fine.

678
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,530
What are you doing here?

679
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,830
Sorry to disappoint.

680
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,760
You're too late.

681
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,130
We've already apprehended them.

682
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,210
That one is Chef Dong.

683
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,640
Chef Dong?

684
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,920
But Du Linfeng says

685
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,750
this is
their Intelligence Department's case.

686
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,750
A smuggling case.

687
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,970
These people used rickshaw pullers
as a front

688
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,400
to smuggle silver coins
for Japanese ronin.

689
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Our department has been watching them
for a long time.

690
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,510
We've been monitoring them for months.

691
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,910
If they were involved in anything else,

692
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,170
we would know about it.

693
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,640
What's going on here?

694
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,740
Inspector Zhu.

695
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,090
Since when

696
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,680
did this case fall under
your Intelligence Department?

697
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,540
Inspector Zhu,

698
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,460
this has always been
our department's case.

699
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,110
Didn't he already say so?

700
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,770
This is their smuggling case.

701
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,840
Just because he says so?

702
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,750
Do you have any evidence?

703
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,000
The physical evidence is all here.

704
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,330
And we have all these men as eyewitnesses.

705
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,890
Inspector Zhu,

706
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,660
if you need anything else,

707
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,690
our department is at your service.

708
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,680
Thank you, Inspector Zhu,

709
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,400
for your concern regarding
our Intelligence Department's case

710
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,330
and for clearing obstacles for us!

711
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,540
Inspector Zhu,

712
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,810
your men stationed around here

713
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,070
can withdraw now.

714
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,060
Take them back!

715
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,480
-Move!
-Move!

716
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,960
-Go!
-Move!
