Why don't you ever come to class reunions?

Do we have to wait until the final farewell ceremony

I'm busy.

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,620
Busy fishing, huh?

10
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,240
I went to the center to look for you.

Your new Chief said

12

Thank you for your concern, Captain Zhang.

Stop being so sarcastic here.

16
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,800
Now I understand

17
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
why the Detention Center moved to the city

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,750

Zhang Xiangyang, do you need something from me?

If you have something to say, just say it.

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,510
does anyone still dare to fish here?

The water in this pond has gone foul.

After many years,

188
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,870
Xu Wenguo has returned to Banan again.

189
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,470
What's your opinion on this?

190
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,600
What's your view on the sharp drop in Tanghong Group's stock?

191
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,240
Mr. Tang!

192
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,430
Mr. Tang, please respond!

193
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,240
Mr. Tang!

194
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,690
What's the situation? Tell me.

195
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,740
At 1 a.m. this morning,

196
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,290
this article suddenly appeared online.

197
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,980
Then it went viral across the internet this morning.

198
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,720
I just want to ask,

199
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
what is our company's PR team doing?

200
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,080
When this kind of article is published,

201
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,960
they should immediately contact the platforms

202
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,200
to remove the links and retract the article.

203
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,120
What have they been doing?

204
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,750
We spend so much on PR fees every year to keep them.

205
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,630
What are they good for?

206
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,630
It can't be removed, Mr. Tang.

207
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,140
When we saw this news,

208
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,280
our PR team

209
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,870
immediately reached out to them.

210
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,670
But this time, it's really strange.

211
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,620
We called them,

212
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,640
but they didn't answer.

213
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,910
We went to visit them in person,

214
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,840
but they refused to see us.

215
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,080
In just a few hours,

216
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,870
this article

217
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,000
has become a trending topic on several news websites.

218
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,240
Mr. Tang, someone is pulling strings behind the scenes.

219
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,390
What's the name of that, uh, childhood friend of yours again?

220
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,800
Dong, right?

221
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,440
He's taken so much money from us.

222
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,270
Why aren't they taking it down?

223
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,630
Why are they still smearing us?

224
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,760
I've contacted him.

225
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,260
He confirmed our suspicions.

226
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,640
What suspicions? Tell me.

227
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,750
He said this time,

228
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,200
someone indeed spent a lot of money behind the scenes

229
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,130
to push negative content about us.

230
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,110
Negotiate with the websites one by one.

231
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Okay, got it.

232
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,330
Get lost!

233
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,840
A real-name report has been filed against Tang Weimin and his son Tang Yaoxin.

234
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,240
Tanghong Group's stock plummets,

235
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,550
shrinking by 25%,

236
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,320
with its market value evaporating by 8.4 billion.

237
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,820
This has sparked widespread social attention and discussion.

238
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,050
According to the accusations,

239
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,790
Tang Weimin and his son Tang Yaoxin,

240
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,320
during the restructuring of No. 6 Factory 20 years ago,

241
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,310
through false contracts and abuse of power

242
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,570
as well as other means,

243
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,750
transferred a large amount of state-owned assets

244
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,300
to personal ownership,

245
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,960
severely damaging the interests of the state

246
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,250
and the rights of workers.

247
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,270
There might have also been criminal cases involved during this period.

248
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,780
The police are currently investigating the details of the case.

249
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,580
We will continue to follow and report on this case.

250
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,100
Stop, stop.

251
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,150
You played it wrong again, right?

252
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,480
Another mistake, right?

253
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,620
Play this phrase 10 times first.

254
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,670
I'll keep count for you.

255
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,390
If there are any mistakes,

256
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,190
let's not count this time, okay?

257
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,090
Your left hand plays well.

258
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:33,870
What are you

259
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,840
looking for there?

260
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,990
Don't look for the keys, you hear me?

261
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,230
Give him a break.

262
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,680
Let him rest for a while.

263
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,150
It's not like he'll make a living from this in the future.

264
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,200
You don't have to be like this.

265
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,850
Dad.

266
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,960
Can you please not interfere when I'm parenting?

267
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,000
You parented me, and I have to parent him too.

268
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,600
Fine, you continue. I don't know how to parent, alright?

269
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,000
If I didn't know how to parent, how did you grow up so well?

270
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,400
Please go upstairs and study your TV drama.

271
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,240
Don't listen to grandpa, okay?

272
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,450
Practicing piano is like this.

273
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,000
Quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes.

274
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,349
Right? Very good.

275
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,349
Come on, let me demonstrate for you.

276
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,060
Stand up straight.

277
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,110
Dad.

278
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,750
Look who's back.

279
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,440
It's me.

280
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,040
Finished the English class?

281
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,550
Mom, you're back.

282
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,830
You're back.

283
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,360
Good boy.

284
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,420
Honey, let's get a divorce.

285
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,030
Let's find time in a couple of days to go to the  Civil Affairs Bureau

286
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,690
and complete the procedures.

287
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,250
I'll give you all the company stocks.

288
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,610
I'll go make the changes in a few days.

289
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,480
The cash in the bank will also be left to you and the kids.

290
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,280
Honey,

291
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,030
just leave me some pocket money.

292
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,450
I'll leave this house to you and the kids.

293
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
As for the apartments in Banan City,

294
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,490
I'll leave one to my parents

295
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,010
and one to your brother,

296
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,110
and you can arrange the other small ones as you see fit.

297
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,950
I'll leave this marriage with nothing.

298
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,830
What do you mean?

299
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,470
The passports are ready.

300
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,270
The visas have been approved too.

301
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,270
I've also bought the plane tickets.

302
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,750
As soon as the kids are on vacation,

303
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,510
take them abroad for a trip.

304
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,800
Stay for a year or half a year.

305
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,600
We'll see how things are then

306
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,590
and decide whether you should come back or not.

307
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,990
What do you think, honey?

308
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,650
You've achieved financial freedom.

309
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,890
You should be happy.

310
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,740
Is this because of Xu Wenguo?

311
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,960
We've been married for over a decade,

312
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,000
yet you still don't trust me.

313
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,800
Wrong. I trust you very much.

314
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,050
I only just found out he came back

315
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,360
when I saw it on TV.

316
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,370
Daddy! Daddy!

317
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,500
Hulu isn't playing properly.

318
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,910
He even bit me.

319
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,200
Hulu!

320
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,720
No hitting, okay?

321
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,920
Daddy's coming over.

322
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,270
I'll go keep the kids company.

323
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,930
Think about it some more.

324
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,990
Wait for us in the car.

325
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,310
Aunt.

326
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,710
Why didn't you tell me you were moving here?

327
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,750
Are you settling in alright?

328
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,480
Yes. Quite alright.

329
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,810
Mom, I'll make dumplings for you tonight.

330
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,010
I'll go out for a walk.

331
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,630
Are you here to see my mother?

332
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,200
I came to see you.

333
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,170
How did you find this place?

334
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,970
Yihan gave me the address.

335
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,720
That Tang Yaoxin...

336
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,710
How does he treat you?

337
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,150
He's quite considerate.

338
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,030
He's also good at taking care of people.

339
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
That's good then.

340
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,910
All these years, I never knew where you were

341
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,790
or how you were doing.

342
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,460
But now it seems you're doing quite well.

343
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,770
Yonghong.

344
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,280
I hope you're doing well.

345
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,670
Wenguo.

346
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,500
You don't want me to do well at all.

347
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,970
You want to ruin me.

348
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,280
I know everything you've done since you came back.

349
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,970
You disappeared for 20 years,

350
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,550
when your mother and I stayed here

351
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,950
and endured for 20 years.

352
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,280
We've finally made it to where we are today,

353
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,370
but you came back to destroy everything.

354
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,250
What gives you the right?

355
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,030
What qualifies you?

356
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,790
Mom.

357
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,220
Are you having a fight with Uncle?

358
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,130
Say hello to Uncle.

359
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,200
Come here.

360
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,790
Hello, Uncle.

361
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,130
How old are you?

362
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,070
13.

363
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,220
You've really grown up.

364
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,750
Go wait in the car.

365
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,030
Go find Dad, be good.

366
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,490
Tang Yaoxin is downstairs?

367
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,050
Why doesn't he come up?

368
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,040
Afraid to see me?

369
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,070
Xu Wenguo.

370
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,480
All these years,

371
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,840
I've never asked you for anything.

372
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,640
But today,

373
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,610
I'm begging you.

374
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,460
I'm begging you, don't hurt Tang Yaoxin.

375
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,360
For all these years,

376
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,350
he's the one who's been taking care of me,

377
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,590
my family,

378
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,070
my parents,

379
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,150
my grandparents,

380
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,110
and my brother.

381
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,480
He's also my family.

382
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,750
Spare him.

383
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,820
Can you do that?

384
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,360
Aunt, I'm leaving now.

385
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,200
Wenguo.

386
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,400
Yonghong

387
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,730
is already a mother of two children now.

388
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,960
Bawang Village. Go or not?

389
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,350
No.

390
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,030
I'll give you 10 yuan.

391
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,550
I wouldn't go even for 100.

392
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,240
100?

393
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,110
You wish.

394
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,920
100.

395
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,480
You must have gone crazy from poverty.

396
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,580
Don't worry, it's a gift for you.

397
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,510
Alloyed copper.

398
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,940
From the Ming Dynasty.

399
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,310
This is too valuable.

400
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,310
I can't accept it.

401
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,010
It's a gift for you. Don't worry about it.

402
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,350
Officer Du!

403
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,730
I didn't expect it to be you, Officer Du.

404
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,100
Officer Du.

405
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,110
What exactly do you want to do?

406
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,760
Sanchuang.

407
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,850
Find us a quiet place.

408
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,810
No problem.

409
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,550
My office is very quiet.

410
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,790
Waiter! Brew a pot of tea

411
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,920
and bring two women!

412
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,750
Sanchuang.

413
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,440
I got it wrong.

414
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,350
I mean, brew a pot of tea and bring two fruit plates.

415
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,610
Officer Du, I've completely reformed this time.

416
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,960
I've now opened this private restaurant,

417
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,510
and I'll do business properly.

418
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,790
These two bottles of aged wine

419
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,600
are for you.

420
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,120
You two talk.

421
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,740
You've been on the run for 20 years, right?

422
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,670
18 years.

423
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,580
20 years.

424
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,830
Officer Du.

425
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,110
Thank you.

426
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,310
For testifying for me in court.

427
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,770
I did it because of Binbin.

428
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,480
I still dream

429
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,530
about him a lot.

430
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,840
He still looks the same.

431
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,830
Unlike us.

432
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,530
We've all grown old.

433
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,160
Haven't you been doing well out there?

434
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,440
Why did you come back?

435
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,190
Just to mess with the Tangs?

436
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,200
For what reason?

437
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,650
Liu Guangcai

438
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,880
claims he's responsible for everything.

439
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,340
Do you think he's capable of

440
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,190
doing such a thing?

441
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,640
So you think

442
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,760
it was Tang Weimin and Tang Yaoxin

443
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,090
who ordered Liu Guangcai to do it.

444
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
What do you think was their purpose?

445
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,000
To monopolize No. 6 Factory.

446
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,470
But he didn't expect that

447
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,430
Li Chao got in his way.

448
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,920
That's why he had to kill Li Chao.

449
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,130
Liu Guangcai was just their killer,

450
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
and Binbin and I

451
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,480
were the scapegoats they chose.

452
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,470
Do you have evidence?

453
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,370
Over the past decade,

454
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,660
I've been looking for evidence.

455
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,770
If there's no evidence, stop making trouble.

456
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,930
The father-son duo are running a large business now.

457
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,170
Besides, this isn't your business to handle.

458
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,570
Leave it to the police.

459
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,530
If I don't make trouble,

460
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,950
how can I find evidence?

461
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,510
Officer Du.

462
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,950
You've always been helpful to Binbin and me.

463
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,920
Can you help me one more time?

464
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,070
This time, I'll keep a close eye on you.

465
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,420
Don't do anything stupid.

466
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,560
I went to see Binbin off before he passed away.

467
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,340
He left you a message,

468
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,060
asking you to live well for him.

469
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,550
Back then, your brother had a gun.

470
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,880
He could have killed me,

471
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,710
but he let me go.

472
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,050
I've always believed he was a good kid.

473
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,310
He sacrificed his life so that the two of us could survive.

474
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,480
Let's both live well.

475
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,560
Sir.

476
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,969
Get in the car and talk.

477
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,000
Sir.

478
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,660
I've had people investigate.

479
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,030
Whether it's the recent public opinion attacks against you,

480
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,320
or the legal issues

481
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,000
you've encountered,

482
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,230
there is indeed suspicion that Xu Wenguo and his people

483
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,200
are manipulating things behind the scenes.

484
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,700
Yes.

485
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,030
We've already gathered some information.

486
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,030
However,

487
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,240
you need to understand that

488
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,620
from our perspective,

489
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,190
he did come back under the banner of investing in Banan

490
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,320
and developing Banan.

491
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,840
So as long as he's operating legally and reasonably,

492
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,550
we must protect him.

493
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,800
Tang.

494
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,980
Stay calm,

495
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,960
and wait for him

496
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,070
to make a mistake.

497
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,860
I'll heed your advice, Sir.

498
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,690
Alright, you can go now.

499
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
Please take care.

500
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,670
Hi, could you

501
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,000
please open the trunk?

502
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,260
[Congratulations on the Grand Reopening of Banan No. 6 Machine Factory's Machine Repair Workshop]

503
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,000
This is a vintage wine I've kept for 20 years.

504
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,420
It also represents 20 years of nostalgia.

505
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,320
I hope our No. 6 Factory's Machine Repair Workshop

506
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,330
will be like this old wine.

507
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,440
The older, the better.

508
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,710
Prosperous and thriving!

509
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,360
Bravo!

510
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,710
Everyone, please wait here for a moment.

511
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,510
There are still a few important guests

512
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,070
who haven't arrived...

513
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,590
Wenguo.

514
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,110
At our event yet.

515
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,400
None of the city officials or factory leaders

516
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,600
who were supposed to come have shown up.

517
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,670
It's almost time. What should we do?

518
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,800
Let's do this.

519
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,480
Pick a few worker representatives from among the workers,

520
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,430
and you come up with me

521
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,400
and stand next to me.

522
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,860
We'll proceed as planned.

523
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,540
Sir,

524
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,510
please come up for the ribbon-cutting.

525
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,030
Ma'am,

526
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,800
please come up for the ribbon-cutting.

527
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,440
Our commencement ceremony will now begin.

528
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,870
I'd like to invite all the leaders and guests to come on stage.

529
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,200
Please pick up the golden scissors in front of you.

530
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,510
Let's count down from five together.

531
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,070
Five,

532
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,110
four,

533
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,190
three,

534
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,230
two,

535
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,280
one!

536
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:20,960
Wenguo.

537
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,480
When you come back,

538
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,710
I'll have become the director of No. 6 Factory.

539
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,560
We'll have reclaimed No. 6 Factory.

540
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,220
How long is that going to take?

541
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,020
At most, 20 years.

542
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,710
Maybe a decade if we make it quick.

543
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,050
[Congratulations on the Grand Reopening of Banan No. 6 Machine Factory's Machine Repair Workshop]

544
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,450
I am Xu Wenguo.

545
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,590
I hope I can contribute a little

546
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,230
to help No. 6 Factory

547
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,400
and all the workers at No. 6 Factory.

548
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,650
This is my brother's wish.

549
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,710
In the near future,

550
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,230
all the workshops at No. 6 Factory

551
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,030
will start operating one by one!

552
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,500
Wenguo, there's an emergency.

553
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,300
I need to catch you up real quick.

554
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
Qiuhu, stop them!

555
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,960
Let's go.

556
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,620
Yihan, go and host the guests on site.

557
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,550
I need to talk to Wenguo about something.

558
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,810
Let's talk over there.

559
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,250
What's going on?

560
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,440
I just got a call from the bank.

561
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,100
The loan didn't come through.

562
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,440
The money that shareholders were supposed to transfer for the second phase

563
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,640
has all been stopped.

564
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,030
Why is that?

565
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,590
How did you sign the contract?

566
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,940
There's no problem with the contract.

567
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,470
What can I do if they don't transfer the money?

568
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,070
As you can see,

569
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,360
the media has started to be unfriendly towards us now.

570
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,150
Now you know why

571
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,550
these officials didn't come today, right?

572
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,070
It's Tang Yaoxin.

573
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,640
They're not stupid.

574
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,320
They'll definitely strike back.

575
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,450
It must be that father and son duo who are messing with us.

576
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,130
Alright,

577
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,970
I'll take care of the money.

578
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,670
Wenguo.

579
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,210
Why are you so stubborn?

580
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,070
I told you before we came back to Banan that

581
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,400
it's okay if we came back

582
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,230
to report the Tang father and son.

583
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,590
But as for this No. 6 Factory we've invested in,

584
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,590
it's not something that can be revitalized

585
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,760
by our company alone.

586
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,030
This money doesn't solely belong to you.

587
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,090
It's what everyone worked together to help you secure.

588
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,590
Ding.

589
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,000
If you think there's a risk

590
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,390
and are worried about the money,

591
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,080
you can withdraw at any time.

592
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,670
This time I've returned to Banan City,

593
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,000
I have no plans to leave.

594
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,920
Go to sleep.

595
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Why are you sweating so much?

596
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,590
Right.

597
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,770
The sheets are all wet.

598
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,610
You didn't wet the bed, did you?

599
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,210
Why so wet?

600
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,850
How could that be?

601
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,320
Fenfang.

602
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,530
Fenfang?

603
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,290
Why are you yelling in the middle of the night?

604
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,460
I'm peeing.

605
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,440
Go back to sleep.

606
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,700
I'm back.
