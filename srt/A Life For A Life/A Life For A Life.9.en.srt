00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
No more talk.​

177
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,360
It's all for us?

178
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,340
We can't let you come all this way for nothing.

179
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,790
It's a small token of our appreciation.

180
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,440
Officer Du.

181
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,650
Next time you visit,

182
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,960
come straight to me.

183
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,430
No need to go through Xia.

184
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,360
A toast to you.

185
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,320
Come on! Come on!

186
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,910
Let's drink together!

187
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,630
Fill it up, fill it up.

188
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,000
We're all friends now!

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,260
I'll just have water.​

190
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,120
Well…

191
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,550
Aren't you drinking water?

192
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,310
I'll have this.

193
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,000
We're all friends here!

194
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,550
Cheers!

195
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,870
Come on. Cheers!​

196
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,390
Good! Good!​

197
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,720
Once we drink, we're family!​

198
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,780
Well, get more drinkers in here?

199
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,590
Call them all!

200
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,180
Don't.

201
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,270
Wang Hongbing's a fugitive in my jurisdiction.​

202
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,960
​​I'm here to take him back.

203
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,330
This guy's actually a fugitive?

204
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,000
Didn't you figure it out?

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,320
He's got some crimes!

206
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,150
You won't be able to take him.

207
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,480
What do you mean?

208
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,080
He died in our mine.

209
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,120
Dead?

210
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,840
When?

211
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,010
A month ago.

212
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,450
Check this—​

213
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,950
​​is this the man?​

214
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,450
Xu Wenguo?

215
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,640
[Wanted]

216
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,080
This isn't Wang Hongbing.

217
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,810
Let me check.

218
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,630
First Xu Wenguo,

219
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,480
now Wang Hongbing.

220
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,910
Who exactly are you after?​

221
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,840
Him specifically.

222
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,980
One ID card

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,080
shared by a dozen men is nothing unusual.

224
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,550
In our mine crew,​

225
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,150
there's bound to be someone named Wang Hongbing.

226
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,270
Right? Right?

227
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,820
Cut the crap.

228
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,860
Just find this man.

229
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,140
Anyone recognize him?

230
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,560
Help search the mines.

231
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,440
Got it?

232
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,130
Xia, calm down.

233
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,600
At this hour,

234
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,960
most mine bosses

235
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,150
might be here.

236
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,030
​​I'll go and look him for you.

237
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,010
​I'll ask around.

238
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,680
Stay calm.

239
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,360
Sit tight.

240
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,870
You guys.

241
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,630
Enough talk.

242
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,240
Get someone in here.

243
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,040
Sit, sit, sit.

244
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,690
Do what needs doing!

245
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,910
Call them!​ More drinkers!

246
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,260
All friends here!

247
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,960
Xia, relax!

248
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,910
We'll find him!

249
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,480
Come on.

250
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,150
Drink up.

251
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,240
Come on! Come on!

252
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,270
Quickly.

253
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,600
Come on! Have a seat!

254
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,960
What would you like to drink, sir?

255
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,090
I'll pour it for you.

256
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,870
Make sure—

257
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,550
I'll drink mine.

258
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,670
Officer Du has a good drink!​

259
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,000
-Have a drink.
-No thanks.​

260
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,800
Just one bite.

261
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,670
It's warm.

262
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,230
Officer Du!

263
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,240
A toast to Officer Du!

264
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,030
Xia!

265
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,840
The bosses from all the major mines

266
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,960
all gathered here!

267
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,840
Long time no see. We've missed you so much!

268
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,770
Come on! Come on!

269
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,630
Fill it up, fill it up.

270
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,810
Don't toast to me.

271
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,330
Toast to Officer Du.

272
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,220
Officer Du, quick!

273
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,620
Officer Du, take a drink.

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,240
Officer Du, have a drink.

275
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
Everyone, take a look.

276
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
The man in this photo.

277
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,470
​Who's seen him at your mine?

278
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,840
No clue.

279
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,790
Not from my mine.

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,930
Not ours either.

281
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,620
Might be from our mine!

282
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,750
No "might be"!

283
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,460
Check carefully!

284
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,840
Jiang, he's definitely from our mine.

285
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Our mine?

286
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,000
Confirmed!

287
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,470
Shift start! Down the mines!

288
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,000
Zhang Weigui!

289
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,240
Qiu Zhigang!

290
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,910
Niu Zhenhua!

291
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,480
Hu Jianjun!

292
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,480
Ding Xiaosu!

293
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,550
Qiuhu!

294
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,870
Wang Hongbing!

295
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,450
Wang Hongbing!

296
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,510
I'll defeat you.

297
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,000
Officer.

298
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,020
Everything set?​

299
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,870
All arranged.​

300
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,670
Let's head to the office first.​

301
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:16,660
Move.

302
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,440
Go.

303
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:21,960
This way.

304
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,790
That Wang Hongbing—

305
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,720
where is he now?

306
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,550
Working underground.

307
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,480
What's his issue?​

308
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Why's so many people after him?​

309
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,240
Anyone else?​

310
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,910
Another group came earlier.

311
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,640
They're all in the office now.​

312
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,860
Du Xiangdong.

313
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,450
Hurry up! Hurry up!​

314
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,510
Stay alert today.

315
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,390
What's wrong, bro?

316
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,030
No questions.

317
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,030
Be careful.

318
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,150
Move! Faster!

319
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,840
​Stop gawking!​

320
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,920
Stay behind me.

321
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,960
Back rows, speed up!

322
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,790
Come on! Come on!

323
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,320
Grab tools! Start working!

324
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,130
Finish early, get off work early!​

325
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,790
Here, your tools.

326
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,160
Hurry up back there!

327
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,910
Come on.

328
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,410
Anyone without tools, come here.

329
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,690
​Didn't you say you weren't coming?​

330
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,360
Catch wind of something?

331
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,200
I caught the scent alright.

332
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,550
​​Are you meeting me for the first time?​

333
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm known for never missing a chance!​

334
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,210
Listen,

335
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,140
this military merit,

336
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,230
half belongs to me!

337
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,720
Who tipped you off?

338
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,980
Well done, Xia.

339
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,320
You sure can keep a secret.​

340
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,650
Don't blame me for this.

341
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,790
It's Zhang and Mr. Su's orders.

342
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,870
Pour some tea.

343
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,550
Du.

344
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,200
Here.

345
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,400
My apologies.​

346
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,030
It's really a pit down there?

347
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,550
Officer Du.

348
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,480
Watch your step.

349
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,000
It's twenty meters deep.

350
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,100
Why ​​is​​ a toad statue here?

351
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,470
It's a golden toad—feng shui charm.

352
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,590
All traps are set.​

353
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,740
Once Xu Wenguo surfaces,

354
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,690
he definitely won't escape.​

355
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,640
If we catch him this time,​

356
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,550
your transfer to the Criminal Police Team

357
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,349
will be officially justified.​

358
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,020
What happened?

359
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,140
It's nothing, nothing.

360
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,170
We use

361
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
blasting for mining.

362
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,819
Noises are normal.

363
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,790
Never had accidents before.​

364
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,810
Alright, alright, that's enough.

365
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,089
No accidents so far?

366
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,310
How'd that real Wang Hongbing die?

367
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,030
Here, Xia.

368
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,060
When does Wang Hongbing get off work?

369
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,100
Half an hour left.​

370
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,040
Get out.

371
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,920
This way.

372
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,070
Sir,

373
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,350
this is Wang Hongbing's bed.

374
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,350
Alright, thanks.

375
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,960
Okay.

376
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,590
Let's go.

377
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,000
[Civil Law Thinking]

378
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,230
He was reading law books.

379
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,160
He's up to no good.

380
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,250
We're set.​

381
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,720
Ding.

382
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,170
What's up, bro?​

383
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,630
​​You two, get out of here.​

384
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
What are you doing?!

385
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,000
Get lost! None of your business.

386
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,790
Now!

387
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,710
Ding, take him away.

388
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,200
Go. Let's go.

389
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,900
I'm not leaving!

390
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,340
Move now!

391
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,160
Why are you pulling me?!

392
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
​I'm going to save Bing!​

393
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,000
Are you stupid?

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,100
We can't save him alone!​

395
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,030
We need backup!​

396
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,560
Let's go!

397
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,510
Zheng Sanchuang.

398
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,300
What exactly do you want to do?

399
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,070
Bro.

400
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,600
Stop asking.

401
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,630
Even if you ask, I can't explain.

402
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,680
At least we shared a bunk in the mines.

403
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,400
Trust me.

404
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,750
It won't hurt.​

405
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,330
​​Just go peacefully.​

406
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,110
Move.

407
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,400
Brothers!

408
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,300
Bing's in trouble!

409
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,300
We must save him!

410
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,590
​I've got a family to feed.

411
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,590
How can we save him?

412
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,070
My wife's waiting at home.

413
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,950
Don't come closer!

414
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,800
How's Bing treated us?

415
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,460
We're brothers who've faced death together!​

416
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,710
Abandon him now,

417
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,480
they'll come for us next!

418
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,640
Are you even men?!

419
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,350
Move!​

420
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,960
Go!

421
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:46,980
Run!

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,660
You go first! I'll cover Bing!

423
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,890
Mine Director! Director!

424
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,640
Emergency!​

425
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,160
​​What's wrong?​

426
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,550
The mine collapsed!​

427
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,160
How many trapped?

428
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Over forty!

429
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,920
Where's Xu Wenguo?

430
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,600
​​Is he down there?​

431
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,270
Who?

432
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,130
Wang Hongbing!

433
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,160
​Is Wang Hongbing trapped?​

434
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,460
Yes!

435
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,920
-Where are they? Lead the way! Now!​
-Hurry!

436
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,450
Hurry up!

437
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,200
Stop!

438
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,160
Everyone stop!

439
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,890
The exit's caved in!​

440
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,890
We're all trapped!

441
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,080
​If you want to survive,

442
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,000
stop fighting!

443
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,540
Or else

444
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,480
we'll all die here!​

445
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,770
In this mine shaft,

446
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,200
I know another exit.

447
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,200
But I don't know if it's blocked or not.

448
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,920
I'll take the chance.

449
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,930
I want to live.

450
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,250
I'm done fighting.

451
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,650
Me too.

452
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,080
Hongbing, we all want to live!

453
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,660
Please lead us out!

454
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,370
We want to survive!

455
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,760
Follow me.

456
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,920
Please!

457
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,800
Don't leave me!

458
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,400
Save me!

459
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,280
Bro!

460
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,640
I might as well kill him!

461
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Zheng Sanchuang.

462
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,650
Tell me.

463
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,240
Who ordered you to kill me?

464
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,450
Please.

465
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,610
Don't abandon me.

466
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,800
Who the hell wants me dead?!

467
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,450
Let's go!

468
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,110
Please!

469
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,010
Don't leave me behind!

470
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,960
I have a child.

471
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,240
He'll be orphaned.

472
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm begging you.

473
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,030
Save me!

474
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,110
Please.

475
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,490
Qiuhu.

476
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,310
Help me.

477
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,770
Bro, where are you going?

478
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,890
Wherever you go, I follow!​

479
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,200
Hurry up!​

480
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,120
Up ahead.

481
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,240
Right here.

482
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,510
Wang Hongbing led us

483
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,400
out from the collapsed mine shaft.

484
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,260
Wang Hongbing!

485
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,130
Raise your head!

486
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,890
Head up! Did you see Wang Hongbing?

487
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,570
Look up! Up!

488
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,650
Head up!

489
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,790
​See Wang Hongbing?​

490
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,480
Head up!

491
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Stop right there!

492
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,510
Mi!

493
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,790
Hold him down!

494
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,920
Why are you running?

495
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,160
No escape!

496
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,420
Get down!

497
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,550
My leg…​

498
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,490
Why are you fleeing?​

499
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,090
-My leg…​
-Zheng Sanchuang?

500
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,040
Where's Xu Wenguo?

501
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,910
He went in!

502
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,520
​Into where?​

503
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,790
The mine shaft!

504
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,920
You sure?

505
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,640
I'm sure!

506
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,850
Why are you here?

507
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,450
Du, I'm going in to catch him!

508
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,770
Wait for me a second!

509
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,650
Xu Wenguo!

510
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,880
You've got nowhere to run!

511
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,610
Come out now!

512
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,350
Confess honestly!

513
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,310
Liu Guangcai!

514
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,690
He sent me here!

515
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,470
Liu Guangcai from the Security Department?

516
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,100
Yes, him!

517
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,950
Zhang Xiangyang, come here!

518
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,550
My leg… my leg…

519
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,010
Say it again! Who sent you?

520
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,880
Xia!

521
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,770
Xia!

522
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,200
Mi!
