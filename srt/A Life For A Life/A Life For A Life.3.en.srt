you're a criminal police officer?

Just focus on your own job properly!

How could you have the nerve to run around?

on this chessboard, the Horse

must move accordingly in a chess game.

00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,330
Why?

298
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,000
Because there are rules

299
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and disciplines.

300
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,830

I'm going with this move.

Here's my heads-up for you.

307
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
That police uniform you're wearing

308
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,670
is like the iron horseshoe nailed to your hoof,

309
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,000
the bridle on your head,

310
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,350
and the reins holding you tight.

I don't care about your thoughts,

312
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,920
but here, you must follow the rules.

313
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,690
Chief, he understands now.

314
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,430
You got it, right?

315
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,940
Alright.

316
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,100
Submit a self-criticism report and take a demerit.

317

Agreed.

318
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,040
I strongly suggest that

319
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,670
at the staff meeting,

320
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,800
Du Xiangdong should

321
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,190
do a thorough self-criticism.

322
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,590
It must be a complete process.

323
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,590
Did you hear that?

324
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,110
Chief,

325
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,570
we can't close this case so easily like this.

326
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,920
It's about two lives!

327
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Xu Wenguo and Yao Binbin

328
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,280
are only in their twenties.

329
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,880
If you wrongly execute them,

330
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,700
it's not a chess game where you can

331
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,560
retract a move!

332
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,430
That stubborn brat.

333
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,130

334
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,360

Then you should get another one!

343

Yes, sir.

You're on night duty today, right?

349
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,560
Yes.

350
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,400
I'll take your shift.

351
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,600
Why are you taking my shift?

352
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,950
You helped my daughter

353
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,920
a lot last time.

354
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,020
I haven't even thanked you properly.

355
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,680
Don't bother taking my shift.

356
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,670
I'd like to

357
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,160
have a good talk with Xu Wenguo and Yao Binbin tonight.

358
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,020
Talking to them

359
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,580
is within the rules.

360
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,720
But it's your night shift again tomorrow.

361
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,180
Can your health handle it?

362
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,040
I can't cover your shift tomorrow.

363
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,770
My daughter is on holiday tomorrow.

364
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,710
I want to spend more time with her.

365
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,950
As you should.

366
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,710
I'll take all the night shifts for a while.

367
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,490
You're so nice, bro.

368
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,020
Thanks!

369
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,740
They're accomplices!

370
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,780
You can't talk to them both at once!

371
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,590
I know.

372
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,190
And don't do anything recklessly.

373
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:11,950
Officer Du,

374
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,550
I didn't kill anyone.

375
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,770
I'm telling you the truth.

376
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,390
That gun is fake.

377
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,890
It couldn't kill anyone.

378
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,500
Don't fool me with the same trick

379
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,100
you used on Zhang Xiangyang.

380
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,640
Do you know

381
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,320
why I'm here?

382
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,650
Am I here to help you or harm you?

383
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,430
I went to meet him

384
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,660
just to scare him a bit

385
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,550
and beat him up.

386
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,870
But he was not scared.

387
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,980
He even laughed at me and said I...

388
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,580
I didn't dare to fire the gun.

389
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,110
Then, in a fit of rage,

390
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,200
I pulled the trigger.

391
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,810
But Officer Du,

392
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,530
I really didn't know

393
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,860
why that gun could fire.

394
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,020
So,

395
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,910
you did shoot Li Chao.

396
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,060
Yes.

397
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,190
Officer Du,

398
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,310
what do you mean by that?

399
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,100
What do you think?

400
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,530
The gun you made

401
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,480
was what killed Li Chao.

402
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,910
That gun didn't even have a firing pin.

403
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,060
I took out the firing pin myself!

404
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,500
It really couldn't fire!

405
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,430
Then tell me

406
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,780
when you first realized that

407
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,110
this gun couldn't work.

408
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,960
When I saved my brother at the pool hall.

409
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,350
I'll shoot whoever dares to

410
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,350
hurt my brother!

411
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,870
My brother tried to fire a shot then,

412
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,270
but the gun didn't go off.

413
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,330
Later, I asked my brother what happened.

414
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,210
He said he had removed the firing pin.

415
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,600
From that day on, I knew

416
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,160
this gun was just for show.

417
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,490
It couldn't fire at all.

418
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,630
So,

419
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,320
you made a new firing pin and put it back in.

420
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,680
Then you shot and killed Li Chao.

421
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,810
I would never harm my younger brother!

422
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,120
To be honest with you,

423
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,590
when my brother and I made that gun,

424
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,650
we were indeed aiming to kill Li Chao!

425
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,090
Then Ms. Cui found out.

426
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,320
She came to me in tears,

427
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,020
asking us not to do anything crazy.

428
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,580
I promised Ms. Cui,

429
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,710
so I took out the firing pin from the gun

430
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,060
and hid it.

431
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,870
Xu Wenguo,

432
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,890
you didn't behave yourself.

433
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,940
If you really didn't want to use this gun,

434
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,020
you should have thrown away the firing pin.

435
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,300
Why did you hide it?

436
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,990
To commit crimes in the future?

437
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,920
To take revenge?

438
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,850
Who else knows that

439
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,150
you two made a gun?

440
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,730
No one else knows.

441
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,470
Think carefully.

442
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,670
Does your mother know?

443
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,960
No, she doesn't.

444
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,040
That gun is fake.

445
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,780
It's just a toy gun.

446
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,100
You're lying again.

447
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,000
Your mother admitted that

448
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,930
she once saw that gun.

449
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,350
[Cui, Li, Xu]

450
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,630
You made this gun

451
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,070
and killed Li Chao.

452
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,300
Li Chao was a bastard.

453
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,370
I had put up with him for over a decade!

454
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,180
[Yao]

455
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,780
Trust me! It's not a real gun.

456
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,780
It couldn't fire!

457
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,910
Binbin fired the gun

458
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,730
and killed Li Chao.

459
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,660
[Chen]

460
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,780
Ms. Cui is still waiting for my food.

461
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,040
Maybe she's been busy with something. She hasn't shown up.

462
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,740
[Xu]

463
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,650
Someone passed on a message,

464
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,850
asking me to take good care of Xu Wenguo.

465
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,530
[Cui]

466
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,060
I promised Ms. Cui,

467
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,220
so I took out the firing pin from the gun

468
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,410
and hid it.

469
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,050
Where did you hide it?

470
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,130
In my kitchen.

471
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,150
Hello, Mr. Liu.

472
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,610
The police have entered the factory!

473
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,040
What are you doing?

474
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,560
Step back!

475
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,310
What are you doing?

476
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,170
Officer Zhang.

477
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,080
Step back!

478
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,130
It's me.

479
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,270
Take a close look.

480
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,380
The search warrant.

481
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,990
Please cooperate with our work.

482
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,050
Alright, alright.

483
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,230
And specific location?

484
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,910
Inside the hemp rope used for hanging cured meat.

485
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:21,850
Xu Wenguo,

486
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,550
That gun went off on the day of the incident.

487
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,760
How do you explain that?

488
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,010
You're right.

489
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,020
Maybe someone put the firing pin back in.

490
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,630
Was it you?

491
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Or Yao Binbin?

492
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,700
Officer Zhang.

493
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,050
The investigation is over?

494
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,210
We've got the pin.

495
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,220
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

496
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,410
Any fingerprints on it?

497
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,900
We've extracted one fingerprint.

498
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,230
It belongs to Xu Wenguo.

499
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,620
Seems like Xu Wenguo didn't lie.

500
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,950
He put the firing pin in.

501
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,070
Does it match this gun?

502
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,810
It fits into the gun,

503
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,070
not perfectly though.

504
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
I have a question.

505
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,470
Why are there no fingerprints

506
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,070
on the firing pin of this gun?

507
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,220
Long-term use causes wear and tear.

508
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,580
No fingerprints left for sure.

509
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,970
But I think these two sets of firing pins

510
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,570
look completely different.

511
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:33,890
I don't understand

512
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,130
why parts made by the same person

513
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,260
can be so different.

514
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,400
Lady, you think this is

515
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,150
a standard-issue gun

516
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,260
made to exactly the same specs?

517
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,590
This is a homemade gun.

518
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,290
The parts

519
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,110
were machined one by one.

520

Quickly bring out the rest of them!

00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,650
Officers, do head counts by cells!
