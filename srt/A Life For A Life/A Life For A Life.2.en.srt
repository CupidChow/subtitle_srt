1
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,270
I shouldn't be here.

2
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,830
I'm the victim.

3
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,010
A murder happened in No. 6 Factory.

4
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,480
We believe that these two did it.

[A Life For A Life]

00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,660
[Chapter 2: A murder in No. 6 Factory]

7
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,380
Go.

8
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,830
Officer Du,

9
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,710
that machine tool

10
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,840
was made after an old Soviet machine.

11
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,780
It needs regular oiling and maintenance.

12
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,340
Shut up.

13
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,470
Sit down.

14
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,630
Get it started.

15
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,310
Get what started?

16
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,190
There are rules in place.

17
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:46,960
Name?

18
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,470
Xu Wenguo.

19
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,290
Age?

20
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,829
24.

21
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,250
Family members?

22
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,620
I'm an orphan. I'm all by myself.

23
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,310
What else?

24
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,540
Nothing.

25
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,910
Why did you

26
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,370
live at Yao Binbin's home?

27
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,870
Ms. Cui took me in.

28
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,660
She raised me.

29
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,020
I call her Mom.

30
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,120
I see Binbin as my younger brother.

31
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,380
Who is Yao Wenwu?

32
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,190
Not my father anyway.

33
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,579
He left a long time ago.

34
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,380
He never took care of me or my mom.

35
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,630
When did Cui Lizhen and Yao Wenwu

36
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,570
get divorced?

37
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,950
I don't know.

38
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,270
When I moved in,

39
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,220
Ms. Cui was already raising Binbin alone.

40
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,070
After Yao Wenwu left,

41
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,780
a man often visited your home.

42
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,740
Who was he?

43
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,360
I heard he was an ex-boyfriend of Ms. Cui's,

44
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,790
named Li Chao.

45
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,140
The workshop supervisor?

46
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,780
Li Chao

47
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,910
hogged up your mom's time.

48
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,590
He didn't care what his displays

49
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,050
of affection towards Ms. Cui would do to you.

50
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,220
You hated his guts, right?

51
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,840
[Li Chao]

52
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,490
Where were you on October 6th?

53
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,160
I can't recall.

54
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,310
Where was Xu Wenguo?

55
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,540
I can't recall it either.

56
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,800
Here's a tip.

57
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,400
October 6th was a Tuesday.

58
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,330
You two should be in the workshop, right?

59
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,290
If you harass my mom again, I'll kill you.

60
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,830
I was at work,

61
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
fixing machines.

62
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,159
In that afternoon,

63
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,250
you two got into a fight with Li Chao in the workshop.

64
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,340
He attacked my brother.

65
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,030
We didn't lay a finger on him.

66
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,630
Your mom is like a public bus that everyone can ride.

67
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,100
The shabbiest kind, I'm telling you.

68
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,560
Li Chao was an animal.

69
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,930
Why did he

70
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,690
keep going to your place?

71
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,620
After moving into Ms. Cui's apartment,

72
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,910
I had never let him in again.

73
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,760
In that case,

74
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,030
Li Chao must've found you obnoxious.

75
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,030
You put up with him for a long time, didn't you?

76
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,390
For over a decade!

77
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,470
Then you and your brother made this gun,

78
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,510
right?

79
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,630
Don't tell me this gun isn't yours.

80
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,310
Listen, in the pool hall,

81
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,090
over 20 witnesses

82
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,240
saw you and your brother

83
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,560
take out this gun.

84
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,120
Then you killed Li Chao.

85
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,870
Li Chao died?

86
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,490
Yes.

87
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,250
Just as you wished.

88
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,060
I didn't fire the gun.

89
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,270
I didn't kill him.

90
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,290
Did I tell you

91
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,620
Li Chao was shot dead?

92
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,670
Did I say it?

93
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,770
But you're right.

94
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,590
Li Chao did die of a gunshot.

95
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,900
We did examinations.

96
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,040
The bullet fragments in Li Chao's body

97
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,320
were from the shotgun you made.

98
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
I didn't fire the gun.

99
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,860
Wenguo, who fired the gun?

100
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,640
I didn't.

101
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,380
Binbin couldn't have done it either.

102
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,180
Yao Binbin confessed right away

103
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,950
when we interrogated him.

104
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,980
I didn't fire the gun.

105
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,750
But I don't believe what he said.

106
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,010
We didn't kill anyone.

107
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,590
I mean it.

108
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,050
I visited No. 6 Factory.

109
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,150
I saw your girlfriend,

110
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,760
Sun Yonghong,

111
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,380
the prettiest girl there.

112
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,510
She's a real beauty.

113
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,280
She grabbed our arms as we left,

114
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,780
saying, "Officers, I beg you."

115
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,390
"Wenguo couldn't have killed a person."

116
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,180
"Please help him."

117
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,780
"I beg you. Please help him!"

118
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,340
You two are getting married by the end of this year, right?

119
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,740
Wenguo, look at me.

120
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,510
Don't you want to be with her?

121
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,100
There is a long list

122
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,100
of men pursuing her.

123
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,860
And the son of the factory director ranks top.

124
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,710
Don't forget

125
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,710
about Ms. Cui.

126
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,420
She treats you like her own son.

127
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,420
Aren't you going to take care of her in her old age?

128
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,860
Truth to be told,

129
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,740
I don't think you can count on Yao Binbin.

130
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,950
Don't try to shoulder all the responsibility.

131
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,350
This is a serious matter.

132
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,330
I'll ask you one last question.

133
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,470
Who fired the gun?

134
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,409
We didn't fire it.

135
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:36,100
It was you then.

136
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,809
I really didn't.

137
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:37,809
Our forensic report

138
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,929
says that the bullets were shot from this gun.

139
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,860
That's not a real gun.

140
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,500
It doesn't work.

141
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,220
Take my word for it. It's not a real gun.

142
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,860
You fired the gun.

143
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,409
It couldn't have been fired!

144
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,500
Who couldn't have fired the gun,

145
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,620
you or Yao Binbin?

146
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,050
Answer me.

147
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:46,500
I didn't do it.

148
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,530
Did you or Yao Binbin fire the gun?

149
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,170
It wasn't me.

150
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:48,690
It really wasn't!

151
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,410
Did you or Yao Binbin do it?

152
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,570
That's not a real gun.

153
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,530
Did you do it or not?

154
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,260
Officer Du.

155
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,690
Xiaonan,

156
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,410
who let him in?

157
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,810
Don't you know the rules?

158
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,650
Officer Du, I didn't kill anyone.

159
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,710
Binbin didn't kill anyone either.

160
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,380
Officer Du,

161
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,090
It's no use talking to him.

162
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,570
You should talk to me.

163
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,620
Chief,

164
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,820
what brings you here?

165
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,930
Hey.

166
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,990
I've heard that you like this too.

167
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,520
Come on, sit down. Join me.

168
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,420
This helps to prevent dementia.

169
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,580
I'll get you a chair.

170
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,180
No need.

171
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,530
The Criminal Police Team complained about you.

172
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,230
You mean Zhang Xiangyang?

173
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,810
He's such a blabbermouth.

174
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,850
It doesn't matter who said what.

175
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,380
You did break the rules.

176
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,500
They were interviewing a suspect at our place.

177
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,760
Couldn't I sit in on it?

178
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,020
But there are rules in place.

179
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,810
When they interrogate detainees,

180
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,280
we're not allowed to be present.

181
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,300
Why can't I be present?

182
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,090
Stop asking questions.

183
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:21,800
Stop.

184
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,930
It's called discipline.

185
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,740
Understood?

186
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
Yes, understood.

187
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,110
Why can't the Cannon work until it skips a few checkers?

188
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,140
For a longer shot range?

189
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,950
Nonsense.

190
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,600
The carriage takes up some space.

191
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,100
If everyone acts recklessly like you,

192
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,300
there will be a chaos.

193
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,930
I got it. I got it.

194
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,020
I finally understand

195
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,410
why the Horse moves in an L shape.

196
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,740
Why is that?

197
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,260
You see, a horse is supposed to run on the grasslands,

198
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,520
instead of being trapped in this small chessboard.

199
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,450
Now, it has to make a turn for every few steps it takes.

200
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,860
Du Xiangdong,

201
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,620
you should be glad that this is not a battlefield.

202
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,770
If it were,

203
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,970
I would make you the first one to charge.

204
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,220
given that tone you took with me.

205
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,000
You've got a sharp tongue.

206
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,260
Don't read too much into what I said.

207
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,910
Since you started working here,

208
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,640
I've been giving you guidance.

209
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,390
I wouldn't harm you, would I?

210
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,740
I've been protecting you,

211
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,380
right?

212
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,610
Everyone, get moving!

213
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,160
You only have 15 minutes.

214
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,770
Officer Du.

215
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,500
As you were.

216
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,220
This new guy does a good job making the bed.

217
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,750
Officer,

218
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,500
that's my spot.

219
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,910
You sleep here?

220
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:51,980
Yes.

221
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,140
Then where does he sleep?

222
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,270
Xu Wenguo sleeps in the front spot now.

223
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,050
Officer Du.

224
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,840
Officer Du.

225
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,220
Keep it going.

226
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,220
Officer Du.

227
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,740
Zheng Sanchuang.

228
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,380
Yes!

229
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,100
Come with me.

230
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,030
Take a step back.

231
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,310
Why did you give Xu Wenguo the front spot?

232
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,770
Officer Du,

233
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,480
didn't you tell me to take good care of...

234
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,560
Cut the crap.

235
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,740
Level with me.

236
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,820
No one else is around.

237
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,630
Spill it.

238
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,440
Someone sent me a message,

239
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,300
asking me to take good care of Xu Wenguo,

240
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,880
or my younger sister

241
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,590
and my child would get in trouble.

242
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,750
Who sent you that message?

243
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,340
Zheng Sanchuang,

244
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,110
you'll be set free in a few days.

245
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,610
Who gave you the message?

246
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,100
Yes.

247
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,220
Who?

248
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,570
I can't tell you.

249
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,220
I just can't.

250
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,140
Well, I...

251
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,770
I can't tell you about it.

252
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,990
Brother San.

253
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,330
Disperse.

254
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,410
All of you go away.

255
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,320
Are you okay?

256
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,270
Yeah.

257
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,100
Go on with that massage.

258
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,180
It wasn't a big deal.

259
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,490
Time's up.

260
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,210
Go back to the cell.

261
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,510
Where did you get these?

262
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,829
I just picked them off.

263
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:19,940
Ignore him.

264
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
Zhang Xiangyang!

265
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,710
Did he confess?

266
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,630
Hell no.

267
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,980
I almost got there,

268
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,850
but you showed up and spoiled the whole thing.

269
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,750
You dropped the ball, not me.

270
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,170
How was it not your fault?

271
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,240
How was it my fault?

272
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,090
I don't have time to bicker with you.

273
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,290
Zhang Xiangyang,

274
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,180
I think this case is more complicated than it seems.

275
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,090
You think?

276
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,220
Your thinking is limited

277
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,740
by the theories you learned at school.

278
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,540
You know that?

279
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,200
Unlike you,

280
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,850
I'm a real policeman

281
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,330
who fights on the front line.

282
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,020
Knock it off.

283
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,730
Don't you know what you were like at school?

284
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,080
Let me jog your memory.

285
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,190
Xiaonan, wait for me outside.

286
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,650
Du Xiangdong,

287
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,880
are you onto something?

288
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,940
I'm bewildered.

289
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,960
Since those two guys came here,

290
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,020
the old detainees have treated

291
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,020
Xu Wenguo with nothing but respect.

292
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,170
It's said that someone outside asked them to take care of him.

293
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,180
Who?

294
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,790
I couldn't get a name.

295
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,210
The dots have connected now, right?

296
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,610
Those brothers must be hiding dark secrets, aren't they?

297
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,840
They not only made a gun,

298
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,020
but are also probably gangsters.

299
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,380
The case can be closed soon.

300
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,580
It's not that simple.

301
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,290
After spending

302
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,860
these days with them,

303
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,680
I have a hunch that they are

304
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,270
not responsible for this case.

305
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,060
Forget that

306
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,180
silly hunch of yours.

307
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,640
You're overly sensitive.

308
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,990
You were a brooding lad back in school.

309
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,220
But criminal police are different.

310
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,420
We focus on evidence.

311
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,980
This is the perfect workplace for you.

312
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,600
I mean it.

313
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,050
The detainees

314
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,790
will be moved

315
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,410
by your tender

316
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,090
and warm heart.

317
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:09,820
Go away.

318
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:11,720
Bye bye.

319
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,130
Report to me if you find anything!

320
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,590
Why should I report to you?

321
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,590
You're a genius.

322
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,580
Amazing.

323
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,130
You know how to make a shotgun, don't you?

324
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,940
Impressive.

325
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,570
Don't stare at me.

326
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,320
My job is to take care of you.

327
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,130
As long as you're here,

328
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
I have to make you feel comfortable.

329
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,420
A cake for you.

330
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,440
Who told you to do that?

331
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,740
Hey.

332
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,030
My turn to use the toilet.

333
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,960
Don't yell at me.

334
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,260
I'm in the office.

335
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,990
This is embarrassing.

336
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:34,930
What's up?

337
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,660
Busy, huh?

338
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,090
Are you on duty today?

339
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,660
Let me cover your shift then.

340
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,860
You often help me out.

341
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,340
Cut to the chase.

342
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,610
Here's the thing.

343
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,130
My daughter

344
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,750
didn't do well on her exams.

345
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,900
My wife asked me to find a place

346
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,700
in No. 6 High School for our girl.

347
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,220
Impossible mission for me, right?

348
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,900
If necessary,

349
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,460
you'll have to pull some strings.

350
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,420
Exactly.

351
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,720
I need to work a way out.

352
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,020
Well, cigarette?

353
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,450
An old schoolmate of yours said

354
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,370
he was familiar with some district officials.

355
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,210
Can you ask him

356
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,150
to put in a good word for me

357
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,840
with the superintendent?

358
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,500
I'm not close to that old schoolmate.

359
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,430
We haven't been in touch for years.

360
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,490
I have only one daughter.

361
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,050
We're stuck in these mountains.

362
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,180
There won't be a big break in our lives.

363
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,950
I just want what's the best for my daughter.

364
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,200
Keep it.

365
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,310
No, take it back.

366
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,180
It's okay.

367
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,060
It's yours now.

368
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,950
I'm not going home tonight

369
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,000
to face the wrath of my wife.

370
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,620
[Registration Office]

371
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,630
Do you have super glue?

372
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,330
Nope.

373
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,920
Do you still need the telephone?

374
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,260
Hello?

375
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,200
Hello, this is Zhang Xiangyang. Who paged me?

376
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,500
You left your pen behind.

377
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,960
It's you, Xiangdong. This isn't urgent, right?

378
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,000
I can take it back another day.

379
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,850
Anything else?

380
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,600
Well...

381
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,690
Hands on your head!

382
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,810
Where is that gathering you mentioned before

383
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,470
being held?

384
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,770
Happiness Restaurant.

385
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,100
Happiness Restaurant.

386
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,280
Want to join us?

387
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,060
Alright, got it.

388
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,780
Come in, come in.

389
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,100
Get up, get up!

390
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,220
Hello.

417
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,370
Take a seat. Guys, Xiangdong's here.

Come on, sit down.

419
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,660
Sit here, here. Sit next to me.

420
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,330
No, thanks.

421
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,790
Waiter, get me a chair. Sit here, Xiangdong.

422
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,400
I'll take this seat.

423
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,530
There's a seat here.

424
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,130
Come on, dear.

425
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,090
Scootch over.

426
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,770
Why did you come so late?

427
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,900
We've finished almost all the dishes.

428
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,770
Let's order some more.

429
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,170
Don't bother. It's okay.

430
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,300
Waiter, please bring me one bowl of noodles.

431
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,460
Xiangdong, many people here are new to you, right?

432
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,460
Let me introduce you to them.

433
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,350
This is Director Zhang

434
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,330
from the Public Security Bureau,

435
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,190
who graduated long before we did.

436
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,450
This is Xia

437
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,470
from my unit,

438
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,260
just transferred from the county.

439
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,220
Nice to meet you.

440
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,420
And the rest

441
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,830
must be their family members.

442
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,020
Introduce yourselves, guys.

443
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,180
I'll go first.

444
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,900
Well,

445
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,180
you haven't met my wife, have you?

446
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,050
She's from Wafangdian, Dalian.

447
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,900
This is my wife.

448
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,180
Look at you,

449
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,050
with your hair permed like instant noodles,

450
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,850
dressed up all fancy.

451
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,530
What?

452
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,550
What's going on?

453
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,730
I forgot to introduce her to everyone.

454
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,600
This is my girlfriend,

455
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,330
Liu Fenfang,

456
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,590
the beauty of their plant.

457
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,990
Whose girlfriend?

458
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,570
Don't talk nonsense.

459
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,500
Not bad!

460
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
Which plant?

461
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,530
The meat processing one.

462
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,050
He used to be so skinny with sunken cheeks.

463
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,050
But look, he's so chubby now

464
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,370
and even dates a girl from the meat processing plant.

465
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,430
Look at Xiangdong.

466
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,850
He's still the same as back in school,

467
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,400
skinny with a pointy chin.

468
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,700
I bet he doesn't have a girlfriend caring for him.

469
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,610
We have several single girls in our department.

470
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,940
Maybe I can fix you up with one.

471
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,500
Okay.

472
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,400
Yanan, if you really care about him,

473
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,660
just forget about setting him up with anyone.

474
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,180
Why don't you two date each other?

475
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,290
If you can't find anyone,

476
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,750
we can go get our marriage license tomorrow.

477
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,140
Get married tomorrow?

478
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,660
Then you can do the wedding toast ceremony today!

479
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:28,530
Wedding toast! Wedding toast! Wedding toast!

480
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,590
Wedding toast! Wedding toast! Wedding toast!

481
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,970
You sit still.

482
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,910
I'll handle it.

483
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,250
I came late.

484
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,700
And I don't know what to say.

485
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,530
If there were ever a chance between us, we'd have been a couple back in school.

486
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,190
I have to go back to work later.

487
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,050
This toast

488
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,310
is to Zhang Xiangyang.

489
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,850
Come on, Xiangyang, this one's to you.

490
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,050
Honestly, I'd like to

491
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,290
ask you for a favor.

492
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,620
If you want my help,

493
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,420
you need to switch to a bigger glass.

494
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,200
No problem.

495
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,260
Drink up, and I'll help you with it.

496
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,900
You don't even know what it's about yet.

497
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,310
I know what you're going to say.

498
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:11,880
Drink it.

499
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,530
But don't get it wrong.

500
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,330
I can't help you get into the Criminal Police Team.

501
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,740
It's not about that.

502
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,600
Then what is it?

503
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,260
A colleague of mine

504
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,290
has a child

505
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,210
who wants to go to No. 6 High School.

506
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:28,910
Given your wide social network,

507
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,470
can you pull some strings?

508
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,430
Which district is No. 6 High School in?

509
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,190
Chaoyang.

510
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,260
Isn't your work unit in Chaoyang District?

511
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,460
That lady who introduced us to each other,

512
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,740
her husband is the deputy district chief there.

513
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,650
He's my dad's student.

514
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,950
I bet he'll do me a favor, won't he?

515
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,050
I got this. Let's drink.

516
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:42,430
Okay.

517
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,520
Just to be clear, is it actually your son?

518
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,390
Get lost.

519
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,480
I'll drink it then.

520
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,590
Everybody, don't move.

521
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,740
Nice!

522
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,100
Bravo! Well done!

523
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,420
Are we on the same mission?

524
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,290
I guess so.

525
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,130
There comes a task again.

526
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,190
Let's go, let's go.

527
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
Zhang Xiangyang.

528
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,740
Hey, listen to your mom.

529
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,360
You stay.

530
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,990
Take good care of the ladies.

531
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,570
We'll leave it to you.

532
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,590
Sir,

533
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,050
please settle the bill.

534
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,370
How much is it?

535
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,770
It's 458 yuan in total.

536
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,610
I only ordered one bowl of noodles.

537
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,820
Um, don't ask him to pay it.

538
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,100
Go downstairs and find that curly guy.

539
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,200
This table's bill has already been paid.

540
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,060
Sorry for that.

541
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,130
Sir,

542
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,530
are you a police officer?

543
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,830
Yes.

544
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,130
Then why

545
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,610
didn't you go catch bad guys with my dad?

546
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,260
Try these dishes.

547
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,220
Can we talk?

548
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,620
I've got something to handle. I'm going back for my shift.

549
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,700
You're leaving?

550
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,020
Be careful.

551
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,070
Why not pack some food?

552
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,830
[No.1 Detention Center of Banan City]

553
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,260
What are you doing?

554
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,670
You can't park here.

555
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,140
Hello, sir.

556
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,030
We're from the meat processing plant.

557
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,440
I'm looking for Officer Du Xiangdong.

558
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,790
Who are you looking for?

559
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,790
You can't park here.

560
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,980
I know.

561
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,750
I'm here for Du Xiangdong.

562
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:33,990
Do you know him?

563
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,030
Du?

564
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,110

00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,620
talk in my office

754
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,080
while we drink tea?

755
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,870
He is in there.

756
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,100
Officer Du?

757
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,850
Officer Du?

758
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,480
Where is he?

759
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,770
I just saw him come in.

760
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,860
This is his notebook.

761
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,860
He left it behind.

762
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,610
Officer Du!

763
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,420
Why did you jump through the window?

764
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,440
The door is right here.

765
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,700
I'll be right with you!

766
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,300
♫Angry, mad♫

767
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,050
♫Emotional tide♫

768
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,800
♫Where should I hide♫

769
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,830
♫All the bad?♫

770
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
♫Where should I hide♫

771
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,550
♫All the sadness?♫

772
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,660
Officer Du!

773
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,670
Are you Officer Du?

774
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:08,870
Hello, Officer Du.

775
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,170
I'm Liu Guangcai, head of the Security Department of No. 6 Factory.

776
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,300
Where are you going?

777
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,450
I'm leaving,

778
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,660
but I can't find the gate.

779
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,040
You're really agile.

780
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,530
You disappeared in an instant.

781
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,250
Here is your bag.

782
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,910
Check if anything is missing.

783
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,910
You didn't inform us of your visit.

784
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,210
We did a terrible job

785
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,550
welcoming you.

786
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,540
How about this?

787
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,300
I'll ask the canteen chef to stay longer

788
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:29,940
and cook for us.

789
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,820
Thank you, but no.

790
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,640
I have to go now.

791
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,610
It's just a simple meal.

792
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,320
Are you sure you're leaving?

793
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:33,960
Yes.

794
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,840
I just called where you work.

795
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,660
The chief there told me

796
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,620
he didn't ask you to visit

797
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,610
Xu Wenguo and Yao Binbin's family.

798
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,800
See?

799
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,440
Officer Du is devoting his private time

800
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,630
to probing into some detainees' lives.

801
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,640
How noble of you.

802
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,860
Next time, just give me

803
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,160
a heads-up if you need to do this again.

804
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,540
I'm familiar with the factory.

805
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,880
I can provide you with convenience.

806
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,650
We promise

807
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,220
to take good care of the detainees' family.

808
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,750
Detainees are humans too.

809
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,970
Alright, I got it.

810
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,590
Where is the gate?

811
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,130
Right over there!

812
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,830
Officer Du,

813
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,040
we're very excited

814
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,530
about your visit.

815
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,690
Shall we commemorate this occasion?

816
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,380
I really need to go.

817
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,510
Come on.

818
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,900
Be closer.

819
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:20,930
Come on, guys.

820
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,150
Come here.

821
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:24,940
Everybody,

822
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,900
three, two, one.

823
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,800
Cheese!

824
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:34,320
[To commemorate Officer Du Xiangdong's visit to No. 6 Factory in October, 1992]
