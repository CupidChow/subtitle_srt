00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,889
We're hunting a murderer!

353
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,070
Open it!

354
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,810
Fine. We'll open it.

355
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,070
See for yourself.

356
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,690
Is there anyone inside?

357
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,010
No!

358
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,110
It's cold enough to freeze a living person to death!

359
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,910
Oh, my pork! My pork!

360
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,330
Be gentle!

361
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,160
Are you done checking?

362
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,690
You can go now.

363
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,370
