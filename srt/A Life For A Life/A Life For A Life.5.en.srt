00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,890

00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,030
While leisure activities are encouraged,

168
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,720

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,030
we'll allow tonight's gathering.

193
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,960
But!

194
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,150
Mark my words:

195
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,710
no excessive drinking,

196
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,790
safety first,

197
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,510
and no tardiness tomorrow.

198
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,270
Got that?

199
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,550
Yes!

200
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,190
And lower the volume.

201
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,270
Change the song.

202
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,970
Alright, let’s keep going!

203
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,040
Carry on!

204
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,310
Xu,

205
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
a word in private.

206
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,260
Let me handle this.

207
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,570
Mr. Liu,

208
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,430
where are you taking my brother?

209
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,790
Just a brief chat. Nothing serious.

210
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,310
What's this about?

211
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,240
Wait here. It's fine.

212
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,080
No, but…

213
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,050
Is everything really alright?

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
It should be fine.

215
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,390
You guys head back to your department now.

216
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,890
Yao Binbin

217
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,510
has been stealing scrap materials from the factory lately.

218
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,390
You know that?

219
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:49,930
That's impossible.

220
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,260
How is that impossible?

221
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,850
What's my role here?

222
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,160
The reason I pulled you aside to discuss this privately

223
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,600
is to make you enforce discipline as his older brother.

224
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,200
Got it?

225
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,220
Okay.

226
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,600
Thanks, Mr. Liu.

227
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,640
Alright, that's all.

228
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,420
Well, Mr. Liu,

229
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,510
feel free to drop by anytime.

230
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,120
Just stay out of trouble, both of you.

231
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,480
I'm leaving.

232
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,670
You okay, bro?

233
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,440
Fine.

234
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,270
What did they say?

235
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,270
Nothing specific.

236
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,340
Just told us not to stay out too late.

237
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,150
So?

238
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
Everything alright?

239
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,420
​♫Night breeze whispers​♫

240
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Thanks for today.

241
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,670
May I?

242
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,670
♫The world bathed in moonlight​♫

243
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,090
Can I get this dance?

244
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,200
​♫Your smile's silhouette​♫

245
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,240
Of course

246
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,700
​♫Etched in my heart's canvas​​♫

247
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,450
♫Who sighs softly​♫

248
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,050
♫Beyond the horizon's veil♫

249
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,370
♫My longing takes flight​♫

250
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,950
♫Chasing shadows of your soul​♫

251
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,860
​​♫Starry river flows silent​♫

252
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,110
♫Guiding footsteps homeward​♫

253
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,210
♫Time flows like honey♫

254
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,440
♫​Your warmth lingers in dreams​♫

255
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,520
​​♫I dare not speak of love​♫

256
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,780
♫Lest I startle the drifting clouds​♫

257
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,370
♫Let moonlight be my envoy​♫

258
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,390
Bro, why aren't you dancing with Hong?

259
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,030
♫​​Carrying unvoiced truths​♫

260
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,600
If you don't make a move now, you'll never get her.

261
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,930
Stop talking nonsense.

262
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,150
We're just classmates.

263
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,280
♫Moon♫

264
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,240
♫Mirror of my heart​♫

265
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:04,030
♫Your silver threads weave tenderness​♫

266
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,400
Bro, when were you classmates with him?

267
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,730
Back in high school.

268
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,780
♫Through the veil of night​♫

269
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,420
♫Mortal world♫

270
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,030
♫How much do you fathom my soul♫

271
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,200
​​♫This love I never voiced aloud♫​

272
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,150
By the way,

273
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,280
​♫I surrender it to you♫

274
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,580
about that girl today…

275
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,510
Awesome. Amazing. Unbelievable.

276
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,200
Back!

277
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,600
Back!

278
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Okay, stop!

279
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,060
Sir.

280
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,430
What's up?

281
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,990
Mind if I check the engine?

282
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,730
Please?

283
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,610
Sure, go ahead.

284
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,870
Thanks a lot.

285
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,550
No problem.

286
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,260
Impressive setup you've got here.

287
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,750
Ever thought about bringing me in?

288
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,150
Help you scale things up.

289
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,780
This is just a hobby project with my brother.

290
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,540
Not looking to go big.

291
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,880
Fine, keep running it well then.

292
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,670
About the matter with Liu Guangcai,

293
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,670
I'll talk to my father.

294
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,590
He won't bother you anymore.

295
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,280
Count on it.

296
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,510
Alright, appreciate it.

297
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,460
I'm off then.

298
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,160
Okay.

299
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,360
Binbin, let's go.

300
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,980
Bro,

301
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,340
come check this out.

302
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,390
A Crown engine.

303
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,080
Didn't know you recognized the Crown.

304
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,610
Let's test your knowledge.

305
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,550
Tell me, what's the core technology of Crown?

306
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,910
Original MS122 six-cylinder engine.

307
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,150
Four-speed automatic transmission.

308
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,150
Four-wheel independent suspension.

309
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,610
2.8-liter displacement.

310
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,150
Where did you learn all this? Sounds professional.

311
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,790
Alright.

312
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,360
Hop in.

313
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,150
Let's take it for a spin.

314
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,910
Seriously?

315
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,680
You can drive this, right?

316
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,240
Got the basics.

317
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,720
Binbin.

318
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,460
Get in.

319
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,270
Don't wreck his ride.

320
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,230
No worries.

321
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,110
Perfect excuse to drive you home.

322
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,260
Not necessary.

323
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,360
Just walk through.

324
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,420
No need for wheels.

325
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,320
This is goodbye for now.

326
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,850
Let's go.

327
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,580
Wenguo, let me help you.

328
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,090
No need.

329
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,320
Hand it over.

330
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,580
I said no.

331
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,050
Hong.

332
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,060
Hong.

333
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,200
Get over here.

334
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,600
Hurry up.

335
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,910
What's his problem?

336
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,930
He's in a sulk. Can't you tell?

337
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,670
Why is he upset?

338
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,360
You and Tang Yaoxin were

339
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,440
dancing so intimately.

340
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
No wonder he's fuming.

341
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,010
He gave me permission.

342
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,380
You just do whatever he says?

343
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,980
How could you be so careless?

344
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,470
The main thing is he's not venting to you,

345
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,620
he'll actually takes it out on me at home.

346
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,160
So,

347
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,120
what should we do then?

348
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,360
Why don't you talk to him?

349
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,630
I'll handle it.

350
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,510
Bro,

351
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,630
hit the dance floor with Hong.

352
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,960
Exactly, the place is empty now.

353
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,420
Join me for a dance.

354
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,910
I don't dance.

355
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll lead.

356
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,750
Hong, do you know why

357
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,080
he won't dance with you?

358
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,910
You've already danced with Tang Yaoxin here.

359
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,240
You broke his heart.

360
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,890
Enough with the commentary.

361
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,080
Who said I was angry with her?

362
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,120
This is about you.

363
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,150
Never seen a car before?

364
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,200
You just drive whenever someone lets you?

365
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,430
See, this is exactly what I told you about.

366
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,630
He'd take it out on me.

367
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,720
My bad, bro. All my fault.

368
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Let me make it up to you.

369
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,450
Come with me.

370
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,670
This way, bro.

371
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,600
Why are we back here?

372
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,430
Just follow.

373
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,390
Keep up.

374
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Watch your step.

375
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,849
This way.

376
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,119
Binbin, where are we going?

377
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,790
Sis, just keep going.

378
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,310
Big surprise waiting.

379
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,610
Right ahead.

380
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,590
Bro,

761
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,630
I'll park it here,

762
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,760
and pick it up in a couple days.

763
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,490
Fix it right.

764
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,060
Where's your brother?

765
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,600
With Hong, probably.

766
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,760
I'm leaving.

767
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,430
Do you know how to drive?

768
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,590
Yes, I do.

769
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,960
Let me back it in for you.

770
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,880
Open the door.

771
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,940
[Bin-kook Repair Shop]

772
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,030
Binbin.

773
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,210
Why is Tang Yaoxin's car here?

774
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,170
Aren't you working today, bro?

775
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,830
Why did you dismantle the whole engine?

776
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,230
It broke down.

777
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,360
He asked me to fix it.

778
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,050
Stop bragging.

779
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,280
Since when can you fix engines?

780
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,280
Don't you trust me?

781
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,000
I'll definitely fix it,

782
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,230
even if I've never done this before.

783
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,530
Don't screw around.

784
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,670
All parts are quite expensive.

785
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,190
If you wreck something, we can't afford to replace one.

786
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,580
Bro.

787
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,610
It's not worth much.

788
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,040
Let me spill a secret.

789
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,440
This is a rebuilt vehicle

790
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,500
with a used engine.

791
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,340
You have no idea about it.

792
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,840
Tang Yaoxin's car

793
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,170
is the first imported vehicle in our city.

794
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,100
I'm serious.

795
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,010
Look—the engine number has been ground off.

796
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,140
Clearly used parts.

797
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,100
Check this—

798
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,310
rusted out to hell.

799
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,900
Would a new car be like this?

800
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,290
It's a refurbished car.

801
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,880
Hi.

802
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,620
I'm Yao Binbin.

803
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,040
Where to?

804
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,130
This ride?

805
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,570
Not pricey.

806
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,860
My brother and I bought it.

807

How about I pick you up after school?

811
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,030

Binbin! Binbin!

819
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,950
Hurry up and get to the hospital!

820
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,360
Your mom is collapsing!

821
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,400
Got it. Thanks.

822
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,230
Binbin,

823
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,550
when you get there,

824
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,020
no matter what anyone says—

825
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,070
keep your cool.

826
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,910
Okay?

827
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,840
What's going on?

828
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,800
Director Li put your mom and brother

829
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,120
on the layoff list.

830
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,580
The shock hit her hard—

831
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,190
triggered the attack.

832
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,120
Where's Li Chao?

833
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:23,810
Binbin.

834
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,630
Listen to me.

835
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,140
At a time like this, throwing tantrums—

836
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,720
only hurts your mom!

837
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,300
And your brother!

838
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,280
Mr. Liu,

839
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,010
where is he?

840
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,580
Fishing at the reservoir.

841
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,930
When you find him,

842
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,890
swallow your pride.

843
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,760
At least—

844
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,190
just say you're sorry.

845
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,890
There might still be—

846
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,360
room to fix this.

847
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,110
Your mother

848
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,970
endured all this.

849
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,230
For what?

850
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,550
For you.

851
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,300
Fine.

852
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,110
Binbin,

853
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,940
I'm cooking dinner.

854
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,280
Come grab a bite later.

855
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,740
Save your mom the trouble.

856
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:26,950
Binbin,

857
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,060
Binbin, where are you going?

858
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,400
Li Chao!

859
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,110
Why did you lay off my mom?

860
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,960
And my brother?

861
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,590
Got a problem, punk?

862
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,820
Listen up!

863
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,330
Your brother is none of your business.

864
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,550
As for your mom,

865
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:56,850
she can plead her cases

866
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,640
after she scrubs up real nice.

867
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,100
What the hell did you say?!

868
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,030
You know what's between me and your mom.

869
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,990
You almost called me dad.

870
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,070
What's that in your hand?

871
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,710
Trying to scare your daddy?

872
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:09,360
Get lost now!

873
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,960
I'll blow your brains out right here!

874
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,960
Clear out now or I'll put your whole family out of work!

875
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,470
You little…

876
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:28,920
You…

877
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,720
How dare

878
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,480
you shot me.

879
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,060
Hold it right there!

880
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:28,930
Apprehend him!

881
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,990
You're wanted for car theft!

882
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:31,870
I didn't!

883
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,670
Got a tip you did!

884
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:33,760
Why else would we be here?

885
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,980
Arrest him and take him away!

886
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,710
Move!

887
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,480
Stay back!

888
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:37,980
Freeze!

889
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,070
Back off!

890
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,480
Back off! Get lost!

891
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,070
I never stole it.

892
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:42,700
