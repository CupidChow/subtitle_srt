00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,910
We've done nothing wrong.

176
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,370
What's the reason for firing us?

177
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,090
-Why?
-Why?
-Why?

178
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,330
Everybody, please calm down!

179
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,270
Yonghong.

180
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,490
I'm also on that list.

181
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,120
Take care.

182
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,750
Be careful!

183
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,280
Yonghong...

184
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,670
Yonghong...

185
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,930
Yonghong, just stay there.

186
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,090
Don't step forward.

187
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,450
Don't jump off it.

188
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,710
I'm worried about you.

189
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,320
What will happen

190
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,080
to your parents if you die?

191
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,570
Have you taken their feelings into consideration?

192
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,720
Xu Wenguo!

193
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,510
Xu Wenguo, where are you?

194
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,600
Take me away!

195
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,640
Wenguo...

196
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,480
Mom.

197
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,830
Dad.

198
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,390
Tang Yaoxin insisted on paying you a visit.

199
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,070
Here they are.

200
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,120
Move the table forward.

201
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,100
I'll place it here.

202
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,510
Get that board over here.

203
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,730
This?

204
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,210
Do you need any help?

205
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,960
No, it's okay. I got this.

206
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,440
And then what?

207
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,900
Lay it down horizontally.

208
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,310
This is my bed,

209
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,070
where I sleep.

210
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,650
Now you've seen it.

211
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,530
It's time you left.

212
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,030
Just go.

213
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,900
[Inn]

214
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,100
I'd like a room.

215
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,790
For how many people?

216
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,170
Just one.

217
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,070
One person...

218
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,200
For how many nights?

219
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,790
Only one.

220
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,120
Five yuan for one night.

221
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,970
Show me your ID.

222
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,020
I lost it.

223
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,300
I can't proceed without your ID.

224
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
I need to put down your information.

225
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,140
Then I won't stay here.

226
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,550
I can fix the problem.

227
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,280
Pay me another five yuan, and I'll rent you a room.

228
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,850
That's more like it.

229
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,310
Come here, Qiaoqiao!

230
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,270
Yes.

231
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,070
Take this gentleman to his room.

232
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,350
Make way, please.

233
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,590
Here's the key.

234
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,680
Shall we?

235
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,280
Come on, keep up.

236
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,720
Why are you so slow?

237
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,610
Hurry up.

238
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,990
Keep going.

239
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,770
This way.

240
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,380
Here!

241
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,450
Why are you standing there?

242
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,720
Come here.

243
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,350
Here it is.

244
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,770
Come on in.

245
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,380
Come in now.

246
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:20,960
Come.

247
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,480
It's freezing cold outside.

248
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,540
Sit down.

249
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,200
Be seated.

250
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,250
Mister,

251
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,970
we provide massages here.

252
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,110
10 yuan per hour.

253
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,400
Professional service.

254
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,250
Would you like to give it a try?

255
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
This is all I have.

256
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,450
Take it.

257
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,000
You can go now.

258
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,880
But I haven't served you yet.

259
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,720
How can I take your money?

260
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,790
Just leave.

261
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,040
All I want is a good sleep.

262
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,270
Fine, mister.

263
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,210
How about this?

264
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,460
I'll stay here for only half an hour.

265
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,560
You can sleep as you want.

266
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,640
They'll give me a hard time if I show up downstairs now.

267
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,700
Just a while, okay?

268
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,830
You look really tired.

269
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,840
Get some sleep now, will you?

270
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,590
Mister!

271
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:40,890
You sit there.

272
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,460
Mister,

273
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,720
You look exhausted.

274
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,600
Let me give you a massage.

275
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,680
A head massage for fatigue relief.

276
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,160
Are you feeling cold,

277
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,640
mister?

278
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,790
Well,

279
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,790
at least take off your glasses.

280
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,830
Who would sleep with glasses on?

281
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,690
Let me give you a massage.

282
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,340
I'll put the glasses beside you.

283
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,200
Don't be so tense, mister.

284
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,970
Do you like this?

285
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,200
We spent days investigating and found

286
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,950
that Chen Su'e

287
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,640
had gone back to her hometown in Mengcheng

288
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,100
after testifying in court

289
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,720
for Yao Binbin's case.

290
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
She secluded herself

291
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,110
and seldom interacted with others.

292
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,590
On the day of her death,

293
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,310
her neighbors

294
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,240
didn't hear any unusual sounds.

295
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,920
Captain,

296
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,310
we compared the fingerprints

297
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,270
with those of the people Chen Su'e knew.

298
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,200
Two of the three fingerprints

299
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,480
match Xu Wenguo's.

300
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,270
Who?

301
00:25:59,270 --> 00:25:59,920
Whose are they?

302
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,670
Xu Wenguo.

303
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,070
We compared

304
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,550
the fingerprint records of Xu Wenguo here

305
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,960
with the fingerprint photos taken

306
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,030
in Chen Su'e's home,

307
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,070
and found a perfect match.

308
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,610
Chen Su'e refused to

309
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,920
provide an alibi for Xu Wenguo and his brother,

310
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,310
so he held a grudge against her.

311
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,270
After he escaped,

312
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,510
he went to her place and killed her.

313
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,460
I beg to differ.

314
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,080
After all, Chen Su'e watched

315
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,650
Xu Wenguo and Yao Binbin grow up.

316
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,710
Resentful though Xu Wenguo might be,

317
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,210
it was unlikely for him to kill her.

318
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,210
Wait a moment.

319
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,480
Two of the three fingerprints

320
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,790
belong to Xu Wenguo.

321
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,320
Whose is the remaining one?

322
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,060
We haven't figured it out yet.

323
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,880
The evidence we've obtained suggests

324
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,920
that Xu Wenguo was at the crime scene,

325
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,700
and is a major suspect.

326
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,790
How is he doing now?

327
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,480
He is doing fine.

328
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,550
His condition is stable.

329
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,070
Sorry.

330
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,510
I was held up by work in the factory.

331
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,480
It's alright. No worries.

332
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,620
How is the patient now?

333
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,830
He is asleep in the ward.

334
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,490
Our office is just right in front.

335
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,820
Let us know if you need help.

336
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,950
-Alright?
-Got it. Thank you.

337
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,880
You're welcome.

338
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,880
Alright, go see him then.

339
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,240
I'm heading back to the center.

340
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Thank you so much.

341
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,000
Chief.

342
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,300
Well,

343
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,260
the application form?

344
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,720
Thank you for reminding me.

345
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,380
I already prepared it for you.

346
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,160
Have you two reached a consensus?

347
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,100
You must think it through.

348
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,400
I've made up my mind.

349
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Thank you, Chief.

Li.

352
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,270
Su.

353
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:15,930
Xiangyang.

354
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,110
Who are you looking for?

355
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,980
Du Xiangdong.

356
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,030
For what?

357
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,530
An important issue.

358
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,720
Something important is going on there too.

359
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,110
His girlfriend is with him.

360
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,380
Give them some privacy.

361
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,680
I'm carrying police duties.

362
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,060
What's the thing?

363
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
This is serious.

364
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,350
Chen Su'e was murdered.

365
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,590
Xu Wenguo's fingerprints

366
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,850
were found in her home.

367
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,960
What does it have to do with Du Xiangdong?

368
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,200
Xu Wenguo used his badge

369
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,540
when he escaped.

370
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,310
You know about

371
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,440
that badge stuff.

372
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,110
He didn't give it to Xu Wenguo on purpose.

373
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,480
What are you all doing here?

374
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,750
This is a hospital.

375
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,890
Please keep quiet.

376
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,140
My apologies.

377
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,550
He was attacked

378
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,340
when he was chasing after a fugitive.

379
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,670
It was a meritorious act.

380
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,000
We shouldn't falsely accuse a fellow of ours.

381
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,260
What meritorious act?

382
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,000
Why did he have to do that?

383
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,370
Did I ask him to chase after a fugitive?

384
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,550
If he hadn't interfered,

385
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,280
we might have caught Xu Wenguo.

386
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,130
You're right.

387
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,350
As criminal police officers,

388
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,730
all you handle is serious cases,

389
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,720
unlike us.

390
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,310
You see,

391
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,720
he's my old schoolmate and he never listens to me.

392
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,590
Aren't you going to discipline him as his superior?

393
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,250
Are you incapable of managing

394
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,110
your subordinates or what?

395
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,040
He simply can't rein in Xiangdong.

396
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,550
What's the point of meeting him now?

397
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,340
He doesn't recognize you.

398
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,160
Let me handle it, alright?

399
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,790
How?

400
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,350
From now on,

401
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,110
I'll have him watched 24/7.

402
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,030
I promise he won't go out to cause trouble,

403
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,030
or to show his face before your eyes.

404
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
I'll ask the brass

405
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,950
for permission.

406
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,350
I guarantee you with my 30-year party membership.

407
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,240
Su,

408
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,200
we two go way back.

409
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,270
You know me well.

410
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,880
You'd better keep your word.

411
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,640
Otherwise,

412
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,580
we'll discipline him for you.

413
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,970
This is what the higher-ups want.

414
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,620
I don't get a say in it.

415
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,750
I understand.

416
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,030
I'm leaving then.

417
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,050
Liu Fenfang, I'm hungry.

418
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,880
You already woke up.

419
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,600
What would you like to eat? I'll get it for you.

420
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,250
What are you looking at?

421
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,950
Don't you know who I am?

422
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,040
Did you just call my name?

423
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,300
Do you have another name I don't know?

424
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,700
Nurse!

425
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,450
Nurse, he can recognize me!

426
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,210
Have you recalled everything?

427
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,760
Do you feel pain in the head?

428
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,750
No need to cry, right?

429
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,050
Why are your hands so cold?

430
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,880
I was worried sick!

431
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,510
I thought you would

432
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,880
never remember me.

433
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,970
Is he awake now?

434
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,400
Nurse, check him out.

435
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,070
What's your name?

436
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,960
Du Xiangdong.

437
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,500
What's her name?

438
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,030
Her name is Liu Fenfang.

439
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,890
Good progress.

440
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,910
His brain has almost recovered.

441
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,240
Sign him up for a checkup just to make sure.

442
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,500
Nurse.

443
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,030
Will this injury affect his future children?

444
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,200
Liu Fenfang, I heard you.

445
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,200
Because I did say it.

446
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,440
Thank you.

447
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,060
Thank you, nurse.
