117

118
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,560
Xu,

119
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,230
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,830
In the end, I got No. 6 Factory's land.

121
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,160
You lost.

122
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,550
You can't really call it losing.

123
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,280
This factory belonged to our family 20 years ago.

124

I admit you're not wrong about that.

128
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,430
But the future No. 6 Factory

129
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,550
needs a new approach

130
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,180
and a new leader.

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,070
And I admit my father couldn't make it.

132
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,000
Neither can you.

133
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,040
It has to be me.

Do you see that chimney?

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,190
Tear it down and build a central business district,

136
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,000
and the workers will have everything they need—

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,360
food, drink, and entertainment.

138
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,500
As for Workshop 4,

139
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,790
if we turn that into an apartment building,

140
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,950

Just treat these workers well.

148
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,780
That's also Binbin's wish.

149
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,830
But I am curious about one thing—

150
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,240
what's your wish?

151
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,210
For the past 20 years, my biggest wish

152
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,320
has been to send you and your father to prison

153
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,600
to face justice.

154
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,870
I want to see both of you sentenced to death with my own eyes,

155
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,670
so I can give Binbin closure.

156
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,400
Xu Wenguo...

157
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,560
You're still too naive.

158
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,540
Do you have any evidence?

159
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,880
What are you accusing me of?

160
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,240
Murder?

161
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,720
Arson?

162
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,890
Or weapons manufacturing?

163
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,980
Where's your evidence?

164
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,240
Without it,

165
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,970
what are we even talking about?

166
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,900
Alright, alright.

167
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,910
I admit it.

168
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,720
I was the one

169
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,200
who told Liu Guangcai to kill him.

170
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,720
I also lent Binbin that car on purpose,

171
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,720
because I knew he liked it and I knew he'd take it apart.

172
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,840
Even if you've got a recorder

173
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,080
in your pocket right now,

174
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,790
when the police come for me,

175
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,150
I'll tell them

176
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,600
you were holding a knife to my throat

177
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,530
and threatening me to say all of this. How about that?

178
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,630
Let me say it again, bro.

179
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,330
You have no evidence.

180
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,810
Now you've got one last chance—

181
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,910
push me into the river right now.

182
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,390
Go ahead.

183
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,510
Or should I jump in myself?

184
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,400
Xu,

185
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,810
it's been twenty years.

186
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,060
You managed to survive, make it all the way here,

187
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,320
and stir up this much trouble.

188
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,080
I genuinely respect you.

189
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,240
I really do.

190
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,970
So since you're so capable, and I'm so capable,

191
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,440
why don't we work together?

192
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,600
Binbin is dead.

193
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,960
The dead can't come back.

194
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,840
You know what's king in this world?

195
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,390
Making money...

196
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,820
Are you satisfied now?

197
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,150
You owe me this.

198
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,930
Got it.

199
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,510
Please keep

200
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,290
this car for me.

201
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,890
This car's no good anymore.

202
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,720
It's just a pile of scrap metal.

203
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,790
Not worth the trouble.

204
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,050
I'll give you 200,000.

205
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,840
Its parts are all discontinued,

206
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,040
and the wiring is old.

207
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,910
Parking it also costs money.

208
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,870
500,000.

209
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,720
What?

210
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,270
Are you crazy?

211
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,650
You're going to spend 500,000 to fix this car?

212
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,650
Binbin always wanted this car back then.

213
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,660
It took me a long time to find it.

214
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,240
I see.

215
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,230
I'll have it towed tomorrow

216
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,600
and keep it safe.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,260
I'll transfer the money to you tomorrow.

218
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,190
It's not about the money.

219
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
Back then, Tang Yaoxin came to me

220
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,540
and offered me 20 million to sell you out.

221
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,960
20 million.

222
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,080
I didn't take it.

223
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,270
That's not like you.

224
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,270
I'm not used to this side of you.

225
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,670
I'm not used to it either.

226
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,120
Go home now

227
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
and get some rest.

228
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,010
Go on.

229
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,320
Boss,

230
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,750
I know what's bothering you.

231
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,360
How about I kill Tang Yaoxin for you?

232
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,110
You can't do that.

233
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,910
I promised Officer Du.

234
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,340
I also promised Officer Du

235
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,680
that I’d be a better person.

236
00:12:59,310 --> 00:12:59,980
Go back now.

237
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,000
Boss.

238
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,540
You gave me my life.

239
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,330
You gave me 20 extra years.

240
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,590
If you want it back, it's yours anytime.

241
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,920
Get rid of that stuff.

242
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,120
Live a good life.

243
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,400
Binbin...

244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I've done my best.

245
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,240
Du.

246
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,810
Did you get the keys to the new apartment?

247
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,700
I did.

248
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,660
It's a pity—

249
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,270
just one point short, and it would’ve been a large two-bedroom apartment.

250
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,320
Hang in there for two more years,

251
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,200
and I'll transfer you here

252
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,830
and get you a large two-bedroom apartment.

253
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,720
I can't hang in there anymore.

254
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,510
Come on, just hang in there.

255
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,020
Thanks.

256
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,470
Come back, come back.

257
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,910
You missed a stroke.

258
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,270
Officer Du.

259
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,890
What are you doing here?

260
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,800
I came to see you.

261
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,030
I went to the new detention center earlier.

262
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,630
They said you're in charge of the relocation here.

263
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,630
In charge?

264
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,800
I'm about to retire.

265
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,840
I'm just here to help keep an eye on things.

266
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,670
So after this place is torn down,

267
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,930
what will happen here?

268
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,430
It's being allocated to a state-owned forest farm.

269
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,430
The plan is to turn it into a scenic conservation area.

270
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,490
They might even build a hotel here in the future.

271
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,210
Are you busy today?

272
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,270
I'm not busy at all.

273
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,630
Then let me keep you company.

274
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,920
[Yao Binbin]

275
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,420
Officer Du.

276
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,329
Officer Du.

277
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,160
I remember I used to live

278
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,420
in this cell back then.

279
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,870
I remember you being in that one over there.

280
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,920
No.

281
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,390
You remembered it wrong.

282
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,030
Binbin was in that one.

283
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,110
You were the one who personally sent him there.

284
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,320
When I was first assigned here,

285
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,240
the old correctional officers scared me,

286
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,370
saying being sent here

287
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,230
was like getting a life sentence.

288
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,760
I didn't quite get it at the time.

289
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,200
But now, in the blink of an eye,

290
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,800
I've spent half my life here.

291
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,880
Du Xiangdong.

292
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,600
A horse can run wild on the grasslands.

293
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,400
But here with me,

294
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,200
on this chessboard, the Horse

295
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,440
must move accordingly in a chess game.

296
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,370
Keep it as a memento.

297
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,950
[Horse]

298
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,370
Officer Du, your cooking is really good.

299
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,160
It's really delicious.

300
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Then eat more.

301
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,500
That was the best

302
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,330
pork trotter soup I've ever had in my life.

303
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,110
Officer Du,

304
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,270
Trust me!

305
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,510
We didn't kill anyone.

306
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,070
Xu Wenguo,

307
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
do you need me to do anything for you?

308
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,480
No need.

309
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,590
I've done my best.

310
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,640
Officer Du,

311
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,000
let's say goodbye here.

312
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,640
I came this time

313
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,990
to say goodbye to you.

314
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,490
I'm planning to leave here.

315
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,790
When will you be back?

316
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,550
You're not planning to leave for another 20 years, are you?

317
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,130
I don't know either.

318
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,580
I have something to leave for you.

319
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
I can't take it.

320
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,530
Your police officer ID.

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,730
It's time to give it back to you.

322
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,240
While I'm gone,

323
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,300
please take care of Ms. Cui for me.

324
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,550
Don't worry.

325
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,880
Alright, I'm leaving then.

326
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,840
Take care.

327
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,930
Officer Du, Officer Du!

328
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,440
The wall at the back collapsed.

329
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,520
Luckily, no one was hurt.

330
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
You should go and take a look.

331
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,680
Officer Du,

332
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,830
please sign here.

333
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,850
Here.

334
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,680
Okay, thank you.

335
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,840
Let's go. We're off work.

336
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,080
Let's go.

337
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,550
Officer Du,

338
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,000
this bank card is in your name,

339
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,110
and the password is your officer ID.

340
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,110
Please take care of Ms. Cui in her old age

341
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,210
and see her through to the end.

342
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,900
The rest of the money is yours.

343
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,430
I took your wallet back then.

344
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,280
Think of the extra as interest.

345
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,530
I came back this time

346
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,600
to clear Binbin's name

347
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,940
and fulfill his dream.

348
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,000
But I failed at both.

349
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,020
I want Tang Weimin and Tang Yaoxin

350
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,980
to pay with their lives for Binbin.

351
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,540
I've been watching them for 20 years.

352
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,770
I thought there was someone who could help me.

353
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,440
But later I realized

354
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,190
she would never stand up.

355
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,190
So, this path

356
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,880
ends here.

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,260
Xu Wenguo is going to commit suicide.

360
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,680
That's impossible.

361
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,000
Who told you that?

362
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,960
He didn't say he was going to die.

363
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,620
But I'm sure he's going to die!

364
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,020
I have this feeling!

[Bingo Repair Shop]

366
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,110
My brother's greatest dream

367
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,000
was to drive the first Crown in Banan City

368
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,080
and pick up that girl he never held hands with.

369
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,270
My greatest dream

370
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,170
was to make his dream come true.

371
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,310
I bought that Crown car.

372
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,060
