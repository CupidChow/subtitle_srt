00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,460
Do you know Liu Fenfang?

197
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,820
That's me.

198
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,440
So you're the one dating Du

199
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,370
from our center.

200
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,730
What a coincidence.

201
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,130
What are you moving here?

202
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,650
We're delivering pork to the center.

203
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,070
Mr. Li from your center

204
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,000
is my old acquaintance.

205
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,860
He told us

206
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,370
[Guesthouse]

207
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,550
to take away

208
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,830
the unused furniture.

209
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,070
So you don't need to arrange transport.

210
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,000
You're too kind.

211
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,880
Liu,

212
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,920
let me tell you a secret.

213
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,510
The center will allocate housing,

214
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,590
if you two get married,

215
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,670
you'll get a new place immediately.

216
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,810
Thank you, thank you.

217
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,740
You're welcome.

218
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:15,750
Let's go.

219
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,080
The engine won't start.

220
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,680
What's wrong with it?

221
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,080
Liu,

222
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,590
since you're already here,

223
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,590
why not visit Du?

224
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,720
Next time, okay?

225
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,730
I won't hold you up.

226
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,860
We should get going.

227
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,830
Come visit next time.

228
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,510
Okay, alright.

229
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,510
Let's go, move.

230
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,440
Hurry up.

231
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,850
Du,

232
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,570
this twice-cooked pork today, let me tell you.

233
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,630
It's so delicious.

234
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,000
Du?

235
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,070
Du?

236
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,440
Du?

237
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,850
Chief,

238
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,140
Du Xiangdong escaped!

239
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,570
Chief.

240
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,180
Chief.

241
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,040
Every time I trust you to guard someone, you fail!

242
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,650
When did you notice he was missing?

243
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,930
I just went to get food,

244
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
then he vanished.

245
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,070
This Detention Center isn't that big.

246
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,400
How could he disappear?

247
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,150
Where else could he hide?

248
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,030
Chief.

249
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,720
I swear I wasn't slacking off this time.

250
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,690
I even jogged to get the food,

251
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,550
I was just downstairs,

252
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,840
bumped into the beauty from the meat processing plant.

253
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,300
So I just chatted briefly.

254
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,440
What brings Liu Fenfang here?

255
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,100
Didn't you ask her to

256
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,070
move the furniture?

257
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,470
They came in a huge truck.

258
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,370
Take me to Mengcheng County.

259
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,660
What for?

260
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,830
Go to Chen Su'e's house to check on the crime scene.

261
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,950
Not today.

262
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,870
We're going somewhere else.

263
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,030
Where?

264
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,700
The Civil Affairs Bureau.

265
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,400
What for?

266
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,920
What else?

267
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,040
To get the certificate.

268
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,100
What certificate?

269
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,020
Marriage certificate.

270
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,290
Today's my 27th birthday.

271
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,510
I swore at my grandma's grave

272
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,070
to marry before turning 27.

273
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,680
So you've thought this through?

274
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,650
What do you mean, Du Xiangdong?

275
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,880
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

276
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,960
No.

277
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,430
I need to submit an application at the center.

278
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,030
Already handled.

279
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,450
You processed mine too?

280
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,240
Done.

281
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,130
I'm already dressed.

282
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,210
But I can't wear this to get married.

283
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,640
Relax,

284
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,510
I packed your uniform,

285
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,940
folded it nicely.

286
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,870
What's wrong?

287
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,690
Regretting it?

288
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,790
Always so confident,

289
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,290

About the title evaluation,

346
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,620
I did nominate you.

347
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,470
But they only approved one person.

348
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,490

349
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,480
Thank you, Chief.

350
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,280
I understand.

351
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,300
It's been nearly three years,

352
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,730
could you check again

353
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,350
if there's any way

354
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,750
to transfer me to the Criminal Police Team?

355
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,760
You know the situation here.

356
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,360
We're under the Municipal Bureau.

357
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,640
The Xu Wenguo case

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,170
still affects your record.

359
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,830
I know you caught someone.

360
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,500
But to the higher-ups,

361
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,710
it's barely atonement.

362
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,700
This title evaluation proves

363
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,380
transferring to the Criminal Police Team will be even harder.

364
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,970
Understood.

00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,510

How'd it go?

378
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,170
I didn't get it.

379
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,640
Might be for the best.

380
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,270
If I had gotten it,

381
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,720
I couldn't have left without guilt.

382
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,230

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,280

Don't serve rice.

385
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,170
I brought rice back.

388
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,330
it's no big deal.

389
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,110
Worthless.

390
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,580
Eat up.

391
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,590
I already brought back rice.

392
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,850
Why are you serving it?

393
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,160
Put it in the fridge.

394
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,620
Why are you off work early?

395
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,530
Slow day at the factory.

396
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,400
Last time you called,

397
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,720
you mentioned

398
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,380
having something to discuss.

399
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,640
Nothing important.

400
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,200
Have more.

401
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,920
Seriously, nothing?

402
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,960
My second sister,

403
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,160
remember her?

404
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,890
What about her?

405
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,340
Her German company

406
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,550
opened a branch here.

407
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,620
She said

408
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,880
if you'd join them,

409
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,130
they'll offer you a security department chief position.

410
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,930
You're familiar with the field.

411
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,340
It's easy workload,

412
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,370
The salary is five times higher.

413
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,570
Really 1,000 yuan?

414
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,230
No joke.

415
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,810
Look at you.

416
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,720
Stuck in this Detention Center.

417
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,110
When will it end?

418
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,470
Better jump ship now.

419
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,210
Forget the salary,

420
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,860
they'll rent us a downtown apartment with one-bedroom.

421
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,720
We already have a one-bedroom.

422
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,810
Not the same.

423
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,510
Yours is in the mountains.

424
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,080
What about when we have kids?

425
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
How to raise them?

426
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,650
What about schooling?

427
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,110
Dragging them around?

428
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,520
Besides,

429
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,110
living apart like this

430
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,240
isn't sustainable.

431
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,670
If you take this job,

432
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,200
all problems solved.

433
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,240
Am I right?

434
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,090
I serve the nation,

435
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,290
now you want me guarding capitalists?

436
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,920
My years wasted,

437
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,330
all for nothing.

438
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,960
You think you haven't been wasting your time?

439
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,650
You definitely did!

440
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,020
Look at your workplace—

441
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,370
harsh and exhausting,

442
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,480
no rewards,

443
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,720
daily humiliation.

444
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:50,630
What?

445
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,280
Who dares disrespect me?

446
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,680
Really?

447
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,030
You know the truth.

448
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,570
Think about it.

449
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,400
You think working for capitalists

450
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,660
means no humiliation?

451
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,570
What era is this?

452
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,910
Still capitalists vs. the state?

453
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,170
Our own happiness matters most.

454
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,160
Give me a straight answer.

455
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,420
Join my sister or not?

456
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,270
No.

457
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,380
Go yourself if you want.

458
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,550
Then sleep.

459
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,350
Don't touch me.

460
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,310
Not tonight!

461
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,070
Du Xiangdong,

462
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,520
you are worse than Xu Wenguo.

463
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,570
He dared escape,

464
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,280
you won't even run.

465
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,630
Liu Jun!

466
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,580
Li Wei!

467
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,830
The bulb's been broken for ages,

468
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,630
why didn't you tell me last time?

469
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,290
Don't bother replacing it.

470
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,500
I don't need light,

471
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,880
wastes electricity.

472
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,540
It's good.

473
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:18,550
It's fixed.

474
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,200
Wash your hair later.

475
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,130
I'm here to help.

476
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,780
Enough fussing.

477
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,070
The malted milk I brought last time,

478
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,200
why's it untouched?

479
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,730
I forgot about it.

480
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,700
It never crossed my mind.

481
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,200
Let me open it.

482
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,860
Remember to drink.

483
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,550
Du, you're here again.

484
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,550
Ms. Cui has a remittance form downstairs.

485
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,840
Go ask her to collect it.

486
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Okay, got it.

487
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,750
Okay.

488
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,670
There's a remittance downstairs.

489
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,960
Whose is it?

490
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,820
I don't know.

491
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:11,800
I'll go check.

492
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,560
Your ID's still in the usual spot?

493
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,320
Yes.

494
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,280
Hello, Uncle Du.

495
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,060
Liu Jun.

496
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,190
Du.

497
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,400
Li Wei.

498
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,590
Wang Lijuan.

499
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,800
I'm here to collect on behalf.

500
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,880
This is for Cui Lizhen.

501
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,010
Here.

502
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,850
Please sign here.

503
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:40,870
Right here.

504
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,280
Okay, thank you.

505
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,070
Thank you.

506
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,800
Wang Lijuan.

507
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,680
[Payee: Cui Lizhen]

508
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,680
[Wang Hongbing, Mutong County, Yunkang City]

509
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,590
Is Zhang Xiangyang here?

510
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,710
Officer Du.

511
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,960
I'll go call him.

512
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,710
Anyone seen Yang?

513
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:16,950
Over there.

514
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,480
Bro.

515
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,510
Bro.

516
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,440
Come on.

517
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,630
Someone's here for you.

518
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,230
Who is it?

519
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,920
Officer Du.

520
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,030
Xiangdong.

521
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,590
Off-duty today?

522
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,420
I need to discuss something.

523
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,010
Lazing around, sleeping?

524
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:39,890
Sit.

525
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,110
What's up?

526
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,680
I might have located Xu Wenguo.

527
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,400
Cui Lizhen lives alone now.

528
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,000
After Chen Su'e's death,

529
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,510
except me at No. 6 Factory,

530
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,550
no one's been in contact with her.

531
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,720
Think about it—

532
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,970
who'd send this much money?

533
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,510
Every family has rich relatives.

534
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,320
But she doesn't know Wang Hongbing,

535
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,510
and she has no relatives

536
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,480
in Yunkang.

537
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,760
No connection?

538
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,690
None whatsoever.

539
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,640
So I suspect

540
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,200
Wang Hongbing is Xu Wenguo.

541
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,680
Based on remittance dates

542
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
and locations,

543
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,440
he's likely hiding

544
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,670
around Yunkang.

545
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,030
Let's center our search here

546
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,510
and expand outward.

547
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,490
Screen the area.

548
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,070
We'll catch him.

549
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,450
Okay, I got it.

550
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,600
Wait, more to discuss.

551
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,940
What's your plan?

552
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,590
I'll notify the Joint Defense Office

553
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,070
to coordinate with local police.

554
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,190
No way. That won't work.

555
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:52,960
Why not?

556
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,710
Xu Wenguo's expert at evasion,

557
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,700
hence eluding capture for years.

558
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,030
Yunkang's

559
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,760
police resources and terrain

560
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,880
are unfamiliar.

561
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,710
By the time bureaucracy approves the operation,

562
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,910
he'll have vanished.

563
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,810
What's your solution?

564
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,610
How about this?

565
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,650
Listen,

566
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,120
we dispatch our own team.

567
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,690
Better if you lead.

568
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,290
And

569
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,440
if you need backup,

570
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,440
I can assist.

571
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,230
Confirm his identity first.

572
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,490
Don't rush the arrest.

573
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,230
Avoid alerting him.

574
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:21,840
Alright, I got it.

575
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,400
Prepare contingency plans.

576
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:22,800
I know,

577
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,300
here's my proposal.

578
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,320
I'll file an urgent report,

579
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,880
suspending all other cases.

580
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,480
Within half a month,

581
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,150
two homicide cases,

582
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:29,880
and a burglary case.

583
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,000
We ignore them.

584
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,840
From today,

585
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,710
Banan Municipal Public Security Bureau

586
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,180
focuses solely on Xu Wenguo's case.

587
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,910
Agreeable?

588
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,670
Sir, we're swamped!

589
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,180
Four sleepless nights!

590
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,270
I just caught a nap!

591
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,860
Talking now,

592
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,550
my throat's spitting sparks!

593
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,670
Xiangdong.

594
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,510
The case of No. 6 Factory has been closed.

595
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,030
Yao Binbin has been sentenced

596
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,070
and has executed.

597
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,280
Past priorities were past,

598
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,100
current urgencies matter now.

599
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,560
Clear, bro?

600
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,470
What are you doing here?

601
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,430
It's my personal car.

602
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,120
We've got leads on Xu Wenguo.

603
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,750
Who?

604
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,610
Xu Wenguo.

605
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,710
[Banan Meat Processing Plant]

606
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,680
Du.

607
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,980
What are you doing here?

608
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,580
If you're packing, hurry up.

609
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,550
Pack what?

610
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,960
I'm here to pick Liu Fenfang up from work.

611
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,800
Off work?

612
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,970
We've all been laid off!

613
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,630
I gotta go.

614
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,390
I've been persuading Fanfang

615
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,720
to tell you herself.

616
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,500
She promised days ago—

617
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,320
she'd definitely tell you.

618
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,000
I even accompanied her

619
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,340
to the market for nice meals.

620
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,450
I thought you already knew.

621
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
With no job, she's been

622
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,280
sitting in the park

623
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,760
all day long.

624
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,340
This isn't sustainable.

625
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,990
Talk some sense into her.

626
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,440
She's still young.

627
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,920
Being laid off isn't the end.

628
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,970

654
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,450

I didn't mean to hide it.

656
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,480
