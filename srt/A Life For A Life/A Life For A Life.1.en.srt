00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,080
Also,

192
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,550
you can take whatever you want

193
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
from these things in my room.

194
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,670
You're not going to take any of these things with you?

195
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,400
Except for that tape recorder.

196
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,150
What a waste of words.

197
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,600
Fatty San!

198
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,250
Fatty San!

199
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,200
Come out and buy fish!

200
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,220
Fatty San! Come out and buy fish!

201
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,810
What should we do, Boss?

202
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,720
Report it to the police.

203
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,010
Report it to the police.

204
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,340
Report it to the police!

205
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,860
If you leave,

206
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,440
our center won't meet the standards.

207
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,290
Chief,

208
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,180
I want to fight.

209
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,170
I can't hold it anymore.

210
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,890
How many times have I told you?

211
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,570
Focusing only on big things

212
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,940
is an impractical romantic notion.

213
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,680
Even the smallest tasks need someone to handle them.

214
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,040
Aren't there already people doing them?

215
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,940
It's not like I'm indispensable.

216
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,740
Du Xiangdong,

217
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,790
let's not discuss this today.

218
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,640
Let's talk about it after you work here for three years.

219
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,970
I've already worked here for three years.

220
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,190
Has it been three years already?

221
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,060
It's been more than that.

222
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,660
I've been here for three years and four months.

223
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,930
That was fast.

224
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,400
Then stay for another three years.

225
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,990
You have a college degree and ability.

226
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,650
Young men with ambitions do not speak of sorrow.

227
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,140
I'll get you a position as a section chief first.

228
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,250
How's everything going with that girl?

229
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,110
Treat her well.

230
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,130
She's the most beautiful girl in the Meat Processing Plant.

231
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,410
Assemble! Assemble!

232
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,800
No more free roaming!

233
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,100
Here, have one of mine.

234
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,580
Have a good one.

235
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,510
Here.

236
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,370
Let me be honest with you.

237
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,840
I really don't want you to leave.

238
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,270
Since you came, my life has become much easier.

239
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,770
I think

240
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,910
you are a...

241
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,230
You're a natural-born correctional officer.

242
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,910
If it really doesn't work out,

243
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,600
just stay here

244
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,440
and contribute to socialism at your post.

245
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,170
How about it?

246
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,130
There are new prisoners here. From the Municipal Bureau.

247
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,130
Let's go pick up the prisoner first.

248
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,060
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

249
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,800
Left, left,

250
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,010
left-right-left!

251
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,960
One, two, three, four!

252
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,560
One, two, three, four!

253
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,080
Left, left.

254
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,160
One, two, three, four!

255
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,810
One, two, three, four!

256
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,570
Officer Wu, Officer Du.

257
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,890
I'm going to the restroom.

258
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,800
Now?

259
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,850
Du Xiangdong!

260
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,030
Come down.

261
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,050
It looked like you.

262
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,610
Long time no see.

263
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,760
Slow down. Wait for me.

264
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,780
How long has it been since we last met?

265
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,960
Since graduation, it has been...

266
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,369
Three years and four months.

267
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,099
How have you been lately?

268
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,240
This workplace is not bad.

269
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,130
The environment in the mountains is great.

270
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,130
Most importantly, the air is fresh.

271
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,850
It's not like where we are.

272
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,610
This Yao Binbin

273
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,870
is suspected of theft.

274
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,170
This Xu Wenguo

275
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,480
is suspected of intentional injury

276
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,400
and theft.

277
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,960
Stand up.

278
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,650
Move inside.

279
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,330
[First Prize at the Police Academy]

280
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,620
Why don't you ever come to our class reunions?

281
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,680
I'm busy.

282
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,040
Busy?

283
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,810
Can you really be busier than us in the Criminal Police Team?

284
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,930
This weekend, I'm meeting up with some of the guys.

285
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,760
They're leaders now.

286
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,090
If you're free, join us.

287
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,790
I can't make it.

288
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,850
Why?

289
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,890
It's too far for us to come from the mountains to the city.

290
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,620
Well, I'll get back to work now.

291
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,470
Give me back my pen!

292
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,630
Master, why did you even bother with him?

293
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,800
Everyone, stand to the side.

294
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,760
Hurry up!

295
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,570
Keep moving.

296
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,370
What are you looking at? Move it.

297
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,050
Binbin.

298
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,280
I told you to move.

299
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:39,770
Move!

300
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,730
Don't push him!

301
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,170
Don't move.

302
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,280
Mind your own business.

303
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,010
Turn around.

304
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:43,930
What are you doing?

305
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,850
Are your legs shaking?

306
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,130
Hurry up and get up.

307
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,670
Binbin.

308
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,020
I told you to stand up.

309
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,020
I told you to stand up. Did you hear me?

310
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,090
Stand up!

311
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:52,890
What's wrong?

312
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,680
He's being stubborn.

313
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,930
If you have anything to say, just say it.

314
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,990
What's the matter?

315
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,750
I shouldn't be here.

316
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,700
You shouldn't be here?

317
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,280
Then who should be here?

318
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,480
Should I be here?

319
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,170
Get up.

320
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,330
Don't let people look down on you.

321
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,390
Get up by yourself.

322
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,350
Binbin.

323
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,310
Get up.

324
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,590
Get up.

325
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,890
Get up!

326
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,570
Don't touch his hand!

327
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,320
Let go!

328
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,580
Don't touch my brother!

329
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,520
Stand properly!

330
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,720
What are you looking at?

331
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,750
Got a problem?

332
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,860
Bro, please don't touch his hand!

333
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,830
-His hand is injured.
-Who is your bro?

334
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,890
Call me Officer Du!

335
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,210
Officer, I'm sorry!

336
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,970
Don't touch my brother!

337
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,610
Squat down!

338
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,500
Everyone, squat down against the wall!

339
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,130
Hurry up!

340
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,740
Are you alright?

341
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,410
Go!

342
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:58,930
Are you okay?

343
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,300
Your moves were not bad.

344
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,810
With those two moves today,

345
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,680
I can tell you majored in criminal investigation.

346
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,610
Are you alright?

347
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,090
What could possibly be wrong with me?

348
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,930
Is he alright?

349
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,720
He's fine.

350
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,430
But this guy is quite something.

351
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,130
You gave him a taste of your authority as soon as he arrived.

352
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,330
You did the right thing.

353
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,280
What did he do?

354
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,040
He knocked down the son of the director

355
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,850
of No. 6 Factory.

356
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,180
Quite fierce, isn't he?

357
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,120
Why?

358
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,070
Seems like it was because of a girl.

359
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,920
The younger one is even more unbelievable.

360
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,050
He stole the only Crown car in our city.

361
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,840
What step are they at in the procedure?

362
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,570
As usual, shaving their heads.

363
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,350
Your watch!

364
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,300
I shouldn't be here.

365
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,690
028, Yao Binbin.

366
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,130
Cell 13.

367
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,350
Be gentle.

368
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,540
Come here.

369
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,250
Don't move.

370
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,370
He's 028. He's new here.

371
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,760
He'll be sleeping on bunk 2.

372
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,890
His hand is injured.

373
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,840
You can go now.

374
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,120
-Not bad, kid.
-Not bad.

375
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,370
What are you doing?

376
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,410
Stop gathering here!

377
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,410
Let's go.

378
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,900
If you bully the new guy—

379
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,120
I'm telling you—

380
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,200
I'll make you sit here until your butts rot.

381
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Do you believe me?

382
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,280
Do you believe me?

383
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,170
Yes, yes, yes.

384
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,440
If there's a problem, call the correctional officers.

385
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,320
Shameless.

386
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,500
Let's go.

387
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,140
Number 29,

388
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,860
Xu Wenguo.

389
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:33,910
Cell 14.

390
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,610
One, two, three,

391
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,370
go!

392
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,370
Come back.

393
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,220
Hurry up, stand properly.

394
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,860
Stand properly, everyone.

395
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,960
He's 029, the new guy.

396
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,530
They've told you the rules, right?

397
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,840
According to the rules, new guys have to start by sleeping on the edge of the bed.

398
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,640
Go over there.

399
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,650
Give me your hand.

400
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,670
That one.

401
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:25,900
Turn it over.

402
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Lower your voice.

403
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,610
Bro,

404
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,500
how did you end up here?

405
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,150
What a pretty face.

406
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,130
What a shame.

407
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,350
Do you care about him?

408
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,240
Stop it.

409
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,670
Why are you laughing?

410
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,310
What's your name?

411
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,680
Brother San is asking you.

412
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,880
Who told you to speak?

413
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,470
If you keep talking, I'll knock your teeth out.

414
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,470
What's your name?

415
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,260
Xu Wenguo.

416
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,330
Disperse.

417
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,330
Disperse.

418
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,720
Disperse. Move.

419
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,490
You're from No. 6 Factory?

420
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,440
Pao.

421
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,150
Brother San.

422
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,730
Pack up my bedding

423
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,450
and move it back.

424
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,020
You sleep on the first bunk.

425
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,670
It's more spacious

426
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,880
and cleaner.

427
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:55,880
Hurry up.

428
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,890
Do it quickly.

429
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,940
Where was the body found?

430
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,500
The reservoir in Majia Slope, Wuyu Town.

431
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,930
Is the victim's identity confirmed?

432
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,930
Yes.

433
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,330
It was Li Chao, the workshop supervisor of No. 6 Factory.

434
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,440
The middle and ring fingers of the right hand are missing.

435
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,090
There are burning marks on the base of the palm.

436
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,520
The entry wound shows a circular shape.

437
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,720
The skin around the wound shows

438
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,860
petal-like abrasions, a form of structural damage.

439
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,720
Cause of death?

440
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,520
Excessive blood loss after a gunshot.

441
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,780
We found a bullet casing at the scene.

442
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,120
Also, we found some

443
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,470
fragments of the bullet

444
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,330
from Li Chao's body

445
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,240
and the soil by the river.

446
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,330
So, according to our speculation,

447
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,850
it is likely that the weapon used by the killer

448
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,180
was a homemade shotgun.

449
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,610
I think

450
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,240
the murderer

451
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,170
is very likely to be

452
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,960
an insider from No. 6 Factory,

453
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,570
who used the factory's resources

454
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:51,910
to make a gun

455
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,360
and commit murder.

456
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,280
Therefore, I suggest that

457
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,810
we focus our investigation

458
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,960
on No. 6 Factory.

459
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,970
[No. 6 Factory]

460
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,230
Officer Du!

461
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,090
Nobody move.

462
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,370
Officer Du.

463
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,430
Who told you to sleep here?

464
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,850
Government,

465
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,690
he's injured.

466
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,760
We should take care of him.

467
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,360
And according to our party's policy…

468
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,980
Do you think you know the party's policy better than I do?

469
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,580
I see.

470
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,600
Go back to your own place.

471
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,640
Move over, come on.

472
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,240
Move it to my place. Hurry up.

473
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,140
Go to sleep.

474
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,440
Go to sleep now.

475
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,470
Go to sleep.

476
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,100
Yes.

477
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,240
You actually got a car?

478
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,010
They give you a car for your meritorious service?

479
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,290
No matter how much merit I've earned, I'm not worthy of a car.

480
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,130
It just happened that I was about to go on a field assignment. I kind of tagged along.

481
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,810
I'm glad I didn't ride my bike today.

482
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,010
This place is too far.

483
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,590
It's alright.

484
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,280
It only takes me three and a half hours by bike.

485
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,520
Du Xiangdong, you're quite interesting.

486
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,370
I'm a forensic doctor,

487
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,640
dealing with corpses every day.

488
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,440
You asked me to treat a living person.

489
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
Am I supposed to treat him like a corpse?

490
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,970
Well, you're experienced.

491
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,520
Besides,

492
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,930
I don't know any doctors.

493
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,770
Come on.

494
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,570
Please.

495
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,130
Come on. Be gentle.

496
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,100
Alright.

497
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,010
Wrap it up.

498
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,680
Apply some ointment and wrap it up.

499
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,210
Hou.

500
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
Wrap it up for him.

501
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,690
Who was that doctor just now?

502
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,040
A forensic doctor.

503
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,540
What's his condition?

504
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,280
What's your relationship with him?

505
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,170
Nothing.

506
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,420
He's just a regular detainee.

507
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,850
Even if there was a relationship between you two, it wouldn't change anything.

508
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,910
His hand is ruined.

509
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,760
His right thumb and palm bones

510
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,640
are crushed.

511
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,110
He's basically lost the ability to work.

512
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,130
So, can this kid work after he gets out?

513
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,090
It depends on the type of work.

514
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:51,860
He can forget about

515
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,660
skilled work.

516
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,240
I advise you not to get involved.

517
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,440
Once the case is over,

518
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,890
he will be transferred to prison.

519
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,420
By then, how they will handle it will be up to the prison's rules.

520
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,240
Du!

521
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,240
The machine in the labor room is broken.

522
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,420
Wu is calling you to take a look.

523
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,610
What's the use of calling me?

524
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,650
I don't know how to fix it.

525
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,570
You're the intellectual among us.

526
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,200
Hurry up.

527
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,500
Wu is waiting for you.

528
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,280
Alright.

529
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,930
Um... Officer Du,

530
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,960
I can fix it.

531
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,490
It's none of your business.

532
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,720
I really can.

533
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,970
What's going on?

534
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,040
Sir,

535
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,340
if there are any technical problems,

536
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:02,970
you can tell him.

537
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,300
He knows better than us.

538
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,800
Let me explain this to you.

539
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,210
This is a product from the 1950s, a Soviet-style imitation.

540
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,429
It should have been phased out long ago.

541
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,830
It's already scrapped.

542
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,330
Can this part be fixed?

543
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:15,409
It can't.

544
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,440
The only option is to replace the part.

545
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,409
Alright.

546
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,440
How much?

547
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,790
This part is not available domestically.

548
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:23,239
Unless you go to the Soviet Union.

549
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,770
I can go to the Soviet Union.

550
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,940
Tovarishch, nichevo khorosho.

551
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,130
You're not going to the Soviet Union.

552
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,130
I wish I could go.

553
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:29,989
Officer.

554
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,810
This can be fixed.

555
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,260
Can the lathe be disassembled?

556
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,409
Can it?

557
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,170
Yes, I think.

558
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,510
It's already scrapped.

559
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,560
Just give it a try. It can't be worse.

560
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:42,929
Go.

561
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,120
But my hands aren't up to it.

562
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,250
I need a helper.

563
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:47,760
Who?

564
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:48,560
My brother,

565
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:50,570
Xu Wenguo.

566
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,850
Xu Wenguo!

567
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,560
Here.

568
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,080
Go ahead.

569
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:54,910
Have a seat.

570
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,850
This is a special approval from the Chief,

571
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,730
a reward for your performance yesterday.

572
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,660
Try my cooking.

573
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,810
Pork trotter soup.

574
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,620
Braised pork trotters.

575
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,010
And Cold pork tendon salad.

576
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,190
Enjoy.

577
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,290
Officer Du, you're amazing.

578
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,500
You must have relatives working at the meat factory.

579
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,480
Stop talking so much.

580
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,410
Hurry up and eat.

581
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,510
Don't get too picky with your food.

582
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,970
You'll be eating steamed buns in the future.

583
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,890
What are you waiting for?

584
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,890
Waiting for wine?

585
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,670
Officer Du, your cooking is really good.

586
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,040
Just eat.

587
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,250
Officer Du, come and eat with us.

588
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,250
You guys eat.

589
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,290
It's really delicious.

590
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,490
Then eat more.

591
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,940
Du, Du.

592
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,390
I barely touched it,

593
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,220
and it just got stuck by itself.

594
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,480
What's this?

595
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,080
This is my tape recorder.

596
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,600
Who allowed you to touch it?

597
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,890
My wife came to see me.

598
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,520
And you weren't there,

599
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,000
so I took it to listen to it.

600
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,930
I didn't expect

601
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,410
it would end up like this.

602
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,410
Tell me the truth.

603
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
Did you upset your wife again,

604
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,960
and she smashed my thing?

605
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:43,770
Look.

606
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,410
What?

607
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,740
The screws are all here.

608
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,650
I'll pay you for it.

609
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,410
Forget it, forget it.

610
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,910
You ate it all.

611
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,970
I saved you a little.

612
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,290
Since you are here, take a look.

613
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,210
Can it be fixed?

614
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,530
These parts can't be reassembled.

615
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,680
Let me try.

616
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,770
The screws are all here.

617
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,030
He said the tape got stuck inside.

618
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,120
Hold this panel.

619
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,700
Don't move.

620
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,120
Can you fix it? If not, forget it.

621
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,950
Don't worry.

622
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,970
Trust my brother.

623
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:37,650
Press it down.

624
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,870
Look at the bottom.

625
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,720
It's stuck in here.

626
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,320
Loosen it.

627
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,760
Right.

628
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,690
Did it come out?

629
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,120
With skills like that,

630
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,430
what can't you do?

631
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,890
I was wrongfully accused.

632
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,690
Cut the crap.

633
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,330
You were caught red-handed.

634
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,660
Still trying to deny it?

635
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,680
Then I won't say anything.

636
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,440
What about intentional injury?

637
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,410
You broke the factory director's son's finger.

638
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,470
Well, I did hit him.

639
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,410
I admit that.

640
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,140
You two are still young.

641
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,730
And you have such skills.

642
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,140
After you're sentenced,

643
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,340
behave well in prison

644
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,440
and try to earn a reduced sentence.

645
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,300
Officer Du,

646
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,410
my brother and I just want to use our skills

647
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,320
to earn money to treat our mother's illness

648
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,780
and give her a better life.

649
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:43,930
Done?

650
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,440
See if it can play music.

651
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,170
Give it a try.

652
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,740
Not bad, you two.

653
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,210
After you're out,

654
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,410
if you need anything,

655
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,900
you can always come to me.

656
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,420
Thank you, Officer Du.

657
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,560
Your case isn't serious.

658
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:30,980
You won't be sentenced for long.

659
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:38,400
♫You said I'm like a cloud, elusive and unpredictable♫

660
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,830
Don't carry too much mental burden.

661
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:44,650
♫Actually you don't understand me♫

662
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:49,590
♫You said I'm like a dream♫

663
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,320
♫Sometimes far, sometimes near♫

664
00:40:54,530 --> 00:41:01,890
♫Actually you don't understand me♫

665
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,650
♫You said I'm like a riddle♫

666
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,600
Officer Du,

667
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,440
Zhang Xiangyang from the Criminal Police Team is here to see you.

668
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,120
He's waiting at the registration office.

669
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,930
Okay, I got it.

670
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,110
You guys put it back on.

671
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:27,860
Why are you here?

672
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,120
Looking for me?

673
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,770
It's nothing. I just want to have a quick word with you.

674
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,370
What is it?

675
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,690
Those two guys from No. 6 Factory I brought in last time—

676
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,090
how have they been doing?

677
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,340
Xu Wenguo,

678
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,560
Yao Binbin.

679
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:43,410
I know.

680
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,620
They've been fine. Why?

681
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,940
There's been a murder at No. 6 Factory.

682
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,020
We can now confirm it was these two guys who did it.

683
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,510
Keep a close eye on them for me.
