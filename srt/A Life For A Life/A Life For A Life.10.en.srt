[Chapter 10: Liu Guangcai's Confession]

18
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,710
Hello, everyone.

19
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,640
My name is Liu Guangcai.

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,590
I'm 39 years old.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,130
Former head of the Security Department at No. 6 Factory.

22
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,430
Li Chao—

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,710
I killed him.

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,579
After that happened,

25
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,960
I was filled with regret

26
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,190
and pain.

27
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,520
I kept reflecting on it.

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,400
Later, I realized

29
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,520
the conflict between us

30
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,450
probably started

31
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,200
when the old factory director was stepping down,

32
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,470
and they needed to promote

33
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,280
one of us middle managers

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,840
to take over as the new director.

35
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,510
Chief Li.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,820
You're here.

37
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,310
You're looking for me?

38
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,390
There's something I want to ask you.

39
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,230
Someone reported me.

40
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,310
Really?

41
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,170
They accused me of embezzlement.

42
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,150
I had the Security Department look into it,

43
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,710
and I got my hands on the report letter.

44
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,470
It was your

45
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,220
apprentice who wrote it.

46
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,079
Alright.

47
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,270
I'll have a talk with him.

48
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,380
Chief Li,

49
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,000
I think the competition

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,540
for the factory director should be fair and open.

51
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,120
Shouldn't we avoid

52
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,870
playing tricks behind each other's backs?

53
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,000
Mr. Liu.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,150
I started from the bottom

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,000
and worked my way here.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,140
It took me 25 years.

57
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,750
And you?

58
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,310
Your whole family works at this factory.

59
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,040
Your parents are technicians,

60
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:57,050
but they were sent here for re-education.

61
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,740
Do you think you're on my level?

62
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,790
You're already very lucky to be the head

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,000
of the Security Department.

64
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,330
You should be grateful and content.

65
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,680
I'd wanted to kill him

66
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,630
for a long, long time.

67
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,510
Liu Guangcai,

68
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,630
you pissed me off.

69
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,350
You know that?

70
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,470
I just wanted him dead.

71
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,490
You'd better pray I never become the factory director.

72
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,800
Every morning I opened my eyes,

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
I wanted him dead.

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,190
If I really become the factory director…

75
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,510
It was like I was possessed.

76
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,200
I'll serve your parents,

77
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,560
take care of your wife,

78
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,159
and raise your kid right for you.

79
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,230
Don't worry.

80
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,350
If I don't treat your whole family well,

81
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,950
then I won't be Li Chao.

82
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,790
Actually, I wasn't afraid of him at all.

83
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,510
But I knew

84
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,160
I had to act immediately.

85
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,800
Because when Li Chao actually got that position,

86
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,400
he'd definitely come for me.

87
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,430
But

88
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,040
dealing with someone like Li Chao

89
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,370
took more than impulse.

90
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,950
I needed help.

91
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,360
And right then…

92
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,480
two idiots showed up.

93
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,159
To me,

94
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,830
your mom is a bus that everyone can ride.

95
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,240
And she's the crappiest one out there.

96
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,370
What are you saying?

97
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,070
Li Chao!

98
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,800
Come here.

99
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,590
Let go!

100
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,580
Say that again.

101
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,920
Say that again!

102
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,760
They managed to get my attention.

103
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,360
And soon,

104
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,830
I discovered a secret.

105
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,750
Stop.

106
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,240
Take it out.

107
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,500
Take what out?

108
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,630
You know what I'm talking about.

109
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,890
There's nothing on me.

110
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,800
Nothing.

111
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,110
There's nothing.

112
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,640
I swear…

113
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,230
I swear there's nothing.

114
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,560
Yao Binbin,

115
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,030
this isn't the first time

116
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,830
you've stolen from the factory.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,860
What exactly are you trying to do?

118
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,430
Yao Binbin was stealing seamless steel pipes.

119
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,159
Right then and there,

120
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,870
I had a strong gut feeling—

121
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,120
he was making a gun

122
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,730
to kill someone.

123
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,150
Mr. Liu.

124
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,960
Mr. Liu.

125
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:09,720
Mr. Liu.

126
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,600
What's the matter?

127
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,790
Yao Binbin, Xu Wenguo,

128
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,630
and Director Tang's son

129
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,120
got into a fight at the pool hall.

130
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,650
Yao Binbin pulled out a gun.

131
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,250
Yao Binbin pulled out a gun?

132
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,660
Just as I expected.

133
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,680
Anyone hurt?

134
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,460
No.

135
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,830
The pool hall owner said the gun didn't go off.

136
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,720
With that—

137
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,310
I had to help him.

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
Didn't you promise

139
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,120
you'd only take it out

140
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,850
if that jerk insulted

141
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,730
our mom again?

142
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,570
If I hadn't removed the firing pin,

143
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,300
you'd be in deep trouble today.

144
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,460
Sorry, Wenguo.

145
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,360
Go home.

146
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,310
I came up with a plan.

147
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,720
First,

148
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,050
I needed to find the fake gun Yao Binbin made.

149
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,560
Everyone, stay alert about theft.

150
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,110
Our factory's security is top-notch.

151
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,040
Lock your doors.

152
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,240
Every family sleeps with doors unlocked.

153
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,270
No one picks up lost items on the road.

154
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,190
If you go out, lock your door.

155
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,250
Everyone leaves a spare key outside—

156
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,240
just in case.

157
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,000
I found the gun.

158
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,120
What I needed to do next

159
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,910
was give it a firing pin.

160
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,390
Next,

161
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,680
I had to create

162
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,030
an opportunity

163
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,630
for Yao Binbin to fire this gun.

164
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,040
Chief Li?

165
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,440
Chief Li?

166
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,480
It's me.

167
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,840
Chief Li,

168
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,080
are you going fishing?

169
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,790
Yes.

170
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,740
Come, have some tea.

171
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,960
No, thanks.

172
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,150
I came here

173
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,440
to talk to you about something.

174
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,330
Yao, why don't you…

175
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,150
Master, I'll wait for you outside.

176
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,840
Alright.

177
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,400
Okay.

178
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,180
Sit, sit.

179
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,860
Congratulations in advance.

180
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,120
I heard that the position of factory director

181
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,320
is surely yours.

182
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,380
After we talked last time,

183
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,060
everything clicked for me.

184
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,200
Really?

185
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,980
Yes.

186
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,390
Moreover,

187
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,800
I'll need to work hard

188
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,380
under your leadership in the future.

189
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,760
That's more like it.

190
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,770
The more you want to take someone down,

191
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,910
the more you need to make them trust you.

192
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,510
Best if you can even pass as a friend.

193
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,650
You're so young,

194
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,150
exactly what our factory needs.

195
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,970
Work hard.

196
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,740
Your future is bright.

197
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:10,840
I...

198
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,360
Thank you, Director.

199
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,150
Thank you, Director.

200
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,840
Bit too early for that.

201
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,770
It's not proper.

202
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,030
The appointment hasn't been finalized yet.

203
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,910
You're

204
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,550
heading out to fish soon?

205
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,840
Leaving in a bit.

206
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,750
Going alone?

207
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,630
Yeah.

208
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,910
Let me go with you.

209
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,920
No need.

210
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,000
Fishing isn't hunting wolves.

211
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,900
Going alone keeps the mind calm.

212
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,750
He was going alone.

213
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,550
That was perfect.

214
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,930
To get Yao Binbin to make a move,

215
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,450
I had to work on Cui Lizhen.

216
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,550
You and Chief Li

217
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,480
have a special connection, right?

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,060
This time,

219
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,770
I don't know why,

220
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,890
but Chief Li insists on adding you

221
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,270
and Xu Wenguo

222
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,990
to the layoff list.

223
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,260
I can't understand it either.

224
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,370
Maybe you should

225
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,270
have a word with him in private.

226
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:12,790
No.

227
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,080
If there's any conflict,

228
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,600
you two can try to talk it out.

229
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,490
Your two sons

230
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,320
often have conflicts with Chief Li.

231
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
If something really happens,

232
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,270
how is the Security Department

233
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,480
supposed to handle it?

234
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,600
Where is that jerk now?

235
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,120
I'll go find him right away

236
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,600
-to make it clear to him!
-Calm down, Ms. Cui.

237
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,550
I've been working here for decades…

238
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,720
I mean well.

239
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,790
I mean well. You…

240
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,510
Ms. Cui.

241
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,300
Ms. Cui?

242
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,420
Ms. Cui?

243
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,240
Ms. Cui!

244
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,990
Cui Lizhen was so cooperative.

245
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,760
Binbin, Binbin!

246
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,000
Mr. Liu,

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,800
what's wrong?

248
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,640
You need to

249
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,040
go to the hospital now.

250
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,720
Your mom collapsed.

251
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,630
What happened to my mom?

252
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,420
Li Chao,

253
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,320
Chief Li,

254
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,550
put your mother and brother

255
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,790
on the layoff list.

256
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,050
Where's Li Chao?

257
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,330
He's fishing at the reservoir.

258
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,600
Li Chao!

259
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,550
Why did you put my mom

260
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,770
and brother on the layoff list?

261
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,880
Your brother's business

262
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,020
is none of your concern.

263
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,270
As for your mom, tell her to come see me herself

264
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,680
after she scrubs up real nice.

265
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,740
I'll blow your brains out right here!

266
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,000
I overestimated the power of that gun.

267
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,000
Li Chao

268
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,940
wasn't killed on the spot.

269
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,630
Brat.

270
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,630
How...

271
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,040
How dare you shoot me?

272
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,910
Stop there!

273
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,480
Actually, Binbin

274
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,790
had already done everything for me.

275
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,460
I shouldn't have stepped in again.

276
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,450
I should have just stayed there

277
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,930
and waited for Li Chao to die slowly.

278
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,000
But that night,

279
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,520
I was too impulsive.

280
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,870
It was like I was possessed.

281
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,200
Chief Li.

282
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,300
Chief Li, are you alright?

283
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,670
Chief Li?

284
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,680
What happened to you?

285
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,800
Come on.

286
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,870
Are you okay?

287
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,000
What happened to you?

288
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,480
You'll be fine.

289
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,030
You'll be fine.

290
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,410
You'll be fine.

291
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,060
You'll be fine.

292
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,100
At that moment…

293
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,000
I couldn't tell if I was hallucinating

294
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,060
or if there really was someone there.

295
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,670
My mind was a mess.

296
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,290
According to the plan,

297
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,840
I should've gone straight to the repair shop

298
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,770
and caught Yao Binbin with the gun.

299
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,250
But for some inexplicable reason…

300
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,620
I went back to the staff dormitory first.

301
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,390
It was her.

302
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,270
The one who ran off from the reservoir

303
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,330
must have been her.

304
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,030
That was my first instinct

305
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,430
when I saw Chen Su'e at the staff dormitory.

306
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,400
She saw me.

307
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,950
I really didn't see clearly.

308
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,900
I...

309
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
I chased after him.

310
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,890
Yao Binbin ran very fast.

311
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,240
I wasn't as fast as him

312
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,970
and failed to catch up with him.

313
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,859
When I reached the reservoir,

314
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,160
I heard a loud bang…

315
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,130
and then the guy fell down.

316
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,140
So you saw Yao Binbin

317
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,300
shoot and kill Li Chao,

318
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,550
right?

319
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,200
I knew she was terrified,

320
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,220
but at that moment,

321
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,200
I was even more nervous than her.

322
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,200
Whether to kill Chen Su'e or not—

323
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,050
I wanted her to make that decision herself.

324
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:53,900
Aunt Chen,

325
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,840
you've told us this

326
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,970
because you put justice above family.

327
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,350
We'll protect you.

328
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,650
I heard

329
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,920
the surgery you had a few years ago

330
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,660
cost over 30,000 yuan and still

331
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,060
hasn't been reimbursed.

332
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,660
I've reported this situation

333
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,070
to the factory.

334
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,210
We'll cover 10,000 yuan for you first,

335
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,200
alright?

336
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,960
To be honest,

337
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,200
I kept hesitating

338
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,190
whether to kill Chen Su'e or not.

339
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,100
She's weak

340
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,440
and easy to control.

341
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,190
For a while,

342
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,760
I completely gave up

343
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,250
on the idea of killing her.

344
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,460
But that prison guard,

345
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,960
Du Xiangdong,

346
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,270
came to the factory again and again.

347
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,720
Step back!

348
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,550
What are you doing?

349
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,810
And the real firing pin

350
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,660
was eventually found.

351
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,880
That was when everything

352
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
started slipping out of my control.

353
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,990
More surprisingly…

354
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,280
[Attached: photo of Xu Wenguo]

355
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,210
Xu Wenguo broke out of prison.

356
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,000
He was definitely

357
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,230
going to look for Chen Su'e.

358
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,550
I had to get to her first.

359
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,110
Mr. Liu,

360
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,670
what brings you here?

361
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,720
I heard you're not feeling well.

362
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,690
We at the factory have been worried.

363
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,510
The director asked me to check on you.

364
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,110
These are some gifts for you.

365
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,680
No need, no need.

366
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,760
I'm in good health.

367
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,190
Thanks for your concern.

368
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,840
Last time,

369
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,590
you got 10,000 yuan

370
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,900
for your medical expenses, right?

371
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,650
I talked to my superiors again,

372
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,120
and the director sent me

373
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,920
to bring you the remaining

374
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,060
20,000 yuan.

375
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,160
It's not convenient to talk here.

376
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,890
Let's talk inside.

377
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,110
I'm just here

378
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,790
on behalf of the factory to deliver the money.

379
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,090
Please write me a receipt.

380
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,510
I've got to hurry back.

381
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,240
Okay.

382
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,590
The receipt is for the factory?

383
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,530
Yes.

384
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,410
Also,

385
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,070
the director told me to pass on a message.

386
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,000
He said you don't need

387
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
to worry about anything.

388
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,720
Just focus on getting better

389
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,530
and come back to work as soon as you can.

390
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,810
In two more years,

391
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,560
you'll be able to retire and receive a pension.

392
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,330
Please thank the director for me.

393
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,030
No need for that.

394
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,200
We're all family at No. 6 Factory.

395
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,040
This is just

396
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,070
what we should do!

397
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,830
After Chen Su'e was taken care of,

398
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,240
next up was Xu Wenguo.

399
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,510
I knew that guy very well.

400
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,270
He was a bookworm

401
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,880
and a thinker.

402
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,160
Not easy to deal with.

403
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,960
My men told me

404
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,790
Cui Lizhen received a remittance slip.

405
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,560
Du Xiangdong seemed to have picked up on something.

406
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,930
In this world,

407
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,900
the one who wanted to find Xu Wenguo more than I did

408
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,900
was Du Xiangdong.

409
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,940
As long as he was alive,

410
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,930
he'd keep trying to overturn Yao Binbin's case.

411
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,240
I had to get rid of him.

412
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,800
I once asked Zheng Sanchuang

413
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,750
to take care of Xu Wenguo in prison.

414
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,480
I realized

415
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,010
he was about to be released.

416
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,000
I've confessed everything.

417
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,780

418
00:23:59,230 --> 00:23:59,960
and Chen Su'e

419
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,420
and pinning it on Xu Wenguo and Yao Binbin—

420
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,380
it was all me.

421
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,720
I'm sorry, guys.

422
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,900
I dragged you down with me.

423
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,810
They were just errand boys.

424
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,660
I accept any legal judgment

425

against me.

426
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,510
My only request

427
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,120
is that the leaders of No. 6 Factory

428
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,890
treat my family well.

429

I've worked at No. 6 Factory my whole life.

You've all seen my performance.

431

to live again,

433
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,280
I'd definitely leave

434
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,620
and see the outside world.

Yao Binbin's case.

441

for his family?

Mr. Su,

447
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,330
in Yao Binbin's case,

448
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,930
we hold no responsibility.

449
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,360
First, there was no forced confession.

450
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,720
He confessed on his own.

451
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,460
The evidence chain was complete too.

452
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,630
And besides,

453
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,310
he really did make a gun, fire it,

454
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,310

455

Those are all facts.

457
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,890
He had multiple offenses against him.

458
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,820
But he didn't know it was a real gun,

459
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,350
nor did he know there were real bullets inside.

460
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,940
He had no intent to kill.

461
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,550
No matter what,

462
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,170
I made the arrest

and conducted the interrogation.

464

Why do you sound so guilty?

Say that again.

468
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,530
I made the arrest

469

and conducted the interrogation.

470

be it a serious demerit

472

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,720
Once it's done, I won't come back here.

522
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,160
Move aside!

523
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,920
Please put them down.

524
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,790
I know what you mean.

525
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,720
What's going on?

526
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,440
-Xiangyang.
-Where are you taking those things?

527
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,620
Aren't you Captain Zhang from the Criminal Police Team?

528
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,550
Nice to meet you.

529
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,160
What's going on?

530
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,220
It started raining, so I set up a tarp.

531
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,990
But she's occupying public space.

532
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,440
It's against the rules.

533
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,640
We've warned her so many times.

534
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,220
It's not easy for ordinary folks to make a living.

535
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,250
Give her a break.

536
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,610
Understood, understood.

537
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,640
So how about

538
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,470
we eat something together?

539
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,200
Come on, sit down.

540
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,530
No need, Captain Zhang.

541
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,550
You don't want anything?

542
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,070
If you haven't taken it down by tomorrow,

543
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,640
we'll confiscate everything.

544
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,200
Alright.

545
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,350
This is the last warning.

546
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,480
Okay.

547
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,220
Xiangyang, sit down.

548
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:23,690
Sit.

549
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,550
Xiangyang, what do you want to eat?

550
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,480
Bring me a glass

551
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,230
and a trotter soup.

552
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,190
Alright.

553
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,520
Here you go.

554
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,200
Take your time.

555
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,060
Call me if you need anything else.

556
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,070
Mi's martyr title got approved.

557
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,070
His wife asked me to thank you

558
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,330
for testifying for him

559
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,640
and proving that he was indeed innocent.

560
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,640
Mi was a great criminal police officer.

561
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,870
I'm not as good as him.

562
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,950
Maybe I'm just not cut out to be a criminal police officer.

563
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,640
Why are you so humble today?

564
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,640
It's a pity that Mi died.

565
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,350
But at least he didn't die for nothing.

566
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,730
Liu Guangcai confessed everything.

567
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,040
The No. 6 Factory case is finally solved.

568
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,210
Xiangdong.

569
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,740
This one's for you.

570
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,470
Your instinct was right.

571
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,900
Yao Binbin didn't kill anyone.

572
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,720
And?

573
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,910
His family will be compensated.

574
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,070
We're talking to his mom.

575
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,960
That's it?

576
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,750
That was a life.

577
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,440
Mr. Su took all the blame.

578
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,470
He asked for a place for you in the Criminal Police Team

579
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,660
before he left.

580
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,170
Sign this.

581
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,880
How about Yao Binbin?

582
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,880
Xu Wenguo is fine?

583
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,520
Mi died for nothing, didn't he?

584
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,000
No, Xiangdong.

585
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,230
I know you are in a bad mood.

586
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,550
Sign this.

587
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,550
Let's look ahead.

588
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,840
Come to the Criminal Police Team on Monday,

589
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,550
okay?

590
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,110
I...

591
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,730
I'll drink as a punishment.

592
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,510
Alright.

593
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,320
I'm going home.

594
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,610
in the Criminal Police Team is waiting for me at home.

595
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,580
[In memory of our good friend, Mr. Gao Liang]
