1
00:00:00,106 --> 00:00:02,101
It's him!

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:03,459
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:06,460
What do you mean, "It's him"? Who? Jun Hui?

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,180
You tell them!

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,756
Let go of that hand.

6
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:19,256
Hey.

7
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:23,875
Come out.

8
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:31,023
Hey, what are you doing?

9
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:33,047
- What are you doing?
- Oh my.

10
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:35,078
- Let go of me.
- Seo Jun Hui!

11
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:37,555
- Hey, hey!
- What do we do?

12
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:41,099
What is going on here?
[Episode 3]

13
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:41,980
Be quiet.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,700
- What's with you?
- Stay out of it!

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,501
Why are you acting like this?

16
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:47,303
Let's talk downstairs.

17
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:50,634
Hyung, do you know him?

18
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:53,050
How do you know him?

19
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,536
He's my friend.

20
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:57,617
What? "Your friend"?

21
00:00:57,617 --> 00:01:00,035
That means he's younger than me.

22
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:02,885
Wow, he's much younger. What are you looking at?

23
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:06,260
I won't overlook what happened today.

24
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,159
What happened with you two? Why are you acting like this?

25
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:14,255
- What is it?
- We will talk downstairs.

26
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:22,256
- Did they leave?
- Yes.

27
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:26,287
Gosh, where did they go? I don't see them outside.

28
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:29,297
Hey, what is going on here?

29
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,718
I told you, I'll explain it all later.

30
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:34,144
- What...
- Hey, now.

31
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:37,774
Leave that and go get changed first.

32
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:42,144
I knew something was off when you came out looking like that.

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,566
You were acting out of character. My goodness.

34
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:53,015
Hey, wait.

35
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:56,137
Tell me what's going on before you start fighting over it.

36
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:59,285
Why are you two doing this? I'm going crazy here!

37
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,415
Hey, I'm the one going crazy.

38
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:04,406
Jin Ah says she likes him. He's the one she likes!

39
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:07,339
What are you saying? I told you that he's my friend.

40
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:09,916
That's why I'm even more shocked!

41
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:13,356
Hey, what is he talking about?

42
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:16,105
Say something, you punk!

43
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:19,176
I told you to get lost last time, didn't I?

44
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:21,997
Are you stalking Yun Jin Ah?

45
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:23,046
Do you want to die?

46
00:02:23,047 --> 00:02:25,038
Are you serious?

47
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:29,646
What did you say?

48
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:32,473
Did you say Hyung is a stalker?

49
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:38,220
This punk was cheating.

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,720
That's why Jin Ah ended things.

51
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,304
He's a total jerk!

52
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,683
- Hyung, did you cheat?
- No, no.

53
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:52,099
What happened was...

54
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,626
I wasn't the only one who did it. Jin Ah also cheated with this guy!

55
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:59,807
She told your parents that she likes him earlier tonight. She did!

56
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,841
- Go.
- Hey, Seung Ho.

57
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,113
I said go.

58
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:11,463
Go before I beat you to death, even before my friend does.

59
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:13,600
Can't you hear me?

60
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,529
Get lost, you son of a bitch!

61
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:20,923
So are you saying you don't believe me?

62
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:22,868
All right. Fine.

63
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,905
Someday, you'll come to regret this.

64
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:39,851
Yun Jin Ah, that fool.

65
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,791
Hey, when did you find out?

66
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:45,891
You should have told me if you knew!

67
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:49,752
You act like you care so much about your sister.

68
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:55,822
Seriously, I should've stayed out of this.

69
00:03:57,882 --> 00:04:00,219
I told you to stay out of it.

70
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,860
Couldn't you figure out the situation?

71
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,049
Gosh, you bonehead.

72
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,750
Yun Jin Ah said she liked you. How can I think straight?

73
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,509
What happened out there?

74
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,510
Did you fight?

75
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,750
Lee Gyu Min says he cheated.

76
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:41,660
And? Jun Hui, why did you get involved...

77
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,470
Mom.

78
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:49,200
Lee Gyu Min kept showing up, so I asked Jun Hui to help me out.

79
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,667
He pretended to be my boyfriend.

80
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:53,566
- What about saying you like him?
- I was just saying it!

81
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:56,062
That way, I could get rid of him.

82
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,677
Why do you even need to ask?

83
00:04:57,677 --> 00:05:00,477
Because it was such a ridiculous thing to hear.

84
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:01,814
Do you know how shocked I was?

85
00:05:01,814 --> 00:05:06,915
Why are you yelling at her? It's that punk who was wrong.

86
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:10,487
Anyway, thank you, Jun Hui.

87
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:13,426
It's nothing. I'm sorry about the commotion.

88
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,299
You shouldn't say sorry for things like that.

89
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,700
Then we will feel worse.

90
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,297
How embarrassing for you, Yun Jin Ah.

91
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:24,566
How old are you that you don't know when someone's cheating?

92
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:27,483
- Don't date anymore.
- Be quiet!

93
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:28,706
You should both eat.

94
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:33,707
No, I'll come over next time when things are calmer.

95
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,663
- You.
- What?

96
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,300
Tell me the truth.

97
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,912
It's true about Gyu Min, but what about Jun Hui?

98
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:11,528
Mom, why bother asking?

99
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,163
Aren't you embarrassed to see Jun Hui?

100
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,514
He's your younger brother's friend! What must he be thinking?

101
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:20,079
"She sure is causing a lot of fuss just to date."

102
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,549
And what about Seung Ho?

103
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,800
His friend had to step in. How embarrassing is that?

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,208
How are you always so foolish?

105
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:32,924
So why did you do something no one told you to do? Why would you invite Lee Gyu Min here?

106
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:34,975
Telling me to cover things up and just get married.

107
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:36,985
Is marriage as simple as visiting your neighbor?

108
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:39,385
What gives you the right to yell!

109
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:44,475
If you had done better, Gyu Min wouldn't have cheated.

110
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:46,114
I told you multiple times!

111
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,064
Mom!

112
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,246
You're the only one in my vicinity.

113
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:54,925
Other people's daughters all date and marry well when the time comes.

114
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:58,764
What are you lacking that you're still so lost at this age?

115
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:00,969
It's because I'm not like those other well-off daughters.

116
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:02,797
It's because I'm your loser daughter!

117
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,898
Why, you!

118
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:07,631
Forget it.

119
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:40,933
I came to steal beers, but the owner is here.

120
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:49,205
You seem angry. Did you fight with someone?

121
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:52,404
- I'm a bit tired.
- I guess I'm right.

122
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:57,746
I'm proud that you didn't get beat up. Did you beat the other guy up?

123
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:59,545
I'm going to wash up.

124
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,186
Do you want a beer?

125
00:08:01,186 --> 00:08:03,380
No.

126
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,948
He really must've gotten in a fight.

127
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,457
Whether she gets married or gets old... I really don't know anymore.

128
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,608
Did I say something false?

129
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:17,836
Am I saying it for someone else's benefit? I'm saying it for her–

130
00:08:17,837 --> 00:08:19,035
Go to sleep.

131
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:22,761
How can I sleep now? My insides are on fire.

132
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:26,070
Jin Ah feels worse than you do.

133
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:30,179
You didn't do anything right either!

134
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:32,495
You couldn't be aggressive in life.

135
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:36,080
You could only sniff at other executives and had to retire.

136
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,242
Why would you bring that up now?

137
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:41,348
Why not?

138
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:44,151
If you worked in a high position for a long time,

139
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:46,432
would this happen to Jin Ah?

140
00:08:46,432 --> 00:08:49,932
It's all because he looks down on our household.

141
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,100
Sorry.

142
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,692
You don't have to say that to me.

143
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:18,953
You didn't fight outside, did you?

144
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:20,492
Gyu Min tried to hit Jun Hui.

145
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,000
Did he hit him?

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,464
I said he tried.

147
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:30,124
If you wanted a pretend boyfriend, you should've found someone suitable.

148
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:33,505
Lee Gyu Min is throwing a fit because it's my friend.

149
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,504
Are you that thoughtless?

150
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:40,500
Well, did you talk about anything else out there?

151
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,357
What would we say?

152
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:44,758
I told him to get lost before we both beat him to death.

153
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:47,932
Why do you live that way?

154
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,814
I'm already getting criticized enough.

155
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:55,114
You don't have to add to it!

156
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,060
♫ You can dance ♫

157
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:53,280
♫ Every dance with the guy that gives you the eye, and let him hold you tight ♫

158
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,620
♫ You can smile ♫

159
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:03,870
♫ Every smile for the man that held your hand beneath the pale moonlight ♫

160
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:12,430
♫ But don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be ♫

161
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,890
♫ So darling, save the last dance for me ♫

162
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,940
♫ Oh, I know that the music's fine ♫

163
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:30,245
What brings you here at this hour?

164
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:32,626
I smelled the alcohol and came.

165
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,329
Of course, you did.

166
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,173
But why...

167
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:39,593
Ah, you came here because I wasn't at my place.

168
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:43,242
Yes, I rang the bell at your place but you weren't there, so I knew you'd be here.

169
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:46,043
I didn't steal enough beer earlier.

170
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,560
What about Jun Hui?

171
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,089
He came in and left again.

172
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:53,840
Oh.

173
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,410
♫ Save the last dance for me ♫

174
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,410
♫ Baby, don't you know I love you so ♫

175
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,420
♫ Can't you feel it when we touch ♫

176
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,890
♫ I will never ever let you go ♫

177
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,540
♫ I love you oh, so much ♫

178
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:26,227
I was about to get bored alone. You totally saved me.

179
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:30,875
Jun Hui must have gone somewhere.

180
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,000
Who knows.

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,400
I think he got into a fight.

182
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,924
He came in looking so angry.

183
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,799
He wouldn't reply my questions and didn't want to drink either.

184
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,646
He seems okay on the outside, but his feelings don't match.

185
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:49,795
He was angry and feeling upset.

186
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:52,581
He was frustrated so he left.

187
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:58,200
Honestly, I feel bad for him even when he feels upset about something.

188
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,574
He doesn't have a dad or brother to talk to.

189
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:06,395
He doesn't even have a mom who will take his side wholeheartedly.

190
00:13:06,395 --> 00:13:11,159
Through life or death, it's just me and that isn't always enough.

191
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,180
That's why I'm trying not to nag him so much these days.

192
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,066
Aren't you here to drink?

193
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,420
What, what? I am drinking. Let's drink.

194
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,291
Who do you think you're fooling?

195
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,891
Spill it right now.

196
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:31,148
I'm telling you, nothing happened.

197
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:32,739
Really?

198
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:34,449
Drink.

199
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,874
- You should sleep over.
- Okay.

200
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,600
Do you like me that much?

201
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,651
I do.

202
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,070
♫ Save it ♫

203
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:56,360
♫ Baby, save the last dance for me ♫

204
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,990
♫ Save it, save ♫

205
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,498
You aren't dead.

206
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:33,070
Gosh. Seriously...

207
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,928
What?

208
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:39,540
Are you angry over a joke?

209
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,400
You're at work early.

210
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,700
I woke up severely early.

211
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:58,182
About yesterday...

212
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,259
I wanted to thank you.

213
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:03,510
That's unexpected.

214
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,516
I thought you'd be mad that I butted in and created a commotion.

215
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:08,199
What?

216
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,758
You'll be late. Go in.

217
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:39,867
What did you mean by what you said?

218
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:42,600
Why did you think that I'd be angry?

219
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:48,068
Well, because I ruined a chance for you to make things work with your boyfriend.

220
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,390
Did it look like I was trying to make things work with him?

221
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,885
Isn't that why you dolled yourself up, head to toe, and invited him home?

222
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:01,981
I see.

223
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:06,564
Well, I suppose you could think that seeing how I was dressed.

224
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:09,502
But I had a different reason for that...

225
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,503
I'm sure you did.

226
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,723
I didn't invite him.

227
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:19,701
Does that make any sense? Do you think I would do that?

228
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:24,848
No matter who invited him, he wouldn't have been able to come if you had been firm about it.

229
00:16:24,848 --> 00:16:26,737
That's common sense.

230
00:16:31,308 --> 00:16:34,858
You have nothing more to say, right? I'll head down.

231
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:00,850
Come see me, Section Chief Yun.

232
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:09,050
What happened with the Gasan-dong store?

233
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,920
I told you to fix it and instead, we are getting notified of being sued?

234
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,621
Do you know how much trouble I'm in with the director?

235
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:18,861
How could you handle your work like that?

236
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:20,779
What did you do?

237
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,751
How could a franchisee dare to go up against the head office?

238
00:17:25,698 --> 00:17:27,689
Why are you standing there? Go figure it out.

239
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,638
If you can't fix this, we will all get fired.

240
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:33,239
All because of you, Section Chief Yun!

241
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,583
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

242
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,715
Go on in, please.

243
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:34,418
- Sit down.
- Okay.

244
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:38,369
- Have you been doing well?
- Yes.

245
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:29,027
How bad must it have been for me to resort to that?

246
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:31,806
The head office can't even give me benefits.

247
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:35,167
They even added extra milk costs.

248
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:37,768
That's just lacking in common sense.

249
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:42,414
Gosh... that darn common sense.

250
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:49,333
Oh, sorry. I'm just so frustrated.

251
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:54,646
So about you sending us that litigation notice,

252
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:57,499
you intend to go all the way, right?

253
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:03,615
When you get stepped on enough, you fight back. I can't live my life getting stepped on.

254
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:05,762
Of course.

255
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:08,881
- You can't live that way.
- Exactly.

256
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:14,409
You have to take it all the way. You need to go to the edge of the cliff.

257
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:18,769
If you only act halfway, you can't have the confrontation you want.

258
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:20,305
Right?

259
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:25,300
I don't think that's something someone from the head office should say.

260
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,861
I plan on quitting soon, too.

261
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:32,122
I don't think I can do it anymore.

262
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:37,059
I've been stuck between the company and franchises' battles for so long.

263
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:39,369
I'm getting so sick of it.

264
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:45,559
I guess you could end up going to court for this.

265
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,171
I'll testify for you if you need.

266
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,342
Are you saying you will quit?

267
00:20:53,342 --> 00:20:55,851
Then what do you plan on doing?

268
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:58,021
Didn't I tell you?

269
00:20:58,021 --> 00:21:01,360
My dad is retired, and he doesn't work.

270
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,399
I'll just do that, too.

271
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,701
Would you like to join us?

272
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:23,387
I can't believe you're sick just from grabbing him by the collar.

273
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:25,623
Get up.

274
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:28,600
- Come on now.
- Oh, ouch.

275
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,167
Ouch.

276
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:36,542
Let me see.

277
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:39,601
Oh, dear.

278
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:42,802
You can't fool your age. We are old now.

279
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:48,679
Why would you go after him like that?

280
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:55,804
You'll get better after you take some medicine and get some rest.

281
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,919
You better eat first.

282
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,490
It'll be hard to get up again, so stay seated.

283
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,417
I'll get the rice ready for you.

284
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:08,179
Wouldn't porridge be better?

285
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:14,108
You're acting like you did something amazing, aren't you?

286
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:30,868
- Hyun Jeong.
- Yes?

287
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:34,657
- Did you check the service table?
- Yes, I just did.

288
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:37,300
- Hello.
- Hello, what would you like?

289
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,800
I'm here from the head office.

290
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:43,767
My name is Kang Se Yeong.

291
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:46,707
- You're the franchise owner, right?
- Yes.

292
00:22:46,707 --> 00:22:49,348
What brings you here?

293
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:50,887
I'm not here for anything in particular.

294
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:54,947
I was passing by and thought I'd say hello.

295
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:58,550
I heard you were Section Chief Yun Jin Ah's friend.

296
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,987
- Yes.
- I've heard a lot about you.

297
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,442
I see...

298
00:23:02,443 --> 00:23:06,418
You're also Seo Jun Hui's sister, right?

299
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,642
- Yes.
- Oh.

300
00:23:08,642 --> 00:23:13,640
I met him once through Section Chief Yun Jin Ah.

301
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,050
- I see.
- Yes.

302
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:20,349
Since you're already here, would you like to try out the coffee?

303
00:23:21,323 --> 00:23:22,902
That's so kind of you.

304
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:26,391
That would be great, but I'll buy the coffee.

305
00:23:26,392 --> 00:23:28,673
It will be on me.

306
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:33,584
Let's have coffee next time.

307
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:46,984
Out of your store's supplies, you're going to return the company's.

308
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:49,657
and sell the rest, right?

309
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:52,647
I'll contact a supplier.

310
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:56,415
Why are you in such a rush?

311
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,931
You have to move quickly to save money.

312
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:04,309
I'm just thinking of you.

313
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,659
Who asked you to?

314
00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:12,149
I'm thankful that you're thinking of me.

315
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:17,269
We should talk about it first. Why are you so extreme about it?

316
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:24,445
Because I don't enjoy life.

317
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,460
Why is life so complicated?

318
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,683
Stop that.

319
00:24:33,683 --> 00:24:38,383
You have so much ahead of you. How can you say such a thing?

320
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,602
Do you think my life is full of flowers just because I'm young?

321
00:24:45,002 --> 00:24:47,361
I get betrayed.

322
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:50,121
I get hurt.

323
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:53,658
Then when I'm comforted by something,

324
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,694
I try to be strong.

325
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:59,494
Only to end up discouraged once again.

326
00:25:00,954 --> 00:25:06,766
Despite it all, I try to find hope.

327
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:09,865
Everyone lives like that.

328
00:25:11,264 --> 00:25:14,074
Everyone feels the same.

329
00:25:16,444 --> 00:25:20,503
I know. Everyone is just trying to make a living.

330
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:24,725
Stay strong.

331
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,100
Stay strong.

332
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:43,332
Are you staying up all night today too?

333
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:45,612
Why are you suddenly working so hard?

334
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:47,164
I was always like this.

335
00:25:47,165 --> 00:25:49,683
- Hello.
- Hello.

336
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:52,233
All the members aren't here today.

337
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:56,165
- Section Chief Yun is working off-site.
- She's on a date.

338
00:25:56,165 --> 00:25:57,691
That can't be true.

339
00:25:57,692 --> 00:25:59,803
I'm a witness. I saw her boyfriend.

340
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:03,670
Oh, right. I went to your sister's store, Jun Hui.

341
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:05,176
I see.

342
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:08,948
So one person went on a date. What about the three of you?

343
00:26:08,948 --> 00:26:10,690
We are going home.

344
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,089
I haven't decided yet.

345
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:13,900
You must have plans.

346
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,254
I'm going to make some.

347
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:19,433
Jun Hui, when are we going to that club you mentioned?

348
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:20,915
Why don't we go now?

349
00:26:20,915 --> 00:26:23,162
Hey, you said you'd work all night.

350
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:27,099
Did you mean you'd party all night?

351
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:29,240
- I'll go get my bag.
- Me too.

352
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,719
Are we really going clubbing?

353
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,241
I'm not dressed right. I should've dressed for the lights.

354
00:26:34,241 --> 00:26:36,686
You know how to club.

355
00:26:36,686 --> 00:26:39,639
Section Chief Geum? You're not interested, are you?

356
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,289
You should go too. You can just watch like me.

357
00:26:44,193 --> 00:26:46,122
Sure, I'll go.

358
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:51,458
Oh, really? Yun Jin Ah has a man?

359
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,721
You must be going insane.

360
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,040
I saw him several times, but you're saying you don't know him?

361
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,958
If there really was someone, there's no way I wouldn't know.

362
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:06,221
But I don't know, which means there's no one.

363
00:27:06,221 --> 00:27:08,669
You must have been fooled too.

364
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,456
Hey!

365
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:17,038
I saw him at her place.

366
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,539
She said it in front of her parents.

367
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:27,109
That he's the guy she likes.

368
00:27:28,758 --> 00:27:31,839
Do you know what's even funnier though?

369
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:36,968
He's Seung Ho's friend.

370
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,638
He's her younger brother's friend!

371
00:27:40,638 --> 00:27:44,938
Are you talking about the guy who took her away in front of her work?

372
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:48,641
Gosh, you do know him. Why did you say you didn't?

373
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:52,378
Oh my gosh. Hey, you idiot.

374
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:04,059
I only told you we met up. How did you know we were here?

375
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:07,163
Where else do you go near your store?

376
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,869
Right...

377
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:11,732
- Gyeong Seon.
- Yes?

378
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,599
You should leave now.

379
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:28,761
You seem ready to fight today.

380
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:31,119
Did you already fight with someone today?

381
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,630
I lost count of the number of people that messed with me today.

382
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,670
I feel for you.

383
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:41,567
That guy is really hopeless. He thinks you're with Jun Hui.

384
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:44,911
I heard they met at your house. Why didn't you tell me?

385
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:48,242
I was going to tell you.

386
00:28:48,242 --> 00:28:51,960
It's getting annoying and tiresome to even talk about him.

387
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,452
You know how it is.

388
00:28:53,452 --> 00:28:57,191
I don't even want to say a word about that guy.

389
00:28:57,191 --> 00:28:58,610
That's why I didn't tell you.

390
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,711
I know. I know what you're saying.

391
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:05,000
Do you think you can do a good job?

392
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,103
I'll have to die if I can't.

393
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:09,994
I believe in you if that's what you're preparing for.

394
00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:12,593
I'm looking forward to a great finale.

395
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,128
[Ye Eun]

396
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:23,353
You should come too, Section Chief Yun.

397
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:38,968
Hey, Lee Gyu Min.

398
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:44,157
Go where? My house?

399
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:45,551
You must be really crazy!

400
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:48,751
I'm not crazy. I feel so wronged.

401
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:51,581
I feel crazy because I'm the only one who was made out to be trash!

402
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:54,465
I want to meet your parents again and tell them that you're no different,

403
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:56,812
- so they should apologize to me!
- Hey!

404
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,764
And him too! That punk friend of Seung Ho's!

405
00:30:59,765 --> 00:31:03,084
I'll make him get on his knees in front of me!

406
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:06,145
Were you really such a crazy person?

407
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:07,976
- What about you?
- Were you this pathetic?

408
00:31:07,977 --> 00:31:10,696
What about you? What's so great about you?

409
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:14,255
Did you graduate from a better school or come from a better household?

410
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:24,347
You're forcing me to become this way.

411
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:10,037
I told her we were here, but Section Chief Yun isn't responding.

412
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,654
Just leave her alone.

413
00:32:26,297 --> 00:32:28,965
I'm really going to die.

414
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:33,706
- I said, go ahead.
- You think I'm lying, don't you?

415
00:32:33,706 --> 00:32:35,848
Yes, you're lying.

416
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:41,041
Seriously? Do you hate me that much?

417
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,770
Would you like it if I died?

418
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:45,410
Are you saying I can die?

419
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:49,072
How much more confirmation do you need?

420
00:32:49,072 --> 00:32:50,881
It's all because of that punk, isn't it?

421
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:53,310
Don't call him "this punk" and "that punk."

422
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,792
He isn't someone who you can call those things.

423
00:32:57,648 --> 00:33:00,868
It's not because of anyone.

424
00:33:00,868 --> 00:33:04,982
I hate myself for being stupid and only being able to see you.

425
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:07,003
I hate it so much that I get goosebumps.

426
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:08,852
That's all it is.

427
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:14,094
Gyu Min.

428
00:33:14,094 --> 00:33:18,399
Let's not hate each other and both live well on our own.

429
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,726
Okay? Farewell.

430
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:28,875
I'll never give up!

431
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:33,358
I'll make you have a change of heart!

432
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,480
What is this?

433
00:33:43,451 --> 00:33:46,175
What are you doing here?

434
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:47,416
Is this the new trendy dance?

435
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:51,162
I thought you were only dancing. When did you take these pictures?

436
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,948
Who is the one who was only dancing?

437
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,425
Section Chief Geum, you acted like you were forced to go, but you had the most fun.

438
00:33:56,426 --> 00:33:57,808
- That's what I'm saying.
- Oh.

439
00:33:57,808 --> 00:34:01,133
I just like to be diligent in any situation that comes up.

440
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:02,640
Good morning.

441
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,834
Section Chief Yun, I sent you a message yesterday.

442
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,870
Did things go well with your boyfriend?

443
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,279
How did you know?

444
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:11,282
Why is that important?

445
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,863
The point is the reunion.

446
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:16,631
Did things work out?

447
00:34:16,631 --> 00:34:19,175
I suppose I have to say that things went well.

448
00:34:19,176 --> 00:34:20,428
No wonder.

449
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:24,451
I was going to message you again but your friend upstairs told me not to.

450
00:34:29,843 --> 00:34:31,689
Yes, Chairman.

451
00:34:31,689 --> 00:34:34,669
I was worried about the Gasan-dong store,

452
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:36,508
but I think Yun Jin Ah handled it well.

453
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:40,283
Yes. The franchisee asked us to let him off this time.

454
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:42,770
It seems it was a protest.

455
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,711
You can't look at it only that way.

456
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:48,349
He could still resent us.

457
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:51,059
Still, we can't start accepting this from our franchisees.

458
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,105
We should just cut out the root.

459
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:55,887
That's not so easy in this day and age either.

460
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,550
That's right.

461
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,936
Why don't we focus on getting the store back to being successful again?

462
00:35:00,936 --> 00:35:05,169
We can send Yun Jin Ah there and set a goal of returning it to its baseline.

463
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:09,900
Right now I think that would be the best thing for the store and the company.

464
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:16,788
Have you had lunch?

465
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,220
- By the way, Section Chief Yun.
- Yes?

466
00:35:20,221 --> 00:35:25,119
What about that store opening promotion that you were supposed to pay for?

467
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,769
I will handle that soon.

468
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:31,132
No, it's okay.

469
00:35:31,132 --> 00:35:33,371
For an employee to bear...

470
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:36,354
I think it's just too much.

471
00:35:36,354 --> 00:35:38,322
The company will cover it.

472
00:35:38,322 --> 00:35:40,820
I took care of it.

473
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,419
Just so you know.

474
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:46,633
Director, I respect you for thinking of your employees so much.

475
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:48,321
It's nothing.

476
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:51,642
What are you doing? You ought to bow to him.

477
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:55,722
What are you doing? It's fine.

478
00:35:55,722 --> 00:35:58,500
Thank you, Director.

479
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:13,020
It was you, right, Manager Jeong? The personal expense for the promotion?

480
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,916
I don't have that kind of authority.

481
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:18,515
We just went by company protocol.

482
00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:21,186
Hey, now. I've been here for a while.

483

Thank you for helping me so many times.

I'm not just helping you.

487

So you won't be going to the office for the time being?

Yes, I'll be going to work at the store.

So the person who will take over for me here is called Kang Se Yeong...

I know who she is.

491
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:52,273
She came by to say hello when Lee Gyu Min charged in.

492
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:58,626
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

493
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:02,750
She's good at her work so there won't be work-related problems.

494
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:06,361
"Work-related"? Is there something besides that?

495
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:09,527
No, just in case...

Oh...

Are you already jealous that I might become more friendly with her?

That isn't the case, Your Highness. I'm hungry.

Let's go eat. My treat.

Oh, it's today. I forgot.

It was so cold back then.

You're right. It was cold.

509
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:57,664
What about your dad? Haven't you heard from him?

510
00:37:57,664 --> 00:37:59,600
I'm scared he might contact us.

Of course. You raised him so well.

I don't know what kind of girl Jun Hui will end up with,

Mom, why are you so attached to him?

If people overheard you, they'd think she was your daughter.

Is that all Gyeong Seon said?

Why didn't she tell you the whole story?

631
00:48:46,342 --> 00:48:48,063
Why did she just say that?

632

I went to Gyeong Seon's place, but she wasn't home.

I wondered if she was at your place and she was.

I was sorry and wanted to thank you too.

But you were going on about common sense and all that.

01:00:18,747 --> 01:00:20,272
What do I do?

806
01:00:21,491 --> 01:00:23,755
No, no, no.

807
01:00:23,755 --> 01:00:25,621
Where am I supposed to go? Is this right?

808
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,813
It's right.

809
01:00:27,813 --> 01:00:29,336
Ah...

810
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,869
I'll go to you. Just stay there.

811
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:36,314
Yes.

812
01:00:36,314 --> 01:00:38,222
I got it. I got it.

813
01:00:38,222 --> 01:00:39,974
Come here.

814
01:00:41,185 --> 01:00:44,453
Hold on. I'm coming.

815
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,951
You're coming, right?

816
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,544
Okay, okay.

817
01:00:53,544 --> 01:00:56,356
You're coming, right?

818
01:00:56,356 --> 01:01:02,170
♫ Wherever you are ♫

819
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:06,800
♫ I can feel you ♫

820
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:46,530
♫ And we're meant to be ♫

821
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:52,050
♫ This is one thing I know ♫

822
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:59,860
♫ I feel everything ♫

823
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:05,790
♫ Never been so exposed ♫

824
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:10,790
♫ Are there pieces still yet to be ♫

825
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:15,020
♫ Discovered with your love ♫

826
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:19,660
♫ I can see anything through ♫

827
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:23,580
♫ Wherever you are ♫

828
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:28,974
♫ I can feel you ♫

829
01:02:28,974 --> 01:02:31,664
How long will you be at the Gasa-dong store?

830
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:34,113
It's undecided. Take care of all my stores for me.

831
01:02:34,113 --> 01:02:36,153
I'll treat you all big time once I come back.

832
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:39,289
I'll countdown the days. I'll get going then.

833
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:41,714
Okay. Bye.

834
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:50,108
Section Chief Geum, I only gave you two stores because the locations are far.

835
01:02:50,108 --> 01:02:52,851
Should I be grateful?

836
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:54,488
Why are you being like that?

837
01:02:54,488 --> 01:02:57,796
She isn't leaving on purpose.

838
01:02:57,796 --> 01:03:01,904
So is there something I should know about the Suseo store?

839
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:05,015
Is there something the owner wants or a preference?

840
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:09,214
Why are you asking her? You should ask the younger brother.

841
01:03:10,838 --> 01:03:13,777
Geum Bo Ra sure is smart.

842
01:03:14,905 --> 01:03:17,158
Treat me to a big meal next time.

843
01:03:17,158 --> 01:03:19,103
Okay.

844
01:03:19,103 --> 01:03:23,333
Shouldn't she be treating you? She seems excited to go to Suseo.

845
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:26,115
It's good if she's excited and works hard.

846
01:03:26,115 --> 01:03:27,463
It isn't just work, though.

847
01:03:27,463 --> 01:03:31,325
She's trying to make progress with Seo Jun Hui.

848
01:03:31,325 --> 01:03:34,826
Why don't you want them to work out?

849
01:03:34,826 --> 01:03:36,909
It isn't that I don't want that.

850
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:40,023
How would you feel if Section Chief Kang dated your younger brother?

851
01:03:40,023 --> 01:03:42,024
My brother?

852
01:03:42,024 --> 01:03:44,197
That's nonsense. What are you talking about?

853
01:03:44,198 --> 01:03:48,327
You see? If Seo Jun Hui is your friend's younger brother,

854
01:03:48,327 --> 01:03:51,228
isn't that pretty much like your younger brother?

855
01:03:53,742 --> 01:03:56,192
I suppose so.

856
01:03:56,192 --> 01:03:58,309
But my brother is my brother.

857
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:01,743
My friend's brother isn't my brother.

858
01:04:01,743 --> 01:04:03,342
I guess.

859
01:04:06,296 --> 01:04:08,696
What kind of coffee do we have here?

860
01:04:11,276 --> 01:04:13,282
I'll be back.

861
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:18,946
Wow, this is delicious.

862
01:04:18,946 --> 01:04:20,577
It's really good.

863
01:04:20,577 --> 01:04:24,260
Really? I just threw it together.

864
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,257
And it tastes like this?

865
01:04:26,257 --> 01:04:29,022
It tastes really good.

866
01:04:29,022 --> 01:04:30,822
That's true.

867
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:48,950
Seriously, who did this?

868
01:04:51,551 --> 01:04:52,839
Wait.

869
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:59,099
It's hard to succeed lately with action games where you fight and break things.

870
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:01,115
What about something new and fresh?

871
01:05:01,115 --> 01:05:04,541
For example, a crossbow or hammer.

872
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:06,401
"Crossbow," "hammer"?

873
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:08,048
Classic?

874
01:05:08,048 --> 01:05:10,910
It's similar to what Seo Jun Hui brought up before, right?

875
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:12,978
Something like that.

876
01:05:14,339 --> 01:05:15,648
Hey.

877
01:05:16,742 --> 01:05:18,660
Are you sick?

878
01:05:20,837 --> 01:05:23,400
I feel strangely nauseous.

879
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,000
My head hurts and I feel weak.

880
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,250
Have this. Here.

881
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:32,111
Yes. Thank you.

882
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:34,750
You should go to the hospital if you're sick.

883
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:37,856
Okay, I'll go the hospital then.

884
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:48,992
Wait.

885
01:05:48,992 --> 01:05:52,510
Didn't he just say he felt weak?

886
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,242
Yes, he did.

887
01:06:03,568 --> 01:06:07,343
I could've taken a taxi. Did you come out when you're busy?

888
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:10,781
No, I even finished up my meeting.

889
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:12,563
You know I'm good at my job.

890
01:06:12,563 --> 01:06:15,392
My company can't run without me.

891
01:06:15,392 --> 01:06:17,963
Are you that great? I didn't know that.

892
01:06:17,963 --> 01:06:19,782
Did you really not know?

893
01:06:19,782 --> 01:06:21,651
You really don't have a good eye for men.

894
01:06:21,651 --> 01:06:25,284
You aren't a man.

895
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:30,499
It's just a figure of speech.

896
01:06:30,499 --> 01:06:33,022
No need to point that out.

897
01:06:34,253 --> 01:06:38,235
I'm not trying to argue or anything.

898
01:06:38,235 --> 01:06:41,795
You are a man. You're a man...

899
01:06:41,795 --> 01:06:43,869
What are you saying?

900
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:46,213
- What time will you be done later?
- Later?

901
01:06:46,213 --> 01:06:49,292
My official first day is tomorrow.

902
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:52,400
I can leave anytime in the evening. Why?

903
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,299
I'm going to pick you up.

904
01:06:54,299 --> 01:06:55,854
Really?

905
01:06:55,854 --> 01:06:58,520
Why bother?

906
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,800
Do you want to?

907
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,319
Gosh, seriously.

908
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,421
Starting tomorrow, we will be opening earlier

909
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:07,642
so don't drink and go to sleep early.

910
01:07:07,643 --> 01:07:10,193
I'll do the orders for any products that we need.

911
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,664
I feel like our roles are reversed.

912
01:07:12,664 --> 01:07:15,666
I don't know if I can overwork a head office employee like this.

913
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:17,202
You aren't allowed to feel that.

914
01:07:17,202 --> 01:07:19,648
Cheer up, let's do well! Go, go!

915
01:07:19,648 --> 01:07:21,065
Yes.

916
01:07:21,979 --> 01:07:25,151
You suddenly seem much brighter.

917
01:07:25,151 --> 01:07:27,277
Me? Am I?

918
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:29,568
It's like looking at a different person.

919
01:07:29,568 --> 01:07:32,469
Is it because of that man waiting for you outside?

920
01:07:35,547 --> 01:07:39,157
I'll get going now. Take care!

921
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:02,600

What if...

927
01:08:42,144 --> 01:08:43,887
"What if"?

928
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:48,963
What if I...

929
01:08:50,253 --> 01:08:52,035
If you, what?

930
01:08:54,544 --> 01:08:56,553
Not me.

931
01:08:57,654 --> 01:09:00,710
Noona, by any chance...

932
01:09:01,406 --> 01:09:04,799
I... I...

933
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,310
If I asked you to buy me food tomorrow, would you?

934
01:09:13,788 --> 01:09:16,179
Have I ever said no?

935
01:09:16,179 --> 01:09:19,579
I'll buy you enough to make your stomach explode.

936

Really?

937
01:09:25,658 --> 01:09:27,451
Of course.

938
01:09:28,184 --> 01:09:29,800

Yes.

01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:38,506
I had fun today.

970
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:43,167
We could have had more fun.

971
01:12:43,167 --> 01:12:45,737
Today isn't the only day we have.

972
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:47,432
Right?

973
01:12:50,673 --> 01:12:53,751
- I'll get going then.
- Okay.

974
01:13:01,796 --> 01:13:03,746
Bye.

975
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:48,931
- Here you go, Section Chief.
- Thank you.

976
01:13:48,931 --> 01:13:50,943
There are lots of people even though it isn't peak hours.

977
01:13:50,944 --> 01:13:53,352
I guess you and the owner are a good match.

978
01:13:53,353 --> 01:13:55,333
I don't like the nuance of that statement.

979
01:13:55,334 --> 01:13:57,532
You met at the right time.

980
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:59,653
It's all timing with men and women.

981
01:13:59,653 --> 01:14:03,654
Usually, men are so dense that it's a problem, though.

982
01:14:03,654 --> 01:14:07,742
Yes. it seemed that way.

983
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,562
What do you do if the timing's off? Do I wait until it's right?

984
01:14:11,563 --> 01:14:15,500
You will die of old age or frustration.

985
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,478
It's game over if you test the waters until you're sure about things.

986
01:14:18,478 --> 01:14:22,140
Why? You know you like each other.

987
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,697
You know but you're dying of frustration.

988
01:14:24,697 --> 01:14:27,087
Just then, an aggressive hunter comes in.

989
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:29,826
Something about that person is new, fresh, and exciting.

990
01:14:29,826 --> 01:14:32,118
Then he falls for that person.

991
01:14:33,861 --> 01:14:37,234
- Timing is really important then.
- Yes.

What is it?

998
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:03,457
- What is it?
- I hit a soldier.

999
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,828
Which one?

1000
01:15:04,828 --> 01:15:07,168
Okay. Good job.

1001
01:15:07,168 --> 01:15:09,097
It's squid. Squid.

1002
01:15:09,097 --> 01:15:12,029
- I want meat.
- Squid is good.

1003
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:13,628
Awesome, awesome.

Which one?

1008
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,263
- Ribeye.
- Ribeye?

1009
01:15:26,263 --> 01:15:28,838
Hey, you can't get that one.

1010
01:15:28,838 --> 01:15:31,800
You won't get it.

1011
01:15:36,154 --> 01:15:39,065
What is this? Wow!

1012
01:15:39,065 --> 01:15:42,198
Okay, let's go.

1013
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:45,825
I'm hungry! Let's go.

1014
01:15:45,826 --> 01:15:48,839
Forget it, forget it.

1015
01:15:48,839 --> 01:15:51,719
Chairman, it's really ribeye beef.

1016
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:53,630
Oh!

1017
01:15:56,448 --> 01:15:59,179
I'm coming to the office this evening.

1018
01:16:07,388 --> 01:16:09,509
Are you still working?

1019
01:16:10,569 --> 01:16:13,600
I'm done with my work dinner soon.

1020
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,084
How long are you staying?

1021
01:16:17,669 --> 01:16:20,709
I still have work left, so I think I'll stay a bit longer.

1022
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,951
Who is sending you those messages?

1023
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:26,799
My friend.

1024
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:30,568
Suseo? Jun Hui's sister?

1025
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,750
No, another friend.

1026
01:16:37,904 --> 01:16:39,200
You're done, right?

1027
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:42,170
I'm hungry. Let's head out and eat.

1028
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:45,360
You're supposed to treat me, remember?

1029
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:50,509
I think I have some work left to do.

1030
01:16:50,509 --> 01:16:53,288
What else besides the weekly report?

1031
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:56,229
You did it all.

1032
01:16:56,229 --> 01:16:59,649
What's with you? Don't you want to treat me?

1033
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:02,614
Let's go. I'll treat you.

1034
01:17:07,305 --> 01:17:09,890
Thank you for the meal.

1035
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,282
I think I'm going to faint.

1036
01:17:12,282 --> 01:17:14,107
Let's do the second round next time.

1037
01:17:14,107 --> 01:17:16,599
What? You aren't even paying.

1038
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:17,817
That's not the point.

1039
01:17:17,818 --> 01:17:21,218
You're trying to get everything for free today.

1040
01:17:22,897 --> 01:17:24,143
Isn't that her?

1041
01:17:24,143 --> 01:17:27,535
- Pretty girl from the coffee company?
- Where?

1042
01:17:29,025 --> 01:17:30,969
- Noona.
- Hello.

1043
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:33,260
Hello.

1044
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:34,243
Where are you going?

1045
01:17:34,243 --> 01:17:36,254
We were going to eat.

1046
01:17:36,255 --> 01:17:37,926
You must be having a work dinner.

1047
01:17:37,926 --> 01:17:40,655
Yes, just a few of us.

1048
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:41,955
Where are you going to eat?

1049
01:17:41,956 --> 01:17:43,652
Just somewhere around here.

1050
01:17:43,652 --> 01:17:46,008
We are looking for a place.

1051
01:17:46,008 --> 01:17:51,348
You must've eaten already, Jun Hui.

1052
01:17:51,348 --> 01:17:54,668
Oh, well...

1053
01:17:54,668 --> 01:17:56,399
We are going for a second round at a bar.

1054
01:17:56,399 --> 01:17:59,927
Would it be inconvenient for you to join since they don't serve meals?

1055
01:17:59,927 --> 01:18:01,878
I don't know.

1056
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:05,078
We weren't that hungry anyway.

1057
01:18:07,087 --> 01:18:09,737
Many people think I'm like that.

1058
01:18:09,737 --> 01:18:12,001
But I'm not at all.

1059
01:18:12,001 --> 01:18:15,249
I don't have much experience dating.

1060
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:18,939
Section Chief Yun is more impressive than I am.

1061
01:18:18,939 --> 01:18:20,964
Oh, really?

1062
01:18:20,964 --> 01:18:26,189
Then what kind... well, what kind of guy do you like?

1063
01:18:26,189 --> 01:18:28,157
Well, whatever.

1064
01:18:28,157 --> 01:18:30,218
Just someone I'm comfortable with.

1065
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:33,178
Oh, so you don't like bad guys.

1066
01:18:33,179 --> 01:18:36,654
- Seo Jun Hui is out then!
- You're out. Go home.

1067
01:18:36,654 --> 01:18:40,267
Jun Hui is the bad guy type?

1068
01:18:40,267 --> 01:18:43,424
- They're just saying that.
- "Just saying," he says.

1069
01:18:43,424 --> 01:18:45,943
All right, suppose it isn't true.

1070
01:18:45,944 --> 01:18:48,200
Have you ever not succeeded when you liked someone?

1071
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,070
No, right? What does that mean?

1072
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:54,912
If you set your mind to it, all the girls you like...

1073
01:18:54,912 --> 01:18:56,093
Shut up before I kill you.

1074
01:18:56,093 --> 01:18:59,532
Is your success rate a hundred percent?

1075
01:19:01,461 --> 01:19:05,089
No, it's ninety-nine percent.

1076
01:19:05,089 --> 01:19:07,830
What? Who is the one percent?

1077
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:11,579
That means there's a woman who Seo Jun Hui couldn't win over.

1078
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:13,661
Who is it?

1079
01:19:13,661 --> 01:19:15,562
Who?

1080
01:19:25,231 --> 01:19:28,005
Drink, drink.

1081
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:53,610
Do you know who Jun Hui is talking about?

1082
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:56,049
How would I know that?

1083
01:19:57,919 --> 01:20:01,669
She's probably younger than us, right?

1084
01:20:01,669 --> 01:20:05,797
We aren't that old either.

1085
01:20:05,797 --> 01:20:10,103
Weren't you going on about being unable to get up in the morning because of your age?

1086
01:20:10,103 --> 01:20:14,118
That's when I'm really tired or in a bad condition.

1087
01:20:16,028 --> 01:20:20,706
What could be so great about this woman that Seo Jun Hui couldn't get her?

1088
01:20:23,898 --> 01:20:28,609
By the way, why have you been smiling so much this whole time?

1089
01:20:28,609 --> 01:20:32,318
Me? No, I haven't.

1090
01:20:33,932 --> 01:20:36,804
Anyway, there is someone.

1091
01:20:37,442 --> 01:20:40,760
But they haven't progressed much in their relationship.

1092
01:20:42,283 --> 01:20:46,135
This is why I have to get in there and get him first.

1093
01:20:48,727 --> 01:20:51,580
I better progress things quickly.

1094
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,318
Make things passionate.

1095
01:21:01,477 --> 01:21:03,596
What is the problem anyway?

1096
01:21:03,596 --> 01:21:08,389
If a player like you is hesitating, there must be a reason.

1097
01:21:09,108 --> 01:21:12,077
It's just... I'm not sure.

1098
01:21:12,077 --> 01:21:13,491
What does that mean?

1099
01:21:13,492 --> 01:21:15,600
Do you mean you aren't sure about her?

1100
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,606
No... I am.

1101
01:21:19,606 --> 01:21:20,850
I am, but...

1102
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:23,200
Is she not sure about you?

1103
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:28,679
I... I haven't been able to ask her yet.

1104
01:21:29,701 --> 01:21:32,300
Do you also get nervous?

1105
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,830
Why? Is it because you'll be rejected?

1106
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:37,631
That's why I said I'm not sure!

1107
01:21:38,511 --> 01:21:42,642
Does she know you've turned into a blubbering idiot?

1108
01:21:42,642 --> 01:21:44,351
"Idiot"... how am I an idiot?

1109
01:21:44,351 --> 01:21:46,443
Gosh...

1110
01:21:47,099 --> 01:21:48,799
You must like her a lot.

1111
01:21:48,799 --> 01:21:51,413
You're just dying. You're dying.

1112
01:21:51,413 --> 01:21:53,542
What are you saying?

1113
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:56,452
Okay. Let's talk about something else.

1114
01:21:56,452 --> 01:22:01,831
Anyway, that means you two aren't in a confirmed relationship.

1115
01:22:01,831 --> 01:22:03,445
Right?

1116
01:22:10,029 --> 01:22:13,512
So far, not yet...

1120

You don't know how important timing between men and women is.

1121
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:56,000
Are we dating now?

1122
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,321
- I said, you're pretty!
- You're crazy!

1123
01:22:58,321 --> 01:23:01,054
I am crazy... about someone.

1124
01:23:01,054 --> 01:23:04,439
Do you want to come over to my place?

1125
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:07,409
Will we really be okay?

1126
01:23:07,409 --> 01:23:08,883
Did we commit a crime?

1127
01:23:08,884 --> 01:23:10,883
Be conservative with your body.

1128
01:23:10,883 --> 01:23:14,532
If someone gets your body, word will get around.

1129
01:23:14,532 --> 01:23:17,254
Jin Ah said she would come over, but I can't reach her.

1130
01:23:17,254 --> 01:23:19,093

1132
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,404
