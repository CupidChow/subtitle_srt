1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,116
Will you really be okay?

2
00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:07,576
Of course, you know I can act. I'm sure I won't get caught.

00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:10,076
[Episode 6]

4
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:38,193
D-Dad!

5
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,875
Did you go exercise?

6
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,369
Yes.

7
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:53,484
Jin Ah.

8
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:57,957
I want you to...

9
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,599
I... lied to you.

10
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,834
Is it something that could...

11
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:27,406
make me disappointed in you?

12
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:33,542
Yes.

13
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,691
But you might not be.

14
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:51,577
I'm going to try to make it so that you're not.

15
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:58,131
I can't... tell you anything now.

16
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,640
Please wait a little bit.

17
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,541
I'll tell you everything later.

18
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,571
Until then...

19
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:16,641
please trust me and wait.

20
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,610
Are you angry?

21
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,340
I mean...

22
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:30,344
Why are you sitting there with your head bowed?

23
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,083
What are you two doing?

24
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:46,362
I just want to exercise with you. Is that something to pout about?

25
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:50,493
I'm just saying it for your health.

26
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:52,262
Don't you know that it's all for you?

27
00:02:52,262 --> 00:02:53,904
You're worrying about strange things.

28
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:56,226
She's young. She can handle it herself.

29
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:58,613
Why are you bothering her on her day off?

30
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:01,289
Stop being silly and get out.

31
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:05,889
Goodness, why are you acting so out of character?

32
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,631
And why are you standing there like that?

33
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:12,232
Oh my. Did you get changed to go with him?

34
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:13,881
I'll get going.

35
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:18,282
If you don't want to go, why are you forcing yourself to go?

36
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:32,120
♫ Sometimes it's hard to be a woman ♫

37
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:41,000
♫ Giving all your love to just one man♫

38
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:52,770
♫ You'll have the bad times and he'll have the good times ♫

39
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:59,140
♫ Doing things that you don't understand ♫

40
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:08,120
♫ But if you love him, you'll forgive him ♫

41
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:18,070
♫ Even though he's hard to understand ♫

42
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:29,050
♫ And if you love him, oh, be proud of him ♫

43
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:35,450
♫ 'Cause after all he's just a man ♫

44
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:47,660
♫ Stand by your man. Give him two arms to cling to ♫

45
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:56,070
♫ And something warm to come to when nights are cold and lonely ♫

46
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,567
♫ Stand by your man ♫

47
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,767
It's been two hours, right?

48
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,420
I think so.

49
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:10,146
Let's go then.

50
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,639
Dad.

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,590
♫ Stand by your man ♫

52
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:32,590
♫ Stand by your man and show the world you love him ♫

53
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,110
♫ Keep giving all... ♫

54
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:36,913
Why do you keep saying that everything's okay?

55
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:39,826
What did he say?

56
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:45,287
Don't suffer by yourself.

57
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:48,784
I'm really not.

58
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:52,485
I wish he would've just yelled at me.

59
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:55,938
I shouldn't have held you back yesterday.

60
00:05:57,377 --> 00:06:00,625
I'm not a woman who can be held back, even if you try.

61
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,925
I stayed because I wanted to.

62
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:06,760
I should be the one comforting you, not the other way around.

63
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,360
It's not trying to comfort you. I'm just telling you the truth.

64
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:15,100
You're so beautiful.

65
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,950
I know that.

66
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,837
When will you show me that pretty face of yours?

67
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:24,347
I'll come pick you up later.

68
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:28,848
I should stay home today. I do have a conscience, after all.

69
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:39,217
Don't worry. I can do a good job.

70
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:41,111
I have you.

71
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:44,637
Next to me...

72
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:50,126
I have Seo Jun Hui, so what would I be scared of?

73
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:52,327
I'm not at all afraid.

74
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:58,512
- Yun Jin Ah.
- Yes?

75
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:01,254
I love you.

76
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,483
I really love you a lot.

77
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:36,780
♫ I feel you now from here ♫

78
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:43,480
♫ Our time is not done yet ♫

79
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,640
♫ You've given me my fullest heart ♫

80
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:56,100
♫ We'll never be apart ♫

81
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:13,300
♫ I'm breathing through you now ♫

82
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:20,070
♫ The love we have so true ♫

83
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:26,720
♫ I never thought that I could need someone ♫

84
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,080
♫ the way I do ♫

85
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:46,371
[I want to see you soon.]

86
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:48,781
[Me too. Take your time coming, but I am dying to see you.]

87
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:50,454
[Dad is going to bed! I'll run right over.]

88
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:51,850
[Come soon. I'll hug you.]

89
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:56,051
[We just hung up, but I want to hear your voice and see you again.]

90
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:01,388
Have you eaten?

91
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:03,222
I don't have an appetite.

92
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:05,623
Have you not eaten all day?

93
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:07,160
Oh no.

94
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:11,261
Do you want anything? Tell me, I'll go buy it for you.

95
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:13,828
Not really.

96
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:18,049
You should eat something. Can't you think of anything?

97
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,780
No.

98
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:24,432
I do feel like eating something spicy.

99
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,338
"Something spicy"?

100
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,939
You must want kimchi stew.

101
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,664
Now that you mention it, I'm really craving it.

102
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:34,255
We should go to Mom's place then. You love her kimchi stew.

103
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:36,273
Gosh, why make such a fuss?

104
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:41,869
Mom always says that we should let her know if we want to eat anything.

105
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,943
Give me your phone. I should call Jin Ah first.

106
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:46,745
Wait, I'm looking at something.

107
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:51,600
Hold on. I'll tell the manager that I'm leaving and get my bag.

108
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:01,559
- You're here.
- Mom.

109
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,781
Why do you always bring something when you come, like some stranger?

110
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:07,081
It's just fruit.

111
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:10,854
- Dad, we're here.
- Oh, hi.

112
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:12,919
- Hello.
- Come on in.

113
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,259
He was excited to day drink, so he's been grilling meat.

114
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:19,767
I feel the same as Dad...

115
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:20,969
What about Yun Jin Ah?

116
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:22,391
She's still sleeping.

117
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:24,792
When I'm here?

118
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,923
You wench!

119
00:10:38,923 --> 00:10:42,322
Oh, you scared me! What is this?

120
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:43,770
- Hey.
- What?

121
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,390
What are you doing?

122
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,449
What are you doing here? You didn't even call.

123
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:49,929
Oh my! Oh!

124
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,430
Hey! Oh no.

125
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:54,967
- Ouch!
- Sorry, sorry.

126
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,769
When... when did you get here?

127
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:01,189
I called Mom before coming.

128
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:06,989
Hey, I know it's your day off, but how can you still be sleeping?

129
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:09,589
What did you do yesterday?

130
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:12,982
What... what would I do?

131
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:14,775
Stuttering?

132
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:17,231
You're acting very suspicious.

133
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:19,496
Tell the truth right this instant!

134
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:21,075
What truth!

135
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:25,175
Hey... you!

136
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,638
You made so much kimchi stew.

137
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,783
You said Jun Hui wanted it.

138
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,983
He didn't have an appetite, but I think he will eat very well.

139
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:53,405
It's taking so long.

140
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:15,805
I need to make a phone call.

141
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:23,894
Why did you come?

142
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:25,994
Hey, are you crazy?

143
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,912
I was dying to see you. What could I do?

144
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,533
You're really crazy!

145
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:30,708
Yes, I am.

146
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,909
What? Hey!

147
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,156
Seriously, get out.

148
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,557
- Why?
- What do you mean "Why"?

149
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:41,358
Why didn't you say anything though?

150
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:42,958
Say what?

151
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:45,939
I told you that I loved you.

152
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,060
Ah...

153
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,471
"Ah"?

154
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:53,740
Oh?

155
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:55,340
Oh, look at you.

156
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,916
"Look at you"?

157
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,740
Look at you.

158
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:01,590
Where did they go?

159
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:04,773
What the heck? What are you doing?

160
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:08,266
Gosh, I told him to leave. What's he doing in my room?

161
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,345
Listen to your elders, would you?

162
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:13,302
- When will you grow up?
- I know.

163
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:16,001
I'm hungry. Let's hurry up and eat.

164
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:21,521
Jun Hui, eat a lot.

165
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:24,881
And come over whenever you feel like having a home-cooked meal.

166
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:27,172
It doesn't matter if no one is home.

167
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,595
You can help yourself to whatever you want.

168
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,096
I will.

169
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,663
No matter what I make for him, he doesn't seem satisfied.

170
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:37,468
I think he's only ravenous for your cooking.

171
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:39,929
Wait until he gets married. He'll only want his wife's food.

172
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:43,179
That depends on who he marries.

173
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,361
An employee at Jin Ah's company has been interested in Jun Hui lately.

174
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:49,172
Oh, really? Who is she?

175
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:51,643
She's the section chief who took over my store for Jin Ah.

176
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:53,310
Her name is Kang Se Yeong.

177
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,610
She's already laying down the foundation by sucking up to me.

178
00:13:58,414 --> 00:14:01,214
- You noticed, too, right?
- I did.

179
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:04,257
Oh, is that right?

180
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:06,358
I knew as soon as I met her.

181
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:09,576
You must've been really happy.

182
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,348
Yun Jin Ah sure is dense. I knew right away, too.

183
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:16,650
I guess I'm the only one who didn't.

184
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,707
She's popular in the building because she's so pretty.

185
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:19,989
I see.

186
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,813
So she has good looks. What is her family like?

187
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:24,918
Mom.

188
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:27,869
What? Do you know how important that is?

189
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,418
What do her parents do?

190
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:31,919
How would I know that?

191
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:35,789
Jun Hui, you know...

192
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,778
when you date someone, it can't just be about liking them.

193
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:42,878
You have to look at that person's parents, siblings, and the entire family.

194
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:45,127
But what's so great about us?

195
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:46,715
That's why you have to be even more mindful.

196
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:50,015
At least one side of the family should have something.

197
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,831
Stop talking about frivolous things.

198
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,165
Let's just eat.

199
00:14:56,166 --> 00:15:00,626
How is that frivolous? It's about their future.

200
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:03,018
They're all grown up now. They can handle it on their own.

201
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:05,217
Why must you make them uncomfortable?

202
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:06,870
Oh my.

203
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,462
Did you two find that offensive?

204
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:12,194
Will you keep going?

205
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:13,714
Then I'll just go to my room.

206
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,620
Jin Ah, relax.

207
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:18,189
What? She's just trying to help.

208
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,972
That's right. I am.

209
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:24,029
I guess what I'm saying may sound unpleasant.

210
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,727
But it's not like I have any other intention. It's all to help Jun Hui.

211
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,856
Jun Hui, you understand, right?

212
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:32,029
Of course. I'm thankful.

213
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,311
Also, don't worry about it. I'll handle it well on my own.

214
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,611
Okay. Eat this too, Jun Hui.

215
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,790
Section Chief, big news.

216
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,654
It happened in the purchasing team too.

217
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:55,585
What did?

218
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:57,794
The resource team and purchasing team went for dinner.

219
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:00,384
Section Chief Choi declined Manager Oh's drink.

220
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:04,192
"Don't force me. I'll sue you for human rights violation."

221
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:05,584
She said that.

222
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:09,443
Wow, is this Yun Jin Ah's butterfly effect?

223
00:16:09,444 --> 00:16:11,842
It really was out of the blue.

224
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:15,802
Who knew our Yun Tambourine could do something so bold?

225
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:18,312
No one could have imagined it.

226
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,741
What could have caused her to change?

227
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:23,491
Whatever the reason, we should applaud it.

228
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:27,882
I hope the backlash doesn't fall on us.

229
00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:29,494
I'm worried about that, too.

230
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:31,534
I don't think the higher-ups will stay put.

231
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:33,433
Let them try.

232
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:36,134
There's no way I'm letting it go this time.

233
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:53,112
[Announcement: Chairman's dinner. All female employees are invited.]

234
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,223
Come in.

235
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Did you see the announcement?

236
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:47,114
Discuss it with the female employees and choose a place for the dinner.

237
00:17:47,114 --> 00:17:48,614
Okay.

238
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:50,855
One more thing.

239
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:58,293
Any issues with the company, especially any discomfort they experience from discrimination...

240
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:01,778
Get the female employees' opinions on it and bring a report on it.

241
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:04,834
I understand.

242
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,152
Tell them that it will be anonymous, so they can name any perpetrators.

243
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:13,622
Chairman Jo, wouldn't it be unfair to only listen to one side?

244
00:18:13,622 --> 00:18:16,822
Dealing with the situation will be the next step.

245
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:22,503
Why? Is there something you feel guilty about?

246
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:26,454
Only the victims would know.

247
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:41,505
Oh my. Where are you off to?

248
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:43,792
Yes.

249
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,300
No.

250
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,392
"Love U"?

251
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:49,486
Do you want to die?

252
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:51,555
So you do have a girlfriend.

253
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:53,103
Mind your own business.

254
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:54,981
Who is it?

255
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:56,890
Are you possibly...

256
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:58,869
What?

257
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,169
Are you seeing a married woman?

258
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:05,369
Judging from how annoyed you look, I must be right.

259
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:07,068
Who is she?

260
00:19:07,768 --> 00:19:12,068
You still have time, so don't drive too fast.

261
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,199
I miss you, too.

262
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:19,200
Okay. See you later.

263
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:25,798
I had to contact the office so I was talking to my colleague.

264
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,254
Are you dating someone at work?

265
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:29,654
No, he works at a different...

266
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:35,094
Should I get a written apology or handle it internally?

267
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:37,904
Can I just treat you to a meal and call it even?

268
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:39,397
I'm not hungry yet.

269
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:40,950
But do you know

270
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,750
that when you date secretly, it tends to be more obvious?

271
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,520
Is it good?

272
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,620
Yes. Try it.

273
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:03,243
Oh, it's good.

274
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:07,355
What's the problem? I've done worse.

275
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:09,633
Wow, now you're going all out.

276
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,534
Why? Should I do more?

277
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:19,725
When we came here before...

278
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:25,100
I wanted to ask you to date me.

279
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:28,823
I wanted to say it a thousand times, but I couldn't.

280
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:31,743
Did you know that?

281
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:36,043
I was dying of frustration that night.

282
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:42,172
You know the day we first met?

283
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:46,413
Well, I mean when we ran into each after so long.

284
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:49,214
Why did you pass by and pretend you didn't know me?

285
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,084
♫ Sometimes it's hard ♫

286
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:57,763
I was leaving work on my bike.

287
00:20:57,763 --> 00:20:59,988
I saw this woman walking over from afar.

288
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:03,040
I was strangely curious about her.

289
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,658
Gosh, you men...

290
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:08,320
It wasn't like that.

291
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,294
So I just went to take a look.

292
00:21:10,294 --> 00:21:12,203
She was so pretty.

293
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,707
And in that moment, when I was thinking, "Wow, she's great..."

294
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,086
I realized, "Oh, it's Yun Jin Ah?"

295
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:21,377
- So were you disappointed?
- I was surprised.

296
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:23,670
"Is this the Yun Jin Ah I know?"

297
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:26,701
"Was she always this pretty?"

298
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,211
Oh, please!

299
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:33,111
It's true. I really was shocked.

300
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:43,250
♫ Even though he's hard to understand ♫

301
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,670
♫ And if you love him ♫

318
00:24:18,138 --> 00:24:21,082
How petty of you to do that when I was asleep.

319
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:23,681
Who told you to fall asleep?

320
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:25,160
Who fell asleep first?

321
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,260
You should've woken me up.

322
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:30,921
Gosh... I should have.

323
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,471
What right do you have to laugh?

324
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:42,931
I don't think I have any right to.

325
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:49,065
Seriously, this is a big problem.

326
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:51,365
Why?

327
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:57,350
I want to brag about you to everyone, you're so pretty.

328
00:24:59,117 --> 00:25:03,657
I'm being very serious here. I might get sick over it.

329
00:25:03,657 --> 00:25:05,735
What the heck.

330
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,304
On that note...

331
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:13,305
Do you want to meet my friends?

332
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,405
"Your friends"?

333
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:20,855
There's a camping trip for couples.

334
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:23,155
You can go if you have a partner.

335
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:30,504
I said I would think about it. If you don't want to...

336
00:25:30,504 --> 00:25:34,180
It's not that, but they're all couples...

337
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:36,481
I'll be so behind.

338
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,842
Looking at me like that won't make me feel better.

339
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:44,142
I would also be the oldest one there.

340
00:25:46,403 --> 00:25:48,703
Aigoo.

341
00:25:50,476 --> 00:25:52,880
Stop that.

342
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,900
♫ We've got time to see it through ♫

343
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,410
♫ I'm just sorry for ♫

344
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:11,630
♫ I'm just sorry for ♫

345
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:34,246
This is pretty shocking.

346
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:36,729
"There's no way out of an awkward situation."

347
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:40,413
That's a good phrase for times like this.

348
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:43,213
How do I use this?

349
00:26:43,213 --> 00:26:47,076
I'll be your servant from now on, Geum Bo Ra.

350
00:26:47,077 --> 00:26:49,991
Hey, don't make me out to be a lowly person.

351
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:53,794
I'm wondering how to use this against Kang Se Yeong.

352
00:26:53,794 --> 00:26:56,565
She's all riled up by herself.

353
00:26:56,566 --> 00:27:01,004
She's the goddess who has won a 100 out of a 100 and wants to win 101.

354
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:05,405
But she lost to a totally unexpected person.

355
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:07,576
It's already so much fun.

356
00:27:07,577 --> 00:27:10,776
Just overlook it, please.

357
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:14,670
I did think

358
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,566
the change in your behavior was unusual.

359
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:18,785
But it's very cool.

360
00:27:18,785 --> 00:27:21,184
I'm asking you to overlook this.

361
00:27:21,185 --> 00:27:23,769
I'm not making fun of you. I sincerely mean it.

362
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,869
I want to applaud you for your courage.

363
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:31,030
I mean it.

364
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,320
I really want to thank you.

365
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,436
It isn't like I'm giving you permission to have an affair.

366
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:38,138
Forget it.

367
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:40,765
Just treat me big time later.

368
00:27:40,765 --> 00:27:42,295
Treat me when you're alone.

369
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:45,495
Don't come out together and start kissing away.

370
00:27:48,774 --> 00:27:52,475
Would you like some tea, Ms. Geum Bo Ra?

371
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,685
Hi.

372
00:27:57,685 --> 00:27:59,985
Good morning.

373
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:03,526
You must be happy about something.

374
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:05,148
Does it seem like that?

375
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:08,787
Yes, you seem different.

376
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,387
It's almost as if you're dating.

377
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:15,684
Is it true?

378
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:16,790
Hello.

379
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:19,792
- Hello.
- Hello, Jun Hui.

380
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:43,707
Are you working off-site today?

381
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:46,209
My schedule is always full.

382
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,210
I have to leave as soon as the meeting is over.

383
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:55,628
I would love to go away for a day and have some fun.

384
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:59,107
I'd like to go somewhere nice and buy you a meal.

385
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:01,408
You're busy though.

386
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:05,419
My appointments start in the afternoon.

387
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:09,117
Do you have lunch plans, by any chance?

388
00:29:11,694 --> 00:29:13,994
Thankfully, I don't.

389
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:18,463
Then shall we have lunch together?

390
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:19,962
Sounds good.

391
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:23,663
Think of a place you want to go to. I'll treat you to whatever you'd like.

392
00:29:23,663 --> 00:29:25,459
Okay.

393
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,960
I was just joking.

394
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,720
What's going on?

395
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:48,959
With Seo... Seo Jun Hui.

396
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,220
You said you were busy.

397
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,419
I just found someone to have lunch with.

398
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,420
Why are you so shaken up over it?

399
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,120
That isn't like you, Kang Se Yeong.

400
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,221
Section Chief Kang. If you're heading out now, can you drop me off at the subway?

401
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:42,335
Why don't you use your legs? Walk!

402
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,786
No one yelled at her at the meeting. What's with her?

403
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,207
What's going on with you, Section Chief Geum?

404
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,726
Do this report again.

405
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,837
Yes, I will.

406

[Geum Bo Ra / Kang Se Yeong]

407
00:31:11,924 --> 00:31:16,013
Why is Chairman Jo having this company dinner?

408
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:20,564
I believe it's merely a management decision.

409
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:24,403
Well, although it's the chairman's event,

410
00:31:24,403 --> 00:31:28,134
if any executives need to attend, you know, I could–

411
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:31,735
He didn't mention any need for that.

412
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,293
Is there anything else?

413
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,094
There is nothing else.

414
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,901
Then you may leave.

415
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,699
The female employees are definitely acting strange.

416
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:04,748
Geum Bo Ra has now become like Yun Jin Ah.

417
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:08,120
Suddenly, she's taking orders without any issues.

418

What's going on here?

419
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:14,488
Did you sense anything?

420
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:16,290
Not at all.

421
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,258
I think you should all be careful around the female employees for now.

422
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:22,020
I think that is necessary.

423
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,321
We should be careful? What did we even do?

424
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,178
Well, when we hang out and go drinking–

All right.

427

Do you know what? Let's ban our team dinners for now. Ban them.

428
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,871
When did you get here?

429
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:56,212
I was totally fooled by Geum Bo Ra. How absurd.

What did Section Chief Geum do? Did something happen?

- Yes, it's shockingly funny.
- Sorry.

438

What should I do? I have to stop it before they get any further.

Kang Se Yeong, you're popular even without Seo Jun Hui.

440

It's not just anyone though. Do you want me to stand by and watch Geum Bo Ra steal him from me?

441
00:33:46,912 --> 00:33:51,723
Do you think my pride would allow that? I can never allow that.

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,508
It's my first time seeing Jun Hui Oppa's girlfriend.

491
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:50,008
Me, too.

492
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,116
She's pretty, right?

493
00:38:54,116 --> 00:38:56,632
- Seriously?
- Seriously!

494
00:38:56,632 --> 00:39:00,086
What, what? She is pretty.

495
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:02,263
You're older than us, right? How old are you?

496
00:39:02,263 --> 00:39:05,915
Hey, it's rude to ask that when we just met.

497
00:39:05,915 --> 00:39:07,616
Oh, is it?

498
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,704
I'll be forty the day after tomorrow.

499
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,109
You don't look it at all.

500
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:32,931
Wow!

501
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:35,532
I really couldn't tell.

502
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,909
You don't need to do it. You should rest.

503
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:42,866
Why? Let's do it together.

504
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:44,536
No, please rest. Go rest.

505
00:39:44,536 --> 00:39:46,748
Yes, go on. We will be done soon.

506
00:39:46,748 --> 00:39:48,649
Go on and rest.

507
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:54,720
♫ You can dance every dance with the guy that gives you the eye ♫

508
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,784
Unnie, we will get that.

509
00:39:56,784 --> 00:39:57,975
No, I'm almost done.

510
00:39:57,975 --> 00:39:59,954
Oh no! You should rest.

511
00:39:59,954 --> 00:40:02,165
- No.
- Oh no.

512
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:05,180
- Please rest.
- We will do it.

516
00:40:12,975 --> 00:40:14,014
Thank you.

517
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:17,016
How much? Only with words?

518
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:20,473
Why don't we play foot volleyball to get some exercise?

519
00:40:20,473 --> 00:40:22,606
"Foot volleyball"? No, thanks.

520
00:40:22,606 --> 00:40:24,730
Just do it once.

521
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,346
Hey, how can we play with just the three of us?

522
00:40:27,346 --> 00:40:29,246
Let's play.

523
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,199
"Foot volleyball"? That sounds like fun.

524
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,308
Do you want to play?

525
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:39,130
Great kick!

526
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,860
I got it, I got it!

527
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,370
Out!

528
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,860
- Oh no!
- Are you okay?

529
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:56,330
Nice!

Jun Hui!

539
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,880

543
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,480
Forty centimeters of snow is expected in the Gangwon area.

544
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:56,185
Why did she suddenly go on a trip?

545
00:41:57,602 --> 00:41:59,860
- Was that Jin Ah?
- Yes.

546
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,760
She's coming tomorrow because of the snow.

547
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,931
Do you really think she went with her work colleagues?

548
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,580
The snow and rain falling now will not stop until tomorrow afternoon.

Are they angry?

552
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:25,748
They're just worried.

553
00:42:25,748 --> 00:42:27,138
We shouldn't have come.

554
00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:29,608
You don't really mean that.

555
00:42:29,608 --> 00:42:30,680
You caught me.

556
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,570

00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,985
I know you tried hard just for me.

559
00:42:39,986 --> 00:42:42,184
What are you talking about? I had lots of fun.

560
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,285
Let's do this again.

561
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,050
Gosh, I adore you to death.

♫ Save the last dance for me ♫

563
00:42:52,557 --> 00:42:56,347
You still don't know them well. Will you be okay sleeping with them?

564
00:42:56,348 --> 00:42:58,230
What can I do about that?

565
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,030
I'm just a bit disappointed that it isn't a certain guy.

566
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,040
There's a guy right here.

567
00:43:05,902 --> 00:43:07,701
I know.

568
00:43:08,621 --> 00:43:10,321
Gosh, you...

569
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,421
- It's snowing too much.
- Should we go in?

570
00:43:22,076 --> 00:43:24,800
You can go in anytime you walk by.

571
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:26,842
It's good whenever you go in.

572
00:43:26,842 --> 00:43:28,023
What did you eat?

573
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:30,837
- The sushi, ramen, and udon are good too.
- I love sushi.

574
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:33,884
- Udon?
- Nabe, they have that too. So good.

575
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:35,090
What's nabe?

576
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:38,918
Nabe? It's like in a pot...

577
00:43:38,918 --> 00:43:42,452
Unnie, please use what you need. I don't know if the makeup is right.

578
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,525
I can use whatever there is.

579
00:43:45,526 --> 00:43:50,226
I carry most things with me, too, but you're all quite something.

580
00:43:51,043 --> 00:43:53,253
I usually keep my stuff in my boyfriend's car.

581
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:54,606
To prepare for situations like this.

582
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:57,103
I know you purposely make these things happen.

583
00:43:57,103 --> 00:43:59,617
Yes, she probably made the storm happen too.

584
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:00,965
She's like a god.

585
00:44:00,965 --> 00:44:03,466
How did you know?

586
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:07,444
Unnie, you work, right? I totally envy you.

587
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,345
I couldn't get a job, so I went to graduate school.

588
00:44:11,645 --> 00:44:15,445
I heard many people do that lately.

589
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,131
At least you got into graduate school.

590
00:44:18,131 --> 00:44:23,431
I use all of my money from part-time jobs to apply for jobs.

591
00:44:23,431 --> 00:44:25,586
Hey, do you think getting a job is the end of it?

592
00:44:25,586 --> 00:44:28,945
Look at me. I'm at my fourth company and I want to leave.

593
00:44:28,945 --> 00:44:30,445
Why?

594
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:36,697
Every company I get hired into just makes the female employees get coffee.

595
00:44:36,697 --> 00:44:38,882
I got the job with a good resume.

596
00:44:38,882 --> 00:44:41,258
I'm not some personal secretary.

597
00:44:41,258 --> 00:44:44,158
They keep excluding me from my actual job duties.

598
00:44:45,178 --> 00:44:47,894
I've been through all of that, too.

599
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,894
- You, too?
- Of course.

600
00:44:57,959 --> 00:45:01,759
Is this a temple? Talk, would you?

601
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:03,474
You talk.

602
00:45:04,854 --> 00:45:09,403
Gosh, it's so boring when it's just a bunch of guys.

603
00:45:09,403 --> 00:45:12,604
What are the girls doing that it's so quiet?

604
00:45:22,488 --> 00:45:24,686
That is totally true.

605
00:45:24,686 --> 00:45:28,086
- What are you doing?
- Cheers!

606
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:31,018
Wait.

607
00:45:32,073 --> 00:45:34,644
Get out of here!

608
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:36,494
- Hey, go back down.
- Go down.

609
00:45:36,494 --> 00:45:40,994
Get out of here!

610
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:50,942

- I'll call you.
- Call me.

613
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,460
Get back safely.

614
00:46:08,029 --> 00:46:10,949
- Bye!
- I've never seen you relax around girls like that.

615
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:13,678
Be careful. You'll lose your pretty girlfriend.

616
00:46:13,678 --> 00:46:14,978

Thanks.

640
00:49:28,785 --> 00:49:31,886
Why did you bother bringing so much?

641
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:35,954
I just brought some side dishes since I was coming by.

642
00:49:35,954 --> 00:49:38,568
Pickled vegetables? Looks good.

643

Thank you.

Are you heading to a gathering with friends?

645
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,162
Not a gathering, really.

646
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:48,110
My friend married off her eldest daughter last year.

647
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,373
Now her son is getting married.

648
00:49:50,373 --> 00:49:53,849
She's just buying me a meal because she feels bad.

649
00:49:53,849 --> 00:49:56,749
Do you think I can eat in peace at such a place?

650
00:49:57,396 --> 00:49:59,649
Yun Jin Ah is always the problem, right?

651
00:49:59,649 --> 00:50:01,387
Why bother bringing it up?

652
00:50:01,388 --> 00:50:02,942
Hey, now...

653
00:50:02,943 --> 00:50:05,802
- Don't you know anyone decent for her?
- Don't even bring it up.

654
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:08,782
I was drinking with her and Jun Hui when I brought up a setup.

655
00:50:08,783 --> 00:50:10,764
I was cursed out.

656
00:50:10,764 --> 00:50:12,707
They were both glaring at me.

657
00:50:12,707 --> 00:50:15,563
I suppose Jin Ah could, but why would Jun Hui?

658
00:50:15,564 --> 00:50:20,164
Why? Because I wanted to set her up with someone I don't know very well.

659
00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:22,961
Just let her be.

660
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:25,398
They say that fate shows up out of nowhere.

661
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:27,487
- Well...
- Yes?

662
00:50:27,488 --> 00:50:30,421
- I think she could be dating someone.
- Really?

663
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:32,545
Do you know how she went on a business trip?

664
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:34,889
She said she went with her senior manager.

665
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:37,951
A neighbor saw someone pick her up,

666
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:41,851
but she told me that he was young and very handsome.

667
00:50:43,146 --> 00:50:46,711
- Mom, that was Jun Hui.
- "Jun Hui"?

668
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:50,655
He was going to sketch, so he drove her. I found out later, too.

669
00:50:50,655 --> 00:50:54,415
Oh my. Of course, that's the case.

670
00:50:54,415 --> 00:50:57,025
I'm a fool for thinking otherwise.

671
00:50:57,025 --> 00:51:01,695
It's just that she said she was going to Gangwon-do with her colleagues.

672
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:05,055
I thought that there really must be someone.

673
00:51:05,055 --> 00:51:07,505
Jin Ah went on a trip? With whom?

674
00:51:07,506 --> 00:51:10,839
Section Chief Geum or something. I wouldn't really know.

675
00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:13,439
I just took her word for it.

676
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:14,967
Must be nice.

677
00:51:14,968 --> 00:51:18,128
She needs to have fun with them to get rid of the stress in her life.

678
00:51:18,128 --> 00:51:20,057
That's true, but...

679
00:51:20,057 --> 00:51:22,172
don't just think of it casually.

680
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:25,727
Look for someone who could be a match for Jin Ah.

681
00:51:25,727 --> 00:51:30,127
Jin Ah always does as you say.

682
00:51:30,127 --> 00:51:32,467
That is true. All right.

683
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:35,900
I'll keep an eye out.

684
00:51:53,296 --> 00:51:58,596
Now... I really should head in.

685
00:51:58,596 --> 00:52:00,303
Just one more minute.

686
00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:05,907
- Fifty-nine, fifty-eight, fifty-seven...
- That's too fast!

687
00:52:10,334 --> 00:52:12,047
It's Mom, right?

688
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:13,848
I think so.

689
00:52:17,499 --> 00:52:18,943
- What do we do?
- She didn't see us, right?

690
00:52:18,943 --> 00:52:21,419
No, no, no.

691
00:52:21,419 --> 00:52:23,020
Wait.

692
00:52:29,789 --> 00:52:31,889
Is she gone?

693
00:52:33,968 --> 00:52:35,568
Yes.

694
00:52:50,497 --> 00:52:53,197
Why do we have to do this?

695
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,321
It's not like there's a reason we must not date.

696
00:52:58,321 --> 00:53:01,122
Why do we have to act like criminals?

697
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:03,524
Why are you suddenly asking that?

698
00:53:03,524 --> 00:53:05,804
It's not sudden.

699
00:53:05,804 --> 00:53:09,206
Weren't we the ones who decided to cover it up?

700
00:53:09,206 --> 00:53:10,688
You never know.

701
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,789
They might actually be happy for us if we tell everyone.

702
00:53:15,244 --> 00:53:19,144
Mom and Dad will definitely pass out from shock.

703
00:53:19,144 --> 00:53:23,644
Gyeong Seon will probably turn the world upside down.

704
00:53:23,644 --> 00:53:24,924
She could do that and more.

705
00:53:24,924 --> 00:53:27,325
Are you saying this when you know that?

706
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:30,840
How long do we have to do this?

707
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,947
Everyone will find out someday.

708
00:53:33,947 --> 00:53:36,749
It's just a matter of time. Let's just...

709
00:53:36,749 --> 00:53:38,938
A little longer.

710
00:53:38,938 --> 00:53:40,939
Just a little longer.

711
00:53:45,478 --> 00:53:47,677
Is it because I don't have the "good" background?

712
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,869
Then what could be the problem?

713
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,100
Well... it is kind of hard when one person does have a good background.

714
00:54:06,365 --> 00:54:07,884
Are you trying to put the blame on me?

715
00:54:07,884 --> 00:54:11,310
Not at all. I'm already ready to go.

716
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:14,511
I could go up right now and tell them.

717
00:54:14,511 --> 00:54:18,305
Mother, Father... I love Jin Ah.

718
00:54:18,305 --> 00:54:20,605
Please accept our relationship.

719
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:27,366
"I will never allow it until I'm buried in the ground."

720
00:54:28,305 --> 00:54:30,804
Then I'll give up.

721
00:54:30,804 --> 00:54:35,006
You were just seducing me, how can you give up so quickly?

722
00:54:37,043 --> 00:54:38,743
Oh, you.

723
00:54:39,394 --> 00:54:44,194
Would I really give Yun Jin Ah up? I worked so hard to get her.

724
00:54:46,055 --> 00:54:49,654
Tell me ten reasons you like me.

725
00:54:51,925 --> 00:54:54,084
Is ten too many?

726
00:54:54,084 --> 00:54:55,755
Yes, it is.

727
00:54:55,755 --> 00:54:57,094
I only have one.

728
00:54:57,094 --> 00:54:59,095
"One"!

729
00:55:00,809 --> 00:55:03,209
Because you're Yun Jin Ah.

730
00:55:03,209 --> 00:55:05,093
There's no other reason.

731
00:55:11,523 --> 00:55:15,690
Still, if you think about it some more...

732
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:19,330
You're pretty. You're pretty. Everything about you is pretty.

733
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:24,432
I know you're just saying that because you don't have ten reasons.

734
00:55:24,432 --> 00:55:28,438
You're pretty and you're very pure too.

735
00:55:29,608 --> 00:55:31,708
You're really pretty.

736
00:55:32,464 --> 00:55:34,692
You're playing hard to get.

737
00:55:34,692 --> 00:55:37,228
Your boyfriend is going to work all night.

738
00:55:37,228 --> 00:55:40,777
Is it so hard to kiss me to give me some strength?

739
00:55:40,777 --> 00:55:43,279
Wow, how can you hold that back?

740
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:47,199
You'll end up fired if you don't work.

741
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:51,123
This company can't survive without me, just like someone I know.

742
00:55:51,123 --> 00:55:54,393
Is there someone like that? Who can't live without you?

743
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,896
I won't work, I'm coming back there.

744
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:58,797
Go ahead.

745
00:56:00,088 --> 00:56:02,065
Do you think I can't?

746
00:56:02,065 --> 00:56:04,866
Okay, okay.

747
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:33,591
What's with your lips?

748
00:57:33,591 --> 00:57:36,792
I bought a new lipstick. I tried it on to see. Why?

749
00:57:37,551 --> 00:57:40,009
Has Lee Gyu Min contacted you?

750
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:43,711
Why are you suddenly bringing him up?

751
00:57:48,066 --> 00:57:49,966
What is this?

752
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:55,120
I wasn't going to tell you, but I just can't let it go.

753
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,836
Was he this trashy of a person?

754
00:58:04,573 --> 00:58:07,105
Where... where did you get this?

755
00:58:07,105 --> 00:58:10,006
The flower basket. Jun Hui brought it.

756
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:17,392
Did Jun... Jun Hui see this?

757
00:58:17,392 --> 00:58:20,445
He didn't just see it. He went there and practically killed him.

758
00:58:20,445 --> 00:58:23,346
Seo Jun Hui destroyed his notebook too.

759
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,934
Hey, what are you doing?

760
00:58:54,934 --> 00:58:57,505
Why are you doing this?

761
00:58:57,505 --> 00:59:00,256
Are you crazy? Why are you doing this?

762
00:59:00,256 --> 00:59:02,938
Wait... just wait! I'm sorry.

763
00:59:02,938 --> 00:59:05,909
What is this? What are you doing?

764
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:08,482
Hey, pull yourself together!

765
00:59:08,482 --> 00:59:10,993
Seriously, what are you doing?

766
00:59:10,993 --> 00:59:12,662
Seriously!

767
00:59:12,662 --> 00:59:15,456
Sorry, sorry, sorry! What is it?

768
00:59:15,456 --> 00:59:17,457
Why are you doing this?

769
00:59:42,193 --> 00:59:43,793
Hello.

770
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:46,459
What?

771
00:59:56,495 --> 00:59:57,630
Where are you going?

772
00:59:57,631 --> 00:59:59,304
To see Jun Hui.

773
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:02,805
Why are you seeing Jun Hui this late at night?

774
01:00:04,044 --> 01:00:08,059
He doesn't think about meeting people who will help him out in life.

775
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,362
Both he and his older sister...

776
01:00:10,363 --> 01:00:14,566
I don't know why they're so crazy about that family.

777
01:00:14,566 --> 01:00:18,525
Didn't Jin Ah go to meet Gyeong Seon?

778
01:00:18,525 --> 01:00:20,725
That's why I'm saying this.

779
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:37,802
Are you home?

780
01:00:37,803 --> 01:00:40,053
There's big trouble.

781
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:43,251
Why the big show? Is there a problem with your game?

782
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:46,451
It's for real. Yun Jin Ah is at the police station!

783
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,035
What is it? What happened?

784
01:01:52,035 --> 01:01:53,365
I don't know the details.

785
01:01:53,365 --> 01:01:56,864
My sister called and asked me not to tell Mom and Dad.

786
01:01:57,651 --> 01:02:00,151
I shouldn't have told her about Lee Gyu Min.

787
01:02:04,825 --> 01:02:06,824
How can I help you?

788
01:02:08,294 --> 01:02:11,067
- Hey, hey, hey!
- You punk. Get up!

789
01:02:11,068 --> 01:02:12,755
- Hey!
- Come out!

790
01:02:12,756 --> 01:02:14,921
Come on!

791
01:02:14,921 --> 01:02:16,724
Let go of me. Let go.

792
01:02:16,725 --> 01:02:18,625
What's wrong with you?

793
01:02:29,031 --> 01:02:30,831
Seriously!

794
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:34,067
Even if you are angry, you can't do that here.

795
01:02:34,068 --> 01:02:37,841
You could get charged for obstructing a public official's duty.

796
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:41,320
I'm sorry. I'll talk to him.

797
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,420
I'm sorry. Sorry.

798
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:50,470
Why are you throwing a fit, too?

799
01:02:52,322 --> 01:02:55,422
I'll just get Yun Jin Ah out of there first, okay?

800
01:02:57,827 --> 01:03:00,127
Hey, you just stay here.

801
01:03:00,959 --> 01:03:03,959
Gosh, this guy is crazy.

802
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:10,334
Don't do it, Jun Hui.

803
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:28,410
♫ I feel you now from here ♫

804
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:35,150
♫ Our time is not done yet ♫

805
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:41,530
♫ You've given me my fullest heart ♫

806
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:47,600
♫ We'll never be apart ♫

807
01:03:49,697 --> 01:03:53,596
You've gone through a lot of heartache since you started seeing me, right?

808
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:56,617
Don't worry. I'll do better.

809
01:03:56,617 --> 01:03:58,546
There's something you aren't telling me, isn't there?

810
01:03:58,546 --> 01:04:01,476
Did you have fun in Gangwon-do with Jin Ah?

811
01:04:01,477 --> 01:04:03,877
It's the first I'm hearing about it.

812
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,800
Whatever it is, I'm ready to hear it.

813
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,614
Were you that worried about me?

814
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:15,452
The fact that there's no legal problem has no meaning to us.

815
01:04:15,453 --> 01:04:17,169
Why does it have to be Yun Jin Ah?

816
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:19,634
Because she's Yun Jin Ah.

817
01:04:19,634 --> 01:04:21,021
I'm sorry, Seung Ho.

818
01:04:21,022 --> 01:04:23,322
Hey, hey! Yun Jin Ah!

819
01:04:24,503 --> 01:04:26,604
I never thought...

820
01:04:27,272 --> 01:04:30,972
I would be so loved by someone.

821
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:33,567
I love you...

822
01:04:34,467 --> 01:04:36,467
very much.

823
01:04:38,644 --> 01:04:42,944
I'll love you for a very long time.

824
01:04:42,944 --> 01:04:46,170
♫ I feel everything ♫

825
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:51,380
♫ Never been so exposed... ♫
