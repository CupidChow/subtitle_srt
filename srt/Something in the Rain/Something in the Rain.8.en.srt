00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:54,972
Will you be okay?

169
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:56,373
Yes.

170
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,370
♫ I feel you now from here ♫

171
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:36,100
♫ Our time is not done yet ♫

172
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:42,630
♫ You've given my fullest heart ♫

173
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,780
♫ We'll never be apart ♫

174
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:05,470
♫ I'm breathing through you now ♫

175
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:12,000
♫ The love we have, so true ♫

176
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,460
♫ I never thought that I could need someone

177
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,560
♫ the way I do ♫

178
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,420
♫ And we're meant to be ♫

179
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,620
♫ This is one thing I know ♫

180
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:47,380
♫ I feel everything ♫

181
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,310
♫ Never been so exposed ♫

182
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:01,760
♫ Are there pieces still yet to be discovered with your love? ♫

183
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:10,400
♫ I can see anything through wherever you are ♫

184
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,700
♫ I can feel you ♫

185
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,120
What is it?

186
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,798
Are you angry?

187
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,282
No.

188
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:26,054
You are angry.

189
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:28,548
I'm not right now.

190
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:32,765
Then why are you just driving?

191
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,770
Why won't you look at me?

192
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,489
What's so pretty about you?

193
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:52,298
You weren't like this at the hospital.

194
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:57,332
I'm not overly anxious anymore.

195
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,519
Are you saying you're angry since you aren't anxious anymore?

196
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:07,332
I'm not angry.

197
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:11,361
Then why won't you even look at me?

198
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:14,762
I said that I was sorry.

199
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:17,241
Okay.

200
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:24,398
I'd prefer it if you just got angry.

201
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:27,209
That would be better.

202
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,590
♫ Wherever you are ♫

203
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,100
♫ I can feel you ♫

204
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:56,190
♫ Your smile, your touch, your voice ♫

205
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:03,030
♫ Each detail in your face ♫

206
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,960
♫ I could study everything ♫

207
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,100
♫ about you forever more ♫

208
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,667
What is it?

209
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:26,901
Jun Hui.

210
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:32,348
I just knew that something had happened.

211
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:36,668
I was desperate to be wrong.

212
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:41,328
I really thought I'd go crazy.

213
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
I regretted it so much.

214
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:49,729
I should've bought you a cell phone, even if you said no.

215
00:20:51,078 --> 00:20:53,378
I should've gone to pick you up.

216
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,888
I shouldn't have left you alone.

217
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,890
You scared me for a moment.

218
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,915
Now I really don't think I can live without Yun Jin Ah.

219
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,560
♫ Sometimes it's hard to be a woman ♫

220
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,150
♫ Giving all your love ♫

221
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:54,086
I was going to get really mad at you once I saw you.

222
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:56,387
I lost my chance while taking care of you.

223
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,663
Getting angry is bad for your health.

224
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,907
You know that, yet you always get into trouble.

225
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:11,179
About that...

226
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:17,181
What if I said it is to keep a factor of excitement in our relationship?

227
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,755
Gosh, I'm losing my affection for you.

228
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:24,356
What? "Losing affection"?

229
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,191
You're going to regret that.

230
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:29,045
Not at all.

231
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:30,606
Are you sure?

232
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:34,707
I called and told my parents that I can't come home tonight.

233
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,872
Though I suppose

234
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:40,910
you wouldn't care whether a girl you lost affection for made it home or not.

235
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,580
Why would it matter to you?

236
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,920
♫ After all, he's just a man. ♫

237
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,633
Let's hurry home.

238
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:54,630
♫ Stand by your man ♫

239
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,260
♫ Give him two arms to cling to ♫

240
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,380
♫ and something warm to come to ♫

241
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,710
♫ when nights are cold and lonely ♫

242
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:13,360
♫ Stand by your man ♫

00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:51,100
♫ Keep giving all the love you can ♫

249
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,579
You're truly the queen of drinking solo.

250
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,173
Did you take the beer from my place?

251
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:04,774
Of course. I cleaned you out.

252
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:06,781
Are you just getting home now?

253
00:24:06,782 --> 00:24:08,382
Yes.

254
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,319
It doesn't seem like you're coming back from work.

255
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,428
I'm past the age of falling for those tricks.

256
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:17,029
Oh my.

257
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,762
Hey, have you seen Yun Jin Ah today?

258
00:24:21,763 --> 00:24:23,852
No. Why?

259
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:26,188
Gosh, that girl.

260
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:31,795
She hasn't been picking up her phone, so I can't reach her. I miss her.

261
00:24:31,796 --> 00:24:33,610
You two are like lovers.

262
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:38,112
We are more than that. She's my love, Jin Ah.

263
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,802
You should also date, Noona.

264
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,987
No, thank you.

265
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,997
How long are you going to be alone?

266
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:49,639
What if it's forever?

267
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:52,540
Are you afraid I'll get old and burden you?

268
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,666
Don't worry about that.

269
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,437
Your sister will never get in the way of your life.

270
00:24:57,437 --> 00:24:59,628
That's not what I mean.

271
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:03,794
You should meet a good person, date, and fall in love. You know–

272
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,676
The one thing you can't trust is love.

273
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:10,377
That's the one thing I learned from our dad.

274
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,382
Dad may no longer be a part of our lives,

275
00:25:21,383 --> 00:25:25,783
but know that you're dead if you ever live like him.

276
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,199
Drink up and go.

277
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,100
I'm going to sleep.

278
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,200
What are you doing?

279
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,001
Just in case Gyeong Seon came with you.

280
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,375
How did someone who was so scared take a shower?

281
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:24,537
I took it really quickly because I was so sweaty.

282
00:26:24,537 --> 00:26:26,938
Don't you have any smaller pants?

283
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,393
Is that it?

284
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,327
I thought you would worry, so I tried to take care of it quickly.

285
00:26:47,327 --> 00:26:49,019
Things got out of hand.

286
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:52,020
I wasn't trying to hide it.

287
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,635
I'm not saying I need to know everything just because we are dating.

288
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,194
I don't even want that.

289
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:04,395
There are boundaries we should keep, but...

290
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,516
I don't think this was something you should've hidden or covered up.

291
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,610
I made a mistake.

292
00:27:15,205 --> 00:27:19,106
I thought I knew him.

293
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,714
Is it because you shared everything with him?

294
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:35,067
Well, when you date someone, don't most people do that?

295
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:40,206
Whether it's registering with his name or making a dating bank account.

296
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:43,507
You can make a savings account too.

297
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,994
Have you never done those things with someone you dated?

298
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:58,379
I didn't really do the things that everyone else was doing.

299
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,604
So if I ask you to do something common, you won't do it?

300
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,047
Why are you being stubborn?

301
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:11,452
I'm not being stubborn.

302
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:15,453
Fine then. I won't ask you to do anything.

303
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,660
Why would you put it that way?

304
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:23,554
I'm not saying anything wrong. You're saying that's what you want.

305
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:25,663
Then that's what I'll have to do.

306
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:28,564
You don't want to do it, so we won't.

307
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,642
Let's change the subject.

308
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:35,895
No, let's keep talking about it. How were your relationships different?

309
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:38,115
Tell me, what was unique about them?

310
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:39,616
Well...

311
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,895
Let's stop talking and sleep.

312
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:46,596
You sleep. I'm going to drink more.

313
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,652
I think my head hurts again.

314
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:21,990
♫ When the night falls and the rest of the world quiets down ♫

315
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:32,200
♫ I come running to you and there you sing me a song ♫

316
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:44,680
♫ The little sweet melody ♫

317
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,460
♫ Oh, how I wish it would never end ♫

318
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:58,264
My situation...

319
00:30:58,264 --> 00:31:02,660
is so embarrassing and shameful.

320
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,561
That's why I got annoyed at you.

321
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:12,490
I wonder why I was so foolish before.

322
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,920
I'm regretting it a lot right now.

323
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,874
It feels like you're saying that I'm even more lacking.

324
00:31:20,874 --> 00:31:23,975
So I got angry.

325
00:31:28,132 --> 00:31:33,432
I'm upset that I upset you.

326
00:31:34,263 --> 00:31:39,363
I'm sorry for doing something I should be sorry for.

327
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:41,781
That's why...

328
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:47,266
Are you really sleeping?

♫ But why should I be worried ♫

00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:00,920

331

♫ Little sweet melodies ♫

Say it.

333
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,290
Come on, say it.

334
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,443
- You were supposedly angry.
- What?

335
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:17,317
Say what? Forget it.

336
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:31,294
Jun Hui.

337
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:33,677
Jun Hui, it's me.

338
00:32:33,678 --> 00:32:35,393
Turn that off now!

339
00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:38,380
- Hey!
- I had your cell phone.

340
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:39,746
I suddenly thought of something...

341
00:32:39,746 --> 00:32:42,494
No! I can't hear it.

342
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:43,660
I can't hear it at all.

343
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,846
Thank you...

344
00:32:46,846 --> 00:32:52,724
for cherishing me and loving me so much.

345
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:56,647
- Can't hear, can't hear, can't hear.
- So, when you love...

346
00:32:56,647 --> 00:32:59,498

347
00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:02,050
- I can't hear.
- Jun Hui...

348
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:08,737
I love you...

349
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:10,967
very much.

350
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:13,045
I will love you for a longer time.

351
00:33:13,046 --> 00:33:14,473
I will love you for a long, long time.

352
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:17,268
I will love you much more.

353
00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:19,869
I will love you.

[Coffee Bay strives to maintain a healthy and safe workspace. We would appreciate the cooperation of all employees in this survey.

355
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,512
How come I'm not getting the results?

356
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:58,233
I haven't heard from the female employees who are outside the office or dispatched.

357
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:01,367
- What about the location of the dinner?
- That's yet to be determined.

358
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:05,992
They haven't made a decision.

359
00:35:05,993 --> 00:35:09,993
Pleasing all women is the hardest thing to do.

360
00:35:19,944 --> 00:35:21,944
Come in.

361
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:42,738
If you were eavesdropping, you'll need to pay the price.

362
00:35:42,738 --> 00:35:44,792
Why would you say such a thing?

363
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:46,828
How could I dare to...

364
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:50,262
If I made you think so, I apologize.

365
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:52,263
I'm so sorry.

366
00:35:55,038 --> 00:35:57,200
- Truly.
- I know you don't mean that.

367
00:35:57,201 --> 00:36:01,923
About the company dinner that you're presiding over for the female employees,

368
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:07,225
I think it might be best if you paid for it and stepped back from it.

369
00:36:08,364 --> 00:36:09,809
Why would you say that?

370
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:14,510
Most of the female employees are refusing to attend.

371
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:20,033
I guess they don't want to deal with it.

372
00:36:25,622 --> 00:36:28,860
I just wrote that I wouldn't be attending.

373
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:31,171
I think most people feel that way.

374
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:33,979
I'll go along with the majority.

375
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,144
I didn't write anything.

376
00:36:37,145 --> 00:36:41,845
If all of us have different opinions, how can we consolidate?

377
00:36:41,845 --> 00:36:43,988
But why would you write nothing?

378
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:47,589
I wrote about everything that happened in great detail.

379
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:52,689
Welcome.

Hello.

Eat up, everyone.

383
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:03,722
It seems a little empty here without Section Chief Yun.

384
00:37:05,214 --> 00:37:06,592
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

385
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:09,376
- Three fermented bean paste stews.
- Yes.

386
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:12,877
Who is she dating anyway?

387
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,008
Is Section Chief Yun in a relationship?

388
00:37:17,008 --> 00:37:20,231
Not just in any relationship. She's totally in deep.

389
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:23,532
She told me all about it.

390
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:27,617
What?

391
00:37:27,618 --> 00:37:29,608
Ye Eun, did you hear about it?

392
00:37:29,608 --> 00:37:32,009
No, this is news to me as well.

393
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,996
Don't you want to?

394
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:48,797
That's right.

395
00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:53,166
Don't you know that China has the biggest market in the world right now?

396
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:56,079
Gaming and animation culture is trending there.

397
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,977
This is our chance to expand our market.

398
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:02,678
I know that, but why me?

399
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:04,725
Hey, we need to make a plan.

400
00:38:04,725 --> 00:38:06,376
China wants us to come.

401
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:08,671
We should be asking to be included, but we luckily got this offer.

402
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:10,872
When will we get another chance like this?

403
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:13,990
Send someone else.

404
00:38:14,644 --> 00:38:18,626
It won't be as long as your three years in the U.S. Just spend a few months in China.

405
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:21,266
I just can't go.

406
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:25,067
You can't go? Isn't it that you won't go?

407
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,317
I have to see my girlfriend.

408
00:38:30,196 --> 00:38:32,596
Are you crazy?

409
00:38:33,196 --> 00:38:37,107
All right, fine. Dating is important.

410
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:43,107
But Jun Hui. It isn't a year, but three months.

411
00:38:43,107 --> 00:38:44,213
I still can't go.

412
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:46,614
I'm going to fire you then.

413
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:48,907
Then do that.

414
00:38:48,908 --> 00:38:50,408
What?

415
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:54,813
I have work left to do, so I better head back.

416
00:38:54,814 --> 00:38:57,014
I have to go.

417
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,343
Hey, did you disobey the chairman?

418
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:10,844
The team manager is going to kill you.

419
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:16,829
A business trip is good. Why are you refusing to go?

420
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:19,887
A business trip is good. So, why don't you go?

421
00:39:19,887 --> 00:39:24,566
Stop ruining the company atmosphere and listen to commands.

422
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:26,295
Hey, Seo Jun Hui.

423
00:39:26,296 --> 00:39:29,796
Who are you dating that you're making such a fuss?

424
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:34,677
Hey, you refused to go because of your girlfriend, Geum Bo–

425
00:39:34,677 --> 00:39:36,227
Who?

426
00:39:36,228 --> 00:39:40,429
You... you'll see her soon. What's the big deal, right?

427
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:44,171
I can't go no matter what you say. Please send someone else.

428
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:47,436
You could really get fired if you do this.

429
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:49,737
Should I write my resignation letter now?

430
00:39:52,143 --> 00:39:53,720
Hey, what are you doing?

431
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,221
Oh, I better write it.

432
00:40:00,906 --> 00:40:03,396
Why are you blaming yourself for that?

433
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:06,216
They say there's no choice you won't regret.

434
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:08,606
It's not that I regret it.

435
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:12,927
I'm wondering how I made such a foolish decision.

436
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:16,577
I find myself so pathetic.

437
00:40:16,578 --> 00:40:20,390
So you stood up with rage and chose Seo Jun Hui.

438
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,906
That's not even it.

439
00:40:21,906 --> 00:40:25,439
I just happened to be like, "Oh," and fell for him.

440
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:30,241
Thankfully, I don't think I made the wrong choice with him yet.

441
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:33,841
I can't guarantee things won't change.

442
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:37,075
- But I feel like you two will last long.
- Really?

443
00:40:37,075 --> 00:40:39,468
The love Seo Jun Hui shows you is quite something.

444
00:40:39,468 --> 00:40:41,048
It's over the top.

445
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:43,273
I was wondering why you weren't teasing me.

446
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,253
I'm not teasing you. I'm surprised.

447
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:48,673
I told you, he called me when he couldn't reach you.

448
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:51,813
Come to think of it, something felt off.

449
00:40:51,814 --> 00:40:53,077
How?

450
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:57,872
I brushed it off saying you're an adult. What could possibly happen?

451
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:00,778
Inside, I was thinking, he's really overreacting.

452
00:41:00,779 --> 00:41:05,179
But... he must have had an intuition about something.

453
00:41:11,366 --> 00:41:13,866
You must be happy.

454
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:19,935
I am happy, extremely happy.

491
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:00,460
What kind of gathering is it?

492
00:46:04,246 --> 00:46:07,392
Is it a secret group?

493
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:09,893
No.

494
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:12,961
It's about workplace sexual harassment.

495
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:16,189
They want us to report it, but everyone is quite passive.

496
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:21,089
I understand since I was like that, too.

497
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:22,935
But are you different now?

498
00:46:22,935 --> 00:46:26,922
Yes, I'm working hard to be different.

499
00:46:26,922 --> 00:46:29,414
How impressive.

500
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:33,611
It's also because I don't want someone I know to worry.

501
00:46:33,611 --> 00:46:35,321
I'm touched.

502

That's nothing.

Yes, it isn't enough.

504
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:42,657
What?

505
00:46:42,657 --> 00:46:47,356
I want to be confident about our relationship.

Section Chief, you know, right?

515
00:47:15,924 --> 00:47:19,080
He just shows up and starts touching my arm here.

Oh, I hate that!

517

You wouldn't make a move when you were told to write about it.

523

Then I'll tell my sister...

I'll tell Gyeong Seon too. It's only right.

629

Once Gyeong Seon finds out, she'll feel really betrayed.

630
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:22,261
If I hide behind you, she'll feel more disappointed in me.

631

Honestly, more than my mom and dad,

632
00:59:27,169 --> 00:59:29,524
I'm more worried about Gyeong Seon.

633

You know what kind of friend she is to me.

634
00:59:33,281 --> 00:59:36,110
She could be more understanding because of that.

01:00:53,707 --> 01:00:57,146
It's only a matter of time before Mom and Dad find out.

01:00:57,146 --> 01:00:59,510
I heard Gyeong Seon doesn't know either.

Jun Hui says he doesn't care.

646
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,880
He's only saying that.

647
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,450
Goodness.

648
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:08,676
How come you cause trouble every time you date?

649
01:01:08,676 --> 01:01:11,160
That's not true!

650
01:01:13,493 --> 01:01:18,485
Anyway, I'm thinking of telling Mom and Dad. What do you think?

651
01:01:18,485 --> 01:01:21,120
You'd be lucky if you don't get kicked out.

652
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,476
Honestly, I don't know about Dad.

653
01:01:25,476 --> 01:01:29,990
But I'm sure about Mom. She'll faint, at the very least.

654
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:34,537
I don't know.

655
01:01:34,537 --> 01:01:37,890
No one knows about a couple besides the man and woman.

656
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:43,997
What if you two break up?

657
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:47,528
We won't be able to see Jun Hui's family anymore.

658
01:01:47,528 --> 01:01:50,548
We can't see them forever. Do you know that?

659
01:01:50,548 --> 01:01:53,559
I won't let that happen.

660
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:55,379
That's what you're hoping for.

661
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:59,980
Are you two special somehow? How are you different?

662
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,728
We are different.

663
01:02:01,728 --> 01:02:03,617
We will be different.

664
01:02:03,617 --> 01:02:08,218
What you're worried about won't happen. It will never happen.

665
01:02:23,779 --> 01:02:25,479
Why?

666
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:27,280
I mean.

667
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,908
Why would he bring up breaking up first?

668
01:02:29,908 --> 01:02:33,009
Why not just curse us?

669
01:02:37,272 --> 01:02:39,268
Are we people who must never date?

670
01:02:39,268 --> 01:02:41,610
Why, why? What's so wrong?

671
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:44,430
Exactly. There's nothing wrong.

672
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:48,399
Yes, you are right. Yes.

673
01:02:48,399 --> 01:02:51,494
Yes, yes.

674
01:02:51,495 --> 01:02:54,527
It isn't even funny. What is that?

675
01:02:54,527 --> 01:02:57,740
You can be confident. Why not?

676
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:04,249
You talk when you're drunk so much and now you do it while brushing your teeth.

677
01:03:04,249 --> 01:03:06,711
Oh. Oh, this girl.

678
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:09,812
Who would marry you?

679
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:14,571
Seo Jun Hui.

680
01:03:14,571 --> 01:03:17,168
- What?
- What?

681
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,383
What did you say?

682
01:03:18,383 --> 01:03:20,568
I didn't say anything.

683
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:24,369
Go to your room quietly. Seung Ho is studying.

684
01:03:38,562 --> 01:03:40,570
Mom, Dad.

685
01:03:41,283 --> 01:03:43,850
I'm dating Jun Hui.

686
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:48,872
Mom, I'm seeing Jun Hui.

687
01:03:48,873 --> 01:03:52,044
It doesn't matter what you both say. I'm going to date Jun Hui.

688
01:03:52,044 --> 01:03:57,463
I... am dating someone right now.

689
01:03:57,463 --> 01:04:00,175
The person is...

690
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:02,876
Jun...

691
01:04:03,663 --> 01:04:06,445
I'm in a relationship with Jun Hui.

692
01:04:06,446 --> 01:04:07,802
We are seeing each other.

693
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:12,403
It doesn't matter what you say, we will keep dating.

694
01:04:12,404 --> 01:04:15,213
Please spare me. Help me.

695
01:04:15,214 --> 01:04:17,684
I'm sorry.

696
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:19,401
I am dating Jun Hui.

697
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:21,789
I didn't know this would happen.

698
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:23,796
Even though it's my heart...

699
01:04:23,796 --> 01:04:26,896
I couldn't control it.

700
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,388
I couldn't stop it from happening.

701
01:04:28,388 --> 01:04:32,391
It's been so hard for me, Mom and Dad.

702
01:04:32,392 --> 01:04:34,075
Please understand me.

703
01:04:34,075 --> 01:04:36,275
Will you really be okay?

704
01:04:36,879 --> 01:04:40,827
Tell me if you won't. I'll come over instead of going to work.

705
01:04:40,828 --> 01:04:45,829
You don't have to do that. I can do it alone.

706
01:04:46,469 --> 01:04:48,459
I'm not saying you can't.

707
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:50,652
It makes me upset to make you do it alone.

708
01:04:50,652 --> 01:04:54,152
They wouldn't hit their fully grown daughter, right?

709
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,900
Do I have to watch my girlfriend get hit?

710
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,590
You can just come and watch.

711
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,681
Why do you have so much courage?

712
01:05:06,681 --> 01:05:09,289
Like you have someone you can depend on.

713
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:12,190
I do, myself.

714
01:05:16,259 --> 01:05:19,612
I thought it was me. I got excited.

715
01:05:19,613 --> 01:05:22,138
Of course, I depend on you.

716
01:05:22,138 --> 01:05:24,886
You're the only one on my side.

717
01:05:24,886 --> 01:05:27,365
You say the prettiest things.

718
01:05:27,365 --> 01:05:29,666
What isn't pretty about me?

719
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:31,547
I'm going to hang up.

720
01:05:31,547 --> 01:05:34,018
That's becoming your habit.

721
01:05:34,018 --> 01:05:36,090
You're pretty.

722
01:05:36,946 --> 01:05:40,476
I'll ask one last time, will you really be okay alone?

723
01:05:40,477 --> 01:05:43,477
You sure do talk a lot. Bye.

724
01:07:36,902 --> 01:07:38,620
Come in.

725
01:07:46,988 --> 01:07:48,788
What are you doing?

726
01:07:51,376 --> 01:07:55,676
I'm separating old notes that I studied and putting them away.

727
01:07:59,956 --> 01:08:01,910
Where's Mom?

728
01:08:02,477 --> 01:08:04,850
She took Seung Ho to the eastern medicine clinic.

729
01:08:27,578 --> 01:08:29,950
Don't you have something to say?

730
01:08:39,635 --> 01:08:41,720
I told you before.

731
01:08:42,325 --> 01:08:46,925
I'm ready to hear it whenever you're ready to talk.

732
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,158
It's okay, whatever you have to tell me.

733
01:09:01,245 --> 01:09:03,350
Dad.

734
01:09:33,105 --> 01:09:35,305
Where is Jun Hui?

735
01:09:39,052 --> 01:09:40,460
What?

736
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:56,730
♫ Sometimes it's hard to be a woman ♫

737
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:05,620
♫ Giving all your love to just one man ♫

738
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:07,181
You're not crying, are you?

739
01:10:07,181 --> 01:10:09,222
Don't yell at Jun Hui.

740
01:10:09,223 --> 01:10:11,483
Do you like him that much?

741
01:10:11,484 --> 01:10:13,343
Please look upon him favorably.

742
01:10:13,344 --> 01:10:15,374
He's like my second son.

743
01:10:15,374 --> 01:10:17,022
Mom's first stage is fainting.

744
01:10:17,022 --> 01:10:18,047
I'll see it soon.

745
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,716
Find me evidence that it's true. I'll give you a pat on the back.

746
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:24,196
I always did this for you, Section Chief Yun.

747
01:10:24,196 --> 01:10:27,180
Do you have time tonight?

748
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,551
Who is it?

749
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:30,284
Seo Jun Hui.

750
01:10:30,284 --> 01:10:32,226
- Boyfriend.
- Why?

751
01:10:32,226 --> 01:10:34,794
- What?
- What?

752
01:10:34,795 --> 01:10:35,807
Seo Gyeong Seon.

753
01:10:35,807 --> 01:10:37,980
I can't live if I lose you.

754
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:40,869
Don't make things hard for Jin Ah.

755
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:43,060
I only saw Jun Hui.

756
01:10:43,762 --> 01:10:46,973
I could only see Jun Hui.

757
01:10:46,974 --> 01:10:49,914
That's why I came this far.

758
01:10:49,914 --> 01:10:58,220
♫ be proud of him. 'Cause after all... ♫
