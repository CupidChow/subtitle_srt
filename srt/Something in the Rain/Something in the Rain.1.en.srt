00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,753
Using and carrying your phone with you isn't allowed in the store.

3
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:12,969
Please leave it in your personal locker.

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,610
Is there anything else?

5
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:29,997
Manager, I think you trust your fridge too much.

6
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,826
Products also go bad in the fridge.

7
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:35,774
Please dispose of all products past their expiry date.

8
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:37,509
All right.

9
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:46,709
Please clean this area again and organize it.

10
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:51,217
Please clean the items that I've placed sticky notes on.

11
00:00:57,456 --> 00:01:02,627
As a woman, I understand wanting to look taller and slimmer,

12
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:06,992
but heels are slippery and dangerous.

13
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:14,570
The rule exists for your own safety. It would be weird to get annoyed by it.

15
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,558
Let's meet today. I need to talk to you.

16
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,459
Seo Gyeong Seon, you must be psychic. I was just about to call you.

17
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,772
Why? Did you miss me?

18
00:01:32,453 --> 00:01:35,312
Gyu Min wants to meet today.

19
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:38,812
How did you feel? Was it cold?

20
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:41,246
It's cold.

21
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:44,235
Hey, don't let him get the better of you.

22
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:46,836
You know what I mean, right?

23
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:49,030
I know.

24
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,219
Please send these to my home.

25
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,954
Of course.

26
00:02:07,954 --> 00:02:09,892
Do you also have stockings?

27
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:11,264
Yes, I'll get you some.

28
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,432
How would you like to pay for this?

29
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,482
How much did you say it was?

30
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:18,263
327,000 won.

31
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll pay it over three months. There's no interest, right?

32
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:34,503
And this place,

33
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:39,045
they have unlimited sashimi. It's not stale fish, it's totally fresh.

34
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:42,670
The oysters are locally sourced, so they say it's great when in season.

35
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:45,042
Look. It's awesome, right?

36
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:49,849
You love oysters so it would be worth the money, wouldn't it?

37
00:02:55,843 --> 00:03:00,512
Our one-year anniversary is this Valentine's Day. Let's go to the South Sea.

38
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:05,146
They have this great pool villa there, and my co-worker's relative owns the place.

39
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:08,885
You usually have to book a month in advance, but they'll let me have it now.

40
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:10,586
Take a look.

41
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:14,460
Great, right? Totally luxurious.

42
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,270
Why do you not like me anymore?

43
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:32,755
It's not like that.

44
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:35,425
Then why are we breaking up?

45
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:41,035
That's why you asked to meet, isn't it?

46
00:03:43,898 --> 00:03:48,916
Lee Gyu Min... are you seeing another woman?

47
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:54,365
Then what is it? There must be a reason.

48
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:55,892
What is it?

49
00:03:55,892 --> 00:04:00,155
Is my body not great? Does my style turn you off?

50
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,442
Do our personalities clash?

51
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,342
Is it because my dad isn't wealthy?

52
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:06,898
Or because I'm not young and in my twenties? What is it?

53
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:09,783
There must be a reason.

54
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,913
If it isn't any of those...

55
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:14,984
I'll be blunt.

56
00:04:14,984 --> 00:04:17,383
Is it because you've already gone all the way with me?

57
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,500
- Yun Jin Ah.
- What else could there be?

58
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:23,081
I need a reason I can accept.

59
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:32,897
Our relationship...

60
00:04:35,377 --> 00:04:37,187
is just not great.

61
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:39,937
I don't know if you'd understand.

62
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:43,437
No, I don't understand.

63
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,800
So what I'm saying is...

64
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,912
you know how it is.

65
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,099
It's like konjac (a tasteless, bland jelly).

66

you don't expect anything more from me.

70
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:21,768
I said it was the two of us. Why are you overreacting?

71

It's not you. It's our relationship.

72

Aren't you just twisting your words like that... so you don't come off as a predictable man?

I told you not to let him get the better of you, but you didn't listen.

111
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,117
All you did was buy new clothes.

You must be overflowing with money!

Will you keep insulting me?

114
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:28,829
I searched the internet for "konjac."

115
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:30,790
Did you have to look it up to know?

Here. It's this.

Even we don't touch it. It doesn't taste like anything. It's just ambiguous.

Hey, why is it all my fault?

119
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:48,533
What did he do to make things fresh and new?

120
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:53,091
I was flying just a few years ago.

121
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:59,565
I... was contacted by my first love, Jun Wu. He said he wanted to see me.

122
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:01,149
Here come the stories again.

123
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,568
Don't you remember that time?

124
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:04,668
What? What?

125
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,639
I told you about that college student, right?

126
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,539
Oh my. Oh my, this again.

127
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:18,026
He waited outside my place to get my number. Hey, I was thirty-one at the time.

128
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:19,896
Good for you.

129
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:26,335
And I was told to enter the Miss Korea pageant back in the day. How are we any different?

130
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:30,696
"Let's break up." "Okay, let's do it." How could you do that?

131
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:34,274
I would've slapped him when he said that crap about konjac!

132
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:35,935
Gosh.

133
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,569
I was a woman with a past like that.

134
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:47,951
Am I that... bad now?

135
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:51,452
Hey, am I that unappealing?

136
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:54,851
Being completely unappealing is unique, too.

137
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:58,598
You are... colorless and odorless.

138

- Are you really my friend?
- But hold on...

139
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:07,000
Why is that? Because most men only like one type of woman.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,331
Younger women.

141
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,700
It's not your first time being dumped.

142
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,736
So...

143
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:24,100
you need to know how to choose better guys.

144
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,199
I want to eat tteokbbeoki.

145
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:31,198
Let's go eat tteokbbeoki.

146
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,910
I want to go to karaoke too.

Deal.

148
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,249
I'm going to sing.

149
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,479
- Let me just sing one more, just one more song!
- You sang too much.

150
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:43,277
No, no. You can't. Come out.

00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,568
Oh, Dear.

152
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:48,169

Gosh... hey.

155
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,013
- Will you spend all your money?
- Just one song.

156

00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,308

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:45,149
♫ Baby, don't you know I love you so? Can't you feel it when we touch? ♫

323
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:47,990
Hold on, hold on.

324
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,920
♫ Never let you go, I love you, oh ♫

325
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:55,107
Seriously, I could follow you if I wanted to,

326
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:57,334
but I'm holding back.

327
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:02,477
Are you teasing me?

328
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:06,574
Ah!

329
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,820
♫ Save ♫

330
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,090
♫ Save it, save ♫

331
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,320
♫ Save ♫

332
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,210
♫ Save it ♫

333
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,690
♫ Save ♫

334
00:28:35,274 --> 00:28:39,275
So have you found a girl you like?

335
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:44,100
Unfortunately, Yun Jin Ah is still the best.

336
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,042
If you weren't Seo Gyeong Seon's brother, you'd already be dead.

337
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,934
Oh, that's refreshing.

338
00:28:56,665 --> 00:28:59,344
I thought you'd want pork belly and soju.

339
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:02,625
I already had an intense welcoming party with my co-workers.

340
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:04,462
Oh.

341
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:07,491
Are you done working at the overseas branch then?

342
00:29:07,492 --> 00:29:10,299
Why would you say such an upsetting thing?

343
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,120
It's on a rotation basis so I'll get an opportunity again.

344
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:17,621
You were in the U.S. for three years. Wasn't that enough?

345
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:22,330
Honestly, I wanted to just live there.

346
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,780
I think it definitely suits me better.

347
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:30,592
Look at you pretending to be cool.

348
00:29:30,592 --> 00:29:33,183
You better not say that in front of Gyeong Seon.

349
00:29:33,184 --> 00:29:35,600
She's only feisty on the outside.

350
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,634
But she'd do anything for you.

351
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:43,600
Do you know how much she suffered getting your new place and decorating it?

352
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,404
Think of your big sister.

353
00:29:47,914 --> 00:29:50,404
I think of her so much that it's a problem.

354
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,964
I haven't even told her that I'm back.

355
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:56,226
You're crazy!

356
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:02,200
She'd just make a big fuss while making things to feed me.

357
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,364
She has it hard enough with the store.

358
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:09,600
Oh my. It seems like just yesterday that we were giving you piggyback rides.

359
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,385
When did you grow up so much?

360
00:30:12,385 --> 00:30:16,384
When did the noona who gave me piggyback rides age...

361
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:22,005
Do you truly... want to die?

362
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:27,396
It's been a while, right?

363
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:29,966
How's your dating life?

364
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,899
Well, love is always happening.

365
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,694
I heard you became "konjac."

366
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:47,930
What?

367
00:30:48,953 --> 00:30:50,993
What is it? What?

368
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:54,684
Gosh, I don't think I can make it home.

369
00:31:08,356 --> 00:31:10,253
Thank you.

370
00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:15,414
I'll do it.

371
00:31:19,473 --> 00:31:22,973
Was that a hint asking for a piggyback ride?

372
00:31:22,973 --> 00:31:25,266
Stop joking around.

373
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:29,299
Can't you wear sneakers to work?

374
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:31,098
It's not that I can't.

375
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,337
Do they make you feel you have to?

376
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:36,968
They don't say it outright, but I need them in some situations.

377
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:39,640
So you decide wear them on your own.

378
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,628
Let's just say I'm a professional.

379
00:31:42,628 --> 00:31:44,537
You have to break the taboo to be a pro.

380
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:48,678
Oh... do you want to teach me something?

381
00:31:48,678 --> 00:31:50,950
Should I start?

382
00:31:52,173 --> 00:31:54,792
Where are we going?

383
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:58,396
What's this? Where are we going? Hey.

384
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,342
What is this?

385
00:32:24,673 --> 00:32:26,330
Hey.

386
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:43,908
Careful, careful.

387
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,280
Be careful.

388
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:49,738
Hey.

389
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:55,079
What is this place? I didn't know about it, and I live here.

390
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,350
The superintendent's office is over there, on the corner.

391
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,699
Your place is in front of that.

392
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,333
I didn't know there was a path like this.

393
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:05,463
- How did you know about this?
- This place?

394
00:33:06,146 --> 00:33:09,607
It's just like you saw. I was just looking around and found it.

395
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:16,079
When I was in high school, I used to smoke here with Seung Ho.

396
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,798
Yun Seung Ho, that bookworm, smoked since high school?

397
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:25,430
That bookworm probably had his first kiss here with a girl he met at cram school.

398
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,020
Oh my.

399
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,060
I'm going to tell Mom.

400
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,181
It's a crime to act innocent at your age.

401
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:35,900
You really need to get hit today.

402
00:33:38,155 --> 00:33:40,215
Keep running.

403
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:51,036
You've become a player in the time I haven't seen you.

404
00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:02,471
The company relocated while I was away

405
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:06,101
so I don't know what's around my office.

406
00:34:06,101 --> 00:34:09,591
Give me a tour of the good places to eat during lunchtime.

407
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,909
That's not hard to do, but scheduling a time might be hard.

408
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,152
I work outside the office a lot.

409
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:17,724
Are you backing out because you don't want to buy lunch?

410
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,525
Could you tell?

411
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:20,571
Keep trying, though.

412
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:25,370
If I have time one of these days, I'll buy you whatever you want.

413
00:34:36,662 --> 00:34:38,718
Go on.

414
00:35:05,785 --> 00:35:08,067
It looks like it's from the department store. What is it?

415
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:09,989
- It's nothing.
- What is it?

416
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:12,758
It's nothing. It's for someone else.

417
00:35:12,758 --> 00:35:14,909
You smell like alcohol. You drank again, right?

418
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,876
Gyu Min really needs to get scolded.

419
00:35:16,877 --> 00:35:18,699
I didn't see him.

420
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,823
Oh.

421
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:23,699
What does he want to eat? I should go grocery shopping.

422
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:24,992
I forgot about it.

423
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:26,734
You haven't asked him yet?

424
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:30,108
I've been busy. I'll ask him, okay?

425
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:33,786
You shouldn't be so cold to Gyu Min.

426
00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:35,436
You two aren't even young.

427
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:39,166
You have to make sacrifices to end up with a smooth marriage.

428
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:41,377
What marriage?

429
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:47,349
We never discussed that specifically.

430
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:50,503
That's why you need to discuss the specifics.

431
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:55,063
Do you think it's easy to meet a great catch like Gyu Min?

432
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:59,324
His mom, dad, and even his brother attended Seoul University.

433
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:03,635
- Just look at his household.
- Okay.

434
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:05,574
Don't avoid me.

435
00:36:05,574 --> 00:36:08,066
Do you know what it's like when I meet my friends?

436
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:11,873
They're so envious of me, it's a frenzy.

437
00:36:11,874 --> 00:36:14,992
They ask me how I could be so blessed.

438
00:36:14,992 --> 00:36:17,227
Not only is he a lawyer.

439
00:36:17,227 --> 00:36:21,546
I'd have a doctor, a judge, a professor, and even a chief of police for in-laws.

440
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,097
All in one family.

441
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,920
They say I'd want nothing else.

442
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,405
They're all so envious.

443
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:32,006
Your dad doesn't say it out loud but...

444
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:35,534
Mom, I'm really tired.

445
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:37,603
I want to wash up and sleep.

446
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:40,461
You always say that you're tired.

447
00:36:40,461 --> 00:36:43,143
Anyway, take care of it.

448
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:52,982
We are closed.

449
00:36:55,623 --> 00:36:58,003
You... you punk, get over here. You're dead!

450
00:36:58,003 --> 00:36:59,316
Oh no.

451
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:01,091
You!

452
00:37:01,812 --> 00:37:03,518
Wow, why are you so fast?

453
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,398
You must be crazy.

454
00:37:06,952 --> 00:37:08,293
Get over here.

455
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:10,560
Why didn't you call me?

456
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,159
Let's go eat lunch.

457
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,348
I'm sorry, I have a prior engagement.

458
00:37:21,348 --> 00:37:24,150
My friend is here. Enjoy your lunch.

459
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,098
Let's go, Section Chief Yun. You no longer have a boyfriend to meet.

460
00:37:29,229 --> 00:37:31,507
Come on. What are you doing?

461
00:37:37,624 --> 00:37:39,531
Section Chief.

462
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:44,620
I'm not okay, but I'll pretend to be. Let's go.

463
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:55,781
Noona, buy me lunch.

464
00:37:58,211 --> 00:37:59,909
Is there something spicy?

465
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,958
- Spicy seafood noodles.
- Not that.

466
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:04,381
I don't have an appetite.

467
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:08,927
Hello.

468
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,011
Section Chief Yun, how about Chinese food?

469
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:20,711
I'm okay with anything.

470
00:38:20,711 --> 00:38:23,294
Dong Wu, what will you eat? I'll have black bean noodles.

471
00:38:23,294 --> 00:38:25,393
Me, too.

472
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:29,772
Your tastes have gotten very old.

473
00:38:29,772 --> 00:38:31,376
Quiet!

474
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:55,090
It's nice that we can eat all kinds of food since we ordered different dishes.

475
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:10,770
Section Chief Yun. You're getting older now.

476
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,873
You should be dating long-term and thinking about marriage.

477
00:39:12,873 --> 00:39:15,223
Why do you keep breaking up?

478
00:39:23,223 --> 00:39:25,575
Give me a spoon of that.

479
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:27,229
Sure.

480
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:30,753
I'm saying this because you're like my younger sister.

481
00:39:30,753 --> 00:39:34,510
People these days say you're better off alone than married.

482
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,042
You think it was easy during my time? It was the same way.

483
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:16,911
Why are you already awake?

484
00:40:16,912 --> 00:40:22,761
I think it's just a habit. I just wake up when it's time to go to work.

485
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:25,501
I need to use your car, Dad. I need to go straight to a store.

486
00:40:25,502 --> 00:40:28,911
Okay, you know where the key is, right? The second shelf, by the door.

487
00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:30,021
I know.

488
00:40:30,022 --> 00:40:32,143
It's still dark out; drive carefully.

489
00:40:32,144 --> 00:40:34,314
Okay.

490
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:35,820
Get some more sleep.

491
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:38,160
No need to sleep.

492
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,284
I'll get going now.

493
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:43,465
- Be careful.
- Okay.

494
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:46,626
Clean the poster again and put it back in.

495
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:48,878
Okay.

496
00:40:50,756 --> 00:40:54,612
We will keep the roasting machines covered until the opening so just leave them.

497
00:40:54,613 --> 00:40:56,403
All right.

498
00:40:58,732 --> 00:41:01,122
The boxes of cups...

499
00:41:09,813 --> 00:41:14,094
Wow, Lee Gyu Min was cheating.

500
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:38,126
What's this?

501
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:41,416
What do you think it is? It's Lee Gyu Min's true nature.

502
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:45,460
I was curious about why he dumped you

503
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,416
so I looked for him on Instagram.

504
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:50,077
And ta-da! His girlfriend appeared.

505
00:41:50,078 --> 00:41:53,623
Hey, the places where they took photos are all places you suggested, right?

506
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:56,056
Wow, Lee Gyu Min. Is he even human?

507
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:58,815
Was he always such a scumbag?

508
00:42:45,011 --> 00:42:46,836
[Queens Party]

509
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:17,606
Can I have the keys for the car with license plate 3745?

510
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:19,179
I need to take something out.

511
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,515
- Yes, 3745?
- Yes.

512
00:44:15,276 --> 00:44:17,760
I think I'm drunk.

513
00:44:18,943 --> 00:44:22,123
Gyu Min, I think I'm drunk.

514
00:44:22,123 --> 00:44:23,326
Are you tired?

515
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,228
- My legs...
- Yes?

516
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,485
- I have no strength in my legs.
- Oh no.

517
00:44:27,486 --> 00:44:31,396
Let's go home quickly. I'll massage your legs for you.

518
00:44:31,396 --> 00:44:33,403
Be careful. Be careful.

519
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:35,646
You're going to massage my legs.

520
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:38,907
I'll go get the car. Stay here.

521
00:44:39,765 --> 00:44:43,386
- 3745.
- "3745."

522
00:44:43,386 --> 00:44:46,206
- "3745"?
- Yes, 3745.

523
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:51,271
How much?

524
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:34,683
Let's go home.

525
00:45:37,504 --> 00:45:39,239
What's this?

526
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,638
- What?
- Are you cheating?

527
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:45,318
What is this?

528
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,079
What is this?

529
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,269
How would I know, you crazy bastard?

530
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:55,947
Is that any way to speak to me?

531
00:45:55,948 --> 00:45:58,619
Do you think you deserve respect just because you're older?

532
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:02,679
I don't usually allow losers like you in my fish pond.

533
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:06,468
But you were following me around so much, I played with you out of pity.

534
00:46:06,468 --> 00:46:08,157
Got it?

535
00:46:08,157 --> 00:46:10,713
Gosh, so unlucky.

536
00:46:10,713 --> 00:46:11,681
Hey.

537
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:15,106
Where are you grabbing? Do you want to die?

538
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,760
Were you always like this?

539
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,672
Oh, seriously?

540
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:23,396
I may be like this, but I don't do trashy things like cheating.

541
00:46:23,396 --> 00:46:26,794
Seriously, you should be embarrassed.

542
00:46:26,794 --> 00:46:30,500
You followed me around like a fool because I was young, who are you to talk?

543
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:32,601
You... Is that all you can say?

544
00:46:32,602 --> 00:46:34,581
Do you want to hear more?

545
00:46:34,582 --> 00:46:37,104
Do you really want to get cursed out?

546
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:40,324
You may be young but don't live that way.

547
00:46:40,325 --> 00:46:43,277
Who are you giving advice to?

548
00:46:43,277 --> 00:46:45,859
You lowly creep.

549
00:46:45,859 --> 00:46:47,968
What?

550
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:51,317
Don't show up in front of me again.

551
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:54,748
Or I'll show up at your work and reveal everything.

552
00:46:56,477 --> 00:46:58,626
Gosh, seriously.

553
00:47:12,818 --> 00:47:14,814
Drink slowly.

554
00:47:14,814 --> 00:47:17,626
Don't end up drunk and rambling.

555
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,680
You can just hear me out.

556
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,422
You wench! Am I your husband?

557
00:47:24,422 --> 00:47:29,540
If you were my husband, I would have no other wish.

558
00:47:32,472 --> 00:47:34,072
It may not feel sweet.

559
00:47:34,073 --> 00:47:38,319
But you got revenge on Lee Gyu Min, so why are you so depressed?

560
00:47:42,128 --> 00:47:44,877
It's like you said...

561
00:47:44,877 --> 00:47:49,589
I wonder if I just have a really bad eye for choosing men.

562
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,089
I suddenly thought on my way here...

563
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:58,070
Of all the men I've dated so far...

564
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:01,065
It sounds like a lot when I phrase it that way.

565
00:48:01,065 --> 00:48:02,835
Anyway...

566
00:48:03,807 --> 00:48:10,314
all of the moments that I thought were love...

567
00:48:10,314 --> 00:48:14,765
I realized that they weren't really love.

568
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:18,745
What is real love?

569
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:24,557
I don't know. I've never experienced it.

570
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:28,667
That's true.

571
00:48:31,427 --> 00:48:33,054
Hey.

572
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:38,363
Knowing my future is so sad.

573
00:48:38,363 --> 00:48:41,124
You should open a psychic shop.

574
00:48:41,124 --> 00:48:43,524
And how does your future look?

575
00:48:44,624 --> 00:48:48,789
I just live my life idly, like this.

576
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:53,403
I meet a person who roughly meets the conditions I need.

577
00:48:53,403 --> 00:48:57,043
We get married, have kids, and live out our lives.

578
00:48:57,044 --> 00:49:00,015
Oh, something like that.

579
00:49:00,724 --> 00:49:03,991
Even if you don't...

580
00:49:06,305 --> 00:49:08,823
you can be happy, right?

581
00:49:10,316 --> 00:49:16,223
- Must be...
- Right?

582
00:49:17,863 --> 00:49:21,144
Wow, so this is where the young people are.

583
00:49:21,144 --> 00:49:22,927
Why is she so drunk?

584
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:23,960
Hi.

585
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,177
You wanted to go home, yet you're drinking?

586
00:49:26,177 --> 00:49:27,951
Do we have any other joy in life?

587
00:49:27,952 --> 00:49:29,878
No, because you two are always doing this.

588
00:49:29,878 --> 00:49:31,834
- I'll have one.
- Hey.

589
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:39,203
But...

590
00:49:39,203 --> 00:49:43,504
why is Noona more drunk today?

591
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,614
She's sensitive.

592
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:53,414
Why? Did someone say "konjac" again?

593
00:49:53,414 --> 00:49:56,352
I'll be in the restroom.

594
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:03,983
Seriously, you're saying konjac like it's a habit.

595
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:05,335
Wait.

596
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:09,212
I don't even have the strength to hit you.

597
00:50:09,212 --> 00:50:13,613
- My arm hurts.
- That makes me so sad to hear.

598
00:50:13,613 --> 00:50:15,239
What is sad?

599
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,090
- Thank you.
- Yes.

600
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:19,148
- Thank you.
- Okay, okay.

601
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,992
- All right, I got it.
- My friend, Seo Gyeong Seon.

602
00:50:21,993 --> 00:50:25,971
Sleep as soon as you get home and don't think about anything.

603
00:50:25,972 --> 00:50:27,512
- Yes.
- Get some good sleep.

604
00:50:27,513 --> 00:50:30,180
Yes, Mom.

605
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,929
What a good child. Get in the car now.

606
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,349
Let's get you home.

607
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:36,420
- Get in the car.
- I can do it alone.

608
00:50:36,421 --> 00:50:39,139
- Watch your head, okay?
- Yes.

609
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,549
- Get in and take your bag here.
- Bye.

610
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:45,442
- Be careful getting home. Bye.
- Bye.

611
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:46,959
Put your hand in.

612
00:50:48,961 --> 00:50:51,271
You two will end up married at this rate.

613
00:50:51,272 --> 00:50:53,771
You'd be lucky to have a pretty in-law.

614
00:50:53,771 --> 00:50:55,351
- Drive her safely.
- Wait.

615
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:58,213
- Bye.
- Who's paying me to be the driver?

616
00:50:58,213 --> 00:51:00,384
You're asking to get hit.

617
00:51:00,384 --> 00:51:03,412
You two are so violent.

618
00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:10,721
Hey, she drank a lot. She drank a lot.

619
00:51:10,722 --> 00:51:11,893
Drive slowly.

620
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:13,416
She drank a lot. Don't drive too fast.

621
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:14,920
- Okay.
- Bye.

622
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:18,033
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

623
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:22,502
Bye. Get going. Put on your belt.

624
00:51:22,502 --> 00:51:24,914
- Drive carefully.
- Yes, Mom.

625
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:26,762
No, I don't need that.

626
00:51:26,763 --> 00:51:28,914
Get going.

- Bye.
- Good job.

807
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:31,509
I'm going now.

808
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:32,780
Okay. Bye.

809
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:34,330
Bye.

810
01:06:52,352 --> 01:06:55,567
Why did you ignore my messages and calls?

811
01:06:55,567 --> 01:06:57,577
What do you need to say?

812
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:01,137
This isn't a good place to talk. Let's go somewhere quiet.

813
01:07:01,137 --> 01:07:04,828
Forget it. Just say it here, quickly.

814
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,050
♫ You can dance ♫

815
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:43,350
♫ Every dance with the guy that gives you the eye, and let him hold you tight ♫

816
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:46,090
♫ You can smile ♫

817
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,242
We can't end it like this. Let's talk.

818
01:07:48,242 --> 01:07:50,714
Just say it here.

819
01:07:51,772 --> 01:07:54,005
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Pretending to be your boyfriend.

820
01:07:54,006 --> 01:07:55,835
Be natural. Smile, smile.

821
01:07:55,836 --> 01:07:57,804
Wait, wait.

822
01:07:57,805 --> 01:07:59,984
Who is this?

823
01:07:59,984 --> 01:08:01,534
Oh...

824
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:05,489
- Who are you?
- I'm Jin Ah's boyfriend.

825
01:08:05,489 --> 01:08:06,492
Get lost.

826
01:08:06,493 --> 01:08:07,971
What did you say?

827
01:08:07,971 --> 01:08:10,563
I said, get lost. Are you a stalker?

828
01:08:10,564 --> 01:08:11,610
Should I call the police?

829
01:08:11,611 --> 01:08:14,616
Jin Ah, who is this guy?

830
01:08:17,415 --> 01:08:20,373
This is the police, right? I need to report a stalker.

831
01:08:20,374 --> 01:08:23,101
What are you talking about? Did you cause trouble?

832
01:08:23,102 --> 01:08:25,528
You crazy punk. Report what?

833
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:27,637
I'll call you later.

834
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,673
My sister will kill me.

835
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:34,690
I'll explain it to her.

836
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:39,050
♫ Who's takin' you home and in whose arms you're gonna be ♫

837
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:47,120
♫ Please darlin' save the last dance for me ♫

838
01:08:47,851 --> 01:08:50,388
Did I make a mistake?

839
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:53,315
No.

840
01:08:53,315 --> 01:08:55,836
Then why haven't you said a single word?

841
01:08:55,836 --> 01:08:58,181
You seem angry.

842
01:08:59,622 --> 01:09:01,992
I'm just embarrassed.

843
01:09:01,992 --> 01:09:03,859
What kind of a loser am I?

844
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:08,678
How shabby is my love life that my friend's brother has to help me out?

845
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:11,300
I'm dying of embarrassment.

846
01:09:11,921 --> 01:09:13,813
I'm not at all surprised.

847
01:09:13,814 --> 01:09:17,300
You don't have a good eye for men.

848
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,850
I guess so.

849
01:09:21,095 --> 01:09:22,849
You're lucky.

850
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:26,046
You could've been chained down by a not-so-great guy for life.

851
01:09:26,046 --> 01:09:28,234
You're really lucky.

852
01:09:30,445 --> 01:09:33,953
Your interpretation is better than the dream.

853
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,160
♫ Save it ♫

854
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,820
♫ Save ♫

855
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,178
Jun Hui.

856
01:09:48,803 --> 01:09:52,884
You know the coffee company downstairs?

857
01:09:52,884 --> 01:09:54,792
You know a girl there, right?

858
01:09:54,793 --> 01:09:56,681
Yes.

859
01:09:57,866 --> 01:10:00,199
Can you help introduce me?

860
01:10:03,212 --> 01:10:07,073
Hey... what's with that look?

861
01:10:07,073 --> 01:10:09,092
What, you can't?

862
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:10,640
Are you on drugs?

863
01:10:10,646 --> 01:10:14,619
Dude, what's wrong with introducing a gentleman to a lady?

864
01:10:16,155 --> 01:10:18,455
Did you call dibs on her?

865
01:10:18,455 --> 01:10:19,595
What are you talking about?

866
01:10:19,596 --> 01:10:22,698
If that isn't it, then what's the darn problem?

867
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:26,936
Hey, I know that Kang Se Yeong is the most popular girl in this building.

868
01:10:26,936 --> 01:10:30,548
But does that mean I can't talk to her? Am I not allowed to talk to her?

869
01:10:30,548 --> 01:10:32,437
Whom?

870
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:35,876
- Let's finish here today.
- Okay.

871
01:10:38,412 --> 01:10:41,394
You can leave this and confirm my meeting for the afternoon.

872
01:10:41,395 --> 01:10:43,066
Okay.

873
01:10:43,066 --> 01:10:45,163
I'll help you.

874
01:10:46,318 --> 01:10:48,103
No need to feel sorry for me.

875
01:10:48,104 --> 01:10:51,484
I'm sure there are rumors about me since yesterday.

876
01:10:51,484 --> 01:10:54,252
I know what you're talking about.

877
01:10:54,253 --> 01:10:58,065
I don't know why I should be sorry, though.

878
01:10:58,065 --> 01:11:00,591
Then why are you acting out of character?

879
01:11:00,592 --> 01:11:03,513
You don't usually do such things, Section Chief Kang.

880
01:11:03,513 --> 01:11:06,113
Actually, I have a question.

881
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:13,132
Yesterday, not your ex-boyfriend, but the man who saved you...

882
01:11:13,132 --> 01:11:15,502
Who is he?

883
01:11:15,502 --> 01:11:18,486
He's just as you said, "the man who saved me."

884
01:11:18,486 --> 01:11:20,198
Are you two having a thing?

885
01:11:20,198 --> 01:11:22,213
What?

886
01:11:22,213 --> 01:11:25,018
Then I can have a go at him, right?

887
01:11:26,404 --> 01:11:29,604
- Well...
- He doesn't have a girlfriend, right?

888
01:11:29,604 --> 01:11:33,564
I don't know. I'm not too sure.

889
01:11:33,564 --> 01:11:38,091
He has such high standards... and many pretty girls are around...

890
01:11:38,091 --> 01:11:40,100
So there's no one.

891
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,251
It's worth it to try to win him.

892
01:11:45,757 --> 01:11:47,723
I'm going to head out first.

893
01:11:47,723 --> 01:11:49,695
You said you would help.

894
01:11:49,695 --> 01:11:52,021
I'll carry this for you.

895
01:11:56,401 --> 01:11:59,913
- Everyone!
- Let's do our best!

896
01:12:34,339 --> 01:12:36,193
The meat is here.

897
01:12:36,194 --> 01:12:39,012
Section Chief Yun, sit down.

898
01:12:39,472 --> 01:12:43,041
Here, here. Sit down.

899
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:48,191
Should I go get more meat?

900
01:12:48,191 --> 01:12:49,783
Just sit down.

901
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:52,612
Section Chief Yun is doing it.

902
01:12:54,472 --> 01:12:56,770
Let's raise our glasses once more.

903
01:12:57,464 --> 01:13:02,784
To our future, love, and work.

904
01:13:02,784 --> 01:13:04,204
Missile!

905
01:13:04,204 --> 01:13:06,959
Missile!

906
01:13:07,642 --> 01:13:09,198
Should we do a love shot?

907
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,363
Sure.

908
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:25,424
But we don't have missiles like you.

909
01:13:33,937 --> 01:13:37,603
Yun Jin Ah has a good temper. I would never go near those men.

910
01:13:37,603 --> 01:13:41,086
You have to be empty inside to go along with that.

911
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,403
Her nickname isn't "Yun Tambourine" for no reason.

912
01:13:44,404 --> 01:13:48,782
I know you look up to Yun Jin Ah, but don't take after her in those ways.

913
01:13:50,162 --> 01:13:52,284
Okay.

914
01:13:55,186 --> 01:13:58,451
Section Chief Kang and Geum, we should have a drink.

915
01:13:58,451 --> 01:14:00,070
I have to go to the restroom.

916
01:14:00,071 --> 01:14:02,372
Me, too.

917
01:14:03,271 --> 01:14:07,085
Ye Eun, let's have a drink. Come on.

918
01:14:07,085 --> 01:14:09,256
Relax.

919
01:14:13,045 --> 01:14:15,200
I will be going now.

920
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,099
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

921
01:14:18,099 --> 01:14:19,720
I have plans.

922
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,292
Please let them know.

923
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:25,130
We should just go, too.

924
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,721
Hey, you can't all just leave.

925
01:14:27,721 --> 01:14:30,541
I can't force myself to go and sit there, doing nothing.

926
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:33,421
I'm going to go. Bye.

927
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,602
Where did everyone...

928
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:38,946
- Yun Jin Ah.
- Oh, you scared me.

929
01:14:38,946 --> 01:14:41,447
Let's go sing a song.

930
01:14:41,447 --> 01:14:43,962
Sorry, I need to go back to work.

931
01:14:43,963 --> 01:14:46,743
You don't even have a boyfriend now. Why are you backing out?

932
01:14:46,743 --> 01:14:49,244
You can go home late.

933
01:14:50,113 --> 01:14:53,433
I didn't back out even when I had a boyfriend.

934
01:14:53,433 --> 01:14:56,413
There's work I have to finish today.

935
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:58,824
- I'm going now.
- Section Chief...

936
01:15:01,114 --> 01:15:03,325
She just disobeyed me, right?

937
01:15:03,325 --> 01:15:06,566
Senior Manager, I think everyone is gone.

938
01:15:25,323 --> 01:15:28,350
Oh? You haven't left yet?

939
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:30,851
I'm leaving now. How about you?

940
01:15:30,851 --> 01:15:32,781
Are you going for a second round at work?

941
01:15:32,781 --> 01:15:35,981
Second round and work.

942
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:39,380
Are you going home or to escort Gyeong Seon?

943
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:42,839
Who would come after my sister? I'm going clubbing.

944
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:44,657
"Clubbing"?

945
01:15:46,356 --> 01:15:49,254
Must be a good time for you.

946
01:15:49,254 --> 01:15:52,298
Are you going to meet girls?

947
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,698
There are girls everywhere, so I don't need to worry about that.

948
01:15:55,698 --> 01:15:58,177
Hold on.

949
01:15:58,177 --> 01:16:00,181
Yes, Se Mi.

950
01:16:01,096 --> 01:16:03,695
I'm at work.

951
01:16:03,695 --> 01:16:05,336
Okay, I'll be there soon.

952
01:16:05,337 --> 01:16:08,457
- I'm leaving now.
- Go, then.

953
01:16:17,225 --> 01:16:19,683
Yes, Jae Hui.

954
01:16:19,683 --> 01:16:21,954
Where are you?

955
01:16:21,954 --> 01:16:24,304
Yes, all right.

956
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:27,044
See you later.

957
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:39,950
♫ I am the best ♫

958
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:43,720

♫ Before I flip something over, please someone stop me ♫

969
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:39,770
♫ I open my closet and put on the freshest outfit ♫

970
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:43,420
♫ And carefully check over my face's reflection in the mirror ♫

971
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:48,190
♫ It's eight o'clock right now, and we are meeting up at 8:30 ♫

972
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:51,550
♫ I step out boldly tonight ♫

973
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:56,520
♫ I'm the best, I'm the best ♫

974
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,520
♫ I'm the best ♫

975
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,620
♫ I'm the best ♫

976
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,550
♫ Th-th-the best ♫

977
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:14,100
♫ Even I can tell I'm a bit fabulous, all right ♫

978
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:20,650
♫ Even if you were me, you'd be jealous of this body, all right ♫

979
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:36,850
♫ Sometimes it's hard to be a woman ♫

980
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:44,321
♫ Givin' all your love to just one man ♫

981
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,463
They say new love is the best medicine for a break up.

982
01:19:47,464 --> 01:19:49,372
Meet someone new right away.

983
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:53,222
How much can you trust a man's actions and words?

984
01:19:53,223 --> 01:19:55,543
They're all lies.

985
01:19:56,472 --> 01:20:00,671
I thought Yun Jin Ah was diligent. Why is she making noise lately?

986
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:04,712
You accept most things. That's why Senior Manager Gong harasses you more.

987
01:20:04,712 --> 01:20:06,500
Don't you have something with anyone?

988
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,533
You do? How old is she?

989
01:20:08,534 --> 01:20:10,014
23? 24?

990
01:20:10,015 --> 01:20:11,253
35.

991
01:20:11,253 --> 01:20:13,660
Do you actually have something?

992
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:17,585
Do guys just like anyone who's pretty?

993
01:20:17,585 --> 01:20:19,917
You're prettier, Noona.
