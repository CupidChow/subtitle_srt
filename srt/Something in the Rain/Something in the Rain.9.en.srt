[Episode 9]

2
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,190
Dad...

3
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,700
The thing is...

4
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,050
Dad...

5
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:09,087
Dad, Dad. I...

6
00:01:31,755 --> 00:01:34,020
Where is Jun Hui?

7
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:37,873
What?

8
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:43,761
Hey, kid.

9
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:49,150
What about that is so hard to say that you're crying like a dummy?

10
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:52,568
Did you already know, Dad?

11
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,970
Did you know about everything?

12
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,220
And I thought you were all grown up.

13
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:18,695
Are you okay?

14
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:22,485
I'm really worried.

15
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:27,582
Should I come over there?

16
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:32,598
You're not crying, are you?

17
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:07,215
What?

18
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,452
Where are you, Noona?

19
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:11,053
At home.

20
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:12,745
Aren't you going out today?

21
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:15,260
I am. Why?

22
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:18,152
I'm at work right now.

23
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:22,453
I didn't mention it to you, so I thought you might think I was home.

24
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,104
Hello?

25
00:04:26,104 --> 00:04:29,203
I won't go to your place. Happy now?

26
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:32,619
Why would you respond like that?

27
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:34,920
Bye. I have to head out.

28
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,279
Okay.

29
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:07,188
You know that day you got angry, came home, and left again?

30
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:09,638
I went to your place to steal some beers.

31
00:05:09,638 --> 00:05:13,080
Someone rang the doorbell, and it turned out to be Jin Ah.

32
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:15,459
At my place?

33
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,452
I wasn't home so she thought I was at your place.

34
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,166
Hey, hey! Right turn.

35
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,965
Oh.

36
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,613
Geez.

37
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:27,113
What were you thinking about?

38
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:36,956
Something must really be going on with you.

39
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:41,530
What is it? Is it something at work?

40
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,530
Or is it about a friend?

41
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,655
No.

42
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:50,828
Who do you think you're fooling?

43
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:54,267
What is it?

44
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,626
- What is it?
- I said it's nothing.

45
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,687
Oh, right. Did you leave the city?

46
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,726
I saw a receipt in the car.

47
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:08,325
It was on the way to Dangjin.

48
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:12,898
But it was the day Jin Ah went on her business trip there.

49
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:17,380
I drove her there.

50
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,646
You did? Why?

51
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:23,736
I wanted to go somewhere to sketch and get some ideas.

52
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:25,966
And she happened to be going on a business trip at the same time.

53
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:28,685
Why didn't either of you say anything?

54
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:30,786
Since it's not a big deal.

55
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:35,677
I'm not kidding. I've already picked someone out.

56
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:38,508
He's a customer at my store.

57
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:41,047
How well could you know a customer?

58
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,368
Why would you set her up with just anyone?

59
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:49,299
No! I've known him a long time, and he has a good job.

60
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:51,387
Is a good job all you need?

61
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:53,951
Then I guess I'm good enough.

62
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,466
Are you a man?

63
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:57,165
Am I a woman then?

64
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,700
Where did they go?

65
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:33,704
Oh, you startled me. What are you doing here?

66
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,678
I told him to get out, but he won't.

67
00:07:36,678 --> 00:07:39,425
Listen to your elders, would you?

68
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,936
- When will he grow up?
- Seriously.

69
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:44,636
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

70
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,103
Is someone chasing you?

71
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,886
What are you doing at my place?

72
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:53,150
"Your place"?

73
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,940
Are we strangers or something?

74
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,578
I'm tired. Hurry and go.

75
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,979
Let me finish this first.

76
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:05,375
Take it with you. Also,

77
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,034
take all of this and go to bed.

78
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:12,575
No, thank you. I'm only drinking this.

79
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,494
Hurry and leave.

80
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:17,695
Can't I just finish this and then leave?

81
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:19,896
My little brother.

82
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:22,108
All right. All right.

83
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:24,966
Why are you angry and taking it out on me?

84
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:27,267
You're dead tomorrow.

85
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:31,831
Why, those two...

86
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:09,543
Yes, Mother.

87
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:12,192
What?

88
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:14,323
Wh-Where?

89
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:18,952
Please take a good look at him. He's like a second son to me.

90
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:21,152
I'm the eldest son.

91
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:29,472
He has a lot of energy.

92
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:31,964
Oh, really?

93
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:34,864
He seems to have lost a lot of energy lately.

94
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:44,124
Seo Jun Hui doesn't even catch colds. It's just funny.

95
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:46,354
That's not funny.

96
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:50,839
Jun Hui, you must be tired from pulling all-nighters all the time.

97
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,805
Everyone else does it, too.

98
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,297
Should I prepare some herbal medicine for him?

99
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:57,492
Yes, just like his...

100
00:09:57,492 --> 00:10:01,734
Oh no. I don't need it at all, not at all.

101
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,936
It's all right.

102
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:11,161
Ma'am, a bottle of water, please.

103
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:15,080
Jun Hui, eat lots of this, at least.

104
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,373
Why don't you want herbal medicine? It's good for your strength.

105
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:22,682
I'm strong, unlike Seung Ho.

106
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:24,522
What's wrong with me?

107
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,741
Oh, please.

108
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:29,201
You have a cold for all of winter.

109
00:10:29,201 --> 00:10:31,051
You're worse than your sister.

110
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:33,543
Yun Jin Ah has a strong spirit.

111
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:35,525
You shouldn't say things like that.

112
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:38,713
Women shouldn't be told that they have a strong spirit.

113
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:44,735
Both you and Jun Hui, date a woman who's modest and quiet.

114
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:47,472
You don't even need to look far.

115
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:50,772
Look for someone like your mother.

116
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:57,630
- Don't be like your father and meet such horrible women–
- Mom!

117
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,730
It's just us. What's the problem?

118
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,408
Jun Hui.

119
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:08,710
I want to see you getting married, having kids, and living well.

120
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,638
That way, I can meet your mother comfortably later.

121
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:15,017
You know what I'm trying to say, don't you?

122
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:16,930
Of course.

[Ox bone soup]

124
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:27,163
What's going on?

125
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:30,164
Sorry, I had a leg cramp.

126
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:33,450
My goodness. Eat up, Jun Hui.

127
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,560
Yes.

128
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,660
Close your mouth.

129
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:02,269
Sorry, Dad.

130
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,329
Drink it while it's hot.

131
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:07,729
You cried so much, your insides must hurt.

132
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,519
Okay.

133
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:16,068
Should I talk to your mom?

134
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:19,752
Do you think you can do it?

135
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:21,852
I should do it.

136
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:29,493
Can I meet with Jun Hui?

137
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:36,380
If you don't want me to...

138
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,374
It's not that I don't want you to...

139
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:45,794
What now?

140
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:49,119
You can meet him.

141
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,829
That's fine with me.

142
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:54,629
Don't yell at Jun Hui.

143
00:12:58,522 --> 00:12:59,977
Okay?

144
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:02,577
Do you like him that much?

145
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:06,996
Yes.

146
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:20,293
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

147
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:27,937
Oh, Jun Hui.

148
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,596
Come over to our house with Gyeong Seon, okay?

149
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:32,341
- Okay.
- Goodbye now.

150
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:34,741
Yes, get home safely.

151
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:46,071
- What?
- You're actually getting nervous.

152
00:13:46,071 --> 00:13:49,494
It isn't me, it's you. Why won't you let me tell her?

153
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:54,741
Hey, I already told Yun Jin Ah, but mom's first step is fainting.

154
00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:58,312
- You'll see that soon.
- "Soon"?

155
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,819
How long can we hide it? You'll help, right?

156
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:06,019
Crazy punk! Don't even dream of it.

157
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:12,344
Bye.

158
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:27,999
I brought home two servings. Where did Jin Ah go?

159
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:30,121
She had plans.

160
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,291
She had something to do nearby.

161
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:37,191
Plans on her day off? People would think she's dating.

162
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:40,119
- A cola, please.
- Okay.

163
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:43,118
Whatever it is, I need to get involved.

164
00:14:43,118 --> 00:14:47,820
I have a friend in Seocho who knows a good guy for Jin Ah.

165
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:52,565
Gosh, what? Here, eat.

166
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:07,247
- Don't laugh.
- Okay.

167
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,499
Do I look that much like Pororo (Cartoon character with a puffy face)?

This is Manager Jeong. Is Senior Manager Choi Jung Mo around?

336
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,897
I didn't have any other motive. I was trying to figure out the issue.

337
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:30,208
That's all I was doing.

338
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:31,199
What issue?

339
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:35,962
Well, the sexual harassment scandal going on among female employees.

340
00:32:35,963 --> 00:32:41,462
I heard there was an official document, so I wanted to know if it was true.

341
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,353
If that's the case...

342
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,956
I can help out.

343
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,886
Find evidence that it's true.

344
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,376
Cell phone texts, messages, and social media.

345
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:57,116
Recordings are good too.

Perfect seating to view movies.

From front to back, your seat will have a great view.

352
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:36,395
The screen is at the perfect height so that your eyes won't tire out.

In order to exit safely, move your items off the floor.

356
00:33:48,647 --> 00:33:53,247
Then exit through the closest emergency exit.

357

Make an exit at the back entrance by the restrooms.

Please exit safely.

Are you home already?

360
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:41,393
I went somewhere briefly and then came home.

361
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,656
Something's going on, right?

362

Let me confirm something before we start talking.

370
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,789
Do you two like each other?

371
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:14,572
Or are you just playing with Seo Jun Hui?

372
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,192
I like him more than he likes me.

373
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:10,080
I know there's no excuse.

374
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:13,293
No matter what I say,

375
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:18,110
I know that it'll be hard to make you understand.

376
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:22,990
But Gyeong Seon,

377
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,195
I can't live without you.

378
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,262
It's shameless of me, right?

379
00:39:30,263 --> 00:39:32,650
But there's nothing I can do about it.

380
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,985
I can't be without you. I need you.

381
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,802
What about Seo Jun Hui?

382
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,215
What will you achieve by holding onto both of us?

383
00:39:48,215 --> 00:39:53,040
Even if the two of us fight, is it okay as long as you're at peace?

384
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,925
I never thought about that.

385
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,246
Then what were you thinking about?

386
00:39:58,247 --> 00:40:01,947
What were you thinking, coming this far?

387
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:10,810
First, I am sorry that I couldn't tell you about this.

388
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,623
And if you had told me?

389
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:17,024
Do you think I would've welcomed it with open arms?

390
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,663
Do you think this situation makes sense right now?

391
00:40:23,664 --> 00:40:26,864
Do you think you've done something that's right?

392
00:40:35,506 --> 00:40:40,373
Do you think I'm being shameless?

393
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:41,874
What?

394
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:49,800
There's nothing... you don't know about me.

395
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,880
Our time growing up together...

396
00:40:52,881 --> 00:40:55,910
My past relationships...

397
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:02,376
We promised to take those secrets to the grave.

398
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:06,770
I'm sure they're bothering you.

399
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:08,872
Hey.

What kind of person do you take me for?

401
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:22,969
Do you think I'd bring up something from the past

402
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,370
and be so low as to use it against you?

403
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:29,539
That's how frustrated I am.

404
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,965
Do you think you're frustrated?

405
00:41:32,966 --> 00:41:36,650
I couldn't breathe on our way here, I nearly died.

406

I don't know how I managed to get through the past few days.

407
00:41:39,961 --> 00:41:43,710
That's how traumatized and betrayed I feel.

408

It isn't just anyone. How could you...

409
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:54,970
Then what's the right thing for me to do?

410
00:41:55,617 --> 00:41:58,116
What would you like me to do?

411
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:02,255
Should I just break up with Jun Hui?

412
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:05,946
Should I wait until you get over it?

413
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:11,468
If you still refuse to see us, then I should just say, "I guess I can't do anything," accept it,

414
00:42:11,468 --> 00:42:15,533
and then disappear from your life?

415
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:23,199
Is it right for you to act this way right now?

416
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,000
I'd like to resent you if I could.

417
00:42:27,102 --> 00:42:29,552
What did I do so wrong?

418
00:42:29,553 --> 00:42:31,909
It's not like I hate him.

419
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,411
Is it wrong to like someone?

420
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:40,025
I'm sorry.

421
00:42:40,026 --> 00:42:44,887
But I never hesitated just because he was your brother.

422
00:42:44,888 --> 00:42:47,488
To be honest...

423

I had no time to think about you.

424

Well... she has to go to work tomorrow, yet she's sleeping over.

So is she with Gyeong Seon?

Of course. She called me with Gyeong Seon's phone.

00:49:05,251 --> 00:49:09,131
When did I? When?

496
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:10,951
- "Understand"?
- Why, you..

497
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:14,641
You're crazy.

498
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:18,542
I'm going to break your leg.

499
00:49:21,008 --> 00:49:25,010
Gosh.

500
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:29,766
You need to get your eyes examined.

501
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,520
♫ 'Cause after all, he's just a man ♫

502
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:49,160
♫ Stand by your man, give him two arms to cling to ♫

503
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:57,670
♫ and something warm to come to when nights are cold and lonely ♫

504
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:06,910
♫ Stand by your man, and show the world you love him ♫

505
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:14,050
♫ Keep giving all the love you can ♫

506
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:22,930
♫ Stand by your man ♫

507
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:34,100
♫ Stand by your man, and show the world you love him ♫

508
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:41,960
♫ Keep giving all the love you can ♫

509
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:49,760
♫ Stand by your man ♫

510
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:16,679
Who was that?

511
00:52:00,969 --> 00:52:03,040
Thank you, Noona.

512
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,286
You crazy punk! You've lost your mind.

513
00:52:06,286 --> 00:52:08,238
- What? Why are you doing this?
- Why?

514
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:10,618
Do you want to die?

515
00:52:10,618 --> 00:52:12,837
Ouch. Use your words.

516
00:52:12,837 --> 00:52:14,310
Do words work with you?

517
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,430
That hurts.

518
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:19,070
- You need to get hit.
- Okay.

519
00:52:20,601 --> 00:52:23,201
I visited Mom.

520
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:26,480
We should've gone together.

521
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:31,815
I went there to insult you. Why would I take you?

522
00:52:35,084 --> 00:52:40,166
What would her decision be if she were alive?

523
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:44,266
I thought about what she would say to you.

524
00:52:47,528 --> 00:52:50,829
Yes, it's obvious.

525
00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:55,358
She would have said, "Oh my, congratulations Jun Hui."

526
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,023
"I've always liked Jin Ah."

527
00:52:58,024 --> 00:53:00,020
That's what she would've said.

528
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:04,151
People always care more for their own.

529
00:53:04,151 --> 00:53:07,300
I may be best friends with Jin Ah,

530
00:53:07,301 --> 00:53:09,731
but you come first to me.

531
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:12,930
I can't bear to see you hurt and cry.

532
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:14,693
I'll do well.

533
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:17,617
What good is it if only you do well?

534
00:53:17,617 --> 00:53:20,021
Jin Ah's parents.

535
00:53:20,022 --> 00:53:22,564
- Especially Mom.
- I know.

536
00:53:22,564 --> 00:53:25,164
I know what you're trying to say.

537
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:38,825
I know I said I'd understand you two.

538
00:53:38,825 --> 00:53:41,806
That doesn't mean I'll go along with everything you do.

539
00:53:41,806 --> 00:53:45,747
I'll say it when I don't agree and when I don't like something.

540
00:53:45,747 --> 00:53:51,800
If you stop me from doing that, you're no brother and have no conscience.

541
00:53:53,211 --> 00:53:55,111
I won't stop you.

542
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:04,709
It won't be as easy as you think.

543
00:54:15,475 --> 00:54:18,407
You're so bad with computers. Why are you in engineering?

544
00:54:18,407 --> 00:54:21,076
It's not the computer. Your game is the problem.

545
00:54:21,077 --> 00:54:23,476
Hurry and come over.

546
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:26,638
I don't know about your place.

547
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,019
Gosh, how unlike you to be so careful.

548
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:31,819
Mom and Dad went out to meet some people.

549
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:34,293
Yun Jin Ah's not home either.

550
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:35,994
Hey!

551
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:43,260
Give it a rest.

552
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,480
What, what?

553
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,690
♫ You can dance ♫

554
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:15,418
♫ every dance with the guy that gives you the eye and let him ♫

555
00:55:15,418 --> 00:55:17,552
I'm leaving now.

556
00:55:17,552 --> 00:55:20,034
Take your time. Don't run and fall.

557
00:55:20,034 --> 00:55:22,295
I'm not running. I'm walking.

558
00:55:22,296 --> 00:55:24,167
Yes. Okay.

559
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:26,668
See you later. Okay.

560
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:36,750
♫ But don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be ♫

561
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:44,120
♫ So darling, save the last dance for me ♫

562
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:52,640
♫ Oh, I know that the music's fine like the sparkling wine ♫

563
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,230
♫ Go and have your fun ♫

564
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,810
♫ Yes, I know ♫

565
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,890
♫ Laugh and sing ♫

566
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:06,150
♫ But while we're apart, please don't give your heart to anyone ♫

567
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:14,320
♫ And don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be ♫

568
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:21,670
♫ Please darling, save the last dance for me ♫

569
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:26,960
♫ Baby, don't you know I love you so ♫

570
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,110
♫ Can't you feel it when we touch ♫

571
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:35,540
♫ I will never ever let you go ♫

572
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,070
♫ I love you, oh, so much ♫

573
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:47,380
Please continue.

574
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:56,384
Read it properly and memorize it.

575
00:56:56,385 --> 00:56:59,755
Why bother memorizing it? You can come whenever it isn't working.

576
00:56:59,755 --> 00:57:02,793
What do you use that brain of yours for?

577
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,684
The right man is in the right place.

578
00:57:04,684 --> 00:57:08,084
I only use it when it's necessary.

579
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:11,146
Are you home, Seung Ho?

580
00:57:11,146 --> 00:57:12,847
Yes.

581
00:57:16,816 --> 00:57:20,732
Oh my. Jun Hui's here, too.

582
00:57:20,732 --> 00:57:22,893
You said you'd be late. Why are you home already?

583
00:57:22,893 --> 00:57:24,450
We were going to go for round two.

584
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:28,835
I didn't want to see your dad drinking, so I came home first.

585
00:57:28,835 --> 00:57:30,416
Have you two eaten?

586
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:31,834
Yes, ramen.

587
00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:33,746
Why?

588
00:57:33,747 --> 00:57:36,662
There's rice and stew from this morning, and you can reheat the fish–

589
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:38,963
Oh, forget it.

590
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:42,600
Actually, this worked out well.

591
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,349
Look at this for me since your dad isn't here.

592
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:49,456
Look at this person for me and tell me what you think of his looks.

593
00:57:49,457 --> 00:57:51,457
Here.

594
00:57:54,216 --> 00:57:56,413
Why? Who is he?

595
00:57:56,413 --> 00:58:00,051
Oh, it's for Jin Ah. I told you last time.

596
00:58:00,051 --> 00:58:02,963
My friend from Seocho knows someone to set her up with.

597
00:58:02,964 --> 00:58:06,010
Look, he goes to Seoul University. Do you think he's okay?

598
00:58:07,423 --> 00:58:09,323
You know...

599
00:58:10,102 --> 00:58:13,110
they say that men are the best judge of other men.

600
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:16,491
Jun Hui, what do you think of him?

601
00:58:16,491 --> 00:58:17,967
- Well...
- Mom, that's enough.

602
00:58:17,967 --> 00:58:20,427
I told you to stop this stuff.

603
00:58:20,427 --> 00:58:22,838
Do you think I want to do this?

604
00:58:22,838 --> 00:58:25,048
Do you want your sister to be single forever?

605
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:29,648
You never cared before, so why are you nagging me now?

606
00:58:31,298 --> 00:58:34,097
Don't say a word to your sister.

607
00:58:54,277 --> 00:58:56,762
- What is it? Do you need something?
- No.

608
00:58:56,762 --> 00:59:00,849
Are you hungry? I was going to bring you some fruit.

609
00:59:00,849 --> 00:59:02,550
I...

610
00:59:04,171 --> 00:59:05,867
I have something to tell you.

611
00:59:05,867 --> 00:59:08,966
What is it? To me? Go ahead.

612
00:59:11,546 --> 00:59:14,666
It must be something important.

613
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:18,477
- Yes.
- Then should we move to the sofa?

614
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,000
Come sit over here. Over here.

615
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,929
Oh my. Hey.

616
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:38,909
Why... why are you doing this?

617
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,509
Seung Ho, why is Jun Hui doing this?

618
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:44,950
Jun Hui.

619
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:48,520
- Mother.
- Yes, what?

620
00:59:49,879 --> 00:59:52,240
Honestly, I...

621
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,270
Yes, go on.

622
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:06,095
Wh-What's going on?

623
01:00:06,095 --> 01:00:08,471
That's what I would like to know.

624
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:12,009
He said he has something to tell me and suddenly he got on his knees.

625
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:15,368
Jun Hui. Say something, would you?

626
01:00:15,368 --> 01:00:18,868
Why are you sitting there like a sinner?

627
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:27,258
What's this?

628
01:00:27,258 --> 01:00:31,658
You two... what's with you both?

629
01:00:37,211 --> 01:00:39,411
Hold on.

630
01:00:40,912 --> 01:00:42,912
Wait...

631
01:00:45,718 --> 01:00:47,618
You two...

632
01:00:48,386 --> 01:00:50,432
It isn't true, right?

633
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:56,510
- Mom.
- Yes?

634
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:58,611
I'm sorry, Mother.

635
01:00:59,631 --> 01:01:03,241
Oh my. Oh my, what do I do?

636
01:01:03,241 --> 01:01:04,520
- Oh...
- Oh, Mom. Mom!

637
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,084
- What do I do?
- Calm down, calm down.

638
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:11,273
What? You, too. You...

639
01:01:11,273 --> 01:01:13,780
Did you know about it?

640
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:17,220
Oh... I did.

641
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:37,850
♫ Sometimes it's hard to be a woman ♫

642
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:47,400
♫ Givin' all your love to just one man ♫

643
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:54,500
To me, Jun Hui is just the man I like.

644
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:58,213
Just in case... don't cry.

645
01:01:58,213 --> 01:02:02,148
Aren't you even curious about how Jun Hui and I are living?

646
01:02:02,148 --> 01:02:03,939
Don't meet Jun Hui from now on.

647
01:02:03,939 --> 01:02:07,427
The rest of your daughter's life is on the line.

648
01:02:07,427 --> 01:02:10,956
I'm you, and you're me. Isn't that right?

649
01:02:10,956 --> 01:02:14,784
Gather up evidence that the female employees were treated unfairly.

650
01:02:14,785 --> 01:02:17,322
If I speak up this time, you're all dead.

651
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:18,791
I knew you were smart.

652
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:20,790
What is love?

653
01:02:21,926 --> 01:02:24,289
Teach me what love is.

654
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:27,027
What is love? Do you even know?

655
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:28,375
Goodness, what is that?

656
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:31,850
What can't I do for Yun Jin Ah?

657
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:34,539
What is it that you want?

658
01:02:34,539 --> 01:02:36,439
Seo Jun Hui.

659
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,099
I only want Seo Jun Hui.
