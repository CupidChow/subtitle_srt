00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:50,094
You're not going alone.

331
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:51,736
With a male employee?

332
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:56,576
How could your company be so thoughtless?

333
00:25:56,576 --> 00:25:58,735
A man and a woman together.

334
00:25:59,735 --> 00:26:02,086
Who is he? How old?

335
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:04,348
That's not the problem.

336
00:26:04,348 --> 00:26:07,749
The problem is that he's the source of all the annoyance.

337
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:09,944
Are you talking about that pervert?

338
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,745
The one who harasses female employees at karaokes?

339
00:26:17,165 --> 00:26:19,865
No. Don't go.

340
00:26:21,032 --> 00:26:22,925
I wish I didn't have to,

341
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:25,335
but I volunteered to go.

342
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:29,059
I didn't know I'd have to go with him! No one told me.

343
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,460
I just wanted to go with you...

344
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:40,328
So you did want to go with me.

345
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:44,993
Yes. You're right, okay?

346
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:48,226
What's the point now? It's all ruined.

347
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:51,026
What do you mean? I can just go.

348
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:56,704
Do you think I'd let you go alone with a perverted weirdo?

349
00:26:56,704 --> 00:27:00,504
What about work? You can't take time off.

350
00:27:00,504 --> 00:27:04,386
If I really can't, I will have to resign.

351
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:06,797
You're crazy.

352
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:09,466
I am crazy about someone.

353
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,259
I'm going back to the store later. Then I'll go see Gyeong Seon tonight.

354
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:37,340
I haven't seen her much lately. I think she's a bit annoyed.

355
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,810
She isn't annoyed. She's lovesick.

356
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,611
Okay. I will be there, too.

357
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:44,420
You, too?

358
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:49,328
Wouldn't it be weird to be together?

359
00:27:49,328 --> 00:27:51,528
It'll be dangerous and fun.

360
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:53,929
Should we make a bet on who can act better?

361
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:56,638
What nonsense.

362
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:05,069
Do you still have a lot to do?

363
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:08,312
You should head home first. I need to chat with the deliveryman.

364
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,513
That shouldn't take long.

365
00:28:10,513 --> 00:28:13,560
You worked all day because I was gone.

366
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,208
Don't go to your regular bar.

367
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:19,024
Go home and rest. Don't be late tomorrow. Go on.

368
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:21,997
I can't imagine being late because you're so scary.

369
00:28:21,998 --> 00:28:25,197
- Thank you.
- Yes. Goodbye.

370
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,579
Did you leave something here...

371
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:40,343
How did you know I was here?

372
00:28:47,438 --> 00:28:49,784
Can you give me coffee first?

373
00:28:49,784 --> 00:28:51,683
I will pay.

374
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:04,766
I didn't hear from you, so I thought you weren't coming.

375
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:08,297
Do I always have to call before coming?

376
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,245
Looks like you're about leave.

377
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:15,247
Jin Ah said she was coming, but I can't reach her.

378
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:18,728
What do you mean?

379
00:29:18,728 --> 00:29:22,057
We aren't allowed to use the phone in the store so I thought that was why.

380
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:24,036
But now it's way past closing time.

381
00:29:24,036 --> 00:29:26,737
She's not even reading her messages.

382
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:37,302
Jin Ah. I want you and me...

383
00:29:37,302 --> 00:29:40,625
That won't happen. I said no.

384
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:43,079
Why are you being like this? How long are you going to keep this up?

385
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,479
Until you change your mind.

386
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,588
Listen carefully. What you're doing right now isn't love.

387
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,441
It's not even lingering affection.

388
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:56,388
You've had everything you've ever wanted in life.

389
00:29:56,388 --> 00:30:00,188
It's the first time you've felt this way, so you're just mistaken.

390
00:30:00,188 --> 00:30:02,088
It's just your stubbornness.

391
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:04,416
Who cares if it's stubbornness?

392
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:07,417
I just want you back, that's the same thing.

393
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:10,591
That kind of thinking is wrong, to begin with.

394
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:13,579
I'm not some object you can have.

395
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:15,175
Stop acting like you're so great.

396
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:17,790
What are you lacking?

397
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:21,891
You went to a good school and your family is rich.

398
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,199
I'm so tired of this. Let's just stop.

399
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:30,000
Leave. I need to close up.

400
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,160
What are you doing, seriously?

401
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,228
Just once.

402
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:09,384
You should be ashamed.

403
00:31:09,385 --> 00:31:12,434
Do you think this will change anything?

404
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:14,319
Are you trying to show off your strength?

405
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,317
Men who try to use strength to fix things are the lowest scum!

406
00:31:17,317 --> 00:31:20,917
No, nothing is wrong. I just couldn't reach Jin Ah today.

407
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:23,117
You know how we are.

408
00:31:24,136 --> 00:31:25,897
Yes.

409
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:27,657
I'm sure I will get in touch with her.

410
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:30,007
Mom, I will come by in a few days.

411
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:32,007
I'm out of kimchi.

412
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:33,905
Yes.

413
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:37,086
Yes. Rest up.

414
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:38,586
Yes.

415
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:44,156
She didn't go home, either. What happened to her?

416
00:31:44,156 --> 00:31:46,657
Gosh, I'm going crazy here.

417
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,763
I never knew you were such a nasty person.

418
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:02,863
You haven't seen anything yet.

419
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,154
If you don't leave right now, I'll report you for sexual assault.

420
00:32:07,154 --> 00:32:09,553
No, I better do it now.

421
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:14,801
If your parents and my parents met at the police station it'd be quite a sight, won't it?

422
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:18,429
You wait and see.

423
00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:04,865
Jin Ah!

424
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,560
Jin Ah!

425
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:13,111
Why is the place like this?

426
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,852
What happened here?

427
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,731
- It's nothing.
- What is it!

428
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:22,390
Who did this? I asked you who did this!

429
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:27,373
I'm okay.

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,080
Thank you.

436
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:14,767
Why would you let him be?

437
00:34:15,795 --> 00:34:18,629
How can you say that after going through this?

438
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:21,626
That crazy psycho! How can you let him be?

439
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:25,365
Provoking him will only make things harder for me.

440
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:27,564
Are you sure you aren't enjoying it?

441
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:30,968
Hey, don't say that crap.

442
00:34:32,847 --> 00:34:35,229
You should stomp on him. Why are you holding back?

443
00:34:35,229 --> 00:34:37,429
Especially for trash like that.

444
00:34:40,115 --> 00:34:42,650
Do you think he'll stop at this?

445
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,419
Not a chance.

446
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:46,439
Go outside.

447
00:34:46,439 --> 00:34:49,338
Don't make it worse and go outside.

448

Why didn't you use your phone?

451
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,307
Call the police, me, or even him.

452
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:10,709
Why would you just take it?

453
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,709
I thought he would leave if I talked to him.

454
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:21,249
You know how he is. Talking to him is like talking to a wall.

455
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:26,060
You're really good at getting victimized and saying nothing about it!

456
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,568
Do you think being nice is something to be proud of?

457
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:31,468
It's a disease, you idiot!

458
00:35:32,932 --> 00:35:36,732
If you do this to me, I'm really going to get upset.

459
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:39,390
You don't even deserve to cry!

465
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:07,853
I was harsh earlier. I didn't mean it.

466
00:36:09,285 --> 00:36:11,885
I already knew that.

467
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:16,694
You should go in. My sister will be looking for you.

468
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:20,354
She said she doesn't want to see me, that I should go out for some air.

469
00:36:20,354 --> 00:36:22,754
She said she'd clean up.

470
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:27,353
You're angry, aren't you?

471
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:36,551
I can't do what I want and doing it wouldn't even help.

472
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:38,750
It would be strange if I felt okay.

473
00:36:40,022 --> 00:36:41,722
Sorry.

474
00:36:45,546 --> 00:36:47,547
What did you do wrong?

00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,506
You already know.

476
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:54,052
I made you worry.

477
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:57,479
I didn't even think to call anyone.

478
00:37:01,229 --> 00:37:02,729
I...

479
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:08,048
wished you were with me.

480
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:22,345
It's just a scratch. It doesn't hurt at all.

481
00:37:23,754 --> 00:37:26,354
It does. It hurts me.

482
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,810

492
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,370
♫ But if you love him, you'll forgive him ♫

493
00:38:30,372 --> 00:38:32,225
Do you want to have a drink?

494
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:33,706
Should we go to your place?

495
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:36,460
I'm tired. I want to sleep. See you later.

496
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,000
♫ To understand ♫

497
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,440
♫ And if you love him ♫

00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,420

00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:09,600
♫ Stand by your man ♫

512
00:40:11,227 --> 00:40:13,627
Is this the biggest one we have?

513
00:40:13,627 --> 00:40:16,270
You always carry it in here.

514
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,470
Oh... it's because I'm not alone today.

515
00:40:21,548 --> 00:40:24,048
I'm going with my senior manager.

516
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,149
It's fine.

517
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:30,173
What?

518
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:32,805
I thought you were going on a business trip.

519
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,584
I was wondering why you put on such nice makeup and this outfit too.

520
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:39,115
I didn't. I just threw this on.

521
00:40:39,115 --> 00:40:41,215
I'll be going now.

522
00:40:41,215 --> 00:40:43,683
Travel safely.

523
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:45,815
Okay.

524
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,676
I thought she was going on a business trip?

525
00:40:56,676 --> 00:40:59,607
Right? Do you think it's weird, too?

526
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:02,887
I think she's seeing someone, don't you think?

527
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:05,960
It does seem like she's more mindful about her outfits.

528
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,527
We must be right then.

529
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:11,257
Who could she be dating?

530
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:12,951
Do you think it's Gyu Min?

531
00:41:12,951 --> 00:41:13,957
It must be!

532
00:41:13,957 --> 00:41:17,267
She can't lose him. Of course not.

533
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,268
What a thing to say.

534
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,151
He's a punk who cheated on Jin Ah.

535
00:41:21,151 --> 00:41:23,911
You should be worried if Jin Ah dates him again.

536
00:41:23,911 --> 00:41:25,421
What kind of mom are you?

537
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:27,822
What did I say?

538
00:41:32,582 --> 00:41:35,582
All right. Shall we get going?

539
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:39,892
Yes!

540
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:41,950
I'm certain you lived in the Joseon Era in your last life.

541
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,269
Why, you rascal?

542
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,469
Yes, My Lady.

543
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,720
[Coffee Bay]

544
00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:19,419
Manager Jeong.

545
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,272
What is that settlement for?

546
00:42:23,272 --> 00:42:24,220
It's not a settlement.

547
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,710
It's a report on our expenditures for all of our promotions.

548
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,470
Why does he suddenly need that?

549
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,970
He usually checks it around this time of year.

550
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,471
He hates money being spent on useless things.

551
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,801
Well... all money is money.

552
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:44,401
All management should be concerned about spending.

553
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,771
I will reflect on it some more, as well.

554
00:42:58,816 --> 00:43:02,648
About the new shopping mall store in Dangjin...

555
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:04,648
the location is very good.

556
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:08,282
The chairman of the mall and the store franchisee are family.

557
00:43:08,283 --> 00:43:12,046
What is it? They want to do well.

558
00:43:12,046 --> 00:43:14,776
They said you shouldn't worry.

559
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:17,836
They received all the benefits of the subsidiary laws.

560
00:43:17,836 --> 00:43:21,117
If they don't do a good job, they'd have no conscience.

561
00:43:21,117 --> 00:43:25,188
Oh... in the spirit of cutting costs on a large-scale...

562
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:26,823
What was that?

563
00:43:26,823 --> 00:43:30,284
What do you think about workplace education on the efficient use of office supplies?

564
00:43:30,285 --> 00:43:32,673
I heard Yun Jin Ah went on a business trip.

565
00:43:32,674 --> 00:43:35,784
Oh, yes... with Senior Manager Gong.

566
00:43:35,784 --> 00:43:39,325
How lazy were the others that she had to come in from the store?

567
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,734
It isn't office supplies we need to cut back on.

568
00:43:42,734 --> 00:43:46,534
It's the employees who sit around like decorations.

569
00:43:54,497 --> 00:43:56,092
- Hello.
- Hello.

570
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,313
Why are you without your partner?

571
00:43:58,314 --> 00:43:59,749
Oh, Jun Hui?

572
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,459
He took time off for family issues.

573
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,702
What issues?

574
00:44:02,702 --> 00:44:05,502
I don't really know.

575
00:44:05,502 --> 00:44:08,560
You must be really curious.

576
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,990
Oh...

577
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,693
Not at all.

578
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:15,548
You're always together and you look lonely without him.

579
00:44:15,548 --> 00:44:17,439
Oh!

580
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:21,332
Gosh, this is why men shouldn't hang around together, right?

581
00:44:21,332 --> 00:44:24,459
- I need to find someone soon...
- I'll be rooting for you.

582
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,156
- Bye, now.
- Yes.

583
00:44:27,156 --> 00:44:28,323
Goodbye.

584
00:44:28,323 --> 00:44:30,323
Who does he think he is?

585
00:44:30,323 --> 00:44:33,057
You're even going after Seo Jun Hui...

586
00:44:33,057 --> 00:44:34,957
Are you saying I don't have a chance?

587
00:44:34,957 --> 00:44:36,925
It's the opposite. The opposite.

588
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:40,925
He seems like a major player. He seems interested in you, though.

589
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:43,368
Did it look that way?

590
00:44:43,368 --> 00:44:45,454
So what if he's a player?

591
00:44:45,455 --> 00:44:48,055
It depends on who trains him.

592
00:44:57,285 --> 00:44:59,437
Can you stop looking at me like that?

593
00:44:59,437 --> 00:45:00,968
Like what?

594
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:05,068
You look like an unemployed husband watching his wife getting ready for work.

595
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:07,971
That's not bad.

596
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:13,186
Here are your shoes.

597
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:15,791
Thank you.

598
00:45:22,836 --> 00:45:24,753
What will you do?

599
00:45:24,753 --> 00:45:26,003
I'm going to stay right here.

600
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:28,923
Don't make it so that I can't work.

601
00:45:28,923 --> 00:45:32,043
Do something. There's a lot to see here.

602
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:34,043
All alone? That's no fun.

603
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:39,834
My absence does tend to get noticed by people.

604
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:41,085
Get out.

605
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:42,673
You won't play along, even once.

606
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,574
I'll be back.

607
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:52,269
- Work hard.
- Yes.

608
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,891
Wait just a bit.

609
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,600
You're pretty.

610
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,210
What?

611
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,440
I said you're pretty.

612
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:14,687
What did you say? What?

613
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:17,430
I said you're pretty!

614
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,230
- What, what?
- Be quiet.

615
00:46:37,363 --> 00:46:40,195
How was your drive down?

616
00:46:40,195 --> 00:46:44,866
You're the one that wanted to come separately. Are you now acting worried?

617
00:46:44,866 --> 00:46:49,254
My dad had some business in the area, so I came with him.

618
00:46:49,254 --> 00:46:51,046
Take care of the details and do a good job.

619
00:46:51,046 --> 00:46:54,584
You know about Director Nam and this place, right?

620
00:46:54,584 --> 00:46:56,455
I always work hard.

621
00:46:56,455 --> 00:46:59,255
I'm telling you to put in more effort.

622
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:02,873
Where are you going?

623
00:47:02,873 --> 00:47:05,023
To say hello to the shopping mall chairman.

624
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,372
He is related to Director Nam.

625
00:47:07,372 --> 00:47:11,472
Director Nam sent me on purpose to go and meet with him.

626
00:47:17,817 --> 00:47:20,917
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

627
00:47:22,336 --> 00:47:25,786
Here's the itinerary for the OT (Training).

628
00:47:26,934 --> 00:47:31,324
Why bother gathering all the franchisees from every nook and cranny?

629
00:47:31,324 --> 00:47:34,626
You can get friendly with them and share information.

630
00:47:34,626 --> 00:47:36,253
You've been to them before.

631
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,601
I know.

632
00:47:37,602 --> 00:47:40,984
I just drink, sleep, and come back.

633
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:43,484
You'll definitely get friendly then.

634
00:47:45,024 --> 00:47:47,433
Is something wrong at home, by any chance?

635
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:50,934
With my family? No. Why?

636
00:47:52,634 --> 00:47:54,925
It just seemed like you really didn't want to go.

637
00:47:54,926 --> 00:47:58,598
I thought that maybe there was something going on at home.

638
00:47:58,598 --> 00:48:00,867
I'm just complaining because it's tiring to go.

639
00:48:00,868 --> 00:48:02,968
Nothing's going on.

640
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:06,093
I heard that Jin Ah's on a business trip.

641
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:08,493
Oh, yes.

642
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,630
[Apples, 9 for 7,990 won]

643
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:18,483
Jin Ah's mom!

644
00:48:20,685 --> 00:48:23,854
You're too much, even for an addict.

645
00:48:23,855 --> 00:48:27,216
Who exercises morning and evening?

646
00:48:27,216 --> 00:48:28,635
It's still not enough.

647
00:48:28,635 --> 00:48:31,800
You should start now before it's too late.

648
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,380
I'm just going to live like I have always lived.

649
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,020
[Apples, 9 for 7,990 won]

650
00:48:38,026 --> 00:48:41,022
I saw Jin Ah this morning.

651
00:48:41,022 --> 00:48:43,926
It seemed like her boyfriend was driving her to work.

652
00:48:43,926 --> 00:48:46,526
What boyfriend? Where did you see her?

653
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:49,926
The parking lot. He picked her up.

654
00:48:50,485 --> 00:48:54,285
She's going on a business trip with her senior manager.

655
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:57,942
He was very young.

656
00:48:57,942 --> 00:49:00,532
Things are different in this generation.

657
00:49:00,533 --> 00:49:03,433
Manager or Senior Manager, they're all young.

658
00:49:05,296 --> 00:49:06,992
No wonder.

659
00:49:06,992 --> 00:49:10,226
He was very good looking.

660
00:49:10,226 --> 00:49:13,470
That's why I thought he was her boyfriend.

661
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:16,852
I better come back here after my evening workout.

662
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,023
to buy myself some fruit.

663
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:22,023
- Bye then.
- Okay.

664
00:49:29,845 --> 00:49:31,344
Are you finished?

665
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:34,259
Yes. There are just a few things I need to look over.

666
00:49:34,259 --> 00:49:36,549
I think our team can contact the suppliers.

667
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:39,619
- We can call for materials tomorrow.
- Okay.

668
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:43,798
Well, the chairman and store owner want to have dinner together.

669
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:46,188
Just finish things up.

670
00:49:46,188 --> 00:49:49,110
I'm not feeling so well.

671
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,388
- I'll have to go back to my room.
- What do you mean?

672
00:49:52,388 --> 00:49:54,949
- It must have been something I ate.
- Let's go if you're done.

673
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:57,215
We will go to the best restaurant here.

674
00:49:57,216 --> 00:50:01,016
A bowl of noodles would've been fine. That really isn't necessary.

675
00:50:01,016 --> 00:50:02,376
I'm sorry, Sir.

676
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:04,899
I'm not feeling well because of something I ate.

677
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:07,455
I'll be back early tomorrow morning to finish up.

678
00:50:07,455 --> 00:50:09,756
Thank you!

679
00:50:10,955 --> 00:50:12,244
She isn't feeling well...

680
00:50:12,244 --> 00:50:15,344
Sorry. Please, wait one moment.

681
00:50:16,696 --> 00:50:18,896
Section Chief Yun. Section Chief Yun!

682
00:50:20,265 --> 00:50:21,845
What are you doing?

683
00:50:21,845 --> 00:50:24,245
How can you back out when you're here?

684
00:50:24,926 --> 00:50:27,072
What do you mean "back out"?

685
00:50:27,072 --> 00:50:29,151
I'm bringing it up because you aren't acting like yourself.

686
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:30,706
Were you ever picky about this?

687
00:50:30,707 --> 00:50:34,267
What are you referring to?

688
00:50:34,267 --> 00:50:36,559
Are you asking because you don't know?

689
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,601
We all have a meal together, then we will have a drink...

690
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:43,068
- And...
- Play the tambourine at the karaoke.

691
00:50:43,068 --> 00:50:46,368
And endure unpleasant touching?

692
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:52,136
I'm not going to do that stuff anymore.

693
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:54,736
I'm so sick of it that I can't do it.

694
00:50:56,435 --> 00:50:58,636
I'll be going now.

695
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:05,093
What's with her?

696
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,066
Oh my!

697
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:18,636
What's wrong?

698
00:51:18,636 --> 00:51:20,191
It's nothing.

699
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,990
It doesn't seem like nothing.

700
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:24,590
Why are you here?

701
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,581
It was long past the time you said you'd be done, so I was going to the store.

702
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:31,641
I had some things to finish up.

703
00:51:31,641 --> 00:51:33,153
Sorry, you had to wait too long.

704
00:51:33,154 --> 00:51:34,839
You must be hungry. I'm so hungry.

705
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,239
Let's go eat something good, okay?

706
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:42,788
Just tell me I did well.

707
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,177
You did well.

708
00:51:48,177 --> 00:51:49,606
Thank you.

709
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:53,850

736
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,789
I still can't believe it.

737
00:54:20,206 --> 00:54:23,406
That we are together like this.

738
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,250
Honestly...

739
00:54:31,466 --> 00:54:33,766
I am a little worried.

740
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:37,912
Can we really do this?

741
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,376
We can do this.

742
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:46,248
I told you. We can face this together.

743
00:54:50,926 --> 00:54:52,925
I...

744
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:58,061
"I shouldn't have held your hand."

745
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,741
What if I start to think that?

746
00:55:02,705 --> 00:55:05,355
Then you're dead.

747
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:16,311
I'll be good so that you'll never regret it.

748
00:55:17,312 --> 00:55:19,011
Can I trust you?

749
00:55:20,352 --> 00:55:22,552
You can trust me.

750
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,302
And if I don't?

751
00:55:25,104 --> 00:55:26,704
Then don't.

752
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:39,419
I'll be good because I already have regrets.

753
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,336
I'm doing this so you trust me.

754
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:43,800
What regrets?

755
00:55:46,835 --> 00:55:50,435
Why couldn't I confess my feelings first?

756
00:55:50,435 --> 00:55:52,853
I should've held her hand first.

757
00:56:02,044 --> 00:56:04,944
Oh, it's cold.

758
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:09,161
You should've dressed warmly, like me.

759
00:56:10,052 --> 00:56:13,552
Isn't the man supposed to say, "Wear mine" at times like this?

760
00:56:13,552 --> 00:56:15,482
I'm cold, too.

761
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:18,517
That's so not cool.

762
00:56:25,955 --> 00:56:29,455
How do you fit so perfectly in my arms?

763
00:56:29,455 --> 00:56:32,334
Are you teasing me for being small again?

764
00:56:36,399 --> 00:56:38,699
You can't blame me for this.

765
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:10,760
♫ When the night falls ♫

766
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:16,630
♫ And the rest of the world quiets down ♫

767
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:23,370
♫ I come running to you ♫

768
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:27,160
♫ And there you sing me a song ♫

769
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,470
♫ The little sweet melody ♫

770
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,550
♫ Oh, how I wish it would never end ♫

771
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,440
♫ Turn off the light, dear ♫

772
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:59,670
♫ Let me sink beneath the waves of your heart ♫

773
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:06,220
♫ And then comes the light in darkness ♫

774
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:09,790
♫ Glowing through the night ♫

775
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:36,660
♫ Has the rain stopped ♫

776
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,190
♫ Is the daybreak yet to come ♫

777
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,810
♫ But why should I be worried ♫

778
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:52,240
♫ When I'm here with you now? ♫

779
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:02,810
♫ The little sweet melody ♫

780
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:14,130
♫ Oh, how I wish it would never end ♫

781
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:24,180
♫ The little sweet melody ♫

782
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:35,550
♫ How I wish it would never end ♫

783
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:40,640
♫ It seems so unreal ♫

784
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:45,820
♫ But it's not untrue ♫

785
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,770
♫ Come away with me ♫

786
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:56,610
♫ Leave it all behind ♫

787
01:02:51,975 --> 01:02:53,600
Good morning.

788
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,236
I will call you once I'm done.

789
01:02:55,236 --> 01:02:57,436
From the woman in the drawing.

790
01:03:25,706 --> 01:03:27,707
You can work if you need to.

791
01:03:27,707 --> 01:03:30,088
I really came by for a coffee.

792
01:03:30,088 --> 01:03:32,588
I'm almost done with my work.

793
01:03:33,238 --> 01:03:36,638
Is this store location going to change in any way?

794
01:03:37,836 --> 01:03:41,437
If it needs to change, it will have to change.

795
01:03:41,437 --> 01:03:44,239
Yes, even people change.

796
01:03:46,564 --> 01:03:51,460
Section Chief Yun must've been determined when she agreed to go on this business trip.

797
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,760
Senior Manager Gong was livid.

798
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,376
- Why?
- I talked to him

799
01:03:55,376 --> 01:03:58,394
because of the store contract in Dangjin.

800
01:03:58,394 --> 01:04:02,595
He was going on about how Section Chief Yun acted on her own.

801
01:04:03,496 --> 01:04:05,895
I would have gone on my own, too.

802
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:11,150
Still, she's Yun Jin Ah.

803
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:14,699
She must've needed a change.

804
01:04:20,588 --> 01:04:23,910
I'm fine. You must be more tired since you drove.

805
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:27,210
I told you we should've taken turns.

806
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:30,760
I am the best driver.

807
01:04:32,689 --> 01:04:34,289
Next time?

808
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:37,019
Are we going on another trip?

809
01:04:37,723 --> 01:04:40,423
Oh, I'll call you back.

810
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,877
- Who is it?
- It is Geum Bora,

811
01:04:43,877 --> 01:04:46,470
she watched the store while I was gone.

812
01:04:47,089 --> 01:04:50,491
How old is the senior manager you went with?

813
01:04:50,491 --> 01:04:53,671
I don't know. About forty-something?

814
01:04:53,671 --> 01:04:56,677
- Is he good-looking?
- What?

815
01:04:56,677 --> 01:04:59,752
The lady in Apartment 704 said he was very good-looking.

816
01:04:59,752 --> 01:05:01,952
She saw you in the car with him.

817
01:05:03,131 --> 01:05:07,631
How could she have gotten a good look when the car was passing by?

818
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:13,224
She said you were going with a young and handsome man.

819
01:05:13,224 --> 01:05:16,631
Whatever the case, be conservative with your body.

820
01:05:16,631 --> 01:05:19,531
If someone gets your body, word will get around.

821
01:05:20,071 --> 01:05:24,510
What did I do? Why are you making me out to be someone weird?

822
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:26,622
You and that temper of yours.

823
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,341
I can't say anything to you.

824
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,541
Leave.

825
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:33,121
Gyeong Seon is coming over with Jun Hui.

826
01:05:33,121 --> 01:05:34,209
Why?

827
01:05:34,209 --> 01:05:37,123
What do you mean "Why"? Seung Ho is coming up, too.

828
01:05:37,123 --> 01:05:40,364
We are all going to get together and grill some meat.

829
01:05:40,364 --> 01:05:44,864
Besides, I haven't made Jun Hui a proper meal since he got back from the States.

830
01:05:45,546 --> 01:05:46,931
So what?

831
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:50,600
Gyeong Seon takes good care of him.

832
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,635
No matter how you slice it, a sister is just a sister.

833
01:05:54,635 --> 01:06:00,068
They lost their parents so early on. We just accept it as normal.

834
01:06:00,068 --> 01:06:02,051
Honestly, I feel so bad for them.

835
01:06:02,051 --> 01:06:05,352
Why would you feel bad for them? They live just fine.

836
01:06:05,352 --> 01:06:11,049
You're so ignorant. How is that living well?

837
01:06:11,049 --> 01:06:14,707
Is making a living considered living well? Even if that is true,

838
01:06:14,707 --> 01:06:17,381
they only have each other.

839
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:19,989
Think about when they get married later.

840
01:06:19,989 --> 01:06:22,919
What kind of household would like that?

841
01:06:22,919 --> 01:06:25,750
Why would you say such a thing?

842
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,144
I'm telling you the reality.

843
01:06:28,144 --> 01:06:30,203
Wait and see if my words are wrong.

844
01:06:30,203 --> 01:06:35,003
The world isn't such an easy place.

845
01:06:35,771 --> 01:06:38,044
- Gosh.
- Mom!

846
01:06:38,044 --> 01:06:40,701
Don't bring up Lee Gyu Min in front of them.

847
01:06:40,701 --> 01:06:43,933
Don't bring up the past or whatever, okay?

848
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,032
At least you know to be ashamed.

849
01:06:46,032 --> 01:06:48,379
- Do you understand?
- I don't know.

850
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,379
Don't ever bring him up.

851
01:07:03,213 --> 01:07:06,413
Yes, I just heard from Noona.

852
01:07:07,467 --> 01:07:09,267
Why are you worried?

853
01:07:11,957 --> 01:07:14,657
You have to break the taboo to be a pro.

854
01:07:15,727 --> 01:07:17,727
I'm not kidding.

855
01:07:21,028 --> 01:07:22,690
Why are you already worried?

856
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:25,220
I said we can face it and resolve it.

857
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:28,834
What mistake would we make?

858
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:43,241
How do you know the code?

859
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:44,531
What?

860
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:48,753
Oh, this... I must've memorized it when I went in with Seung Ho.

861
01:07:48,753 --> 01:07:53,117
Why would you look at their entry code? That's rude.

862
01:07:55,602 --> 01:07:57,080
A drink for you.

863
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,680
Come sit down, Dad.

864
01:08:05,422 --> 01:08:07,021
Here.

865
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:13,276
- Father, please accept a drink.
- All right.

866
01:08:15,343 --> 01:08:19,787
It's been a long time since the whole family got together.

867
01:08:19,787 --> 01:08:22,527
Let's all toast, okay?

868
01:08:22,527 --> 01:08:26,427
- Cheers.
- Let's drink.

869
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,810
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you.

870
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,390
Thank you for the meal.

871
01:08:45,671 --> 01:08:48,353
- Don't be so nervous.
- Why?

872
01:08:48,353 --> 01:08:50,450
- Am I being weird?
- Yes.

873
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:52,475
A quick person would've already caught on.

874
01:08:52,475 --> 01:08:55,114
Really? What should I do?

875
01:08:55,114 --> 01:08:57,201
Smile. You usually smile a lot.

876
01:08:57,201 --> 01:08:58,801
Prettily.

877
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:11,400
I thought all the couples in the world were like Mom and Dad.

878
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:16,000
I thought our dad was like Mom and Dad, too.

879
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:22,980
How could he marry someone else less than half a year after Mom died?

880
01:09:23,568 --> 01:09:27,667
How could he leave me and Jun Hui?

881
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:29,991
How could he abandon his own kids?

882
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:31,800
Why would you bring that up again?

883
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,499
You just don't know.

884
01:09:33,499 --> 01:09:38,799
You don't know how absurd it was and how sad I was.

885
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:42,640
No one in the world was by our side

886
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,060
and honestly...

887
01:09:45,845 --> 01:09:49,298
I wanted to die, seriously.

888
01:09:49,298 --> 01:09:52,297
You shouldn't say such a thing.

889
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:57,920
You have this family here. Why would you have no one by your side?

890
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,828
Of course.

891
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:03,136
I'll be hurt if you say no one was on your side.

892
01:10:03,136 --> 01:10:06,230
We have never considered you or Jun Hui

893
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:09,608
to be other people's children.

894
01:10:09,608 --> 01:10:12,656
I know. How could I not know that?

895
01:10:12,656 --> 01:10:17,556
I would be the most ungrateful person if I didn't know that.

896
01:10:20,214 --> 01:10:23,314
Hey, don't drink too much.

897
01:10:23,315 --> 01:10:25,494
Just one is enough.

898
01:10:25,495 --> 01:10:27,634
Jeez.

899
01:10:27,635 --> 01:10:31,263
You're both too old. You both overreact when you drink.

900
01:10:31,264 --> 01:10:33,264
Hey.

901
01:10:33,264 --> 01:10:35,380
I admit it.

902
01:10:35,381 --> 01:10:37,969
But what's wrong with our Jin Ah?

903
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:43,191
Hey, do you know how many guys said they couldn't live without her?

904
01:10:43,192 --> 01:10:45,678
I just haven't told you all about it.

905
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:50,839
If you heard about her eventful dating history, you'd all faint in shock.

906
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,138
She's drunk again. She does this whenever she's drunk.

907
01:10:53,139 --> 01:10:55,157
- Aigoo, Gyeong Sun.
- I'm not drunk.

908
01:10:55,158 --> 01:10:57,620
Should I empty this can?

909
01:10:57,621 --> 01:11:00,720
I better drink it.

910
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,019
- Recently, Lee Gyu Min...
- Hey!

911
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:06,320
What's wrong with you?

912
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,303
- Seriously.
- What is it?

913
01:11:08,304 --> 01:11:11,161
- Are you still dating him?
- No!

914
01:11:11,162 --> 01:11:13,862
Hey, do you know something?

915
01:11:13,862 --> 01:11:18,451
What would I know? My sister's just acting over the top.

916
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:21,449
- What are you hiding?
- Just be quiet, would you?

917
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:25,588
Wait. Yun Jin Ah. What are you talking about?

918
01:11:25,588 --> 01:11:29,004
You told me not to mention Gyu Min. It's because something's up, right?

919
01:11:29,004 --> 01:11:34,223
I knew it! You two wouldn't end things so easily.

920
01:11:34,224 --> 01:11:36,960
- Mom!
- Hey.

921
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:40,044
It's just us. What's wrong? There's no need to be shy.

922
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:43,782
A relationship is about breaking up and dating again.

923
01:11:43,783 --> 01:11:46,622
- Isn't that right?
- I said I'm not. I'm not!

924
01:11:46,623 --> 01:11:50,124
I'm never going to see him again!

925
01:11:50,124 --> 01:11:54,675
If you were going to do this, why did you bother dating him at all?

926
01:11:54,675 --> 01:11:57,317
Watch what you say! You're so rude every time you talk.

927
01:11:57,318 --> 01:11:59,397
Why would you hit the head of a child who's studying?

928
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:03,698
Is studying everything? He needs to become human first.

929
01:12:03,698 --> 01:12:05,991
Jin Ah is right about that.

930
01:12:05,991 --> 01:12:11,091
Besides studying and his doctorate, his character is the problem.

931
01:12:11,091 --> 01:12:13,258
I'm not looking for anything else.

932
01:12:13,259 --> 01:12:18,758
The priority is a person who knows how to care about people.

933
01:12:18,758 --> 01:12:22,548
If she brings someone like that, I would definitely say yes.

934
01:12:22,549 --> 01:12:25,149
I agree.

935
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,460
We're out of alcohol.

936
01:12:38,037 --> 01:12:41,361
How is it going with the thirty-five-year-old?

937
01:12:41,362 --> 01:12:43,762
Why are you so interested in me lately?

938
01:12:43,762 --> 01:12:48,059
What interest? I'm asking because you seemed so down about it last time.

939
01:12:48,059 --> 01:12:49,602
"Down"? I don't think so.

940
01:12:49,602 --> 01:12:51,701
There are many couples with older women and younger men lately.

941
01:12:51,702 --> 01:12:54,302
You never know. You might be in one.

942
01:12:54,302 --> 01:12:57,632
Am I you? That's not my thing.

943
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,960
Hello.

944
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,842
Ah, yes. You need to come in a little bit more.

945
01:13:05,842 --> 01:13:08,170
- Yes, yes.
- The designated driver is here.

946
01:13:08,171 --> 01:13:11,971
- Okay.
- You can go in. He's here.

947
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,705
Yes. Okay.

948
01:13:13,706 --> 01:13:17,958
Well, get home safely and call.

949
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:20,222
I mean call to let me know about Gyeong Seon.

950
01:13:20,223 --> 01:13:21,652
Yes, okay.

951
01:13:21,653 --> 01:13:24,354
- Go on in.
- Bye.

952
01:13:36,555 --> 01:13:39,255
It's pretty cold today, right?

953
01:13:39,255 --> 01:13:41,153
What happened with Lee Gyu Min?

954
01:13:41,154 --> 01:13:42,719
It's nothing much.

955
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,519
He showed up and caused a scene again. They found out about it.

956
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,966
- What?
- Call me if something happens again.

957
01:13:51,966 --> 01:13:56,036
You aren't even nearby and you don't even have time to study.

958
01:13:56,036 --> 01:13:58,903
It won't happen again. I took care of it.

959
01:13:58,903 --> 01:14:03,104
What good is it to take care of it? He has to stop causing trouble.

960
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:06,924
Do a good job. Don't turn the house upside down again.

961
01:14:17,778 --> 01:14:20,378
Be careful. Be careful.

962
01:14:49,036 --> 01:14:50,791
The data is off.

963
01:14:50,792 --> 01:14:52,933
- Is there something like that?
- Turn it off.

964
01:14:52,934 --> 01:14:55,234
I don't think so.

965
01:14:55,234 --> 01:14:57,458
Mobile data.

966
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:58,733
Is this it?

967
01:14:58,734 --> 01:15:01,733
The wifi doesn't work either.

968
01:15:01,734 --> 01:15:03,229
Why doesn't it work?

969
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:06,516
- It works here.
- Oh, it does.

970
01:15:06,516 --> 01:15:10,367
It's working. Our Ph.D. student is a genius.

971
01:15:34,251 --> 01:15:36,851
Yes. It's me.

972
01:16:01,899 --> 01:16:03,633
I have to go in now.

973
01:16:03,634 --> 01:16:06,176
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- "Tomorrow"?

974
01:16:06,176 --> 01:16:10,964
Well, I have a day off. I guess I'll sleep in.

975
01:16:10,964 --> 01:16:15,665
I don't have plans after that. Why? Do you want to do something?

976
01:16:15,665 --> 01:16:17,897
Not necessarily...

977
01:16:17,898 --> 01:16:19,439
Well...

978
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,937
Is there something?

979
01:16:20,938 --> 01:16:23,212
What is it? Tell me.

980
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:25,281
Tomorrow...

981
01:16:25,282 --> 01:16:30,082
my sister is going on an OT for two days and one night.

982
01:16:30,082 --> 01:16:33,668
Do you want to come to my place?

983
01:17:04,136 --> 01:17:05,936
Here you go.

That isn't Yun Tambourine.

991
01:19:05,327 --> 01:19:06,996
She's like a completely different person.

992
01:19:06,997 --> 01:19:08,326
It seems like a lie.

That a woman so beautiful is in front of me.

Oh, you're crazy! We are at work.

Should I make it so that pervert can't even step into work?

I'll make sure you don't need to hide anymore.

I'll make sure of it.
