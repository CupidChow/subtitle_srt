Why can't I? Why can't I be with him?

65
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,334
Is it because I've known him since he was young?

66
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,608
Is it because you think of him as a son?

00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:05,339
There's nothing lacking about her.

169
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,717
She's so trustworthy. She really is.

170
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:11,327
Do you want to go home in a taxi?

171
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:15,635
You're just the same.

172
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,779
I didn't do anything.

173
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,880
Why did you come if you weren't going to do anything?

174
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:26,537
You said it yourself.

175
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:29,038
You won't use this against me.

176
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:32,962
All right.

177
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:48,406
What is it?

178
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,408
Are you asking because you don't know?

179
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:52,539
I'm asking because I don't know.

180
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,640
Sleep outside!

181
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,266
What did I do wrong?

182
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,571
It's my fault.

183
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:29,441
Don't attack your mom.

184
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,120
She'll get worse the more you do.

185
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:33,937
Dad, you're the one who shouldn't.

186
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:38,039
You know you'll get in trouble, yet you say more and get in trouble.

187
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:40,871
It's fun.

188
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:47,174
Your mom...

189
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:50,634
It's going to be really hard.

190
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:54,649
Still, you can't hate or resent her.

191
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:56,864
I already do.

192
00:18:56,864 --> 00:19:00,199
You know she's doing it all for you.

193
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,239
I do know that.

194
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:11,023
Let's try together.

195
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,900
I haven't seen people gathering after work lately.

196
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,584
You never hang out with us. Why do you care?

197
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,615
It's not like I ditched on purpose.

198
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:29,515
I just always had work.

199
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:31,570
Why don't people get together?

200
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,230
The mood isn't so great.

201
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,540
What is it?

202
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:03,846
What's with you?

203
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:08,200
Why are things not great between you and Director Nam?

204
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,993
Gosh, what is it?

205
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:13,790
Why are you so interested in other people's business all of a sudden?

206
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,390
I mean,

207
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,652
you two were so close.

208
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:21,054
When someone as easygoing as you acts like this,

209
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,854
I'm sure there's something going on.

210
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:28,545
- Right?
- You have a good eye for people.

211
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:30,484
Well...

212
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,289
I'm stressed out about Director Nam because...

213
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,990
Yes?

214
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:39,240
Gosh, never mind.

215
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:46,615
I better take you somewhere nice and buy you a drink.

216
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:48,114
What? Really?

217
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:50,868
What are good colleagues for?

218
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:53,169
We help each other out through hard times.

219
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:56,814
So where is this nice place?

220
00:20:56,814 --> 00:20:59,814
Do you have a place in mind?

221
00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:01,310
Where?

222
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:08,844
Section Chief Yun hasn't been coming by. Is she very busy?

223
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:13,744
The store is busy, and her heart is busy too.

224
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:16,185
Did you know, too?

225
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:18,843
You, too?

226
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:21,535
Was I supposed to know something?

227
00:21:21,535 --> 00:21:24,335
Dong Wu, we will be late. Let's go.

228
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:32,016
Why didn't you tell me?

229
00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:34,316
Did Section Chief Yun tell you to keep it from me?

230
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:37,238
I guess I was on her radar, after all.

231
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:40,138
Why is she acting like she doesn't have anything to be sorry for?

232
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:42,907
What else did she say?

233
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:45,879
- Did she say she'd do something for me?
- Who?

234
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,761
Are you even listening to me?

235
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:50,033
You said you heard about Yun Jin Ah's boyfriend.

236
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:52,332
Oh, I heard it from the person directly.

237
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:54,434
Yes, Section Chief Yun...

238
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:58,687
"The person," who is that?

239
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,321
Seo Jun Hui.

240
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:05,690
I asked him if he knew who her boyfriend was and he said...

241
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:07,781
"It's me."

242
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:32,860
My mom's arm isn't so good, so I need to go in early for now.

243
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:40,271
Gosh, I understand.

244
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:43,209
- Eat slowly. You'll get indigestion.
- Okay.

245
00:22:43,209 --> 00:22:46,309
I have to go back to the store. One of the part-timers didn't come.

246
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,348
I chose a girlfriend who's too busy.

247
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:52,118
You chose one that's a pain in the ass.

248
00:22:52,118 --> 00:22:53,618
That would be me.

249
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,017
What's wrong with you?

250
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,728
It's nothing.

251
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:08,081
I said it's nothing. I was just saying that.

252
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:10,781
Don't say those things.

253
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:14,229
I made you hear upsetting things.

254
00:23:14,229 --> 00:23:18,250
My mom made it like that. Why would you blame yourself?

255
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:21,779
And you told me not to belittle myself.

256
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,830
I must've looked so bad to you.

257
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:27,459
Is that how you saw me?

258
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,161
I only saw you as being pretty.

259
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:32,560
Oh, seriously.

260
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,861
I'm so weak for the word "pretty."

261
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:38,770
If that word didn't exist, I wouldn't have been able to seduce you.

262
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:41,577
Anyway, don't ever say–

263
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:43,427
- I won't, I won't.
- Don't do it.

264
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:45,205
I won't. I won't ever again.

265
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:47,607
You better not say it again.

266
00:23:52,427 --> 00:23:54,427
Eat slowly.

267
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,962
I'm done eating.

268
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,651
Take your time coming out.

269
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,400
[Push]

270
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:28,976
Welcome.

271
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,250
[Coffee Bay]

272
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:42,337
Mom, are you hurt?

273
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:44,058
It isn't a big deal.

274
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:48,558
"Not a big deal"? You should've been careful.

275
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,711
Let's go in and talk.

276
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,399
Did you know about it, too?

277
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:06,529
I haven't known for long.

278
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,029
I can't put into words how shocked I was.

279
00:25:10,738 --> 00:25:15,049
It's already happened... I should just let them date.

280
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,750
What are you saying...

281
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:21,025
Is this something you can just allow?

282
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:24,355
Jin Ah and Jun Hui are practically family.

283
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:26,556
Well, that is...

284
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:29,599
They say they like each other though.

285
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,043
Even those words sound shameful to me!

286
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:39,788
I truly think of Jun Hui as my son, that's why I'm acting like this.

287
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,097
Think about it carefully.

288
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:46,497
This isn't something you can brush off as being normal.

289
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:51,579
Jun Hui isn't lacking in anything, of course.

290
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:54,997
I may be the type of person who nitpicks about qualifications.

291
00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:56,787
But this isn't just anyone.

292
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,987
Do you think I would assess Jun Hui that way?

293
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:03,609
- That wouldn't be right.
- Of course.

294
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:05,822
It isn't anything else.

295
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:09,735
I think they just have affection for one another and mistook it for more than that.

296
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,770
So they've created this problem.

297
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:19,910
Do you think they've been rational and made the right judgments?

298
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,208
Does it look that way?

299
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,213
I haven't thought about that.

300
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:26,214
Right?

301
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,906
That's right.

302
00:26:29,906 --> 00:26:34,306
You're not one to have poor judgment, so I thought it was strange.

303
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,438
Gyeong Seon.

304
00:26:37,438 --> 00:26:39,717
You're his older sister, right?

305
00:26:39,717 --> 00:26:41,205
What is an older sister?

306
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:44,200
You're like a parent.

307
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,316
Jun Hui is still a child.

308
00:26:46,316 --> 00:26:49,616
He still needs you to set him on the right path.

309
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:54,280
What is it you're always saying?

310
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:58,482
That you will make sure Jun Hui lives a good life.

311
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:00,983
Don't you always say that?

312
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:05,244
I didn't realize Jun Hui living a good life would be on the line because of this.

313
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,813
Isn't this related to his life?

314
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:12,415
Living right and walking a straight path.

315
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:16,209
It's a process that involves doing that every step of the way.

316
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,750
So if even one part goes crooked,

317
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,260
it's hard to straighten it out again.

318
00:27:25,136 --> 00:27:28,976
I don't even need to explain that to you.

319
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:32,976
I'm you, and you're me.

320
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:37,595
We make a great pair, don't we?

321
00:29:43,903 --> 00:29:45,803
Did you go somewhere?

322
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:49,732
- Well?
- Help me take this off.

323
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:55,453
Sit down.

324
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:01,305
I just met with Gyeong Seon.

325
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:03,007
For goodness' sake.

326
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,628
What do you mean by that?

327
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:09,128
I don't know how you can be so at ease.

328
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:13,367
Jin Ah is your one and only daughter.

329
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:16,668
Are you okay with Jin Ah dating Jun Hui?

330
00:30:16,668 --> 00:30:19,987
Whether or not I'm okay with it, they like each other.

331
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:23,388
Liking each other is one thing.

332
00:30:24,004 --> 00:30:27,587
Some say that rather than dealing with bothersome in-laws,

333
00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:30,154
they would prefer having no in-laws to deal with.

334
00:30:30,155 --> 00:30:32,823
But that's not the case with Jun Hui's family.

335
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:36,745
All of those younger half-siblings will be Jun Hui's responsibility in the end.

336
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:39,192
They will become Jin Ah's responsibility.

337
00:30:39,193 --> 00:30:42,092
Are you going to get them married?

338
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:45,708
Don't talk without thinking.

339
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,000
Honey, listen very carefully.

340
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:52,112
Don't be a fool for your daughter.

341
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:54,663
Be a fool that cares for her properly.

342
00:30:54,663 --> 00:30:57,594
Think only about Jin Ah. Just Jin Ah.

343
00:30:57,594 --> 00:31:01,430
The rest of your daughter's life is on the line.

344
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,899
How dare they do this?

345
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,211
Go wash your hands.

346
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,699
Dig in and eat. You like this stew.

347
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,796
Well, let me know the reason before I eat.

348
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,800
Do you need a reason?

349
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,141
I felt like it's been a while.

350
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:56,242
I wanted to cook some food, so I went grocery shopping.

351
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:58,600
Do you think I don't know you?

352
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,654
If you don't, you don't. If you know, you'd already know.

353
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,815
Just eat up.

354
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,299
Let's live well.

355
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:19,011
Better than now. And don't ever feel down.

356
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,682
Wow, your cooking is getting better and better.

357
00:32:35,682 --> 00:32:37,796
You could get married.

358
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,105
Don't make me laugh. Do you think you can last one day without me?

359
00:32:43,105 --> 00:32:46,759
Don't make things up. It's you who can't live without me.

360
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,360
You're right, I can't.

361
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,359
So stay right next to me.

362
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,857
You're dead if you leave.

363
00:32:52,858 --> 00:32:55,300
You should be good to me while I'm here.

364
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,670
How can I be any better to you?

365
00:32:57,671 --> 00:33:01,270
I want to see if there's another older sister like me in this world.

366
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,317
There can't be another one. It's just so overwhelming.

367
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:06,964
Why, you...

368
00:33:06,964 --> 00:33:11,065
I said, "Overwhelming". My heart is "overwhelmingly" full.

369
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,900
It's good.

370
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,830
Eat lots.

371
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,982
If you take your medicine after eating, your stomach won't hurt so much.

372
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,964
- Give that to me.
- Forget it.

373
00:33:31,964 --> 00:33:33,866
Just give it to me.

374
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,150
You ought to be keeping it quiet. Were you advertising it instead?

375
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,250
Even Gyeong Seon knew.

376
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,182
What did you say?

377
00:33:58,183 --> 00:34:00,202
What did you say to Gyeong Seon?

378
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:03,702
What is there to say? She understood right away.

379
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:06,103
Do you think she'd be like you?

380
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,898
I'm an adult.

381
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:18,799
I don't need my parent's permission to date or get married.

382
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,681
Oh, is that right?

383
00:34:22,682 --> 00:34:26,831
Okay, let's see how it goes if you do as you wish.

384
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,564
Why don't you stay still?

385
00:34:39,564 --> 00:34:42,763
Don't move and regret it once you see blood.

386
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,955
I'm not someone who has regrets.

387
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,385
Stay still, would you? You'll get hurt.

388
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,081
Are you going to sleep already?

389
00:35:07,081 --> 00:35:11,369
Yes, I did housework today, I'm so tired.

390
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:13,250
Just because you did some dishes?

391
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,189
I folded laundry and threw out all the garbage too.

392
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:18,621
You did a lot.

393
00:35:18,621 --> 00:35:20,407
I did do a lot.

394
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:22,677
So let me off the hook today.

395
00:35:22,677 --> 00:35:25,167
Okay, go to bed then.

396
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,384
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.

397
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:28,860
Is that all?

398
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:30,679
Psh.

399
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,348
"Psh?"

400
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:37,748
All right. I love... I love you so, so much!

401
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,950
♫ When the night falls ♫

402
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:17,480
♫ and the rest of the world quiets down ♫

403
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,380
♫ I come running to you ♫

404
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,493
I'm sorry.

405
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:26,794
Why would you be?

406
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,194
So annoying. I keep crying.

407
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,594
Gyeong Seon, what should your sister do for you?

408
00:36:43,595 --> 00:36:45,994
What would you do?

409
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,481
Shall I make you laugh?

410
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:53,311
Don't do it. Just don't.

411
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:56,068
Don't do anything. What are you going to do?

412
00:36:56,068 --> 00:37:00,169
- You don't know.
- You! Don't do that thing.

413
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:07,420
Oh gosh.

414
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,400
♫ Glowing through the night ♫

415
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,549
Why are you doing that? How embarrassing.

416
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,280
♫ Has the rain stopped ♫

417
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,130
♫ Is the daybreak yet to come? ♫

418
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:53,640
♫ But why should I be worried? When I am here with you now ♫

419
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,670
♫ Little sweet melody ♫

420
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:14,630
♫ Oh, how I wish it would never end ♫

421
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,220
♫ I love your sweet melody ♫

422
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,170
♫ How I wish it would never end ♫

423
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:42,660
♫ It seems so unreal ♫

424
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,210
♫ But it is not unnatural  ♫

425
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,960
♫ Come away with me ♫

426
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:59,110
♫ Leave it all behind ♫

427
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,751
Did she tell you to get evidence? Jeong Yeong In?

428
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:39,713
Yes, I wasn't sure if I should tell you...

429
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:43,810
I was conflicted over it but I thought you should know, Chairman.

430
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,587
She isn't someone who would tell you to get evidence for no reason.

431
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:51,988
I tend to work out of the office quite a bit.

432
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:54,008
I rarely interact with the female employees.

433
00:39:54,008 --> 00:39:58,253
Also, I'm not so close to the male employees.

434
00:39:58,254 --> 00:40:02,427
So I'm someone who could approach them without being suspected.

435
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:05,129
I think that's what she thought.

436
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,931
If you tell me not to do it...

437
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:10,633
Do it.

438
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,195
It seems like Jeong Yeong In has a plan.

439
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,050
Sit down.

440
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:41,239
I want to give you a task.

441
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,858
Regarding all the unreasonable things that female employees have endured,

442
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:50,211
not just sexual harassment, but even job-related.

443
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:52,211
Gather evidence.

444
00:40:56,204 --> 00:41:00,399
You two were the most aggressive in the questionnaire, so I chose you.

445
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:03,454
I thought it was anonymous.

446
00:41:04,032 --> 00:41:07,113
It was just that you couldn't fool my eyes.

447
00:41:07,113 --> 00:41:09,113
Any questions?

448
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:11,363
Weren't the questionnaires enough?

449
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:14,326
Not enough people participated.

450
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:19,328
Also, it could just look like accusations from one party.

451
00:41:19,328 --> 00:41:21,528
Then you should have a male employee get evidence too.

452
00:41:22,302 --> 00:41:24,364
The sources are secret.

453
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:29,468
Will you compare the evidence and only pursue the cases we all find?

454
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:32,706
For now, when that time comes,

455
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:36,106
the hidden perpetrators will need to turn themselves in.

456
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:39,876
That is just what we hope for.

457
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,100
So things like texts and phone messages?

458
00:41:45,945 --> 00:41:49,059
I hope that's all we find.

459
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:51,558
If we find more than that...

460
00:41:53,168 --> 00:41:55,368
I don't even want to think about it.

461
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,466
Yes.

462
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:22,152
Director, here are the sales trend reports.

463
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,240
Sales trends...

464
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:34,406
Section Chief Kang.

465
00:42:34,406 --> 00:42:36,597
How many years have you been a supervisor?

466
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:38,586
Seven years.

467
00:42:38,586 --> 00:42:40,088
Oh, already?

468
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:43,289
And is the work okay?

469
00:42:44,501 --> 00:42:47,201
I've become pretty efficient at it.

470
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:54,021
Someone at your level should be... what is it?

471
00:42:57,052 --> 00:43:01,151
Well, shouldn't you be sitting behind a desk like this?

472
00:43:07,516 --> 00:43:11,516
This company has many female employees.

473
00:43:12,706 --> 00:43:15,206
They all seem similar...

474
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:18,188
How do I put it?

475
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:23,259
A phoenix... there's always one.

476
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,222
I will take that as a compliment.

477
00:43:27,222 --> 00:43:29,122
Yes, of course.

478
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:31,698
But, you know...

479
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:36,670
it's very complicated.

480
00:43:37,516 --> 00:43:40,806
It's hard to pick someone and take care of that person.

481
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:43,300
It isn't as easy as it sounds.

482
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,039
Why?

483
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,740
People start to talk for no reason.

484
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:51,908
What is it that you're trying to say?

485
00:43:53,502 --> 00:43:56,502
There's nothing in particular.

486
00:43:57,606 --> 00:43:59,790
As you know...

487
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:02,585
there's a lot of talk in the company.

488
00:44:02,585 --> 00:44:03,940
Well...

489
00:44:04,762 --> 00:44:09,362
even if I wanted to help you, Section Chief Kang...

490
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,160
I need my job to be stable.

491
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,720
How do I put it?

492
00:44:19,146 --> 00:44:22,546
You can't just do sales trend reports.

493
00:44:24,948 --> 00:44:27,080
You know what I'm saying.

494
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:32,068
I'll... look into the situation.

495
00:44:33,247 --> 00:44:36,086
You sure are smart.

496
00:44:36,086 --> 00:44:39,186
You really are quite smart.

497
00:45:06,564 --> 00:45:09,342
What will happen to the perpetrators once the harassment issue is exposed?

498
00:45:09,342 --> 00:45:11,142
They'll all get fired, right?

499
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,307
I doubt it.

500
00:45:13,307 --> 00:45:16,182
Do you think it'll just be punishment? That's nonsense.

501
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:19,182
I'll protest and get them fired.

502
00:45:19,182 --> 00:45:21,641
Why would you bother doing that?

503
00:45:21,641 --> 00:45:23,838
They're all here to make a living.

504
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,050
Are we here to play or something?

505
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:28,501
Why are you getting angry?

506
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:32,601
I'm worried that you'll get overly aggressive and end up hurt.

507
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:36,952
Why are you backing out of this?

508
00:45:36,952 --> 00:45:38,631
Who says I am?

509
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:42,759
Why are you being argumentative?

510
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,649
I'm leaving.

511
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:11,309
Can I really eat all this?

512
00:46:12,706 --> 00:46:14,756
Isn't this too expensive?

513
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:16,956
Eat. Eat up.

514
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:21,602
Hey, do you think I can't even treat my colleague to this?

515
00:46:21,602 --> 00:46:23,519
Eat. We can even order more.

516
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,200
Whatever the case,

517
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,899
we did well, surviving this long.

518
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:35,490
Though we did get help from some people.

519
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,697
Who helped?

520
00:46:37,697 --> 00:46:42,196
In your case, Director Nam took good care of you.

521
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,231
You're giving the wrong person credit.

522
00:46:47,231 --> 00:46:50,191
Director Nam lasted this long thanks to me.

523
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:51,792
What?

524
00:46:52,431 --> 00:46:56,321
You certainly did a good job vouching for him.

525
00:46:56,321 --> 00:46:58,121
Just "good"?

526
00:46:59,061 --> 00:47:02,910
If I start talking, everyone is dead.

527
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,748
Hey, what's the name of the person who was in HR that got married?

528
00:47:07,749 --> 00:47:10,452
- Well...
- Do you know her?

529
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,852
She was exclusively for Director Nam.

530
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:18,918
It was that bad? I didn't know about that.

531
00:47:18,918 --> 00:47:22,997
You're so bad at reading people. How do you survive in this environment?

532
00:47:22,997 --> 00:47:24,498
That's not all.

533
00:47:25,168 --> 00:47:28,400
Do you remember how I went on a business trip with Yun Jin Ah?

534
00:47:28,401 --> 00:47:31,022
Back then... don't even bring it up.

535
00:47:31,022 --> 00:47:35,222
I heard that Director Nam just told you to buy dinner.

536
00:47:36,347 --> 00:47:41,247
This is why the person who stays quiet becomes the wronged party.

537
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,400
Honestly, during company dinners,

538
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:49,477
when we are all having fun, I sometimes go overboard.

539
00:47:49,477 --> 00:47:51,198
Yes, I know.

540
00:47:51,198 --> 00:47:54,408
The female employees misunderstand and things like that happen.

541
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:56,807
But Director Nam is on a different level.

542
00:47:59,115 --> 00:48:02,425
Oh, here it is. Look at what he says.

543
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:04,574
"First, sign a contract that's beneficial to us."

544
00:48:04,575 --> 00:48:08,369
"It would be best to use Yun Jin Ah to set a good mood."

545
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:09,641
Hey.

546
00:48:09,642 --> 00:48:14,942
Isn't he saying to use Yun Jin Ah to make those old men lose focus?

547
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:16,642
Hey, I...

548
00:48:17,784 --> 00:48:20,583
Look, do you think I'm lying?

549
00:48:22,975 --> 00:48:26,852
But it seemed like Yun Jin Ah smelled something fishy.

550
00:48:26,852 --> 00:48:30,852
She just ran right off. That girl.

551
00:48:51,785 --> 00:48:54,288
Dad, what are you doing here?

552
00:48:54,288 --> 00:48:57,888
I was waiting to have a date with my daughter.

553
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:14,862
You have something to say.

554
00:49:14,863 --> 00:49:16,662
What is it?

555
00:49:23,218 --> 00:49:28,918
What I'm about to say... don't take it the wrong way and listen.

556
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:37,251
First, your mom and I have to think of you first.

557
00:49:37,251 --> 00:49:41,851
We have a duty to direct you to a path that's good for you.

558
00:49:45,392 --> 00:49:47,903
I know you're upset with your mom.

559
00:49:47,903 --> 00:49:52,202
I'm not upset with her. I'm disappointed in her.

560
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:54,350
Okay.

561
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,657
But it isn't that you don't understand, right?

562
00:49:57,658 --> 00:50:00,858
No, I don't understand.

563
00:50:01,603 --> 00:50:05,103
Why don't you like Jun Hui? What's wrong with him?

564
00:50:05,762 --> 00:50:08,362
It isn't anything about him.

565
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:12,755
Of course, you shouldn't just look at a person's background.

566
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:18,406
Or judge them based on what they have.

567
00:50:19,836 --> 00:50:24,676
But whether or not he has parents is very important.

568
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:26,277
Dad.

569
00:50:27,104 --> 00:50:30,827
You can't overlook the importance of growing up under the care of an adult.

570
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,826
Even when you start your work life...

571
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:36,996
there are things that a parent teaches you.

572
00:50:38,488 --> 00:50:41,467
And when you go through struggles, the parents have experienced it before.

573
00:50:41,468 --> 00:50:43,639
They can give you advice and warnings.

574
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:46,539
That's how they teach you to grow.

575
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,566
Is Jun Hui some bad person?

576
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:53,367
Is he a rude kid who disregards his elders?

577
00:50:53,368 --> 00:50:54,815
No, he's not.

578
00:50:54,816 --> 00:50:56,616
Then what is it?

579
00:50:57,418 --> 00:51:00,218
There's no reason. No reason.

580
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,724
Do you think I get adored everywhere because I have parents?

581
00:51:04,724 --> 00:51:06,925
Not at all.

582
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:12,010
Maybe to you and Mom, I seem like some great daughter.

583
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:15,200
I'm just a normal person.

584
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,724
I'm actually quite lacking in some areas, compared to others.

585
00:51:18,724 --> 00:51:20,125
Jun Hui?

586
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,660
I'm very lucky to have him.

587
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,782
To the degree that I wonder if I even have the right to date him.

588
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:28,380
He's a big and great person.

589
00:51:28,381 --> 00:51:32,682
The way you see things and the way your parents see things are different.

590
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:38,730
What is love?

591
00:51:49,164 --> 00:51:53,764
You said that parents teach children how to grow.

592
00:51:53,764 --> 00:51:56,700
Then teach me what love is.

593
00:52:04,928 --> 00:52:07,028
Dad.

594
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:13,927
♫ I feel you now, from here ♫

595
00:52:13,927 --> 00:52:19,876
I've learned for the first time... what love is.

596
00:52:19,876 --> 00:52:22,510
How to love...

597
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:26,789
I'm learning through Jun Hui.

598
00:52:26,789 --> 00:52:29,709
Even when I helped Mom at the hospital.

599
00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:32,131
Helping her change her clothes.

600
00:52:32,131 --> 00:52:37,084
Putting her shoes on for her and helping her off the bed.

601
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:39,684
Speaking to her warmly.

602
00:52:40,602 --> 00:52:44,303
Worrying about her, in case she fell or got hurt.

603
00:52:44,303 --> 00:52:47,555
I'm a grown woman.

604
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:53,146
But someone worries about me that much, to an embarrassing degree.

605
00:52:53,146 --> 00:52:56,105
He's pouring out his heart to me.

606
00:52:56,105 --> 00:52:58,505
To your daughter.

607
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:04,774
He cherishes me and loves me that much, so what's wrong with it?

608
00:53:04,774 --> 00:53:07,604
How can you say that it's wrong?

609
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:10,755
Jun Hui is such a warm person.

610
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:13,054
He is such a lovely person.

611
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:19,490
♫ And we're meant to be ♫

612
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,010
♫ This is one thing I know ♫

613
00:53:23,014 --> 00:53:25,664
I won't listen to you.

614
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:30,702
If I feel like it's not right anymore, then I'll stop.

615
00:53:30,702 --> 00:53:35,303
No matter what you say to me before that, I will never break up with Jun Hui.

616
00:53:36,486 --> 00:53:38,986
It doesn't matter if I disappoint you two.

617
00:53:39,653 --> 00:53:43,190
I'm disappointed in you and Mom, too.

618
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:46,720
♫ yet to be discovered ♫

619
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,900
♫ with your love? ♫

00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,710
♫ I can see anything through ♫

621
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:57,130
♫ wherever you are ♫

622
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:03,450
♫ I can feel you ♫

623
00:54:24,685 --> 00:54:28,013
You left the store a while ago. Why aren't you home yet?

624
00:54:28,013 --> 00:54:29,813
Where are you?

625
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,671
Why do you sound so weak though?

626
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:38,173
You're not sick, right?

627
00:54:39,703 --> 00:54:42,303
You can't get sick.

628
00:54:44,858 --> 00:54:47,282
You really do sound strange.

629
00:54:47,282 --> 00:54:50,825
It's cold. My nose is just stuffy.

630
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:53,126
You didn't dress warmly, did you?

631
00:54:54,173 --> 00:54:57,573
I'm dressed very warmly, actually.

632
00:54:59,682 --> 00:55:01,682
Are you staying there all night today too?

633
00:55:01,682 --> 00:55:05,243
No, we are almost done with our project.

634
00:55:05,243 --> 00:55:07,992
So I have an emergency offer.

635
00:55:07,992 --> 00:55:09,369
What?

636
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:12,200
Let's cook something delicious this weekend, at my place.

637
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:15,300
I can't cook.

638
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,899
I was worried that you might offer to cook.

639
00:55:21,242 --> 00:55:23,340
So?

640
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,801
What will you cook for me?

641
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:29,802
Anything you want to eat.

642
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:33,000
- "Anything"?
- Of course.

643
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,300
What can't I do for Yun Jin Ah?

644
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,733
What do you want?

645
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:43,923
I want...

646
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,842
Seo Jun Hui.

647
00:55:48,008 --> 00:55:50,710
All I want is Seo Jun Hui.

648
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:56,610
♫ I could study everything ♫

649
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:02,511
♫ about you forever more ♫

650
00:56:02,511 --> 00:56:05,240
Why are you coming home alone?

651
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,440
Why didn't you come with him if you're so curious?

652
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:13,280
I'm not going to say it twice. Ask Dad once he gets home.

653
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,811
Make time this weekend.

654
00:56:15,811 --> 00:56:19,511
My friend from Seocho is setting you up with someone.

655
00:56:22,935 --> 00:56:24,933
So childish.

656

You're so childish, I'm getting goosebumps.

That girl.

658
00:56:49,088 --> 00:56:51,567
They must have their own plans.

659
00:56:51,568 --> 00:56:55,338
Why don't we leave them be and see?

660
00:56:55,338 --> 00:56:59,439
What if they grow a bond we can't break apart?

661
00:56:59,439 --> 00:57:04,039
How can you say such irresponsible things when you're her dad?

662
00:57:04,979 --> 00:57:08,887
They already like each other. What can you do?

663
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:11,699
Do you think love is like that?

664
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:14,847
"Love"? What are you saying?

665
00:57:14,847 --> 00:57:20,560
It's just affection, between a sister and brother.

666

What is love? Do you even know?

Yes, I am very upset.
