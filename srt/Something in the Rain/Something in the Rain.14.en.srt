2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,049
Stop right now!

3
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,278
What do you think you're doing?

4
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:11,866
I won't see him.

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,030
I said I won't see him.

6
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:21,100
I won't see him anymore, so stop it.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,958
Noona.

8
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,243
Everyone, stop it.

00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:34,187
Jun Hui.

10
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:36,060
Let's talk later.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,468
Let's end things here.

12
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,972
Let's break up.

13
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:48,530
Noona.

14
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:51,501
- Jin Ah.
- What do you think you're doing?

15
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,773
What are you doing in front of your elders? Move!

16
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:55,158
- What are you doing?
- Yun Jin Ah!

17
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:56,759
- Yun Jin Ah!
- Let go of me!

18
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,683
- Stop it.
- Open the door.

19
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:02,107
Please let's go.

20
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:05,022
- Stop that right now.
- Noona.

21
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:07,770
Let go of me!

22
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,021
Open the door.

23
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:33,556
Noona.

24
00:02:35,107 --> 00:02:36,996
Yun Jin Ah.

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,585
Don't cry.

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,676
I'm okay, so don't cry.

27
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:43,794
Well...

28
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,644
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

29
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:52,350
I drank too much and caused trouble.

30
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,218
- Your father didn't do anything.
- Well...

31
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,018
About Jin Ah...

32
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,342
I know, I know. Don't worry.

33
00:04:03,922 --> 00:04:06,044
I'll get going.

34
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:26,269
Let go of me now.

35
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:31,409
What are you doing? Get out of the way.

36
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:33,331
Let go.

37
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,748
Seo Jun Hui.

38
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:27,150
Let's listen to some music.

39
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:39,970
♫ No matter what you say or do, I can't stop loving you ♫

42
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:33,266
Do you want to come up for tea?

43
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,698
Just go on in.

44
00:09:35,698 --> 00:09:37,957
Thanks for the ride.

45
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:45,048
It looks like I won't have to worry about Jun Hui. He grew up well.

46
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,688
He is just like his mom.

47
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:53,097
That's the best thing I've heard you say.

48
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,498
Don't live your life hating me.

49
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:59,928
It is a waste of your life.

50
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,063
If we happen to run into each other...

51
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,823
let's greet each other happily.

52
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,505
Drive safely.

53
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:47,567
Did you call the wrong number?

54
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,999
I called you on purpose, Father.

55
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:54,739
I'm ready to get in trouble.

56
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,390
You should be fully prepared.

57
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,334
Noona.

58
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:21,993
Hello.

59
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:24,859
Yun Jin Ah?

60
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:26,608
What are you doing?

61
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,900
What do you think I'm doing?

62
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,400
You're very angry, right?

63
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:39,349
I'm not the one who's angry.

64
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:44,000
I know you're angry and I know everything annoyed you.

65
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,188
I understand you completely.

66
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:47,999
I understand, but...

67
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,114
I miss you.

68
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,084
Wait. I'll be right there.

69
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,113
Open your door for me.

70
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:11,837
N-Noona...

71
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:15,679
Can I come in?

72
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:33,647
What kind of tea do you have?

73
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:36,569
I don't feel like coffee.

74
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,630
It's in the cupboard.

75
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,717
I'm sorry.

76
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:09,278
I was so angry about what Mom said.

77
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:14,882
I wanted to end that crazy situation quickly.

78
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:19,273
I told you that I understand.

79
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:24,293
You're angry.

80
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:31,977
No matter how difficult things get, you shouldn't say that we should break up.

81
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:37,280
In that moment...

82
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,311
I was really annoyed.

83
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,810
All right. That's good enough.

84
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,781
It's not good enough.

85
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,012
Should I get really angry?

86
00:16:57,012 --> 00:17:01,319
Should I yell and say I was dying of anger?

87
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:05,189
That's why I'm apologizing.

88
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:10,470
What am I supposed to do if you say we should break up and just go inside?

89
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,640
I thought about how you were alone and how much you were crying.

90
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,772
I couldn't contact you.

91
00:17:20,092 --> 00:17:23,331
Do you even know how I felt until just a moment ago?

92
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:26,751
I know.

93
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:28,793
I doubt that.

94
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:33,112
I should never have said those words.

95
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:36,482
I made a mistake. I'll never do it again.

96
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:41,155
Look at you trying to act like it was no big deal.

97
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:48,583
Then... what would you like me to do?

98
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:53,431
What? Should I bow to you and beg for your forgiveness?

99
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:57,532
When people are angry...

100
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:00,833
they tend to say things that they shouldn't.

101
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:05,761
Don't you ever make mistakes?

102
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:08,264
At least I don't make mistakes like that.

103
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:15,197
There are things a person can and cannot say, so how could you...

104
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:18,007
The water keeps beeping.

105
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:24,296
Could I turn that off first and then get in trouble?

106
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:40,427
Since I boiled water, can I eat some ramen?

107
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:44,357
Why are you being like this?

108
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,986
I'm so hungry.

109
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:49,416
I don't have the strength to get in trouble.

110
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:16,792
Should I eat ramen alone?

111
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,601
You can't even have one bite.

112
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:36,045
Should I just leave?

113
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:44,953
I said I was sorry.

114
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:47,431
I know I must pick up the pieces.

115
00:19:47,432 --> 00:19:51,023
I don't know how to, that's why I'm acting like this.

116
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:55,998
You could talk to me sincerely. Why do you keep teasing me?

117
00:19:58,144 --> 00:20:01,245
I'm not teasing you.

118
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:04,163
I'm at a disadvantage.

119
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:07,734
I feel like things will get worse if I bring it up.

120
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:10,773
Also, I could say the wrong thing.

121
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:13,164
Why are you going under the blanket?

122
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:17,645
It's because you might get angry and kick me out.

123
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:21,884
I won't leave, even if I die.

124
00:20:32,952 --> 00:20:35,781
Come out while I'm being nice.

125
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:39,278
One, two...

126
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:54,074
I won't give you ramen if you cry.

127
00:20:55,883 --> 00:20:57,865
Give me ramen.

128
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:16,953
You better not do it again.

129
00:21:31,475 --> 00:21:32,956
Look at me.

130
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:38,775

131
00:21:39,784 --> 00:21:41,148
Yes?

Stay by my side forever.

133
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,691
Do you need to think about it?

134
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,164
I'm about to feel hurt.

135
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:06,751
Before that...

136
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,373
"Before that"?

137
00:22:09,771 --> 00:22:12,083

00:25:26,913 --> 00:25:29,116
You said you would send him off, didn't you?

169
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:30,010
Okay.

170
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,431
I'm really going to leave on my own.

171
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:34,492
All right.

172
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:37,353
I'm watching so do a good job.

173
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,979
You really don't take after me.

174
00:26:04,494 --> 00:26:07,794
I have bad taste in women.

175
00:26:07,794 --> 00:26:10,604
You must know that's why I lost your mom.

176
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:17,726
Saying that after all this time doesn't comfort me.

177
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,844
I'm not saying it to comfort you.

178
00:26:23,424 --> 00:26:26,005
I'm saying it comforts me to know.

179
00:26:30,495 --> 00:26:33,996
I feel secure knowing that you chose Jin Ah.

180
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:37,906
Thank you.

181
00:26:41,874 --> 00:26:43,729
Thank you.

182
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,300
You have to stay healthy and stay in touch every now and then.

183
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:12,066
I'm giving you a rare opportunity.

184
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:16,675
Then I can't lose it.

185
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:18,010
Here.

186
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:33,202
Could I hold you just once?

187
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,670
Stay in touch.

188
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:05,620
Gate 5-132

189
00:28:27,842 --> 00:28:31,500
What? I did everything you asked.

190
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,800
Oh my. You did a good job.

191
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,673
What? I gave you a compliment.

192
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,298
Does it bother you?

193
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:42,646
Does it?

194
00:28:43,797 --> 00:28:45,011
Do you know what will happen once I get you?

195
00:28:45,011 --> 00:28:47,918
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

196
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:11,926
So what?

197
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:16,380
You got to be a son to your father, thanks to Yun Jin Ah. What about it?

198
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,265
Should I bow down in thanks to Yun Jin Ah?

199
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:22,344
I know that you're hurt.

200
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,981
We didn't do anything right either.

201
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:28,693
I wouldn't have been surprised if our father did worse.

202
00:29:28,694 --> 00:29:32,638
The really shocking thing was how that family treated you and me.

203
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:36,234
I've confirmed how lowly they think of us.

204
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,315
Wow, it was beyond my imagination. It really was.

205
00:29:39,315 --> 00:29:42,101
It was so beyond it, I never could have imagined it.

206
00:29:43,673 --> 00:29:45,584
They really went too far.

207
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:49,544
Do you think other households would be different?

208
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,102
It's more about how much of it we see.

209
00:29:56,102 --> 00:29:59,064
My background will never change.

210
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:02,762
So you're going to forget about your pride and everything.

211
00:30:02,762 --> 00:30:05,371
Will you be happy as long as the two of you like each other?

212
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:07,374
Do you expect me to watch that?

213
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:08,342
Noona.

214
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:13,630
Stop acting so frustratingly! And don't treat me like I'm someone who doesn't understand.

215
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,101
Never mind.

216
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:18,259
Why does it matter? It seems like you are you, and I am me.

217
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:19,521
Why are you being like this?

218
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:21,929
Why are you acting this way?

219
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,997
Noona.

220
00:30:27,997 --> 00:30:30,218
Don't even think about convincing me.

221
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:32,526
I don't care about anyone else right now, not even you.

222
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:34,615
So do whatever you want!

223
00:30:56,969 --> 00:30:59,140
Why are you cleaning at this hour?

224
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,644
Where's Mom?

225
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:02,224
In her room.

226
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:05,311
Did you two fight?

227
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:11,671
What is that?

228
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:13,097
Laundry.

229
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:15,907
I will do it for you.

230
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:18,976
So you did fight.

231
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:30,007
Why did you fight with Dad?

232
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:33,269
What was it about?

233
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:36,288
I don't know. Don't even bring it up.

234
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,361
Hey, you.

235
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:47,242
Last time, you said you even thought about dying, right?

236
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:50,404
You're saying that it was my fault, in the end.

237
00:31:50,404 --> 00:31:52,744
Why are you overreacting again?

238
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,713
You scared me into leaving your sister alone after saying that.

239
00:31:58,113 --> 00:32:01,653
Suppose I did. What about it?

240
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,745
Do you think I acted that way to cause harm to your lives?

241
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:08,193
What is a mom supposed to do for her children?

242
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,554
I want to give you good things if I can.

243
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:14,744
And help you walk a good path.

244
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:18,520
What's wrong with you? What?

245
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,986
I don't understand how you all don't know how a parent feels.

246
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:26,163
It's so absurd.

247
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:29,607
Why is all the heart and work I put in coming back in this way?

248
00:32:29,607 --> 00:32:31,656
It is so ridiculous.

249
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:34,636
So it's not Dad. Is it Yun Jin Ah?

250
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:36,944
Did she cause trouble again?

251
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:39,852
I suppose it worked out for the better.

252
00:32:39,853 --> 00:32:42,231
Trouble or not.

253
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:45,363
At least they broke up.

254
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,180
Is she breaking up with Seo Jun Hui?

255
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,430
When?

256
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,301
Do you guys pick a date to do that stuff?

257
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:54,358
She said she wouldn't see him anymore.

258
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:56,981
She is seeing him.

259
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,340
What?

260
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,228
Well, I talked to him on the phone on my way up.

261
00:33:03,229 --> 00:33:05,749
He was with Yun Jin Ah.

262
00:33:07,704 --> 00:33:11,516
Then were they putting on a show?

263
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,140
Oh, my head hurts.

264
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,849
Mom, Mom. Calm down. Are you okay?

265
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,849
- Get the...
- What? What did you say?

266
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:27,427
Medicine!

267
00:33:27,427 --> 00:33:29,558
Okay, hold on.

268
00:34:05,554 --> 00:34:07,977
What is this?

269
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:10,952
It's the money you asked me to put into a savings account.

270
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:13,180
I saved it all for you.

271
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:18,545
Why are you giving it to me?

272
00:34:18,545 --> 00:34:20,443
Take it and move out.

273
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:27,596
If we live together in one house, one of us will end up dying early, don't you think?

274
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:35,741
Do you really have to go this far?

275
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:39,580
You said that I'm childish and that I give you goosebumps.

276
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,717
You know very well, your mom is that kind of person.

277
00:34:42,717 --> 00:34:45,806
There's no need to talk more or argue about it.

278
00:34:45,806 --> 00:34:47,977
Let's end it cleanly.

279
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:11,060
- Where are you going?
- Convenience store.

280
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,858
I have beer in my fridge.

281
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:14,319
Go home.

282
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:15,969
Noona.

283
00:35:23,944 --> 00:35:26,649
What do you want me to do for you?

284
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:30,057
Why would you put it that way?

285
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:33,503
There must be something you want.

286
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:38,102
I can never repay you for everything you've done for me, even if I die.

287
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:47,393
Whether it's a dumb guy from a rich family or a thoughtless rich guy.

288
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:53,848
If I had just married anyone, do you think we would be well off right now?

289
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:59,163
We don't all need to be successful.

290
00:35:59,163 --> 00:36:02,273
You just need one CEO in your family.

291
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:04,152
Look at Yun Jin Ah's family.

292
00:36:04,152 --> 00:36:08,350
Her father is no longer an executive at a large company.

293
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:13,712
Their business card is that Seung Ho is doing his PhD at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology).

294
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:15,810
Stop it.

295
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:21,633
If I knew this would happen, I should've tried to be friendly with the first woman Dad married.

296
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:24,731
I heard her relatives are very wealthy from real estate.

297
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:30,074
What should I do for you?

298
00:36:30,074 --> 00:36:33,861
Should I stop seeing Jin Ah? Is that it?

299
00:36:36,073 --> 00:36:37,942
Why don't you try it?

300
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:43,321
It's hard for me too.

301
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:46,930
I'm not saying I'm okay because I'm a thoughtless person.

302
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:50,473
If I were to act solely on my temper, I would've turned it all upside down.

303
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:52,049
I'm not doing anything because I can't.

304
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:53,773
That's how I feel.

305
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:57,105
Do you think I hate Yun Jin Ah?

306
00:36:57,105 --> 00:36:59,942
No matter how I try to understand...

307
00:36:59,942 --> 00:37:03,774
I just can't overlook her family. That's why.

308
00:37:05,728 --> 00:37:07,054
Noona.

309
00:37:07,763 --> 00:37:11,136
I know this is too much to ask.

310
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:14,543
Can't you let it go for my sake?

311
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:18,464
When I see you, I go insane. I get even angrier.

312
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:25,376
I understand what is meant when they say your heart feels like it's tearing apart.

313
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:32,064
I know what it means to feel the pain of your heart being ripped apart.

314
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:43,140
♫ I feel you now from here ♫

315
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:49,850
♫ Our time is not done yet ♫

316
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:56,270
♫ You've given me my fullest heart ♫

317
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:02,350
♫ We'll never be apart ♫

318
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:19,640
♫ I'm breathing through you now ♫

319
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:25,020
♫ The love we have, so true ♫

320
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,450
♫ I never thought that I could need someone ♫

321
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:33,426
I feel too ashamed to see you.

322
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,531
So I've been delaying it.

323
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,248
I'll come see you soon.

324
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:43,550
I'm sorry, Gyeong Seon.

325
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,790
♫ And we're meant to be ♫

326
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:53,060
♫ This is one thing I know ♫

327
00:38:53,060 --> 00:39:00,040
♫ I feel everything ♫

328
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:06,080
♫ Never been so exposed ♫

329
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:15,950
♫ Are there pieces still yet to be discovered with your love? ♫

330
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:23,060
♫ I can see anything through wherever you are ♫

331
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,330
♫ I can feel you ♫

332
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:12,370
Oh, hello.

333
00:40:24,514 --> 00:40:26,673
What is that?

334
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:35,443
Section Chief Yun, Section Chief Yun.

335
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:38,278
Over there, how should I put this?

336
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:40,101
There's a bit of an incident.

337
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:41,845
What do you mean, "incident"?

338
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:46,289
Well, Section Chief Kang and Section Chief Geum are...

339
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:47,822
What?

340
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:53,189
What did you say?

341
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,464
What is it? What's going on?

342
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,684
That's what I would like to know.

343
00:41:04,684 --> 00:41:08,298
You're really something, Kang Se Yeong. Do you even have a conscience?

344
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,552
What about you?

345
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:13,744
You act so just and talk up a storm. How dare you act up to me?

346
00:41:13,744 --> 00:41:16,612
- Seriously, you...
- What? What?

347
00:41:16,612 --> 00:41:18,933
- Let go!
- Seriously, you little!

348
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:21,032
What's wrong with you two?

349
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:25,202
You're not even kids. What is this? Let me know the reason, at least.

350
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,695
Yes, I spoke to the female employees.

351
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:33,295
I said that Yun Jin Ah is partially responsible for the sexual harassment.

352
00:41:33,295 --> 00:41:37,393
I said it's dangerous to pretend she isn't and act like a victim! So what?

353
00:41:37,393 --> 00:41:39,148
How could you say that?

354
00:41:39,149 --> 00:41:42,179
You can't even support her as a fellow woman.

355
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:45,418
Instead, you gather up these girls who are already intimidated and brainwash them?

356
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:47,964
You're worse than cult leaders. Do you know that?

357
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,791
- Hey!
- What?

358
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:53,930
Let go!

359
00:41:56,799 --> 00:42:00,200
Is that why all of you were...

360
00:42:01,165 --> 00:42:02,945
I'm sorry, Section Chief Yun.

361
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:04,386
I was so scared.

362
00:42:04,386 --> 00:42:07,755
I heard that it would only end with a penalty once things were public.

363
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:10,871
It would be like being stripped naked in public then...

364
00:42:10,871 --> 00:42:13,311
- getting fired in the end.
- Who said that?

365
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:17,410
Was that from the great Kang Se Yeong?

366
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:20,491
Really?

367
00:42:20,491 --> 00:42:23,641
What a joke this is.

368
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:27,494
Even with this promise of anonymity, I can't trust it.

369
00:42:27,494 --> 00:42:30,780
Are you really thinking of me?

370
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:35,100
Are you taking out your resentment on me like this?

371
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,442
If that's not it, then you're just a terrible person.

372
00:42:39,472 --> 00:42:44,324
Whatever I do, I can make a plan. It's not too late.

373
00:42:44,324 --> 00:42:46,616
Please just help me.

374
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:49,146
I'm having a hard time as it is.

375
00:43:09,176 --> 00:43:12,248
They are outright avoiding me.

376
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:14,396
I heard about it.

377
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:18,331
I got ahead of myself.

378
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:21,726
I think I placed a burden on you that is too heavy.

379
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:24,186
It's okay to give up on it.

380
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:27,208
No.

381
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:30,058
I won't force you to.

382
00:43:30,058 --> 00:43:32,421
No, I'll do it.

383
00:43:36,732 --> 00:43:38,663
How do you want it to play out?

384
00:43:38,663 --> 00:43:40,303
There are several ways.

385
00:43:40,303 --> 00:43:43,384
There's mediation or a settlement with an apology.

386
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:46,023
Disciplinary action with the cause made public.

387
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,324
There's nothing I want besides the perpetrator being punished.

388
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,430
Jin Ah.

389
00:43:53,043 --> 00:43:57,723
It may be much, much harder than you're expecting it to be.

390
00:44:00,018 --> 00:44:01,748
I know.

391
00:44:01,748 --> 00:44:05,347
You may not be able to maintain your current life.

392
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,063
However, I can promise you one thing.

393
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:18,650
You won't be the only one getting hurt.

394
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:32,668
This is total nonsense.

395
00:44:32,668 --> 00:44:37,320
She was dragged to go to a karaoke and forced to slow dance.

396
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,217
If that isn't sexual harassment, then what is?

397
00:44:40,217 --> 00:44:42,788
We are living in a lawless country.

398
00:44:42,788 --> 00:44:44,047
It's obvious.

399
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:46,046
"Why didn't you forcefully resist?"

400
00:44:46,046 --> 00:44:47,688
"Didn't you enjoy it too?"

401
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,487
They probably went in that direction.

402
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:52,080
Gosh, what trash.

403
00:44:53,364 --> 00:44:56,620
What is it? Who's trash?

404
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,344
- Seo Jun Hui.
- Yes?

405
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:02,393
Join the team going on the business trip and do the final meeting.

406
00:45:02,393 --> 00:45:05,000
It will be one week, at most.

407
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,243
You'll really get fired.

408
00:45:07,243 --> 00:45:10,482
Why? What now?

409
00:45:10,482 --> 00:45:12,213
It's nothing.

410
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,325
Do you have something to tell me?

411
00:45:28,027 --> 00:45:30,175
You go first.

412
00:45:32,368 --> 00:45:35,982
How are the issues at work progressing?

413
00:45:35,982 --> 00:45:37,431
Why are you suddenly asking?

414
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:41,761
Well, because it involves you.

415
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:44,033
Oh.

416
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,854
It should be starting soon.

417
00:45:48,177 --> 00:45:50,027
It should be okay, right?

418
00:45:50,027 --> 00:45:52,638
It probably won't be okay.

419
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:57,028
But I can't avoid it. I should face it head-on.

420
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:00,639
Why are you suddenly asking?

421
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:03,788
Does it have something to do with what you have to tell me?

422
00:46:06,232 --> 00:46:08,984
I have to go to China for about one week.

423
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,147
Oh, I thought there was trouble.

424
00:46:11,147 --> 00:46:15,926
Don't worry. I have lots of people on my side besides you, Seo Jun Hui.

425
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:19,337
That's a relief.

426
00:46:19,337 --> 00:46:21,599
- It will work out.
- Yes.

427
00:46:33,052 --> 00:46:35,417
You know...

428
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:43,958
The mood right now makes me think you're in trouble again.

429
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:48,412
I'm...

430
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:52,780
moving out on my own.

431
00:46:53,891 --> 00:46:57,755
I'm leaving my parent's house. I'm going to live on my own.

432
00:46:57,755 --> 00:47:01,176
I'll become a true goddess now. A goddess of freedom.

433
00:47:05,446 --> 00:47:07,595
What's the reason?

434
00:47:08,418 --> 00:47:11,145
Why do I need a reason?

435
00:47:11,145 --> 00:47:13,916
It's honestly late for a person my age.

436
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:17,615
I barely have any friends who still live with their parents.

437
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:22,756
Who brought it up first?

438
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,486
What?

439
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,003
Was it your family who told you to leave?

440
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:33,340
I brought up moving out a long time ago.

441
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,990
Then we talked about it again–

442
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:36,750
Are they chasing you out?

443
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:41,422
What do you mean?

444
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,999
It's not all because of you.

445
00:47:59,885 --> 00:48:02,371
It is partially.

446
00:48:06,721 --> 00:48:08,831
No.

447
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,387
Let's go.

448
00:48:51,627 --> 00:48:55,688
You said you had to go back to work.

449
00:48:55,688 --> 00:48:57,105
It's fine.

450
00:48:57,105 --> 00:48:59,153
I'm fine too.

451
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:01,906
Why are you being like that?

452
00:49:02,727 --> 00:49:04,513
Just because.

453
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:07,785
It's not just because.

454
00:49:09,264 --> 00:49:10,688
It's uncomfortable.

455
00:49:10,688 --> 00:49:12,423
What is?

456
00:49:13,545 --> 00:49:15,594
Why do you pretend that you're okay?

457
00:49:15,594 --> 00:49:18,526
You were annoyed, so just get annoyed.

458
00:49:18,526 --> 00:49:23,949
"Why does your family weigh and compare people so much?" You can say that instead of holding it in.

459
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:26,173
Does that change anything?

460
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:30,357
Then don't make it obvious that you're annoyed.

461
00:49:30,357 --> 00:49:33,274
What do you expect me to do?

462
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,560
Work, home, and even you...

463
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,222
What do you want from me? What am I supposed to do?

464
00:49:40,222 --> 00:49:42,618
I'm a person too.

465
00:49:42,618 --> 00:49:46,968
Do you know how often I just want to do whatever I want?

466
00:49:57,754 --> 00:49:59,612
I'm sorry.

467
00:50:00,972 --> 00:50:03,163
I was a little frustrated.

468
00:50:03,163 --> 00:50:07,172
So... I was upset by it.

469
00:50:08,114 --> 00:50:10,045
Sorry.

470
00:50:13,185 --> 00:50:15,750
I said I'm sorry.

471
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,142
Seo Jun Hui must be a dummy.

472
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:21,616
I must be.

473
00:50:28,022 --> 00:50:30,459
I'll still take the subway.

474
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,061
I'll drive you.

475
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:33,537
Forget it.

476
00:50:33,537 --> 00:50:35,668
Stop being angry.

477
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:41,607
What did you just say?

478
00:50:41,607 --> 00:50:43,957
You kicked Jin Ah out?

479
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:48,100
If I continue to see her, we might end up cutting our ties.

480
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,209
Why, this person...

481
00:50:50,209 --> 00:50:52,131
You didn't do anything right either.

482
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:54,198
What did you do so well?

483
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:58,602
How ridiculous? What did I do wrong?

484
00:50:59,652 --> 00:51:01,520
We will talk later.

485
00:51:02,402 --> 00:51:06,965
I didn't do a single thing for my benefit. It was all for them!

486
00:51:06,965 --> 00:51:11,314
If I did it to benefit through my kids, I ought to be punished by the heavens!

487
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:19,235
I have something to say.

488
00:51:19,235 --> 00:51:22,196
I have only one thing I want to hear from you. Right now...

489
00:51:22,196 --> 00:51:24,150
I'm moving out.

490
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,551
- Jin Ah!
- I'm moving out,

491
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:28,439
but I need some time.

492
00:51:28,439 --> 00:51:31,331

00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:38,810
Are you thinking of this as a blessing, by chance?

495
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:40,772
Or as an opportunity to go live with Jun Hui?

496
00:51:40,772 --> 00:51:43,388
You kicked me out and now you're worried about what will happen?

497
00:51:43,388 --> 00:51:45,339
Hey!

498
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:46,487
From now on...

499
00:51:46,487 --> 00:51:50,478
don't say anything about Jun Hui or Gyeong Seon. Not even a compliment.

You too, Dad.

502
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:57,878

It's my life. I'll handle it.

505
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,409
Thinking you can do whatever you want as my parents is something I can't accept.

506
00:52:08,409 --> 00:52:11,144
I will never change my mind about that.

507
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,289
Dad, please don't object to this.

508
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:17,080
It's true that I'm leaving because I fought with Mom,

509
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,258
but I consider it an opportunity.

510

Living together is not the problem.

558
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:07,630
I made a big scene about living on my own.

559

Then you expect me to go live with my boyfriend after everything?

560
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:15,392
It's better to stick it out with my mom and fight, in that case.

561
00:57:15,392 --> 00:57:18,218
Still, how can you say that to him?

562
00:57:18,218 --> 00:57:20,720
Did Jun Hui hear that and do nothing?

563
00:57:21,602 --> 00:57:25,600
He didn't say anything, dropped me off, and went home.

564

I bet 1 million won that you'll get dumped soon.

Why? Should I bet more?

566
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,177
It would only help my mom who is dying to find any flaw with him.

567
00:57:36,177 --> 00:57:40,568
If I tell her I begged to live with him, my mom would never believe me.

568
00:57:40,568 --> 00:57:43,099
It's obvious that she'll bother Jun Hui and make his life hard.

569
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:45,218
Don't you think Jun Hui knows that?

570
00:57:45,218 --> 00:57:48,456
How bad was it that he made that offer?

571
00:57:48,456 --> 00:57:53,672
Do you think I don't know that? I know how he feels.

572
00:57:53,672 --> 00:57:57,255
But how can I accept it just to make my life easier?

Also, my family is one thing. What about Gyeong Seon?

Oh, it can never happen. No, no.

575
00:58:06,313 --> 00:58:08,441
Then what will you do?

576
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:13,443
Officetels are nice, but they cost too much, right?

577
00:58:14,231 --> 00:58:17,311
I could cover the cost for now.

578
00:58:17,311 --> 00:58:20,011
But how long could it last?

579
00:58:20,011 --> 00:58:23,612
I don't even know how long I can last at work.

580
00:58:24,493 --> 00:58:27,012
Is it because of what's happening now?

581
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,751
Even without that happening.

582
00:58:29,751 --> 00:58:34,702
How much longer will we be working? About ten years?

583
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:38,211
I would be thankful even for five years.

584
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:41,749
That's a topic for another time.

585
00:58:41,749 --> 00:58:45,867
First, suppose the company does something to you over this issue.

586
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:48,368
Then I really won't sit still.

587
00:58:48,368 --> 00:58:50,733
What will you do then?

588
00:58:51,835 --> 00:58:54,597
Well, I'll be with Yun Jin Ah.

589
00:58:55,245 --> 00:58:57,183
We will both become unemployed.

590
00:58:57,183 --> 00:58:59,742
What? Goodness.

591
00:58:59,742 --> 00:59:02,099
You have quite the love for your colleague.

592
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:06,079
Whatever you choose to do, my colleague...

593
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,707
I will fully support you.

594
00:59:11,317 --> 00:59:13,826
Thank you very much.

595
00:59:15,857 --> 00:59:18,557
Both of us unemployed.

596
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:22,810
Come sit down.

597
00:59:31,142 --> 00:59:34,469
I heard about it from Manager Jeong.

598
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:41,880
Don't you think this situation will become too big?

599
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:48,901
I'm not sure what you mean by that.

600
00:59:48,901 --> 00:59:52,930
Well, there is the atmosphere of the company.

601
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:56,990
Also, people don't all think alike.

602
00:59:58,241 --> 01:00:02,940
What do you think about handling it quietly to keep things calm?

603
01:00:03,919 --> 01:00:08,871
It seems Manager Jeong didn't tell you everything.

604
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:13,501
I told her I wanted disciplinary action where the cause is made public.

605
01:00:17,479 --> 01:00:19,920
Do you really think you can handle it?

606
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,821
How about you, Chairman?

607
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:27,130
Legally, when sexual harassment occurs in the work place

608
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:29,109
the business owner and the perpetrator...

609
01:00:29,109 --> 01:00:31,469
He is listed as a transactor.

610
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:36,769
Yes, but I want to call him a perpetrator.

611
01:00:36,779 --> 01:00:41,199
The perpetrator must be disciplined and measures must be taken.

612
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:45,009
I know that a fine is usually paid for violation of rules.

613
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:48,099
I'm sure the situation differs depending on the size of the company.

614
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:51,206
The fine is not a very large amount.

615
01:00:51,206 --> 01:00:53,499
Honestly, that disappoints me.

616
01:00:53,499 --> 01:00:56,669
It worries me, as well.

617
01:00:56,669 --> 01:01:01,302
That sounds to me like you're saying, "I won't be bought off with money."

618
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:09,762
It seems I'm right. What else do I need to know?

619
01:01:09,762 --> 01:01:13,929
If the employee who was victimized is threatened or put at a disadvantage,

620
01:01:13,929 --> 01:01:18,929
the company will face discipline and a large fine.

621

Aigoo.

623

I'm getting hit on both sides. I can't think straight.

624
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,997
It seems like you two couldn't remember properly.

625

01:03:10,422 --> 01:03:13,602
What is this?

632
01:03:13,602 --> 01:03:15,639
You have no manners.

01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,536
I ought to just...

You should know that I'm a scary person.

638
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:39,776
Manager Jeong, I find this very unfair.

639
01:03:39,776 --> 01:03:43,604
If I had any impure intent, I will bash my head here and die.

640
01:03:43,605 --> 01:03:45,884
I only did what Director Nam told me to.

641
01:03:45,884 --> 01:03:47,880
What? You punk!

642
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,790
Gosh.

643
01:03:48,794 --> 01:03:50,603
Did I tell you to touch Yun Jin Ah's butt?

644
01:03:50,603 --> 01:03:52,807
You said to make it lively!

645
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:54,336
How dare you talk informally to me!

646
01:03:54,337 --> 01:03:57,788
You should have behaved properly if you wanted to hear formal speech!

647
01:03:57,788 --> 01:04:00,081
Let go! Manager Jeong, do you see?

648
01:04:00,082 --> 01:04:02,344
What do you think you're doing?

649
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:09,916
Gosh, you two are so simple.

650
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,557
What do you plan to do about Yun Jin Ah?

651
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:27,021
The thing with that is...

652
01:04:27,021 --> 01:04:31,526
What did I... This is so ridiculous.

653
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:35,585
Honestly, I...

654
01:04:35,585 --> 01:04:38,400
You're trying to say you feel wronged.

655
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,679
That's right.

656
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,079
This has the attention of all the employees already.

657
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,879
The company has to take action.

658
01:04:48,879 --> 01:04:51,440
We will need to put together a fact-finding committee.

659
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,630
"Fact-finding"?

660
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:59,350
I... don't have anything to be ashamed of.

661
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:02,421
If people continue to speak of exposing things...

662
01:05:02,421 --> 01:05:05,910
Yes... I will go through legal means.

663
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:08,590
One year or two years. It's fine with me.

664
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:10,930
I have earned...

665
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:12,365
What's the word?

666
01:05:12,365 --> 01:05:16,144
Honor... I have my honor.

667
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:25,716
Come on in.

668
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:53,735
Don't let the fact-finding committee start and you end up in a position you can't run from.

669
01:05:53,735 --> 01:05:57,330
Whether it's a counterattack or an explanation, make it.

670
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:59,439
Senior Manager Choi can help out.

671
01:05:59,439 --> 01:06:01,514
Yes, I understand.

672
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,593
Must I... Well...

673
01:06:06,593 --> 01:06:08,762
I really don't think that's necessary.

674
01:06:08,762 --> 01:06:13,729
I can't see work issues spread into the family.

675
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:20,811
I'm not giving you this tip because you're claiming to be innocent.

676
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:48,429
Oh, yes. Hello.

677
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:54,383
Sorry for calling you so suddenly.

678
01:06:54,383 --> 01:06:56,466
You weren't too taken aback, right?

679
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:59,514
A little bit.

680
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,859
Yes, uh...

681
01:07:01,859 --> 01:07:04,424
This is what I think.

682
01:07:04,424 --> 01:07:08,984
I'm very thankful that you even came, Section Chief Kang.

683
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:10,958
I take that to be a positive thing.

684
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:17,258
I wanted to discuss with you about doing more within the company, Section Chief Kang.

685
01:07:17,258 --> 01:07:21,091
You need to develop somehow, right? You should.

686
01:07:21,091 --> 01:07:26,013
I think this would be a very good chance for you to do that.

687
01:07:26,013 --> 01:07:29,339
Among the executives, people like Director Nam.

688
01:07:29,339 --> 01:07:35,248
Also your bosses, like me...

689
01:07:35,248 --> 01:07:37,685
we can use this experience to take more interest in you.

690
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:44,352
Se Yeong, you can help grow the company from within.

691
01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:00,739
That's why Section Chief Yun was more aggressive about it.

692
01:08:00,739 --> 01:08:03,087
Yes, a bit.

693
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,528
Let's drink.

694
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,356
Am I late?

695
01:08:11,356 --> 01:08:15,347
It's okay. I'm here to buy you food.

696
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,859
Thanks.

697
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:20,740
So how is your talk going?

698
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:26,268
I know just how shocking and confusing this is. It's not that I don't know.

699
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:30,017
Also, the reason I'm talking about this is...

700
01:08:30,017 --> 01:08:32,803
it's not only because of our company's position.

701
01:08:32,804 --> 01:08:39,086
I'm also worried about your life in our company, Ye Eun.

702
01:08:39,086 --> 01:08:42,990
Yes, Senior Manager Choi. Could you give me some time?

703
01:08:42,991 --> 01:08:44,902
I will think about it.

704
01:08:44,902 --> 01:08:48,149
- I think you should think quickly.
- Okay.

705
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:51,539
Senior Manager, I have a meeting soon.

706
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:53,604
I have to get going now.

707
01:08:53,604 --> 01:08:56,925
- Okay, think about it carefully.
- I will do that.

708
01:08:56,925 --> 01:09:00,077
- You didn't even eat though.
- No, I ate a lot.

709
01:09:00,077 --> 01:09:03,716
- Thank you.
- No... all right.

710
01:09:03,716 --> 01:09:06,002
You should stay a bit longer...

711
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:11,387
Director.

712
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:23,974
Have a drink.

713
01:10:28,037 --> 01:10:30,755
It wasn't a little at all.

714
01:10:30,755 --> 01:10:33,796
Who did you drink so much with?

715
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:36,057
You drank alone, didn't you?

716
01:10:39,376 --> 01:10:41,680
You should've called.

717
01:10:43,975 --> 01:10:48,106
Were you too angry to call me?

718
01:11:20,404 --> 01:11:22,053
Jun Hui.

We are enough for me.

All I need is Seo Jun Hui.

744
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:28,180
♫ Is the daybreak yet to come? ♫

745
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:33,680

♫ Come away with me ♫

758
01:16:39,799 --> 01:16:43,063
I get scared when you ask to see me.

759
01:16:43,803 --> 01:16:47,014
What are you going to be a nuisance about now?

760
01:16:49,002 --> 01:16:52,922
Help me go work at our U.S. office again.

761
01:16:54,299 --> 01:16:56,483
As soon as possible.

762
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:01,692
Since you've been there, you know it's at least three years.

763
01:17:01,693 --> 01:17:04,533
I would prefer it if it's longer.

764
01:17:05,544 --> 01:17:09,044
What's the reason why? Are you fleeing from something?

765
01:17:10,913 --> 01:17:12,874
Something like that.

766
01:17:13,894 --> 01:17:17,254
You were frowning about a quick trip to China because of your girlfriend.

767
01:17:17,255 --> 01:17:20,004
I plan to go with my girlfriend.

768
01:17:54,099 --> 01:17:55,821
It's clean.

769
01:17:55,822 --> 01:17:58,641
It's a nice place to live alone.

770
01:18:01,037 --> 01:18:03,540
Someone saw it this morning.

771
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:07,761
That person liked it so much and said they'd sign tonight.

772
01:18:07,761 --> 01:18:10,831
I put that person off for a bit.

773
01:18:14,913 --> 01:18:17,670
I'll go with this place.

774
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:33,740
♫ Sometimes it's hard to be a woman ♫

775
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:43,230
♫ Givin' all your love to just one man ♫

776
01:18:43,236 --> 01:18:46,812
Have you ever thought about quitting?

777
01:18:46,812 --> 01:18:48,214
Are you suggesting we run away?

778
01:18:48,215 --> 01:18:50,446
What are you two up to?

779
01:18:50,446 --> 01:18:52,946
You've acted like a victim long enough.

780
01:18:52,947 --> 01:18:55,094
He is even thinking of suing for defamation.

781
01:18:55,095 --> 01:18:58,067
Must you see everything destroyed and broken to be satisfied?

782
01:18:58,068 --> 01:18:59,706
I always praised you.

783
01:18:59,707 --> 01:19:01,628
It's not that I want to do it for you, but I will do it.

784
01:19:01,629 --> 01:19:03,625
Everything that I can do, all of it.

785
01:19:03,626 --> 01:19:04,865
Do I look pretty?

786
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,781
People who get worn down and give up,

787
01:19:07,782 --> 01:19:08,970
I can't bear them anymore.

788
01:19:08,971 --> 01:19:10,942
Do you really think you can go to the U.S.?

789
01:19:10,943 --> 01:19:13,985
Mom says she won't let Jun Hui take one step in.

790
01:19:13,985 --> 01:19:17,291
I want to see him now so what can I do but go out?

791
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:19,423
Let's go.

792
01:19:20,606 --> 01:19:22,644
The two of us.

793
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:30,110
♫ Oh, be proud of him ♫

794
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:34,220
