[Episode 13]

2
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,150
Hello.

3
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,771
Where are you going?

4
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,972
Home.

5
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,778
Can you see me?

6
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,906
The thing is...

7
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:57,607
Just come back.

8
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,270
Jun Hui.

9
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,689
I said, just come back.

10
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,989
Don't be like this and...

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,161
Can't you hear me telling you to come back?

12
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,509
It has been a long time.

13
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:27,010
All this time...

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,788
Let's go.

15
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:37,381
What are you doing? Your father is here.

16
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:39,290
Don't worry about him.

17
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,589
This isn't right.

18
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:44,959
I know how you feel, but...

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,460
Do you know?

20
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,105
You know, yet you do this?

21
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:51,846
Is it because you know how I feel?

22
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:53,325
What do you know?

23
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:55,926
How much do you really know?

24
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,831
Okay, I don't know. I don't know a thing.

25
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:03,840
I don't know so I decided everything on my own and that's what I'll do.

26
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:08,589
I made plans with your father so don't tell me to come with you.

27
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:10,219
Yun Jin Ah.

28
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,720
Don't act childish.

29
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,018
He isn't just anyone. He's your father.

30
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,971
Who says?

31
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,042
Who says that he's my father?

32
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,600
Seo Jun Hui.

33
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:32,201
Do what you want. Do what you please...

34
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,916
but don't force it on me.

35
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,327
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:01,128
It's okay.

37
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,735
Are our plans ruined now?

38
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,610
[Thoughts of dessert..]

39
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,632
I don't think it would be bad to have dessert first.

40
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,032
Sure.

41
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,530
Go on in.

42
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,630
Where are you going?

43
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,397
Seo Jun Hui, where are you going?

44
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,395
I did wonder for a moment.

45
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,761
Jun Hui.

46
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,055
Whenever I spoke about Jun Hui at the hotel... how should I put it?

47
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:01,886
You seemed to be nervous.

48
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,989
Anyway, it didn't seem ordinary.

49
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,768
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:11,169
That as well.

51
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,210
I wonder why you kept saying sorry. It was because of Jun Hui.

52
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,239
I'm sorry...

53
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,718
I'm very touched.

54
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,206
It isn't just anyone.

55
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:32,007
Jin Ah is my Jun Hui's girlfriend.

56
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,393
It's wonderful.

57
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,630
Do you mean that?

58
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,322
My flaw is that I'm too honest with women.

59
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,373
Thank you for looking upon me favorably.

60
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:52,374
There's no reason why I wouldn't.

61
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,112
Does your family know, too?

62
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,326
Yes.

63
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,172
They're happy, right?

64
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,911
Well, they never imagined it so they seem a bit taken aback.

65
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,390
But I know they will understand soon.

66
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,593
You know how my parents are.

67
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:21,922
Although they're very conservative,

68
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,811
they're not the type you can't convince.

69
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:29,012
Is that why you got set up on that date?

70
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,075
Well...

71
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,387

Hello.

87
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,232
- Jun Hui?
- Is he upstairs?

88
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:58,851
No, he isn't.

89
00:08:58,852 --> 00:08:59,897
Is he not at work?

90
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,573
No, he already left.

91
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:06,735
I don't know what it is, exactly. He did take his bag with him, he was in a hurry.

92
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,684
When was that?

93
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:12,032
I don't know. What time was that?

94
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:14,333
I think it was around 7:00 p.m.

95
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,348
- Thanks.
- Bye.

96
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,869
I had something to take care of.

97
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,966
I'll return within the week.

98
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,503
What would I be hiding?

99

I have no secrets from you, Honey.

100
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:44,585
It just isn't a big deal.

101
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,810
Yes.

102
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,810
It isn't peak season so there will be tickets available.

103
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:54,940
Don't worry. Make sure to lock up.

104
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,007
I'll call you before I get on my flight.

105
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,980
I love you.

106

Yes.

107
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:47,613

108
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,992
Oh my. Thank you.

109
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:52,483
By the way, your brother came in very drunk.

110
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:55,291
- He came in?
- A little while ago.

111
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:57,573
He was nearly unconscious.

112
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,173
I've never seen him like that.

113

Hey, Seo Jun Hui! Hey.

114
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:11,659
Gosh, how much did he drink?

115
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:14,340
Get up. Come up, get up.

116
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,841
Sleep in your bed.

117
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:21,030
You must be crazy. Oh my!

118
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:24,506
Let's get you over to the bed.

119

Seriously!

120
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:47,278
What have you been up to?

121
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:55,744
Hey, let go! Crazy, stay still.

122
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,040
What happened here?

123
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:17,699
Did he really break up with Yun Jin Ah?

124
00:14:25,874 --> 00:14:27,353
You startled me.

125
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:29,852
Are those the stores you're in charge of?

126
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:31,884
Yes.

127
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,893
Do you want to continue doing the Suseo store?

128
00:14:34,893 --> 00:14:37,414
Are you teasing me?

129
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:40,012
What do I have to gain from that now?

130
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,616
Why would you bring that up?

131
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:43,650
Then what would I bring up?

132
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:49,200
The Suseo store has become a little uncomfortable for you, right?

133
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:51,231
Why would you suddenly say that?

134
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:57,791
I thought it'd be different from when you were just friends. Now there are some family relations.

135
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,540
It isn't like that.

136
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:03,242
You were doing it so I thought you might want to continue.

137
00:15:03,242 --> 00:15:07,391
Well, I don't really care either way.

138
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:09,566
But if things are difficult for my colleague–

139
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:12,267
I'll do it. I will. Give it to me.

140
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:17,380
I don't know when you became Yun Jin Ah's savior.

141
00:15:19,463 --> 00:15:21,260
Is something wrong?

142
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,110
I'll tell you later.

He didn't come to work?

149
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:55,337
Our team manager said he took the day off.

150
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,106
For what reason?

151
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:00,844
I don't know.

- Are you okay?
- Yes.

Are you busy?

Why would I be busy? I'm retired now.

00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:40,167
I spend my days doing this and that.

170
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,730
Then should we meet up today?

171
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:45,038
What?

172
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:53,230
It feels like I just went grocery shopping.

173
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,354
Why is there so much to buy?

174
00:18:56,354 --> 00:19:00,137
I don't think I'll make kimchi this time.

175
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:03,060
The kids don't really eat at home.

176
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,161
You have to give some to Gyeong Seon.

177
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:08,359
Am I their mom?

178
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,638
What kind of person...

179
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:11,349
The problem with the kids is theirs alone.

180
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:14,110
Will you never see them again?

181
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,661
I'm not scared of that.

182
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:17,522
Gosh.

183
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,466
I'm trying here too!

184
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:22,897
You, Seung Ho, and everyone pick on me, saying that I'm wrong.

185
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:25,806
I'm trying my best to hold back. What more do I have to do?

186
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:28,908
- Did I say something?
- You did!

187
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:37,188
What now?

188
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,130
Well...

189
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,519
it's nothing.

190
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,520
Are you teasing me?

191
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,560
Well, it's just...

192
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,865
Gyeong Seon's father wants to meet me today.

193
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:53,256
He must be in Korea.

194
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:56,205
Why would you meet him? Why? Why does he want to meet?

195
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:57,539
I don't know why.

196
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,337
Tell him no. You have no business with him.

197
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:01,653
We already agreed to meet.

198
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:03,966
Oh, Yun Sang Gi!

199
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:08,533
Are you intent on destroying your daughter's life or what?

200
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:11,234
I'm her dad!

201
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:13,969
Yun Jin Ah's father!

202
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,846
What kind of person do you take me for?

203
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:21,509
Don't talk down to me!

204
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:23,410
How dare you.

205
00:20:36,784 --> 00:20:39,734
What do you mean, a conciliation?

206
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:41,602
Gong Cheol Gu.

207
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:44,442
He's been buying dinner for female employees.

208
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:46,500
Telling them to say he hasn't harassed them.

209
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:48,951
And that they made mistakes too.

210
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:52,170
He's saying it's easier to let it go since they both did wrong.

211
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:53,372
And?

212
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:56,748
The girls are young, and it's their boss saying that.

213
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:59,644
They feel pressured to say yes.

214
00:20:59,644 --> 00:21:02,939
From my perspective,

215
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,560
they feel like it's for the best.

216
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,561
What do you mean?

217
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,031
Yun Jin Ah's case isn't the only one.

218
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:14,480
They're worried that they will have to speak up as a victim.

219
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:19,890
Senior Manager Gong is urging them to cover it up, and they think it's best.

220
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:23,780
As time goes by, it seems more like Yun Jin Ah's on her own.

221
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,410
What if Yun Jin Ah ends up changing her mind too?

222
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:40,001
Did you ask for me?

223
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,106
Are you busy lately?

224
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:42,854
No, not really.

225
00:21:42,855 --> 00:21:45,912
Though, I'm working dutifully.

226
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:50,141
You should be dutiful only to your work.

227
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,392
Why don't you tell me what you really mean?

228
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:57,793
What I really mean? Sounds good.

Your hand.

230
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,823
Actions like this are sexual harassment too.

231
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:25,140
No, no. This is...

232
00:22:27,705 --> 00:22:29,648
If you try anything to cover this up,

233
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:33,450
I'm telling you that I can make something up to expose you.

234
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,190
- Do you want to experience that?
- No.

235
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:43,215
It would be best for you if I don't see you hanging around the female employees.

236
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,069
Yes.

237
00:23:05,004 --> 00:23:07,430
Is Section Chief Yun Jin Ah there?

238
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:11,244
Okay.

239

Two Americanos for here, please.

240
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:37,410
Sure.

241
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,900
Is something going on with Jun Hui?

242
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:06,134
I can't reach him on the phone, and he didn't go to work.

243
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:08,613
"He didn't go to work"?

244
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:12,260
You didn't know either. He took a day off.

245
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:15,848
Didn't you two break up?

246
00:24:16,904 --> 00:24:18,423
Then why is he acting like that?

247
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:21,284
Why is he drinking so much and not going to work?

248
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:23,083
Did he drink a lot?

249
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:26,345
He didn't just drink a lot. I thought he had alcohol poisoning.

250
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:29,943
I don't know if he got in a fight or broke something, but his hand was hurt.

251
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:31,334
Did he get hurt?

252
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:33,634
Not a lot.

253
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:38,131
Did nothing really happen between the two of you?

254
00:24:42,924 --> 00:24:46,824
I met with your father.

255
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:50,343
He came to my work.

256
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:53,344
Jun Hui happened to see that.

257
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:58,494
Seriously, why would you do that? Why would you meet him?

258
00:24:58,495 --> 00:25:01,675
Did you want to beg him to let you marry Jun Hui?

259
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:06,276
I know I make many mistakes, but I'm not that bad.

260
00:25:09,145 --> 00:25:11,949
He bought presents for you both.

261
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,820
He said he had no way of giving it to you.

262
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:17,871
I didn't know if I should accept these.

263
00:25:17,872 --> 00:25:20,701
I wondered if giving it to you would make things more uncomfortable.

264
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:23,355
I thought about all sorts of things.

265
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:27,319
So how was Jun Hui?

266
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,838
Did he fight with our father?

267
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:32,116
He wouldn't even look at him.

268
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:35,347
He probably hated the fact that I met his father more.

269
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:37,976
He was very angry.

270
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:40,557
I've never seen him that angry.

271
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:42,333
That was all.

272
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,380
I haven't been able to contact him since.

273
00:25:47,794 --> 00:25:52,218
Jun Hui is probably not home right now, right?

274
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,632
He isn't home.

275
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:59,172
I made hangover soup and went over, but he wasn't there. I thought he went to work early.

276
00:25:59,172 --> 00:26:02,182
Where could he be then?

277
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:09,313
I think... I made a mistake.

278
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,553
He was acting out so much in front of your father.

279
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:17,554
So I told him to stop acting childish.

280
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:24,356
He's probably hurt.

281

00:32:34,815 --> 00:32:39,315
You've been emphasizing family this entire time.

333
00:32:44,315 --> 00:32:47,555
Hyungnim, we are like brothers.

334
00:32:47,555 --> 00:32:50,381
It isn't like we are strangers.

335
00:32:50,381 --> 00:32:52,281
My goodness.

336
00:32:55,455 --> 00:33:01,579
Before the work issue explodes, organize your personal affairs.

337
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:06,220
I keep my personal life separate from my work life.

338
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:08,483
Of course.

339
00:33:08,484 --> 00:33:12,384
You should keep your personal and work life separate. Yes.

340
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:19,611
Will this be enough? Should we order more?

341
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:22,470
No, it should be good.

342
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:26,719
Is today a special day? Why are you treating us to this?

343
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,139
It's only because we never had time.

344
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:32,400
I always wanted to treat you all.

345
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,899
I'm so happy we don't have company dinners lately.

346
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,779
I wish we could hang out like this all the time.

347
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:38,879
I completely agree.

348
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,961
Do you know what though?

349
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:45,331
About the sexual harassment issue...

350
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:48,082
They could say it's our fault too.

351
00:33:48,082 --> 00:33:50,592
Why? We were just the victims.

352
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:54,042
People would say the men wouldn't have done it without encouragement.

353
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:57,650
Then are you saying we were leading them on?

354
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:00,462
No need to get worked up.

355
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:02,463
Not you girls.

356
00:34:05,701 --> 00:34:08,802
I don't like saying this, but...

357
00:34:10,096 --> 00:34:15,896
Section Chief Yun was... a bit too much.

358
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:20,851
Well, don't get the wrong idea.

359
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:23,320
Yun Jin Ah just has such a friendly personality,

360
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,540
I think she crosses the line without meaning to.

361
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:33,324
You know what I mean? Section Chief Geum and I warned you.

362
00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:35,524
That you shouldn't be like her.

363
00:34:41,015 --> 00:34:45,233
Of course, the female employees are the victims.

364
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:50,315
A few of them might be accused of using it as an excuse.

365
00:34:50,315 --> 00:34:52,890
I'm a little worried about that.

366
00:34:53,628 --> 00:34:59,528
Especially anyone who is close to Section Chief Yun.

367
00:35:00,235 --> 00:35:03,435
Don't you think they would be seen in the same light?

368
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:18,835
Aren't you going home?

369
00:35:18,835 --> 00:35:22,535
Oh, yes. I'll leave a little later.

370
00:35:23,297 --> 00:35:25,460
You have many worries lately, right?

371
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:28,456
No, I'm okay.

372
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:32,157
How could you be okay? I know you have it harder than anyone.

373
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,954
What is it that you know?

374
00:35:34,955 --> 00:35:37,487
This and that. I know things are hard.

375
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:39,587
You must be suffering a lot.

376
00:35:41,817 --> 00:35:45,191
I'm not suffering at all.

377
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:47,168
Not about work issues anyway.

378
00:35:47,168 --> 00:35:51,868
If you're referring to anything else, I think you're overstepping.

379
00:35:54,261 --> 00:35:56,791
You're right. I think I went too far.

380
00:35:56,792 --> 00:35:59,540
Don't get the wrong idea. Work hard.

381
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,267
Really? What is he doing?

382
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:17,473
Yes, Seung Ho.

383
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:20,284
Since when are you happy to hear from me?

384
00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:22,685
Are you with Jun Hui by any chance?

385
00:36:23,813 --> 00:36:26,413
I was about to ask you that.

386
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:28,352
Don't you know where Seo Jun Hui is?

387
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,253
Where are you?

388
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:32,839
I'm at school.

389
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:35,919
Why is Seo Jun Hui's phone turned off?

390
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:38,232
I don't know either.

391
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:39,743
Did you two fight?

392
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:41,699
Shut up.

393
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:43,890
So you did fight.

394
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:48,630
Is there any place Jun Hui might go or friends he might meet?

395
00:36:50,268 --> 00:36:53,135
What is this? This is an obsession.

396
00:36:53,136 --> 00:36:54,844
Hang up.

397
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:58,475
Tell Jun Hui to call me if you see him.

398
00:36:58,475 --> 00:37:00,375
You tell him.

399
00:37:02,337 --> 00:37:04,437
What's with her?

400
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:13,530
Oh, Hyungnim.

401
00:37:14,038 --> 00:37:16,238
Oh, hey.

402
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:18,393
Wow.

403
00:37:18,393 --> 00:37:20,126
- Please sit.
- Yes.

404
00:37:20,127 --> 00:37:22,373
Wow, it's been a long time.

405
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,672
- Did you have a drink?
- Yes.

406
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:43,650
Why don't you like my Jun Hui?

407
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:47,076
What about him is so wrong?

408
00:39:47,076 --> 00:39:48,976
Oh.

409
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:52,840
It isn't like that.

410
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:55,119
Is it because of me?

411
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,670
N-No, no. It isn't. Why would you say that?

412
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,148
Then why would you reject him?

413
00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:04,620
It isn't a rejection.

414
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:10,275
It's just that they've been like brother and sister since they were young.

415
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:12,700
How tacky of you.

416
00:40:13,261 --> 00:40:15,305
I suppose so.

417
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:19,378
Not only that, but they do have an age difference.

418
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:22,138
That is even worse.

419
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:25,038
Are you lacking excuses that much?

420
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:30,856
I'm frustrated too.

421
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:37,173
I'm me, and Jun Hui is Jun Hui.

422
00:40:37,173 --> 00:40:41,204
Are you worried that I'll burden the kids if I have nothing?

423
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:43,043
Why would you say that?

424
00:40:43,043 --> 00:40:45,760
Then what is it?

425
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,244
You stomp on a young man's pride.

426
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:53,243
Why would you insult his character in this way?

427
00:41:08,906 --> 00:41:11,860
Is meeting your father...

428
00:41:12,744 --> 00:41:15,544
something to be this upset about?

429
00:41:15,544 --> 00:41:18,250
Do you have to go this far?

430
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:21,180
Why wouldn't it be?

431
00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:24,994
I lived my life thinking he was someone who had nothing to do with me.

432
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:27,534
My girlfriend is acknowledging him.

433
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:30,533
Suddenly, he's my father.

434
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:33,944
He's sneaking himself in so that I have to accept him.

435
00:41:33,944 --> 00:41:37,538
The situation is turning out that way.

436
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:39,790
How can I not care?

437
00:41:41,618 --> 00:41:43,445
I know that already.

438
00:41:43,445 --> 00:41:47,554
If you knew that, you should have told me first.

439
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:50,170
You should have checked how I felt.

440
00:41:51,248 --> 00:41:53,915
You'll probably say you didn't want to worry me again.

441
00:41:53,915 --> 00:41:57,015
There was always a lie hidden in those words.

442
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:02,636
Have you never fooled me?

443
00:42:02,636 --> 00:42:05,016
Have you never lied to me?

444
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:06,916
About what?

445
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:11,018
About being told by your mother to break up and leave you.

446
00:42:11,018 --> 00:42:13,150
Then getting beat up by her?

447
00:42:14,276 --> 00:42:16,576
Depressing things like that?

448
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:28,090
Why didn't you tell me?

449
00:42:29,373 --> 00:42:31,351
It's because you might do this.

450
00:42:31,351 --> 00:42:33,051
It's obvious.

451
00:42:34,703 --> 00:42:37,400
You would cry and apologize.

452
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,934
I'd say it's okay, but you wouldn't believe me and you'd smile.

453
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,340
You would work hard to not worry me.

454
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:44,930
Every time that happens...

455
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:48,440
all I can do is hold your hand and hug you.

456
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:53,220
Do you know how I feel when that's all I can do for you?

457
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:55,663
It drives me crazy.

458
00:42:55,663 --> 00:42:58,263
I feel so pathetic, it drives me insane.

459
00:43:00,096 --> 00:43:02,296
I don't know much about parents.

460
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:07,140
"Parents have no choice but to do this." "Parents are like this."

461
00:43:07,683 --> 00:43:10,240
I can't really understand these words.

462
00:43:11,804 --> 00:43:14,890
So I wasn't afraid of dating you at all.

463
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:21,243
I could've gone through anything as long as you were with me, but...

464
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:28,140
But I don't understand, and I don't want to understand.

465
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:33,863
A person I never wanted to see again showed up and is pretending to be my dad.

466
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:36,450
In front of the woman I love, at that.

467
00:43:37,744 --> 00:43:40,430
How... how am I supposed to accept that?

468
00:43:41,935 --> 00:43:45,755
Am I supposed to be thankful and grateful for it?

469
00:43:45,755 --> 00:43:48,255
Why? Why should I?

470
00:43:50,257 --> 00:43:51,396
He's still your father.

471
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,583
Even words like that...

472
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:56,677
I'm not acting childish.

473
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:58,910
You're making me act like this.

474
00:44:00,356 --> 00:44:04,237
You could just understand and let it go. Why are you being so difficult?

475
00:44:04,237 --> 00:44:08,337
Thinking that way is what makes me look childish.

476
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:13,506
Are you saying it's my fault?

477
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,407
That's not what I'm saying right now!

478
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,206
Then what is it?

479
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:22,347
You said I make you that way.

480
00:44:22,347 --> 00:44:23,964
- Noona.
- I act like I'm an adult.

481
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:29,295
I act like I have an open heart and treat you like a petty, petulant child.

482
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:31,864
Yes, I did.

483
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:34,564
I thought that way. Are you satisfied?

484
00:44:35,813 --> 00:44:38,140
- Noona.
- What?

485
00:44:39,172 --> 00:44:40,541
Don't you get what I'm trying to say?

486
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:41,815
Why wouldn't I know?

487
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:45,255
You don't want me to act like I'm more mature in front of you.

488
00:44:45,255 --> 00:44:49,979
You don't want me to act like an adult older by a few years. I understood it all.

489
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:00,822
What? Was I wrong?

490
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:02,622
Then what is it?

491
00:45:08,867 --> 00:45:10,891
Never mind.

492
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:12,521
I'm sorry.

493
00:45:12,521 --> 00:45:15,821
For not understanding you and being so stubborn.

494
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,740
♫ I feel you now from here ♫

495
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:49,510
♫ Our time is not done yet ♫

496
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:55,810
♫ You've given me my fullest heart ♫

497
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:02,070
♫ We'll never be apart ♫

498
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,680
♫ I'm breathing through you now ♫

499
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:24,133
♫ The love we have, so true ♫

500
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:26,379
Please open the doors for me.

501
00:46:26,379 --> 00:46:27,400
Thank you.

502
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:32,980
♫ I never thought that I could need someone ♫

503
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,110
♫ The way I do ♫

504
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:47,310
♫ And we're meant to be ♫

505
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:52,090

♫ I feel everything ♫

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:06,610
♫ Never been so exposed ♫

508
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:15,430
♫ Are there pieces still yet to be discovered with your love? ♫

509
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:23,730
♫ I can see anything through wherever you are ♫

510
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,060
♫ I can feel you ♫

511
00:47:38,603 --> 00:47:40,210
Yes, Noona.

512
00:47:44,516 --> 00:47:46,016
Okay.

513
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,919
We are here.

514
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:35,480
- This is my house.
- Watch out.

515
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,494
Why is my wife being like that?

516
00:48:38,494 --> 00:48:40,282
I should get going.

517
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:44,293
Hey, I said come on in.

518
00:48:44,294 --> 00:48:47,469
Oh, look at you.

519
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:49,127
No, that's not it.

520
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:52,556
You're wearing your shoes inside, American style.

521
00:48:52,556 --> 00:48:55,640
This is Korea. Korea, okay?

522
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,290
Here.

523
00:48:58,857 --> 00:49:02,556
Welcome, welcome.

524
00:49:03,786 --> 00:49:07,529
Honey! Mi Yeon!

525
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,907
Come over here, okay?

526
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:11,523
Here.

527
00:49:11,523 --> 00:49:13,570
One second.

528
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:19,574
She's just a little shy.

529
00:49:19,574 --> 00:49:24,278
Mi Yeon, what are you doing?

530
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:27,238
Mi Yeon.

531
00:49:27,238 --> 00:49:30,101
What are you doing?

532
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,501
Mi Yeon.

533
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,918
You're crazy, crazy!

534
00:49:38,918 --> 00:49:42,340
I am crazy. I'm crazy about love.

535
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,460
Stop it! Why did you bring him home? Are you in your right mind?

536
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,209
Let's stop thinking only of ourselves.

537
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:50,424
What?

538
00:49:50,424 --> 00:49:53,814
If we only think of ourselves, it just hurts the kids.

539
00:49:53,814 --> 00:49:57,992
What are you talking about? Just get out there and get rid of him.

540
00:49:57,992 --> 00:50:00,284
That is no way to treat a guest.

541
00:50:00,284 --> 00:50:02,333
And he is my guest.

542
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,942
"Guest"? You're really too much.

543
00:50:04,942 --> 00:50:06,546
Should I go kick him out?

544
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:08,618
You better not.

545
00:50:08,618 --> 00:50:11,518
Then you'll get kicked out of here.

546
00:50:14,186 --> 00:50:16,620
Don't mess with me.

547
00:50:19,906 --> 00:50:23,506
He has lost his mind. He really has.

548
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,477
Why don't we stop drinking?

549
00:50:31,477 --> 00:50:34,316
Are you already drunk?

550
00:50:34,316 --> 00:50:37,616
I'm still sober.

551
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,840
Hyungnim.

552
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:53,535
Today, I'm feeling so...

553
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,497
Gosh, how can I describe it?

554
00:50:57,497 --> 00:51:00,700
I feel good.

555
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,994
Yet, I also feel sad.

556
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,590
Sentimental.

557
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,975
That is the word to describe it.

558
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,210
How about you?

559
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,906
Do you understand these feelings of mine?

560
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,840
I know. I know.

561
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,539
Just as I thought, we understand each other.

562
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,646
Here you go.

563
00:51:31,646 --> 00:51:34,648
Please take this drink.

564
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:36,948
That's enough.

565
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:43,446
Honey, what are you doing? Bring us some food!

566
00:51:43,446 --> 00:51:46,010
Stop that.

567
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:51,367
When it comes to what I say, my wife will...

568
00:51:51,367 --> 00:51:54,696
drop everything to do it.

569
00:51:54,696 --> 00:52:00,397
Mi Yeon!

570
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:06,776
You see, you see? If I ask for it...

571
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,267
Oh my.

572
00:52:15,268 --> 00:52:17,578
It's been a very long time.

573
00:52:17,578 --> 00:52:19,779
Yes, it has.

574
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:23,017
I'm sorry to show up so suddenly.

575
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:24,718
Yes.

576
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,686
I'll get going soon.

577
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:29,805
Why would you say such a thing?

578
00:52:29,805 --> 00:52:33,706
He is going to sleep over tonight.

579
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,817
Why are you standing there like that? Bring us some snacks.

580
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,594
Should I have a drink then?

581
00:52:57,594 --> 00:52:59,553
Sounds good.

582
00:52:59,553 --> 00:53:03,355
Here. Cheers.

583
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,959
Here. Have another.

584
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,967
Oh wow.

585
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,950
I heard you met Dad.

586
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,780
I heard from Jin Ah. Why didn't you go to work?

587
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,743
Where did you go?

588
00:53:37,743 --> 00:53:39,608
To Mom.

589
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,001
What did she say? Did she say she was proud of you?

590
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,880
You must have felt really frustrated to have gone there.

591
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,620
I usually feel better once I visit Mom.

592
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,602
Strangely, I couldn't find the answer today.

593
00:53:59,602 --> 00:54:02,302
Mom must be mad at you too.

594
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,401
Do you think everything you do is right?

595
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,121
What did I do wrong?

596
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:17,002
Do you think I like Dad and everything he does?

597
00:54:17,002 --> 00:54:18,568
But what can I do?

598
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:21,369
Live or die, he's our only living parent.

599
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,490
Do we need him?

600
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,183
Is it because we need him?

601
00:54:25,183 --> 00:54:29,146
We all live under the same sky so we will see him sometimes.

602
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:34,575
It's because you take it so lightly that Jin Ah is meeting him, thinking he's my parent.

603
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:37,524
You really don't know anything at all.

604
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:43,112
Yun Jin Ah may do many wrong things, but do you think she would've approached him first?

605
00:54:43,112 --> 00:54:47,867
Our father bought presents but had no way to give them to us so he called her.

606
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,513
You should sit down now.

607
00:55:18,513 --> 00:55:20,109
It's fine.

608
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:23,210
Our guest says to sit down!

609
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:37,169
I heard that you took care of my children.

610
00:55:37,169 --> 00:55:38,754
It isn't like that.

611
00:55:38,754 --> 00:55:41,622
What do you mean?

612
00:55:41,622 --> 00:55:44,693
She took care of them more than our own children.

613
00:55:44,693 --> 00:55:48,994
She cared for Gyeong Seon and Jun Hui so much.

614
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:56,597
Why do you hate Jun Hui dating Jin Ah so much?

615
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,360
I would like to hear your reasons.

616
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,854
I'm just truly curious.

617
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:08,755
What? Well, I can't specify...

618
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,026
Oh, is that Seung Ho?

619
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,408
It's the prettiest girl in the world, my daughter.

620
00:56:24,408 --> 00:56:25,874
Come here, come here.

621
00:56:25,874 --> 00:56:28,773
She needs to get changed first.

622
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,668
Call Gyeong Seon or Jun Hui and tell them to pick him up right away.

623
00:56:36,668 --> 00:56:37,928
How did this happen?

624
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,087
You made this happen! Why are you asking me?

625
00:56:40,087 --> 00:56:42,037
Call them now.

626
00:56:42,037 --> 00:56:44,791
Why would I call?

627
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:46,307
Should I do it?

628
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:47,647
Mom.

629
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:49,493
Is it better if I do it?

630
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:52,216
Please, stop.

631
00:56:52,216 --> 00:56:55,670
You don't even hear what I say anymore, do you?

632
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:59,254
Okay, I'll take him back.

633
00:56:59,254 --> 00:57:01,815
Seriously? What is he to you?

634
00:57:01,815 --> 00:57:04,108
Is he your father-in-law or what?

635
00:57:04,108 --> 00:57:05,955
Don't get ahead of yourself.

636
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:08,503
He isn't a stranger.

637
00:57:08,504 --> 00:57:11,606
He's my friend's father. I can drive him.

638
00:57:11,606 --> 00:57:14,914
Stop throwing a fuss or going overboard.

639
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:18,215
Is this my fault? Is it my fault?

640
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:24,783
Sure, it's my fault. It's all my fault.

641
00:57:24,783 --> 00:57:28,597
Everything in the world is my fault. I ought to die.

642
00:57:28,598 --> 00:57:30,298
So what do you want me to do?

643
00:57:30,298 --> 00:57:33,901
Should I disappear from your sight? Will that make you feel better?

644
00:57:33,902 --> 00:57:36,327
Really? You think you can say whatever you please!

645
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,977
How dare you threaten me.

646
00:57:38,977 --> 00:57:43,775
Stop saying useless things and call them already!

647
00:57:43,776 --> 00:57:45,796
Whatever.

648
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:48,957
Whether you call or kick him out, you figure it out. I don't care.

649
00:57:48,957 --> 00:57:51,662
Hey, just call.

650
00:57:51,662 --> 00:57:53,963
Hey, you punk!

651
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:02,405
What right do you have to say such things?

652
00:58:02,405 --> 00:58:04,973
- What?
- Dad.

653
00:58:04,973 --> 00:58:08,674
Dad, what are you doing? Dad!

654
00:58:08,674 --> 00:58:10,488
Oh, Dad.

655
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:13,230
My life is my own.

656
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,410
One more thing.

657
00:58:15,937 --> 00:58:20,738
I don't like your daughter either.

658
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:31,894
You got married three times.

659
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,610
I'm not drinking.

660
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:55,071
I'm going to drive you home and go see Jin Ah.

661
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,270
I knew she could keep a secret,

662
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:03,080
but now she's really making me feel sorry for her.

663
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,901
I'm telling you because I feel guilty.

664
00:59:06,901 --> 00:59:09,570
I told her to break up with you.

665
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:14,420
What could I do when I was so angry seeing her on that date?

666
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,240
I did regret it a bit after I said the words.

667
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,850
Wouldn't it be stranger if I didn't feel anything?

668
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:27,040
I know that, but...

669
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,450
I know how you feel, but please don't do that to Jin Ah.

670
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:38,050
Even if you've gone crazy, how could you be this crazy?

671
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,220
Okay, okay. I won't make a sound from now on.

672
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,337
If you'll just sit here looking sad, go to Yun Jin Ah who you're crazy about.

673
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:50,520
I'll just drink a bit and go home on my own.

674
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,787
Why don't you just drink at home?

675
00:59:53,787 --> 00:59:56,589
Why do I have to do whatever you want...

676
00:59:59,173 --> 01:00:00,473
[Mom]

677
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,639
Yes.

678
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:08,312
What?

679
01:00:08,312 --> 01:00:10,513
My father?

680
01:00:57,496 --> 01:01:00,407
I-I'm sorry.

681
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,833
Is "sorry" enough?

682
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:04,234
Mom.

683
01:01:04,234 --> 01:01:06,140
Gyeong Seon,

684
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,373
as an older sister, aren't you concerned for your brother's future?

685
01:01:09,373 --> 01:01:13,374
You care about him that much, yet you ignore what's going on.

686
01:01:13,374 --> 01:01:15,193
Why would you bring that up now?

687
01:01:15,193 --> 01:01:18,894
It's time to talk about it! How long will you drag it out?

688
01:01:18,894 --> 01:01:20,934
And you, Jun Hui.

689
01:01:20,934 --> 01:01:23,503
Didn't you hear anything I said?

690
01:01:23,503 --> 01:01:27,753
Do you not care what your elders say just because you had no adult in your life?

691
01:01:27,753 --> 01:01:30,851
What did you just say?

692
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:31,923
Noona.

693
01:01:31,923 --> 01:01:34,811
That's right. We didn't have parents,

694
01:01:34,811 --> 01:01:37,336
however, no one said we had poor manners.

695
01:01:37,336 --> 01:01:40,137
We were never rude or impolite!

696
01:01:40,137 --> 01:01:42,413
That's enough.

697
01:01:42,413 --> 01:01:43,987
I'm sorry.

698
01:01:43,987 --> 01:01:48,890
If you are truly sorry, you should never have started this.

699
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:51,651
It's already like this. How much worse will it get?

700
01:01:51,651 --> 01:01:55,945
Look, that's what your father is like.

701
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,151
How different could you two be?

702
01:01:57,151 --> 01:01:58,680
Mom, please stop.

703
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,720
I don't have anything left to say to you!

704
01:02:00,727 --> 01:02:02,967
You should've listened when I told you earlier!

705
01:02:02,967 --> 01:02:06,978
How old are you that you are behaving so immaturely?

706
01:02:06,978 --> 01:02:09,146
Your life is on the line here!

707
01:02:09,146 --> 01:02:11,466
Think about your future... your future!

708
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:14,020
Do you think Jun Hui will impede Jin Ah's future?

709
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,280
Whether or not he does,

710
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:18,499
I'm saying they can't be together!

711
01:02:18,499 --> 01:02:21,769
Do you think we are the only ones?

712
01:02:21,769 --> 01:02:24,621
Your father said he doesn't like Jin Ah, either.

713
01:02:24,621 --> 01:02:26,498
He doesn't like her.

714
01:02:26,498 --> 01:02:30,257
You're really going too far. How could you hurt him this much?

715
01:02:30,257 --> 01:02:32,878
I could do more.

716
01:02:32,878 --> 01:02:36,471
Don't you know I'm holding back because of our past bond?

717
01:02:36,471 --> 01:02:40,800
If it were someone else, I wouldn't even allow you in this house.

718
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,080
Stop right now!

719
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,653
What do you think you're doing?

720
01:02:46,877 --> 01:02:48,977
I won't see him.

721
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,910
I said I won't see him.

722
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:58,655
I won't see him anymore, so stop it.

723
01:02:58,655 --> 01:02:59,854
Noona.

724
01:02:59,854 --> 01:03:02,553
Everyone, just stop it.

725
01:03:09,117 --> 01:03:11,447
Jun Hui.

726
01:03:11,447 --> 01:03:13,349
Let's talk later.

727
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:15,849
Let's end things here.

728
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:26,126
♫ I feel you now from here ♫

729
01:03:26,126 --> 01:03:27,390
Let's break up.

730
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:33,280
♫ Our time is not done yet ♫

731
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:40,270
♫ You've given me my fullest heart ♫

732
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:46,390
♫ We'll never be apart ♫

733
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:03,010
♫ I'm breathing through you now ♫

734
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:10,090
♫ The love we have, so true ♫

735
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:17,400
♫ I never thought that I could need someone ♫

736
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:23,280
♫ The way I do ♫

737
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:27,028
Jin Ah.

738
01:04:27,028 --> 01:04:28,750
Jin Ah.

739
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:31,606
Noona.

740
01:04:31,606 --> 01:04:33,246
Jin Ah, Jin Ah.

741
01:04:35,356 --> 01:04:37,567
- Jin Ah.
- What are you doing?

742
01:04:37,567 --> 01:04:40,852
What are you doing in front of your elders? Stop this now!

743
01:04:40,892 --> 01:04:43,476
- What do you think you're doing?
- Open up.

744
01:04:43,476 --> 01:04:46,176
- Let go.
- Open the door!

745
01:04:46,176 --> 01:04:49,100
♫ Never been so exposed ♫

746
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,330
♫ Are there pieces still yet to be ♫

747
01:04:55,330 --> 01:05:00,190
♫ discovered with your love? ♫

748
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:04,070
♫ I can see anything through ♫

749
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:08,270
♫ Wherever you are ♫

750
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:14,370
♫ I can feel you ♫

751
01:05:24,898 --> 01:05:26,832
Don't you care about your pride or anything?

752
01:05:26,832 --> 01:05:29,508
Only caring if you two are happy, will you live like that?

753
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,499
Do we really have to do this?

754
01:05:31,499 --> 01:05:33,068
It's hard for me too.

755
01:05:33,068 --> 01:05:35,989
I'm not saying that I'm okay without thinking it through.

756
01:05:35,989 --> 01:05:38,010
I don't think I have to worry about Jun Hui anymore.

757
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:39,164
He grew up well.

758
01:05:39,164 --> 01:05:42,304
I feel secure knowing you chose Jin Ah.

759
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:44,193
Thank you.

760
01:05:44,193 --> 01:05:48,511
It could be much harder than you expected.

761
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:52,020
Can you really endure it?

762
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:54,052
I won't give you ramen if you cry.

763
01:05:54,052 --> 01:05:55,598
Give me ramen.

764
01:05:55,598 --> 01:06:00,560
I left home. I'm living on my own.

765
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,052
Her family is telling her to leave.

766
01:06:03,052 --> 01:06:05,451
Let's live together.

767
01:06:06,089 --> 01:06:09,189
It's enough for me.

768
01:06:10,373 --> 01:06:13,600
All I need is Seo Jun Hui.

769
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:20,430
♫ Are there pieces still yet to be discovered ♫

770
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:23,570
♫ with your love? ♫
