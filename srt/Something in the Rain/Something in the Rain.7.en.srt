00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:45,157
That means we need to write it without details.

330
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:21,310
[Yun Jin Ah]

331
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:37,318
Why are we suddenly doing something like this?

332
00:33:37,318 --> 00:33:41,818
I don't think the person who started it should say that.

333
00:33:41,818 --> 00:33:47,512
I just felt it was going too far, so I wanted to set some boundaries.

334
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:50,221
You're the one who started the fire.

335
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:55,707
We will see if Yun Jin Ah becomes a hero or a traitor.

336
00:33:55,707 --> 00:34:00,107
Whatever happens in the end, it comes down to me.

337
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:03,827
That's enough of that.

338
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:06,606
You sure have a deep friendship with Geum Bo Ra.

339
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:08,538
I heard you went on a trip with her.

340
00:34:08,538 --> 00:34:12,288
Did you go and agree to help her with Seo Jun Hui?

341
00:34:12,288 --> 00:34:14,814
We just went to get some air.

342
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:16,683
Why was it with Geum Bo Ra?

343
00:34:16,684 --> 00:34:20,584
Since when were you two so close?

344
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,980
Calm down.

345
00:34:22,981 --> 00:34:27,940
I don't intend on getting involved in anyone's dating life.

346
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,261
Even if you did get involved, it wouldn't have helped.

347
00:34:31,261 --> 00:34:34,692
You know I wanted your help too.

348
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:37,621
But, according to Seo Jun Hui's older sister...

349
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:40,942
his parents care about the girl's family background a great deal.

350
00:34:40,942 --> 00:34:44,842
Like a family that you know just by their name alone.

351
00:34:44,842 --> 00:34:49,034
I didn't think much of it before, but it's a bit much.

352
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:52,234
Why is that so important?

353
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:54,652
What do his parents do?

354
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:59,427
I don't know. I'm curious, too.

355
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:09,721
Where are you going so late at night? Why won't you tell me?

356
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:11,772
- Well?
- I'll tell you once I get back.

357
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:13,828
Why not just tell me before you go?

358
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:17,029
It's not like you have something important to do.

359
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,930
Will you be very late?

360
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:27,609
Call if you're going to be very late, okay?

361
00:35:36,243 --> 00:35:38,343
Call me.

362
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:12,522
Welcome.

363
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:32,192
The person you've been talking about, is it Jun Hui?

364
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:35,580
I don't know if his name is Jun Hui or whatever.

365
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,991
It was Seung Ho's friend, the one I saw at your home.

366
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:43,890
He's the person Jin Ah's seeing and Jin Ah said he was her boyfriend.

367
00:37:08,305 --> 00:37:11,905
- Bye.
- Bye.

368
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:20,296
What are you doing here?

369
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:22,848
You know why.

370
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:25,850
You ought to be on your knees, but what was that?

371
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,850
"You know why"?

372
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:32,208
Do you want to talk here?

373
00:37:41,712 --> 00:37:44,308
So... so, what now?

374
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:47,308
Why did you want to meet me?

375
00:37:48,668 --> 00:37:52,368
You should apologize to me.

376
00:37:52,368 --> 00:37:55,707
You treated me like I was a lowly and shameless person.

377
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:58,308
I came for an apology.

378
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,584
I don't think that I was wrong.

379
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:10,153
I just told you that Yun Jin Ah was also dating someone else.

380
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:12,578
You said you cheated first.

381
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:15,316
Then there's no reason Jin Ah can't date someone else.

382
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:17,928
Well, I suppose that's true but...

383
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:22,929
I mean she's dating her brother's friend. Are you okay with that and don't care?

384
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:25,029
Actually, I'm happy about it.

385
00:38:26,576 --> 00:38:30,706
I've known him since he was young, so he's like a son.

386
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:34,806
I know better than anyone that he's great and kind.

387
00:38:34,806 --> 00:38:39,644
A person like that is dating Jin Ah. I couldn't be any happier.

388
00:38:42,435 --> 00:38:45,435
We have been like family.

389
00:38:45,435 --> 00:38:49,918
It seems that Jin Ah was worried we'd be shocked so she couldn't tell us.

390
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:54,017
You came here and told me yourself.

391
00:38:54,017 --> 00:38:56,187
Thank you for that.

392
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:29,120
Why aren't you talking? Where are you?

393
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:37,234
Yes, I'm with a friend.

394
00:42:38,353 --> 00:42:40,810
I haven't had much to drink.

395
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,710
Yes, I'm going to sleep at work.

396
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,347
Okay.

397
00:42:57,478 --> 00:43:02,078
You're dead if you try to hide anything from now on.

398
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:07,081
Would I have come if I was planning on doing that?

399
00:43:08,388 --> 00:43:10,188
When did it start?

400
00:43:11,578 --> 00:43:14,278
Why is that important?

401
00:43:14,278 --> 00:43:15,893
Just answer my questions.

402
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,194
With what you did, do you have the right to retort?

403
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:23,297
What did I do wrong though?

404
00:43:23,297 --> 00:43:25,045
Is it because she's your older sister?

405
00:43:25,045 --> 00:43:27,744
Would it be okay if she was your younger sister?

406
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:29,779
You just don't like the fact that it's me.

407
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,680
You're just saying no without a reason.

408
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,427
What's the reason?

409
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:36,907
Do you really not know?

410
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:39,257
I don't know.

411
00:43:39,257 --> 00:43:41,125
You crazy punk.

412
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:43,925
You know what my mom and dad think of you.

413
00:43:44,636 --> 00:43:46,836
What do they think of me?

414
00:43:48,517 --> 00:43:50,117
As a son.

415
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:53,048
You punk.

416
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:55,430
What is Yun Jin Ah to my parents?

417
00:43:57,145 --> 00:43:58,845
A daughter.

418
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,286
Then let me ask you this.

419
00:44:01,286 --> 00:44:03,186
What is Gyeong Seon to them?

420
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:09,691
The fact that we're not blood-related or that there are no legal issues means nothing to us!

421
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:12,138
Why does it have to be Yun Jin Ah?

422
00:44:12,138 --> 00:44:14,417
Do you really have no one else to date?

423
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:18,217
You're surrounded by women, so why does it have to be Yun Jin Ah?

424
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:21,708
- It's because it's Yun Jin Ah.
- Gosh.

425
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,548
Are you kidding me?

426
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,860
Does it seem like I'm kidding?

427
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:33,138
Fine, you can say all the crap you want. Let's see if you two will work out.

428
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:40,629
No matter what you say, I won't give up.

429
00:44:41,868 --> 00:44:44,667
I can never give up on Yun Jin Ah.

430
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,728
That's what I came to tell you.

431
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:51,968
Hey... do you think Gyeong Seon will understand this?

432
00:44:51,968 --> 00:44:54,411
Do you think she'll accept this?

433
00:44:54,411 --> 00:44:55,770
If she can't, then she can't.

434
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,641
Wow, seriously.

435
00:44:57,641 --> 00:44:59,741
You've gone totally insane.

436
00:45:00,612 --> 00:45:02,912
What are you two planning to do?

437
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,471
Are you worried about us?

438
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:10,172
Bullsh*t, you crazy punk.

439
00:45:14,572 --> 00:45:18,872
Whatever it is, I'll accept all of it. Just say it to me.

440
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,619
I'm asking you this favor.

441
00:45:25,995 --> 00:45:29,094
Don't make your sister waver.

442
00:45:58,638 --> 00:46:00,587
Are you going straight to school?

443
00:46:00,588 --> 00:46:02,088
Hey.

444
00:46:03,244 --> 00:46:06,644
If you're going to hit me, let's go somewhere quiet.

445
00:46:07,444 --> 00:46:09,344
You crazy punk.

446
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:13,984
If you make things hard for Yun Jin Ah, I'll really kill you.

447
00:46:15,007 --> 00:46:17,343
I won't be dying at your hands then.

448
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:20,542
Don't smile. Do you really want to get hit?

449
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:21,987
No.

450
00:46:22,677 --> 00:46:25,178
Gosh, this crazy idiot.

451
00:46:25,178 --> 00:46:28,077
Seung Ho. Seung Ho.

452
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:29,578
Hey.

453
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:32,409
Oh my.

454
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:36,049
- You came instead of your mom.
- Yes.

455
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:39,750
He was drinking so much on his own, so I called.

456
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,800
Oh, gosh.

457
00:46:42,831 --> 00:46:45,931
Dad. Dad.

458
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:49,822
Were you here alone? Get up.

459
00:46:49,822 --> 00:46:52,218
- My daughter's here.
- Why did you drink so much?

460
00:46:52,218 --> 00:46:54,718
Why are you sleeping?

461
00:46:54,718 --> 00:46:56,546
Let's go.

462
00:47:02,764 --> 00:47:05,764
- Is something wrong?
- What's wrong, Dad?

463
00:47:06,542 --> 00:47:08,042
Well?

464
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:10,028
No, nothing.

465
00:47:10,846 --> 00:47:13,846
I'm happy. It's because I'm happy.

466
00:47:13,846 --> 00:47:16,364
My daughter...

467
00:47:16,364 --> 00:47:20,035
I'm so happy to see my daughters.

468
00:47:20,036 --> 00:47:22,550
Dad is...

469
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,116
very...

470
00:47:24,822 --> 00:47:29,321
Okay, let's just get going. Mom is going to nag you.

471
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:31,227
Seriously.

472
00:47:31,227 --> 00:47:34,101
He had three bottles.

473
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,500
Be careful.

474
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,687
- I'm fine.
- Be careful.

475
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:41,489
- Be careful over there.
- Okay.

476
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,942
That ridiculous man!

477
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:56,002
I can't tell if he's upset or happy.

478
00:47:56,002 --> 00:47:57,180
Dad, Dad.

479
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,750
What should I do?

480
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:02,458
You're crazy. You're crazy! What are you doing at this hour?

481
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:06,639
Oh! My wife!

482
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,944
Oh, the alcohol! Just how much did he drink?

483
00:48:10,945 --> 00:48:12,560
My goodness.

484
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,960
Hey!

485
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,900
Hey!

486
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:21,886
I'll be good.

487
00:48:21,886 --> 00:48:24,784
Yes, I'm good.

488
00:48:24,784 --> 00:48:27,684
I'll be good, okay?

489
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:32,103
He's going to fall. Dad!

490
00:48:32,103 --> 00:48:34,864
What is wrong with him?

491
00:48:34,864 --> 00:48:37,040
Where did Dad go today?

492
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:41,541
He kept his mouth sealed about it. Who did he meet?

493
00:48:43,277 --> 00:48:46,277
Why is he acting like that?

494
00:48:50,813 --> 00:48:52,313
Yes?

495
00:48:59,732 --> 00:49:02,988
It is true that there's a questionnaire being given to the female employees.

496
00:49:02,988 --> 00:49:06,088
They haven't been submitted to the chairman yet.

497
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:13,107
Why would you make this mess? Goodness.

498
00:49:13,107 --> 00:49:17,576
When we have our usual company dinners or whatever,

499
00:49:17,576 --> 00:49:21,399
do everything with moderation, okay? And respect each other.

500
00:49:21,399 --> 00:49:23,399
Wouldn't that be nice?

501
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:26,568
Yet, you cross the line every time you drink...

502
00:49:27,642 --> 00:49:31,242
Can't you do anything in moderation?

503
00:49:32,813 --> 00:49:37,213
Even with the business trip, I asked you nicely.

504
00:49:37,213 --> 00:49:41,049
Since they are people I know, show that you care.

505
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:43,500
Just show them your sincerity.

506
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,349
Share a meal together, wish them well, that's all.

507
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:51,360
That's all I asked for.

508
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,900
No, that was...

509
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,300
What will you do, Senior Manager Gong?

510
00:49:56,556 --> 00:50:00,808
Director, I can take responsibility for the other things.

511
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:04,447
But for the business trip, you told me to focus on the entertainment.

512
00:50:04,447 --> 00:50:07,247
That's why I did that to Section Chief Yun.

513
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:09,641
Why would you say it like that?

514
00:50:10,527 --> 00:50:14,427
Did I tell you to go with her?

515
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:17,478
I didn't even bring up the letter 'Y' in Yun Jin Ah.

516
00:50:17,478 --> 00:50:19,778
Be careful what you say.

517
00:50:23,618 --> 00:50:26,118
What's the vibe among the female employees?

518
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:30,678
They seem taken aback since it's an unfamiliar process.

519
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:34,677
Right. Then it will be hard to get a proper response from them.

520
00:50:34,677 --> 00:50:38,667
There are those who are actively partaking in it.

521
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:40,667
Like you, Manager Jeong.

522
00:50:43,226 --> 00:50:46,827
I have only been an observer.

523
00:50:46,827 --> 00:50:49,859
You're the person I fear the most in the company.

524
00:50:51,219 --> 00:50:53,119
It's an honor.

525
00:50:59,493 --> 00:51:02,793
Hello. Did you visit that store?

526
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,611
Oh, is it like that there?

527
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:08,307
I should visit sometime.

528
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:41,533
You're dining out alone? Am I paying you too much?

529
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,792
Are you worried about something, Senior Manager?

530
00:51:57,793 --> 00:51:59,493
Yes.

531
00:52:00,405 --> 00:52:02,805
No worries at all.

532
00:52:03,452 --> 00:52:05,013
- Dong Wu.
- Yes?

533
00:52:05,014 --> 00:52:08,814
Have you heard anything from the female employees lately?

534
00:52:08,814 --> 00:52:10,352
Didn't you know?

535
00:52:10,353 --> 00:52:14,353
They don't even look at the male employees these days.

536
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,590
Oh, yes.

537
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:39,400
Hey, there.

538
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:45,570
When you're finished here do you want to get dinner?

539
00:52:46,278 --> 00:52:48,778
Okay.

540
00:52:50,476 --> 00:52:52,426
Why did he show up there?

541
00:52:52,426 --> 00:52:54,785
He wants to buy me dinner.

542
00:52:55,536 --> 00:52:57,975
So will you go?

543
00:52:57,976 --> 00:53:01,645
It seems like he has something to tell me.

544
00:53:01,646 --> 00:53:03,325
Tell you what?

545
00:53:03,326 --> 00:53:06,125
Forget it. Just say no.

546
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:09,227
How can I do that?

547
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:12,015
Why do you keep getting angry?

548
00:53:12,016 --> 00:53:14,846
How can I not get angry when you're with that pervert?

549
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:19,047
All right. I'll end things early.

550
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:21,125
You refuse to say you won't go though.

551
00:53:21,126 --> 00:53:23,626
You never listen.

552
00:53:23,626 --> 00:53:27,277
Don't go far then. Text me the address.

553
00:53:27,277 --> 00:53:29,477
I don't have a cell phone.

554
00:53:30,485 --> 00:53:33,485
Okay, I'll figure out a way to do it.

555
00:53:33,485 --> 00:53:36,427
I told you I would buy you one.

556
00:53:37,056 --> 00:53:40,757
Do you have to pick on me again?

557
00:53:40,757 --> 00:53:43,510
I said, "Okay."

558
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:45,278
Yes.

559
00:53:46,425 --> 00:53:49,425
Gosh, really.

560
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:58,067
I really should buy you a meal.

561
00:53:58,067 --> 00:54:00,665
- Eat this. Go on and eat.
- Okay.

562
00:54:00,665 --> 00:54:04,401
- You should eat, too.
- Okay.

563
00:54:08,525 --> 00:54:11,781
- Aren't you going to drink?
- What?

564
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:14,134
Do you want a drink, Section Chief Yun?

565
00:54:14,135 --> 00:54:17,817
No, I'm fine. I just noticed that you weren't drinking.

566
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:21,518
Well, I don't feel like it either.

567
00:54:29,306 --> 00:54:34,206
Did Director Nam send you here?

568
00:54:34,206 --> 00:54:36,557
No! Why would he?

569
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:41,221
I kept thinking that I should treat you to a meal.

570
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:43,421
And I happened to have some time today.

571
00:54:43,422 --> 00:54:49,322
Also, you worked so hard on the business trip, so...

572
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:56,665
Well...

573
00:54:56,665 --> 00:54:58,000
Go on.

574
00:54:58,001 --> 00:55:00,201
It's nothing, really.

575
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:05,428
I heard they're doing a questionnaire just for the female employees.

576
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:08,993
Yes, I got one, too.

577
00:55:08,994 --> 00:55:10,105
Oh.

578
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:14,906
So did you write something, too?

579
00:55:14,906 --> 00:55:18,857
No, I don't think I'll write anything.

580
00:55:21,054 --> 00:55:23,667
There's just too much to write.

581
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:29,216
I'm not good at writing, so I think that I'll just say it.

582
00:55:29,217 --> 00:55:31,217
Right.

583
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:50,712
- I'll be in the restroom.
- Yes.

584
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:54,213
- It looks like it's burning.
- Yes.

585
00:56:14,262 --> 00:56:16,762
Were you that worried about me?

586
00:56:16,762 --> 00:56:19,217
You didn't have to come.

587
00:56:19,217 --> 00:56:23,286
Is that why you sent the address and the number of this place?

588
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:26,611
I came because I missed you.

589
00:56:26,612 --> 00:56:28,984
It's getting late.

590
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,883
- I'm going to go sit beside you.
- What?

591
00:56:31,884 --> 00:56:35,184
Why don't we both die, seriously?

592
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:38,817
I hate seeing you sitting across from him. How can I hold back?

593
00:56:38,818 --> 00:56:42,517
I'm leaving soon. Hold back. You have to, okay?

594
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:45,059
I'll see.

595
00:56:46,322 --> 00:56:50,322
You better listen to me while I'm asking nicely.

596
00:56:53,474 --> 00:56:55,075
Geez.

597
00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:05,187
Thank you for the meal today.

598
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,152
Oh, this was nothing. No need to thank me.

599
00:57:07,152 --> 00:57:09,743
I'll buy you something better and more expensive next time.

600
00:57:09,744 --> 00:57:12,323
No, it's okay.

601
00:57:12,324 --> 00:57:16,125
This is burdensome and more than enough.

602
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,732
Section Chief Yun.

603
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:24,400
I have to look to the bosses and try to please everyone while working.

604
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,000
I can't only think of one person's side.

605
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:31,403
So by any chance...

606
00:57:32,503 --> 00:57:36,352
if I did something to upset you while we worked together...

607
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:38,611
try to understand me.

608
00:57:38,612 --> 00:57:41,312
Let it go, if you resent something.

609
00:57:42,813 --> 00:57:47,930
It's a little surprising that you're suddenly acting like this.

610
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:52,142
Honestly, you're the one who changed suddenly.

611
00:57:52,143 --> 00:57:54,312
I'm not the only one who feels that way.

612
00:57:54,313 --> 00:57:58,914
You seem like a different person. Haven't you heard that from others?

613
00:57:59,853 --> 00:58:03,113
- I have heard that.
- Do you see?

614
00:58:03,114 --> 00:58:05,913
Now that it came up, tell me why.

615
00:58:05,913 --> 00:58:09,533
Why have you changed so much?

616
00:58:12,315 --> 00:58:16,315
It's because I want to help someone.

617
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:24,163
All this time...

618
00:58:24,163 --> 00:58:28,067
I didn't realize how precious I was.

619
00:58:28,068 --> 00:58:33,004
But there's someone who cherishes me more than I cherish myself.

620
00:58:33,005 --> 00:58:38,962
This person works so hard to protect me, and when I saw that...

621
00:58:38,963 --> 00:58:42,663
I thought to myself that I have to help this person.

622
00:58:43,538 --> 00:58:48,944
Then this person wouldn't have to worry so much and can be at ease.

623
00:58:48,945 --> 00:58:53,445
I need to get better at protecting myself.

624
00:59:14,032 --> 00:59:16,932
Oh, I used your phone, Dad.

625
00:59:16,934 --> 00:59:19,034
Mine is broken.

626
00:59:19,034 --> 00:59:21,509
You should fix it or buy a new one.

627
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:23,910
Yes, I'm going to buy one.

628
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:26,986
Are you feeling better?

629
00:59:26,987 --> 00:59:29,279
I heard you were in bed all day because of your hangover.

630
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,480
I'm all better now.

631
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,040
That's a relief.

632
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,884
What is it? Do you have something to tell me?

633
00:59:36,884 --> 00:59:38,626
No.

634
00:59:39,657 --> 00:59:41,654
I'm okay with anything, so tell me.

635
00:59:41,655 --> 00:59:46,655
Whatever it is, I'm ready to hear it.

636
00:59:46,655 --> 00:59:48,904
No need to be ready for anything.

637
00:59:48,905 --> 00:59:52,505
I told you last time.

638
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,695
Wait a little bit.

639
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,500
Not yet.

640
00:59:57,108 --> 00:59:59,008
It's not the time.

641
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:03,164
Okay, talk when you're ready.

642
01:00:07,105 --> 01:00:09,304
I'll get going.

643
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:51,190
Dang it!

644
01:01:08,327 --> 01:01:10,187
Why are you going that way?

645
01:01:10,188 --> 01:01:12,406
There is a store at the intersection over there.

646
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:14,907
I need to bring my car.

647
01:01:33,938 --> 01:01:36,138
Your cell phone...

648
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:39,866
If it weren't for the registration of your cell phone,

649
01:01:39,866 --> 01:01:42,729
you wouldn't have even called me, right?

650
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:45,404
Isn't that the normal thing to do?

651
01:01:45,405 --> 01:01:49,605
Why? Are you scared that your young boyfriend will get jealous?

652
01:01:51,956 --> 01:01:54,540
Don't talk about him.

653
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:58,141
Can't I even talk about him?

654
01:01:58,141 --> 01:02:01,120
What's so great about him? Just how great is he?

655
01:02:01,121 --> 01:02:03,221
Is he a rich heir?

656
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:08,733
How could you date your younger brother's friend even if you're crazy about men?

657
01:02:09,454 --> 01:02:11,183
They'll close soon.

658
01:02:11,184 --> 01:02:14,385
I'm in a rush. Can you please go?

659
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:30,300
♫ Baby, save the last dance for me, save ♫

660
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:36,170
♫ Save it, save ♫

661
01:02:37,735 --> 01:02:39,735
Jun Hui.

662
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,240
Jun Hui.

663
01:02:57,193 --> 01:03:00,193
Jun Hui, it's me.

664
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:04,520
I had your cell phone.

665
01:03:04,521 --> 01:03:08,222
I suddenly thought of something I wanted to say to you.

666
01:03:09,722 --> 01:03:11,622
Thank you...

667
01:03:13,005 --> 01:03:18,005
for cherishing me and loving me so much.

668
01:03:18,938 --> 01:03:21,718
I never thought...

669
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:25,519
I would be so loved by someone.

670
01:03:26,697 --> 01:03:29,176
You wouldn't know

671
01:03:29,177 --> 01:03:33,645
just how thankful I am.

672
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:36,846
and how happy I am right now.

673
01:03:38,978 --> 01:03:42,378
I'm learning a lot too.

674
01:03:42,378 --> 01:03:44,442
Love...

675
01:03:45,394 --> 01:03:49,294
is unlimited and generous.

676
01:03:49,294 --> 01:03:55,699
It's when you give your everything for that one person.

677
01:03:57,226 --> 01:04:01,525
So when you love...

678
01:04:02,365 --> 01:04:05,765
do it like Seo Jun Hui.

679
01:04:05,765 --> 01:04:07,695
Jun Hui.

680
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:13,527
I love you...

681
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:17,260
very much.

682
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:22,722
I'll love you for a long, long time.

Jun Hui.

692

Stop the car now!

01:05:53,764 --> 01:05:56,964

D-Don't do this.

01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:12,942
Gyu Min.

708
01:07:12,943 --> 01:07:16,143
Please don't do this, okay?

709
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,759
What are you planning to do?

710
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,310
What is it that you want?

711
01:07:23,311 --> 01:07:26,511
I'm going to die.

712

I'm going to die with you.

Move, move!

714
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:36,979
Move out of the way.

715
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,160
♫ My soul ♫

♫ Giving all ♫

718
01:08:09,925 --> 01:08:12,596
I just knew that something happened.

719
01:08:12,597 --> 01:08:14,186
I really hoped that I was wrong.

720
01:08:14,186 --> 01:08:16,144
Yun Jin Ah, where are you!

721
01:08:16,145 --> 01:08:17,715
I regretted it so much.

722
01:08:17,716 --> 01:08:20,788
I should've picked her up. I shouldn't have left her alone.

723
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:23,185
Suppose it was our family.

724
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:25,613
Would you want to marry Jin Ah to a family like that?

725
01:08:25,614 --> 01:08:27,593
I want to be more bold.

726
01:08:27,594 --> 01:08:30,358
Let's not get caught.

727
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:31,483
Let's reveal it ourselves.

728
01:08:31,484 --> 01:08:34,439
I came to meet my boyfriend.

729
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,730
Oh, I see.

730
01:08:35,731 --> 01:08:37,242
I'm dating Jun Hui.

731
01:08:37,243 --> 01:08:39,773
We couldn't stop. Jun Hui.

732
01:08:39,774 --> 01:08:41,059
I'm very sorry.

733
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,828
You must be happy.

734
01:08:42,829 --> 01:08:45,528
I am happy, very happy.

735
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:49,198
If I just hide behind you, they'll be more disappointed in me.

736
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:51,920
For a longer time...

737
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:56,820
and much more than you, I will love you.

738
01:08:56,820 --> 01:09:03,170
♫ Oh be proud of him ♫

739
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:05,450
♫ 'Cause after all, he's just a man ♫
