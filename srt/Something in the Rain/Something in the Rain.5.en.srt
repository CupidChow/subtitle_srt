1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,100
You're here.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,152
You told me to come.

3
00:00:21,923 --> 00:00:24,223
[Episode 5]

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,124
I wanted to see you so much I thought I'd die waiting.

5
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:33,220
I felt that way, too.

6
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,510
Let's go in.

7
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,100
Coffee?

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,007
Sure.

9
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,571
Why are you acting like it's your first time here?

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,585
I don't know.

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,985
Just act like you normally would.

12
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,613
Should I do that?

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,346
Give me some good coffee.

14
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,401
There's the real Jin Ah.

15
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,056
You're thinking again, right?

16
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:33,385
"Can we really do this?"

17
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,329
I tried not to look at Gyeong Seon's place in the hallway.

18
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,580
I shut my eyes tight and came here.

19
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:44,148
Gosh.

20
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,106
What we are doing reminds me

21
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:55,789
of when I was younger and our parents weren't home, we'd invite friends over.

22
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:59,889
We would do things we weren't allowed to do.

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,008
Like this?

24
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,037
You surprised me.

25
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,435
Seung Ho!

26
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,591
Is Jin Ah working today too?

27
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:32,711
I don't know if she's working or playing.

28
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:35,211
Does she ever tell us anything?

29
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:38,321
You didn't even have breakfast and now you're eating noodles.

30
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,752
It doesn't matter.

31
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:41,431
Why wouldn't it matter?

32
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:44,071
You should eat healthy food when you can.

33
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:48,271
You're the foundation and head of our family.

34
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,758
Why don't we go shopping after you're done eating?

35
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:55,821
Buy some new clothes, shoes, and anything else you need.

36
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:58,322
I was going to go to Jun Hui's.

37
00:02:58,322 --> 00:03:00,520
You're just going to play games. Why bother?

38
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,922
That doesn't help your studies at all.

39
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:04,621
You just don't know, Mom.

40
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:07,270
Do you know how smart you have to be to play games?

41
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,071
And Seo Jun Hui makes those games.

42
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:13,429
Why would he study art if he's so smart?

43
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,231
What kind of nonsense is that?

44
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:20,631
I'm saying that he's not on the same level as you, you study actual books.

45
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,205
Since he's been your friend since childhood,

46
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,804
I won't tell you to keep your distance from him.

47
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:31,150
But from now on, don't befriend people like Jun Hui.

48
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,748
You should find people who will help you in life.

49
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:35,719
Don't get flustered later on.

50
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,595
You have to prepare ahead for these things.

51
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:41,345
Thank you for the food.

52
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:44,224
You didn't finish your food!

53
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:48,286
What's with you?

54
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:56,679
You may not want to hear this now,

55
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,030
but you'll all see that I'm right.

56
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,933
Oh my!

57
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,633
It's Gyeong Seon.

58
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,804
C-Can... can you not pick up?

59
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:32,104
I think it's the second time she has called.

60
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:35,547
What were you doing?

61
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:38,045
I was talking to a work colleague.

62
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:41,545
Oh. I wanted to show you the ocean.

63
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:44,024
Ta-da!

64
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:45,265
Pretty, right?

65
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:48,466
Yes, it looks so nice.

66
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:52,036
Is something wrong? You look a little upset.

67
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:55,904
No, I'm just envious since you're at such a nice place.

68
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:58,887
We should have come together. It's your company's event, after all.

69
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:01,187
I know.

70
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:03,528
You must be outside. Where are you?

71
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:05,486
It looks very familiar.

72
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:09,818
Oh, I'm meeting someone, so I'm near my office.

73
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:11,420
It's a park... a park.

74
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,170
"Meeting someone"? Is it a man?

75
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,403
No, unfortunately.

76
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:16,771
Of course, it's a woman.

77
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:17,793
Yes.

78
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:22,092
Your unnie will only be staying for a night, so don't cry while I'm gone.

79
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:23,572
Yes, Unnie!

80
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:26,773
- I will call again.
- Okay.

81
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:52,720
What's wrong?

82
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,923
I... need to use the bathroom.

83
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,533
You went through a lot.

84
00:06:57,534 --> 00:07:05,757
♪ Nature patterned you and when she was done, ♪

85
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:12,620
♪ you were all the sweet things rolled up in one... ♪

86
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:15,521
Why is that man so relaxed?

87
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,120
He's just not showing it, but he must be very nervous.

88
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:25,519
Women get nervous, and you can see the shaking in their eyes.

89
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
They don't know what to do with their hands either.

90
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:29,072
Men don't do that.

91
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,073
It makes it seem like only the woman likes them.

92
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:36,979
If the man shows that he's nervous, the woman will feel anxious, so he hides it.

93
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,580
Then how would she know how he feels? He has to say it in words.

94
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,670
I'm sure he wants to, but...

95
00:07:48,743 --> 00:07:50,342
But what?

96
00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:54,576
Words aren't enough to explain.

97
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,811
You're slowly starting to worry, too, aren't you?

98
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,534
This is why I'm not talking about it.

99
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:08,380
What good does talking about it do?

100
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:11,581
I said no, but you ask again. You don't trust me and ask again.

101
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,820
Please just listen to me.

102
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,430
"Please just listen to me"?

103
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,130
What a rude thing to say to your noona!

104
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,185
You're my girlfriend, actually.

105
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,488
You always put me at a disadvantage.

106
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,658
I'm just speaking the truth.

107
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,459
Why? Do you want me to stay as just a younger brother?

108
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,460
Look at me.

109
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,191
No, I'm going to watch the movie.

110
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,750
But I want to look at Yun Jin Ah.

111
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:01,171
I want to hold her.

112
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,579
I want to hold Yun Jin Ah more.

It seems like a lie.

That such a beautiful woman is in front of me.

129

- Ouch...
- It seems real now, right?

130
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:18,851
You can't be serious for five minutes.

131
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:21,786
It's because I feel shy.

132
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,392
Shy about what?

133
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:27,281
I already saw everything.

134
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,981
Hey, you...

135
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Can you not go home?

136
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,340
- She's cutting half of it.
- Wow, that's amazing!

137
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,780
Do you have some type of know-how?

138
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,780
- Oh... I shouldn't say these things.
- You shouldn't?

139
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:52,304
Mom, go to your room and sleep.

140
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,958
Dad, you, too. Don't fall asleep and go inside.

141
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,610
Oh my. I fell asleep.

142
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,811
What? I wasn't sleeping at all.

143
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,824
How about a beer with my daughter?

144
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:10,655
Mom wouldn't like that. You should get to bed.

145
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:14,105
It doesn't matter what I say. Drink if you want.

146
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:16,507
No, I will gain weight if I drink late at night.

147
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:19,909
Is that why you come in drunk all the time?

148
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:21,619
Whatever. I don't care.

149
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:25,418
You two can stay up drinking if you want.

150

Hey, that is totally cheating.

♫ You've reached into my soul ♫

191
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:54,349
Dad, are you already up?

192
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:55,696
Did you go somewhere?

193
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:58,719
Yes, I went out to exercise.

194
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,051
"Exercise"?

195
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:03,239
Yes, I've been feeling so stiff lately.

196
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:06,840
I woke up and couldn't go back to sleep so I went out for air.

197
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,867
You should go out when it's brighter or go with me.

198
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:12,736
I didn't go far, just around here.

199
00:20:12,736 --> 00:20:14,637
- I'll be in my room.
- Okay.

200
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:25,200
- Hello.
- Good morning.

201
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,400
- Long time.
- Section Chief Yun.

202
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,127
Just give me a high five.

203
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:38,578
Go ahead. Good job.

204
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,990
I heard you screwed over Senior Manager Gong on the business trip.

205
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,997
What do you mean I screwed him over?

206
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:50,698
Then what is it? You don't usually back out.

207
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:54,335
What have you all been thinking about me all this time?

208
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:55,569
Loyal subject.

209
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:58,869
A person whose actions cause harm to others.

210
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:03,739
So I'm saying you did well now. I passionately welcome this side of you.

211
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:05,888
It seems like an entry into a special society.

212
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:08,528
Just know that you would never be allowed in.

213
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:10,529
I don't want to be.

214
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:11,569
I want to be in it.

215
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,670
You need to work harder to get in.

216
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,750
Section Chief Yun.

217
00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:30,235
Follow me.

218
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,400
What?

219
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:51,151
Oh.

220
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:04,200
That's not like Yun Tambourine at all.

221
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,592
She seems like a different person.

222
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,793
I know.

223
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,500
It wasn't just anyone.

224
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:20,871
They were my family. How can I face them again?

225
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:25,300
This will not end with an apology.

226
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,340
I never actually apologized.

227
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,370
Director.

228
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,310
I don't know what I did wrong.

229
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:44,299
I did everything I was supposed to do at the store.

230
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:49,900
I would like it if you'd tell me what exactly I did wrong.

231
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:55,459
That's not what we are talking about here.

232
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,150
You understand everything, so why change the subject?

233
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,670
I'm telling you that I did everything that was required of me as a supervisor.

234
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:07,171
I believe that anything beyond that isn't part of my duties.

235
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:13,295
Am I wrong to think that, Director?

236
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,600
Well, did anyone say anything about the work?

237
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,600
It's just... when people get together...

238
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:31,080
Senior Manager Gong, why did you make a mess of this?

239
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,400
It isn't your first day on the job.

240
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,981
You could just have a light lunch.

241
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:40,182
Why did you make such a big deal out of it?

242
00:23:40,182 --> 00:23:42,000
I apologize.

243
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:51,458
Hey.

244
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,800
It's easy to talk about asking someone out.

245
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,481
What kind of woman in the world, when you ask them to a meal

246
00:23:58,481 --> 00:24:01,375
would say, "I'd like that"?

247
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,176
Then ask her to buy you a meal.

248
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:07,721
Gosh, it may not work out even when I'm buying. If I ask her to buy,

249
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:10,800
she'd be more reluctant.

250
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
It worked for me.

251
00:24:13,595 --> 00:24:15,786
You're showing off again.

252
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:21,740
Don't be like that.

253
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,000
Help me out again and set us up.

254
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:27,417
It's your friend.

255
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,594
- You should head down first.
- What are you going to do...

256
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:47,900
Even if she's a friend, don't show too much interest at work.

257
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,000
I know that.

258
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,456
You're always dying to get into trouble.

259
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:55,057
I'm going.

260
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:03,155
Don't just stand there and say something.

261
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:06,335
What's the problem?

262
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:13,121
Sorry, but can I borrow your lighter?

263
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:15,951
I don't smoke.

264
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:18,040
Oh, is that right?

265
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,841
Now that I think about it, I quit smoking for a bit, too.

266
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,099
So, it is you, Noona. What are you doing here?

267
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:36,392
Anyway... do your work well, okay?

268
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:50,720
What was that about?

269
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:54,120
What's the reason?

270
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,119
Did you have lunch yet?

271
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,600
What's wrong?

272
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,700
What did you say?

273
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,900
What's with you, suddenly?

274
00:26:08,229 --> 00:26:10,978
Wow, this works really well. I couldn't hear anything.

275
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:12,620
What was he saying? I couldn't hear.

276
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,321
Seriously.

277
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:45,049
Should I make it so that pervert can't even come to work?

278
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:47,279
You can't keep letting him pick on you.

279
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,320
Who says I let him pick on me?

280
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,267
I've become so brave lately. I can win against everyone.

281
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:54,787
With earplugs?

282
00:26:54,787 --> 00:27:00,410
No, there's this cool guy who protects me.

283
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:04,210
I feel like it was worth it.

284
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:07,192
I'm going to see Gyeong Seon later today.

285
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,892
What am I supposed to do?

286
00:27:08,892 --> 00:27:11,091
She's really a bit upset.

287
00:27:11,091 --> 00:27:13,370
I kept delaying and didn't see her.

288
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,671
- Then I'm going, too.
- What?

289
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,907
I can just act well. Let's make a bet. 50,000 won or nothing.

290
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:25,615
Deal. You go first then, and I'll come later.

291
00:27:25,615 --> 00:27:27,990
Are you already laying out the bait?

292
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,490
Go.

293
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,100
You're crazy! We are at work.

294
00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:36,939
Seriously!

295
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:05,170
Why don't we just buy food? Why are you cooking?

296
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:08,971
Jin Ah goes crazy for my spicy braised chicken.

297
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:11,399
I haven't made it for her in so long.

298
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,800
This is so small.

299
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,759
Oh right. Did you leave the city?

300
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,883
I saw a receipt in the car.

301
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:23,184
It was for Yeoncheon, that place on the way to Dangjin.

302
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:26,928
But Jin Ah went there for her business trip on that day.

303
00:28:29,116 --> 00:28:31,497
I drove her there.

304
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:33,837
You? Why?

305
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,928
I couldn't think of any ideas, so I thought I'd go sketch somewhere.

306
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:40,148
And she happened to be leaving for a business trip.

307
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:42,898
Why didn't you or Jin Ah say anything?

308
00:28:42,898 --> 00:28:44,799
Since it's not really important.

309
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:50,818
You need this too, right?

310
00:28:50,818 --> 00:28:53,619
Why would you put cucumber in a stir fry?

311
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:58,441
Oh, is that right? My goodness.

312
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:11,428
You're here early.

313
00:29:11,428 --> 00:29:13,910
Yes. Where's Gyeong Seon?

314
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,211
- I'm here.
- Okay.

315
00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:20,946
Stop that.

316
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:32,985
When I went on the business trip, he drove me so he could go sketch.

317
00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:35,287
But he's a really bad driver.

318
00:29:36,132 --> 00:29:38,952
This is why you shouldn't be kind to just anyone.

319
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:42,453
Is Jin Ah just anyone? She's family.

320
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,893
I'll find someone with really, really good manners for Jin Ah.

321
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:53,193
Someone who never cheats.

322
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:57,608
You're excited just thinking about it, aren't you?

323
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:00,708
You're so happy.

324
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:04,297
I'm not kidding. I have someone in mind.

325
00:30:04,297 --> 00:30:07,034
He's a customer who comes to our store.

326
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:09,654
How well could you know a customer?

327
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:11,944
Why would you introduce her to just anyone?

328
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:17,945
No! I've seen him for a while now and he has a good job.

329
00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:22,598
Is a good job all you need? Then I guess I meet the requirement.

330
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:25,495
- Are you a man?
- Then am I a woman?

331
00:30:25,495 --> 00:30:29,600
Why are you two yelling over nothing?

332
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,424
Plus, I don't plan on dating for a while.

333
00:30:33,424 --> 00:30:37,184
Why? Because Lee Gyu Min hurt you?

334
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:39,984
You should look for a better man precisely because of that.

335
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:44,500
I know. I know that, but I'm not feeling it right now. I'll take care of it.

336
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:50,770
I doubt you will. Don't deceive yourself, I'm going to take care of it this time. You just wait.

337
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:54,508
- Where are you going?
- Jeez.

338
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:55,827
To get more alcohol.

339
00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:58,828
Bring lots.

340
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:03,341
I'll follow him and steal lots.

341
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,942
You're so smart, Jin Ah.

342
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:09,814
50,000 won.

343
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,000
Why not just tell her that we are in that kind of relationship?

344
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,503
What am I supposed to do when it makes me angry?

345
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:21,604
Already? Over this?

346
00:31:21,604 --> 00:31:23,953
And you want me to trust you.

347
00:31:23,953 --> 00:31:26,014
That's not the same thing.

348
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:30,076
Is it right to do nothing when my girlfriend might date another guy...

349
00:31:30,076 --> 00:31:34,393
- How can I stand and watch my girlfriend go on a date with–
- Did I go on a date?

350
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,995
Did I even plan a date to see someone?

351
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,570
It's all just talk... just talk.

352
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,471
I hate that, too!

353
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,636
Do you like me that much?

354
00:31:50,637 --> 00:31:52,037
Yes.

355
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:57,371
Mister Seo Jun Hui.

356
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:01,019
I do trust you.

357
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:03,807
I will always trust you.

358
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:08,907
So let's not get shaken up by the small things, okay?

359
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:11,509
Let's be like pros, okay?

360
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:13,594
Yes.

361
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,830
You better not do that again in front of Gyeong Seon.

362
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,530
All right.

363
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,780
I can't with you.

364
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:30,244
It's here.

365
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:34,581
- Get in, Jin Ah.
- Okay.

366
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,100
The food was so good today, Gyeong Seon.

367
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,301
Thanks. Bye.

368
00:32:42,301 --> 00:32:45,391
- Call me once you get home.
- Okay.

369
00:32:45,391 --> 00:32:46,842
Have a safe trip.

370
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:50,141
- Driver, please take her home safely.
- I will.

371
00:32:52,741 --> 00:32:54,641
Let's go inside.

372
00:33:02,907 --> 00:33:05,107
I'm going to buy cigarettes.

373
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,015
Don't you dare bring up acting or betting again.

374
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:20,778
I won't bet 50,000 won or 100,000 won.

375
00:33:20,778 --> 00:33:24,133
What do you mean why? It's no fun if I always win.

376
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:26,734
You won't give me the money, either.

377
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,280
Don't laugh.

378
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:34,779
What was that expression on your face when I was getting in the taxi? Gyeong Seon was watching.

379
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,592
Whatever the case...

380
00:33:38,403 --> 00:33:40,203
The side road?

381
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:43,278
Why do you want me to get off there?

382
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:45,078
Where are you?

383
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:53,862
Mister, you take credit cards, right?

384
00:33:53,862 --> 00:33:57,762
- Yes. Do you need a receipt?
- No, it's okay.

385
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:04,400
Yes, I got off.

386
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:06,999
Where are you?

387
00:34:15,817 --> 00:34:17,817
You can see me?

388
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:34,173
I know my beauty makes it so that you worry about me late at night,

389
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:36,660
but you're being overprotective.

390
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,761
I came to exercise because I ate so much.

391
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:45,567
Fine, I came because I wanted to walk with you.

392
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:18,547
I wanted to have my first kiss there.

393
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:20,899
Who says you get to decide?

394
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:23,200
Who said it was meant to be with you?

395
00:35:26,603 --> 00:35:30,103
It was just a joke. You should be a pro about it.

396
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:36,178
I'm used to the punches, so I don't feel anything now.

397
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:40,757
Yes, I did hit you a lot.

398
00:35:40,757 --> 00:35:42,457
It's okay.

399
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,960
I'll make you tougher from now on.

400
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,238
All right.

401
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,838
You two are so cute.

402
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:22,376
It's so good.

403
00:37:57,977 --> 00:37:59,977
Yes, hello.

404
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,340
It's for Yun Jin Ah on the twelfth floor.

405
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,108
- Hello.
- Is my package here?

406
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:10,909
Yes, all right.

407
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:15,872
Thank you.

408
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,830
[Quick Call Delivery]

409
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:24,109
Wow, love sure does move fast.
[Jin Ah, I love you. Sorry, forgive me.]

410
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:26,799
Did Yun Jin Ah change because of this?

411
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:28,629
I'm disappointed.

412
00:38:28,629 --> 00:38:30,309
Section Chief Yun is so lucky.

413
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:31,970
When will I get something like this?

414
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,740
[Yun Jin Ah]

415
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,361
Seo Jun Hee, big news.

416
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,861
You know your coffee noona downstairs?

417
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:49,821
Well, you call her noona so...

418
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:53,921
Anyway, Section Chief Yun has a boyfriend.

419
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:57,321
How do you know?

420
00:38:57,322 --> 00:38:59,500
I went downstairs.

421
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,316
About this big... No, the bouquet was this big.

422
00:39:04,316 --> 00:39:08,617
It said, "Jin Ah, I love you." Big news, right?

423
00:39:16,255 --> 00:39:19,555
Hey, where are you going?

424
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,626
Seo Jun Hui.

425
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:24,298
Besides what I have already mentioned,

426
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:27,099
some revisions were made to the materials.

427
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,750
So please look over it again.

428
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,262
Also, when you hire new part-time employees

429
00:39:32,262 --> 00:39:35,988
please make sure that they come to the head office for basic training.

430
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:38,488
We will check on that, so please make sure to do so.

431
00:39:38,488 --> 00:39:41,260
- Yes.
- Thank you for coming.

432
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,960
Thank you!

433
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:54,305
If you don't have lunch plans, please have lunch with me.

434
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:56,857
I'll get indigestion if I eat with a work superior.

435
00:39:56,857 --> 00:39:59,757
- Let's have a cup of tea instead.
- Okay.

436
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:13,325
Seo Jun Hui.

437
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:15,030
Oh, hello.

438
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:18,332
- What are you doing?
- What?

439
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,290
What are you doing here, Noona?

440
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:24,417
I came by for training and Section Chief Kang wanted to have some tea.

441
00:40:24,418 --> 00:40:25,918
Oh.

442
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,488
Did you two plan this?

443
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:30,100
What?

444
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,154
Oh! Gosh, no.

445
00:40:32,154 --> 00:40:34,974
Oh no! What do you mean? Not at all.

446
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,925
I had pure intentions.

447
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:41,226
I only said it to be funny, but you're taking it so seriously.

448
00:40:41,226 --> 00:40:43,372
Hey, how did you know I'd be coming?

449
00:40:43,373 --> 00:40:45,073
I didn't know.

450
00:40:45,073 --> 00:40:47,674
I was going to ask Jin Ah for coffee.

451
00:40:47,674 --> 00:40:50,272
I forgot that she wasn't in the office.

452
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:53,373
Can I join my sister and get a coffee, too?

453
00:40:53,373 --> 00:40:55,307
Oh, of course.

454
00:40:55,308 --> 00:40:57,407
Of course!

455
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:10,184
What's up with you? You're hanging out with me.

456
00:41:10,185 --> 00:41:12,685
I'm just a thirsty guy getting some free water.

457
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:21,904
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

458
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,020
What's wrong?

459
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,889
That's the franchisee for the Suseo-dong store.

460
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,836
Seo Jun Hui's sister.

461
00:41:34,836 --> 00:41:37,877
Seems like Kang Se Yeong is moving ahead with her plan.

462
00:41:37,877 --> 00:41:41,177
Soon enough, their families will be meeting here.

463
00:41:46,785 --> 00:41:48,885
Take a look at this.

464
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:58,677
I'm not the type to change people or products easily.

465
00:41:58,677 --> 00:42:00,932
If you say it like that,

466
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:04,549
I'll feel like I brought you here to make you buy things.

467
00:42:04,549 --> 00:42:06,649
Since they're newly imported products,

468
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,749
I just wanted to show them to you for future reference.

469
00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:13,600
You looked like you had a sense of humor and wouldn't be like this,

470
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,700
but you take jokes so seriously.

471
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,243
Oh...

472
00:42:18,243 --> 00:42:22,366
I'm usually really good at taking jokes.

473
00:42:22,366 --> 00:42:26,715
I think I still find you a bit difficult to figure out.

474
00:42:26,715 --> 00:42:30,407
Can't we meet more often to get comfortable with each other?

475
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,000
Didn't you come here for the coffee?

476
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,800
Oh, I was thinking about work.

477
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,836
- I think I have to go up.
- Already?

478
00:42:43,837 --> 00:42:47,832
The two of you can take more time and talk.

479
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:49,763
I always see him at home anyways.

480
00:42:49,764 --> 00:42:52,568
- Go up then.
- Thanks for the coffee.

481
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:54,369
See you at home.

482
00:43:00,472 --> 00:43:02,332
I'll give you a tip.

483
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:06,833
Seo Jun Hui is not an easy guy.

484
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,510
He's not an easy person.

485
00:43:14,351 --> 00:43:16,051
Oh.

486
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,499
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

487
00:43:23,071 --> 00:43:25,680
How much are broken cups worth that you put money back in?

488
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,681
Don't do that again.

489
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:30,299
No, you shouldn't do this. It was my personal mistake.

490
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:32,283
Just listen to me, okay?

491
00:43:32,283 --> 00:43:37,583
I feel bad enough about you working here. How much could it be?

492
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:39,763
You weren't hurt, right?

493
00:43:39,763 --> 00:43:41,422
You know I'm strong.

494
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:43,334
I know that very well.

495
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:44,988
- Hello.
- Yes. Hi.

496
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:47,638
- Section Chief.
- You must be tired. Why did you come?

497
00:43:47,638 --> 00:43:50,759
You're going to the company dinner, aren't you? Let's go together.

498
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:52,799
I'm not going to the company dinner.

499
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:55,740
Why? Have you really changed?

500
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:59,399
What change? I have somewhere to be.

501
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,199
Gosh, then I better not go, either.

502
00:44:02,902 --> 00:44:05,508
This is why subordinates need to get scolded.

503
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,709
Why are you talking back?

504
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,278
You have to go get your flowers anyway, don't you?

505
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:10,678
What flowers?

506
00:44:10,678 --> 00:44:13,788
Haven't you seen it yet? I sent you a picture.

507
00:44:13,788 --> 00:44:17,888
Right, you can't use your phone here.

508
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,368
Your boyfriend sent you a very big bouquet of flowers.

509
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:22,485
- Look.
- "Boyfriend"?

510
00:44:22,485 --> 00:44:23,852
Pretty, right?

511
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:28,152
The employees were going nuts. Look, he says he loves you.

512
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:35,375
- You brought your car, right?
- "Car"?

513
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:36,975
Section Chief Yun...

514
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,265
Oh.

515
00:45:08,265 --> 00:45:09,695
Where was it?

516
00:45:09,695 --> 00:45:11,795
It was right here.

517
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:47,240
[Control Center]

518
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,530
[Jin Ah, I love you. I'm sorry, forgive me.]

519
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:28,627
[Jin Ah, I was wrong. I'm sorry. I must've gone crazy for a bit...]

520
00:46:33,174 --> 00:46:35,900
How do we kill him?

521
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,000
Should we report him for stalking?

522
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:44,690
Do you know where he lives?

523
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:53,555
What is it?

524
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,499
Is everyone here?

525
00:46:58,181 --> 00:47:02,381
Chairman Jo is coming today, so no one can miss it.

526
00:47:03,299 --> 00:47:06,799
Section Chief Yun, do you understand?

527
00:47:09,277 --> 00:47:11,320
Hurry, let's go.

528
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,850
Yes, Sir.

529
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,700
Section Chief Yun.

530
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,602
Yun Jin Ah.

531
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,900
What are you doing? Come here.

532
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:44,100
- I will do it.
- Ye Eun, sit down.

533
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:50,700
Give it to me. I'll do it. I'll do it.

534
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,800
Why are you just watching?

535
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,000
What are you doing when Chairman Jo is here?

536
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:01,430
Chairman Jo, I know that this may not be the right time.

537
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:04,492
But the employees have become so undisciplined lately.

538
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:08,593
This is not an organization, but individuals acting on their own.

539
00:48:08,593 --> 00:48:10,099
That's right.

540
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,100
As I told you about the work that was handled...

541
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,627
How should I put it? An organization is...

542
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,628
Things should proceed properly.

543
00:48:19,628 --> 00:48:22,399
So what is it that you want done?

544
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:26,362
So... what is it?

545
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,868
In settings like this...

546
00:48:28,868 --> 00:48:32,538
there should be courtesy given for an order from a work superior.

547
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:34,839
Kim Dong Wu!

548
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:36,943
Yes, Manager Jung.

549
00:48:40,214 --> 00:48:41,702
Come here and serve.

550
00:48:41,702 --> 00:48:44,303
Yes, I'm coming.

551
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:59,100
Is this the kind of order you're referring to?

552
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,290
Please cut it!

553
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:19,640
[Hwang Geum Jeong]

554
00:49:21,347 --> 00:49:23,947
Oh my! Manager Jeong.

555
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,550
You rebelled once and now you've become bold.

556
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,839
Sorry, I have an urgent matter.

557
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,239
- You should go.
- Manager Jeong.

558
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:38,459
About earlier...

559
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:43,099
I'm more thankful that you didn't act like you usually would.

560
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,513
I just realized how pathetic I used to be.

561
00:49:48,513 --> 00:49:50,813
You were a bit much.

562
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:54,199
I'm reflecting on my mistakes.

563
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,299
Better late than never. You're doing well.

564
00:49:59,674 --> 00:50:01,638
You're dating, right?

565
00:50:01,638 --> 00:50:02,747
Pardon?

566
00:50:02,748 --> 00:50:05,048
You look prettier these days.

567
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,900
I drove him home once when he was drunk, but I don't know if he still lives here.

568
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,830
He must've been really drunk for you to drive him home.

569
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,269
Do you think I wanted to?

570
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:35,800
- Yun Jin Ah insisted I do it.
- Don't talk about it.

571
00:50:35,801 --> 00:50:37,801
I'm getting more annoyed.

572
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,419
It's here.

573
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,207
Hey, don't hit him.

574
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:57,499
I just don't want there to be any issues.

575
00:50:57,499 --> 00:50:59,832
Just talk about it.

576
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:32,033
This guy is a crazy punk.

577
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,500
Hey, what are you two doing!

578
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,807
You perverted punk!

579
00:51:49,808 --> 00:51:52,008
"Pervert"? What?

580
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,175
Do you want to die?

581
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,631
I told you to stop!

582
00:52:05,632 --> 00:52:08,033
What are you doing?

583
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,484
Hey!

584
00:52:11,484 --> 00:52:12,587
Are you crazy?

585
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,988
I told you to stay away from Yun Jin Ah.

586
00:52:14,988 --> 00:52:17,789
What is it to either of you?

587
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:23,500
Hey.

588
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,799
Report us.

589
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:28,699
Forced entry and destruction of personal property.

590
00:52:28,699 --> 00:52:33,199
I'll report you for the same thing, as well as sexual assault and stalking.

591
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,681
"Sexual assault"?

592
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:38,995
What did you do to my sister? Tell me!

593
00:52:38,996 --> 00:52:40,379
Seung Ho, what happened was...

594
00:52:40,379 --> 00:52:42,980
You shouldn't have done it, you punk!

595
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:09,999
Are you okay?

596
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:13,500
It's just a scratch.

597
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,900
What's this about sexual assault?

598
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,200
Did Yun Jin Ah really get assaulted?

599
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,999
He came to the store and created a scene.

600
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:24,399
Isn't it obvious?

601
00:53:24,399 --> 00:53:27,054
Oh, gosh...

602
00:53:27,054 --> 00:53:31,866
Shouldn't we just hand him over to the police? What if he does it again?

603
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,899
- We won't let him.
- How?

604
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:41,500
I was barely able to make time today. I have to head down now.

605
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,630
I'll keep an eye on her.

606
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,050
Hey.

607
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:46,353
It isn't like you have nothing else to do.

608
00:53:46,353 --> 00:53:49,400
Jeez, Yun Jin Ah.

609
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,399
Don't do that.

610
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:56,199
Why? I'm going to lecture her to get it together.

611
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,899
That punk's the one that needs to get it together, why bother an innocent person?

612
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,125
Just pretend you don't know.

613
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:07,526
Don't stress her out anymore.

614
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,399
All right?

615
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,600
Do you understand?

616
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,799
People would think that you were her younger brother.

617
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,400
Jeez, Yun Jin Ah... always getting into trouble. Gosh.

618
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:01,499
Yes, Gyeong Seon. Where are you?

619
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:06,000
Oh, you're home. What are you doing?

620
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,699
Drinking? With whom?

621
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,800
Alone.

622
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,199
Why? Are you going to come?

623
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,499
Do you miss me already?

624
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,900
Yes, I'm going to Jun Hui's place to steal some beer.

625
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,200
Yes.

626
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,600
You should come if you want to.

627
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:46,999
What?

628
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:50,300
Talk a little louder.

629
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,976
What?

630
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:54,780
Where are you calling from?

631
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:59,178
I'm still working.

632
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:02,080
I'm at work. Work.

633
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,399
You're at the office?

634
00:57:04,399 --> 00:57:08,849
Goodness. Why are you working all night?

635
00:57:08,849 --> 00:57:12,000
I suppose you're not the only one.

636
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:17,400
Is this guy not home yet or did he come and leave?

637
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,320
He's always telling me he's working late at night,

638
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,421
but I think he's secretly dating.

639
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:28,199
Did you not get that feeling from Jun Hui?

640
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:35,100
Hello? Hello?

641
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,020
Yun Jin Ah!

642
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,589

643
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:09,340
♫ I feel you now from here ♫

644

♫ Our time is not done yet ♫

645
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,830
♫ You've given me my fullest heart ♫

646
00:58:18,835 --> 00:58:21,080
Where are you? Are you busy?

647
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,961
You're not picking up.

648
00:58:22,962 --> 00:58:27,327
Why aren't you picking up? Pick up your phone.

649
00:58:27,327 --> 00:58:29,727
I'll go over to your place now.

650
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:45,830
♫ I'm breathing through you now ♫

♫ I never thought that I could need someone ♫

653
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:01,892
Is someone chasing you?

654
00:59:01,892 --> 00:59:03,616
What are you doing at my house?

655
00:59:03,616 --> 00:59:05,616
"Your house"?

656
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,942
Are we strangers or something?

657
00:59:09,773 --> 00:59:11,399
I'm tired. Hurry and leave.

658
00:59:11,399 --> 00:59:14,399
Let me finish this one first.

659
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:21,718
Take that. Take that and... take all of this, drink up, and go to sleep.

660
00:59:21,718 --> 00:59:24,770
No, thanks. I only want this one.

661
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:30,560
Can't I just quickly finish drinking this here?

662
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,360
My little brother.

663
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:36,459
Okay, okay. Why do you look so upset?

664
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:39,960
Don't take it out on me. You're dead tomorrow!

665
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,988
You're seriously so petty.

666
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,946
Bye. Good night.

What's wrong?

670
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,068
Why are you crying?

671
01:00:28,068 --> 01:00:32,302
- Did something happen?
- My legs are so cramped that I can't get up...

674
01:00:39,234 --> 01:00:40,735
Come here.

675
01:00:45,073 --> 01:00:47,095
Ouch.

676
01:00:47,095 --> 01:00:49,600
Ouch, it hurts.

677
01:00:51,802 --> 01:00:53,979
What took you so long?

678
01:00:53,979 --> 01:00:56,380
Sorry, sorry.

679
01:00:58,118 --> 01:00:59,818
Sorry.

680
01:01:01,922 --> 01:01:03,822
Gosh.

681
01:01:11,399 --> 01:01:14,470
You should have gone home. Why did you come here?

682
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,271
Did you miss me that much?

683
01:01:17,271 --> 01:01:21,219
I saw everything on the CCTV.

684
01:01:25,499 --> 01:01:28,000
What did you do with the flowers?

685
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,200
I threw them out.

686
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,539
"Threw them out"? Where?

687
01:01:36,399 --> 01:01:39,300
Why? Do you want them?

688
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,020
Yes, I want them so much that I could die.

689

♫ Study everything about you ♫

690
01:01:51,736 --> 01:01:55,335
I didn't think it would do you any good to see it, so I got rid of it.

691
01:01:56,109 --> 01:01:58,109
I thought you'd understand.

692
01:02:00,221 --> 01:02:02,521
I do understand.

693
01:02:02,521 --> 01:02:05,321
I'm thankful too.

694
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:09,200
But I didn't want you to see it either.

695
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,031
It's better if only I see it.

696
01:02:12,031 --> 01:02:14,999
I made you worry again.

697
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:17,599
I'm not worried.

698
01:02:18,899 --> 01:02:21,460
Yun Jin Ah is sitting in front of me.

699
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,081
Why didn't you pick up your phone all day?

700
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:27,181
You were laying low on purpose.

701
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:30,699
Something came up at work.

702
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,970
Next time I do that, I'll let you know beforehand.

703
01:02:34,971 --> 01:02:37,131
You better.

704
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:40,632
I'll get revenge if you don't. I'll just disappear completely.

705
01:02:44,274 --> 01:02:46,575
Will you hide in the closet again?

706
01:02:46,575 --> 01:02:49,583
Next time, try hanging with your clothes on a hanger.

707
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:51,584
No one would find you.

708
01:03:02,902 --> 01:03:04,701
Come here.

709
01:03:12,899 --> 01:03:15,499
Next time, don't do that.

710
01:03:15,499 --> 01:03:17,800
I felt so bad for you.

711
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:21,900
There's nowhere else to hide.

712
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,600
I'll make sure you don't have to hide anymore.

Just because you're Yun Jin Ah.

748

There's no other reason.

Well... I think she has someone.
