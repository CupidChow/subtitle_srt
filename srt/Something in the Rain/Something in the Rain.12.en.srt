1
00:00:01,149 --> 00:00:04,668
Yun Jin Ah, are you crazy? Are you in your right mind?

2
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:09,001
What about Jun Hui? What is he to you?

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,231
Gyeong Seon, the truth is–

4
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:13,333
End things with Jun Hui.

5
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,069
Gyeong Seon.

6
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:35,998
Didn't you hear me?

7
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:39,399
I told you to end things with Jun Hui. What more do you want?

8
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:43,010
Do you think I want to be here?

9
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:44,891
You know how my mom is.

10
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:48,043
I have to do what she wants at least once so she'll be satisfied.

11
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:50,742
So she will never bring something like this up again.

12
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:52,868
First of all, Mom says that she doesn't like Jun Hui.

13
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:55,969
You're an obedient daughter, so just listen to her.

14
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,985
What am I supposed to do if you act like this, too?

15
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:04,034
Do you think we were born for your sake, just like you said?

16
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:06,599
Why must I always hear your side of things and let it go?

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,980
How much of this do I have to endure?

18
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:12,557
When it comes to Jun Hui...

19
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:15,542
I don't care who you are. I cannot see straight.

20
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:18,477
Your family belittled Jun Hui. I only put up with it because it's you.

21
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,533
Otherwise, I would've already ended it!

22
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:23,665
But you've crossed the limit. I can't bear to let it go.

23
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,666
I can't bear to see Jun Hui being looked down on.

24
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,893
Why would you say that?

25
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:32,723
Who is looking down on him?

26
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:34,523
Right now, you are.

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,438
It looks like you have something to talk about.

28
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,831
You're standing here and taking it so lightly.

29
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:42,995
You see me and Jun Hui as a pair of pitiful siblings.

30
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:46,195
Your household blatantly treats us like you're on a higher level than us.

31
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,724
Yes, I have an inferiority complex.

32
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:50,625
That's why I'll be a proper nuisance from now on.

33
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:00,267
Miss Yun Jin Ah?

34
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:04,904
We are supposed to have a blind date today.

35
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,972
[Episode 12]

36
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:29,100
Excuse me.

37
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,416
Why don't we sit here?

38
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:35,009
Would you like that? Please sit.

39
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,009
I'll sit on this side.

40
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:40,496
Sure, you do that.

41
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:50,706
Are you okay?

42
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:52,235
No.

43
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:55,635
I mean, yes. I'm all right.

44
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,820
Aren't you Jin Ah?

45
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,309
Hello.

46
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,626
It is you, right?

47
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:25,126
Wow, it's been a long time.

48
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:29,750
Gyeong Seon's over there.

49
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,552
Yes, I know.

50
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,696
Oh, okay.

Excuse me for a moment.

57
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,899
Where's Jun Hui?

58
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:29,911
What about Jun Hui?

59
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,073
How long will you keep this up?

60
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:40,673
Wouldn't it be stranger to expect warmth from me?

61
00:05:43,072 --> 00:05:45,561
This is a waste of time.

62
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:48,262
Let's have a constructive conversation.

63
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,682
It seemed like you had something to say when you called me in Canada.

64
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:56,785
I don't.

65
00:05:56,785 --> 00:05:57,985
For a brief moment,

66
00:05:57,986 --> 00:06:01,963
I just wanted to confirm Jun Hui and I weren't alone in this world.

67
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:03,864
That's all.

68
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:06,912
It's the truth.

69
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:09,512
When I was younger and my friends would show off their dads,

70
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:13,401
I wanted to show off that I had a dad, too.

71
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:15,602
It was something like that.

72
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,400
I thought you were past the age of needing a parent's protection.

73
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:23,412
It's not about needing it.

74
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:27,136
It's absolutely no help to me.

75
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:31,437
But there are annoying situations where it's useful to have one, just for show.

76
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,612
People's stereotypes are so ludicrous.

77
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:56,699
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,799
You know you're being really strange, right?

79
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:04,003
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,239
I've been forced to go on these before.

81
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:11,396
I've also been on them with people forced into it, but today's the worst.

82
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,300
I have nothing to say for myself.

83
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,500
You must have someone you already like.

84
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,475
Otherwise, it would mean you really don't like me.

85
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:28,476
My pride would be hurt.

86
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,469
You seem like a good person. I really mean that.

87
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,395
Well, I'll pretend to be fooled by that.

88
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:44,445
What can I do to make you less anxious?

89
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,499
I'm not anxious.

90
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:52,899
Is that person behind you really just your friend?

91
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,862
Of course. That's my friend and her father.

92
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:02,311
Then there's no reason they can't know about you being on this date.

93
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:05,411
Yes, of course. Why would you say such a thing?

94
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,000
Then why does she keep looking over like she wants to kill you?

95
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,941
It looks like Jin Ah grew up very well.

96
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:27,455
She's not married yet, is she?

97
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:29,200
No.

98
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,599
Are you dating anyone?

99
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,184
What about Jun Hui?

100
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:38,185
I don't really know.

101
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,815
I'm sure he will marry soon.

102
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:44,863
Time really flies.

103
00:08:44,863 --> 00:08:47,612
What do your children mean to you?

104
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:52,013
Are they like grass on the mountains that you leave once you plant them?

105
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,055
Parents can't do everything for you.

106
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:59,529
You should have done the basics.

107
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,727
I don't resent you because I had to drop out of college.

108
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:04,227
It was half my choice.

109
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:06,977
But Jun Hui is different.

110
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:10,478
He gave up on drawing and art that he loved so much.

111
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,771
He started working for a game company to make money.

112
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:14,170
He says he doesn't want me to support him.

113
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,218
He says he finds it burdensome and can't draw.

114
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:19,419
The worst thing you did to us–

115
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:21,652
All right. Let's stop.

116
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:22,852
Don't cut me off.

117
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:26,618
I wouldn't have come here if I thought I wouldn't get to say what I wanted.

118
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:29,920
You seem to feel bad about getting married multiple times.

119
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,919
No, the worst thing you did to us was take our childhood away too early.

120
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:44,171
I wanted Jun Hui to get in trouble every, single day.

121
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:47,071
I wanted him to do bad things and cause mischief.

122
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:50,870
I couldn't stand to see him acting like an adult. It killed me.

123
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:53,309
He was always thinking of others first.

124
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,593
It breaks my heart even now to see him hide his own pain.

125
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:59,740
Why did you make Jun Hui that way? Why?

126
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:01,441
"Marriage"?

127
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:05,382
Even having a father is a luxury for us.

128
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,083
Do you know that?

129
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,600
Why don't we get going?

130
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
This is absurd.

131
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,510
Excuse me.

132
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:31,511
Let me ask you one thing.

133
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,380
What's your relationship with Yun Jin Ah?

134
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,511
What did you say?

135
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,997
I was set up with her today, and I'm just so taken aback.

136
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:42,199
How do you know her?

137
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,219
I happen to be her former sister-in-law.

138
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,279
What did you say?

139
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,780
Who does he think he is, talking to me?

140
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,600
[Love U: Missed Calls]

141
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,000
Do you want to have some tea?

142
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,726
Do you happen to know how Jun Hui is doing?

143
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,690
Gyeong Seon is still angry with me. She left without telling me.

144
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:18,500
I think... he is doing well.

145
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,800
Is he seeing anyone?

146
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,128
From what Gyeong Seon said, I think he must have someone.

147
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:27,929
Don't you know about it?

148
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,904
I'm sorry.

149
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,530
What does that mean?

150
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't really know. That's why...

151
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,758
Jin Ah, I see you've grown up to be overly polite.

152
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,600
It makes sense. Your parents are pretty traditional.

153
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:58,118
My parents aren't very flexible.

154
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:00,994
I'm not saying it's a bad thing,

155
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:04,167
but it can be a pain for the child.

156
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:12,825
I thought he was your boyfriend when I came in, but I guess not.

157
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:14,527
No.

158
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,075
I was just meeting him briefly...

159
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,600
Why do you keep saying that to me?

161
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,584
It doesn't seem like just being polite.

162
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,950
I'm sorry for being strange...

163
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,131
I'm going grocery shopping before heading in.

164

Mom, if you keep doing this,

325
00:29:56,646 --> 00:29:59,903
you're only encouraging them to stick closer to each other.

326
00:29:59,904 --> 00:30:04,210
What if they run away and hide where we can't find them?

327
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:09,253
The fact that he doesn't live up to your standards is unreasonable.

328
00:30:09,253 --> 00:30:11,021
It breaks new levels of absurdity.

329
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:12,572
Break or destroy it...

330
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:14,899
Why are you acting like other people's children?

331
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:17,718
Look at your children that way.

332
00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:19,849
Like they're other people's children.

333
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:23,970
When you see other children acting poorly, you think it's pathetic, right?

334
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,509
Others often look at Jin Ah and me that way, too.

335
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:29,708
That's the true image of your children!

336
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:34,332
Whether she destroys it or ruins it, it's Yun Jin Ah's life. Why are you interfering?

337
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,461
"Interfering"?

338
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:41,562
How is it interfering for a parent to care about their child?

339
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:45,220
Interest can lead to meddling.

340
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,821
- When you go too far, it's assault.
- Seung Ho!

341
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:49,601
You're harassing her psychologically.

342
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:52,541
You're making her waver and want to leave!

343
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,642
How is that not assault?

344
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,383
Mom.

345
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:02,280
Let's not live like uncivilized people.

346
00:31:04,244 --> 00:31:06,544
Oh, goodness.

347
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:50,832
Your mom is lying down in her room.

348
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,253
About the screaming earlier...

349
00:31:56,254 --> 00:31:58,154
Good job.

350
00:31:59,128 --> 00:32:02,120
I'm saying you did well. You said the right thing.

351
00:32:02,678 --> 00:32:07,783
But you can't think of your mom as someone who doesn't care for her children.

352
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:10,217
From a parent's point of view, it feels necessary.

353
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:13,164
No parent wants bad things to happen to their child.

354
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,765
I know that.

355
00:32:15,765 --> 00:32:19,783
But there's also no guarantee that the life your parents plan for you is good.

356
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:22,549
- No, there isn't.
- So what then?

357
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:24,655
Parents have a lot of fear.

358
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:27,573
They want their children to walk the safe path.

359
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:30,362
It's hard to watch them choose something risky because it makes us nervous.

360
00:32:30,362 --> 00:32:31,762
That's why Mom's acting like that.

361
00:32:31,762 --> 00:32:34,363
Still, this is going overboard.

362
00:32:34,363 --> 00:32:37,085
Also, why is Seo Jun Hui a risk?

363
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:42,344
I'll take my time and talk to your mom.

364
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,400
Don't say anything mean to your sister either.

365
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,900
Have you heard from Jun Hui?

366
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,199
I'll try contacting him.

367
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:59,002
Only because...

368
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:02,303
- It's raining so much–
- All right.

369
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:10,300
They're just the same.

370
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,200
Are you with Yun Jin Ah?

371
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,799
Where are you?

372
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,055
At home.

373
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:23,899
What are you doing here?

374
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:27,993
I'm just here.

375
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,399
You should've come in or called if you were here...

376
00:34:37,815 --> 00:34:39,516
Get up.

377
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,430
It's raining.

378
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,620
It's raining.

379
00:34:47,343 --> 00:34:49,342
Get up now.

380
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:51,352
It's really pouring.

381
00:34:51,352 --> 00:34:54,552
I know, so hurry and get up.

382
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:05,161
What is it?

383
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:08,599
My legs are cramped.

384
00:35:11,899 --> 00:35:13,900
Don't use those methods on me.

385
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,278
You're using that because you think I might be mad.

386
00:35:16,278 --> 00:35:18,180
I'm telling the truth.

387
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,700
It hurts so much.

388
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:27,500
Seriously, I can't deal with you.

389
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:37,983
It's hot.

390
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:39,584
Okay.

391
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:47,235
You're really angry, aren't you?

392
00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:49,734
I was.

393
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:52,526
Your stalling worked.

394
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:55,227
It wasn't like that.

395
00:35:55,227 --> 00:35:58,999
Then why didn't you call?

396
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:02,529
Because I was scared.

397
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:04,643
That I might get angry?

398
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,100
Then what were you scared of?

399
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,349
That you wouldn't pick up my call.

400
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,241
Noona, you're using a lot of smokescreen methods today.

401
00:36:40,627 --> 00:36:45,626
When I look at you like this, you seem much younger than me.

402
00:36:46,506 --> 00:36:47,705
Do I, Oppa?

403
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,706
You're already joking around. You must be feeling better.

404
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,510
I'm sorry.

405
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,511
You should be.

406
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,964
You can get mad at me.

407
00:37:05,964 --> 00:37:08,265
It's too late for that.

408
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:15,762
For the first and very last time, I was going to do what Mom wanted.

409
00:37:15,762 --> 00:37:20,843
I thought I would make it so that she couldn't ask me for anything more.

410
00:37:20,843 --> 00:37:26,643
But... I was too thoughtless.

411
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:33,138
I realized I should've never done that as soon as I saw Gyeong Seon.

412
00:37:33,138 --> 00:37:35,084
Why am I so stupid?

413
00:37:35,084 --> 00:37:37,597
You always cause trouble.

414
00:37:37,597 --> 00:37:40,234
So will you not see me anymore?

415
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:43,318
Yes. I don't want to see you so much that I'm dying.

416
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:46,874
"Dying"? I said you can't die without my permission.

417
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:49,575
I'm going to do whatever I want.

418
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:51,606
What?

419
00:37:51,606 --> 00:37:56,637
Loving and adoring Yun Jin Ah. Is that not allowed either?

420
00:37:57,899 --> 00:38:01,236
I'll have to think about that until the day after tomorrow.

421
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:03,537
Then I'll tell you.

422
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:09,430
Gosh, you better not cause trouble again.

423
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,531
I won't. I'll never do it.

424
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:16,510
By the way...

425
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:20,411
Why did you get so dolled up? You're wearing earrings too.

426
00:38:21,071 --> 00:38:23,839
Am I? This is my usual outfit for blind dates.

427
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,513
"Your usual"? You must've gone on a lot of blind dates.

428
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:31,057
You know how old I am. I've been on some.

429
00:38:31,057 --> 00:38:32,899
- How many times?
- What?

430
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:34,039
I can't hear you.

431
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,602
Answer me.

432
00:38:35,602 --> 00:38:37,412
Don't laugh and answer me.

433
00:38:37,412 --> 00:38:39,972
It's raining outside. Let's go get in some trouble.

434
00:38:39,972 --> 00:38:42,573
What trouble? Answer me first.

Why won't you look at me when you say it?

00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:07,277
Because I've committed a sin against you.

Oh...

00:45:09,428 --> 00:45:13,330
I've fallen too hard for Seo Jun Hui.

486
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:16,443
Go on in.

487
00:45:16,443 --> 00:45:19,410
Yes, I should go in.

488
00:46:05,768 --> 00:46:07,568
Go.

489
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,700
You're late.

490
00:46:36,406 --> 00:46:38,906
Go in and rest.

491
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:42,699
Did anything happen today?

492
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:45,289
Do you think nothing would've happened?

493
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:48,527
Then why is Mom so quiet?

494
00:47:48,527 --> 00:47:52,808
She must have no strength, or it isn't worth it.

495
00:47:54,499 --> 00:48:00,193
The blind date I went on... Gyeong Seon and Jun Hui found out.

496
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,200
I got caught at the hotel.

How is it that everything you do...

498
00:48:10,899 --> 00:48:13,099
Are you lacking in something?

499
00:48:15,743 --> 00:48:19,070
I don't know why I told you at all.

500

Seo Jun Hui...

501
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:24,599
You'll get hurt if you think too little of him.

502
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:26,601
If you make the wrong move, you'll have no chance.

503
00:48:26,602 --> 00:48:29,200
Once he decides against something, you can't beat him to change his mind.

504
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,601
You should know that beforehand.

Welcome back.

You beckoned.

We have a war on our hands.

512
00:49:25,185 --> 00:49:27,636
Let's fight this together.

513
00:49:27,636 --> 00:49:30,285
You are all saying things to bring my spirit down.

514
00:49:30,285 --> 00:49:32,005
Section Chief Yun, you're here.

515
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:33,611
Are you finally back?

516
00:49:33,611 --> 00:49:36,117
You must not be happy to see me.

517
00:49:36,117 --> 00:49:40,417
Isn't that obvious? You're not helpful to me at all.

I"ll take an americano.

521
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:22,872
I wrote a statement with my name on it.

522
00:50:22,873 --> 00:50:24,973
I sent it to Manager Jeong's email.

523

What's with your reaction?

524
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:32,831
I feel bad.

Your help will be good. I pitched in, too.

Everyone wants to back out. How can I force them?

529

I tried to talk to them, but no one wanted to budge.

That's why I'm so easy.

You were in the past, but not these days.

You know it, too. You have power now.

People around me just keep saying that. What power?

534
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:08,797
Whatever the case, you are incredibly brave. Very cool.

535
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:12,560
It's too early for that kind of compliment.

Why?

Do you think there will be a lot of pressure?

538

It can't be a little. It isn't a simple matter.

Section Chief Yun, if–

540

Don't think about that stuff now. I don't want to be nervous beforehand.

You said thinking positively would help. It will work out that way.

Let's just think about work here. Come down.

00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:02,550
Yun Jin Ah is no ordinary person.

549
00:52:03,499 --> 00:52:06,226
I believe it was difficult for her to be brave and step forward.

550
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:08,148
That isn't what I meant.

551
00:52:08,149 --> 00:52:10,787
She has always been tough.

552
00:52:10,788 --> 00:52:13,610
Who would take all of that and last ten years?

553
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,910
They would have left already.

554
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,300
You mentored your employee well.

555
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:22,443
That doesn't sound like a compliment.

556
00:52:22,444 --> 00:52:25,783
No it isn't. Having Jeong Yeong In alone is a handful.

557
00:52:25,783 --> 00:52:28,883
You've raised a junior like yourself.

558
00:52:32,423 --> 00:52:34,223
However...

559
00:52:34,223 --> 00:52:38,623
I don't know if Yun Jin Ah will be okay if this is exposed.

560
00:52:39,575 --> 00:52:43,233
I don't understand what you mean, Chairman Jo.

561
00:52:43,234 --> 00:52:45,034
I don't mean anything else.

You know how it is.

Don't you agree, Chairman Jo?

570

Of course.

571
00:53:12,388 --> 00:53:14,088

Not that, exactly.

He said that his demeanor towards the female employees...

576

was only...

You even contacted female employees that resigned.

583
00:54:05,805 --> 00:54:09,105
No, I didn't mean you.

Oh my. Director, are you okay?

00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,700
I have to be okay.

00:54:39,836 --> 00:54:42,536
I will get him.

It will be either you or me.

- No.

597

Aren't you getting ahead of yourself?

00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,950
Hey, who am I?

599
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,987
I saved all the female employees.

600
00:55:15,988 --> 00:55:19,388
I even won over all the former employees.

601

Oh my.

602
00:55:21,767 --> 00:55:25,229
Director Nam will only be around for a few more days now.

Why are you staring at me like that?

00:55:31,897 --> 00:55:34,457
I'm just getting a good look.

605
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:36,156
What does that mean?

606
00:55:36,158 --> 00:55:38,650
Well, you're our next director.

607
00:55:38,651 --> 00:55:43,168
You may disappear up there so I'm getting a good look.

608
00:55:43,169 --> 00:55:45,395
I'll take care of you if I do well.

609
00:55:45,395 --> 00:55:47,895
You don't need to do that.

Leave her alone for a while. She'll feel better after some time.

613
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:11,026
So I shouldn't go see her?

614
00:56:11,027 --> 00:56:13,421
I'm not saying you should never do it.

615
00:56:13,422 --> 00:56:15,822
That's the same thing.

616
00:56:15,822 --> 00:56:18,111
Should I drive you to see her now?

617
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,000
Seriously, you're the best at putting people in awkward positions.

618
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,678
It must be because I'm lacking in so many ways.

619
00:56:28,399 --> 00:56:31,174
Why would you suddenly say that?

620
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:32,856
I just said that to be funny.

621
00:56:32,857 --> 00:56:35,262
It's not at all funny.

622
00:56:35,263 --> 00:56:39,226
You said I shouldn't have an inferiority complex, so why would you act like that?

623
00:56:39,227 --> 00:56:42,027
Sorry, I won't do it again.

624
00:56:46,786 --> 00:56:49,498
Don't be angry. I'm starting to feel like a bad person.

Who says you are?

626

The man I like isn't that kind of person.

Don't talk carelessly. He's my boyfriend.

Are you laughing? How dare you.

629

Wow, what do I do with this woman?

630
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:10,605
What?

631
00:57:10,605 --> 00:57:13,699
You can adore her.

632
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,601
Gosh.

What are you looking for?

634
00:57:23,661 --> 00:57:29,560
Your mom told me to take out the meat for tomorrow morning's stew, but...

635
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,929
Mom, you took your cast off.

636
00:57:47,399 --> 00:57:49,700
When did Mom take her cast off?

637
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,700
Do you think I could see Jun Hui?

638
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:12,800
Do you want to meet our father?

639
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:44,430
Don't bother thinking about us.

640
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:48,906
We will live well, just as we always have.

641
00:59:48,906 --> 00:59:51,405
How arrogant.

642
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:11,896
I thought it was weird when she wanted to go for a walk after lunch.

643
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:13,322
How did you know about this place?

644
01:00:13,323 --> 01:00:14,729
Section Chief Kang.

645
01:00:14,729 --> 01:00:19,029
I asked her to come with me, but she always has lunch and dinner plans.

646
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:22,160
Section Chief Kang has been suspicious lately.

647
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,059
Why?

648
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:26,247
She appears to be normal,

649
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,579
but something's off about her.

650
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,480
There's just something.

651
01:00:31,313 --> 01:00:33,333
Pretending to be a swan.

652
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:36,052
"Pretending to be swan"? What's that?

653
01:00:36,053 --> 01:00:37,842
She's calm on the outside, as always.

654
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:41,499
But under the water, her feet are moving like crazy.

655
01:00:41,499 --> 01:00:43,499
That's more of a specialty for men.

656
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,600
"A specialty for men"?

657
01:00:47,014 --> 01:00:49,627
Like a guy who goes clubbing without telling his girlfriend.

658
01:00:49,627 --> 01:00:50,696
How does he do it?

659
01:00:50,696 --> 01:00:55,417
He goes inside a parked car, closes the windows, and wraps the phone with clothes.

660
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:57,535
He makes it as quiet as possible.

661
01:00:57,535 --> 01:01:00,317
"Yes, I'm going to bed now. Honey, you sleep well, too."

662
01:01:00,317 --> 01:01:03,687
To make it even more real, he reclines his car seat back.

663
01:01:03,687 --> 01:01:05,852
But his girlfriend keeps talking to him.

664
01:01:05,852 --> 01:01:09,571
Then he says she must sleep for the sake of tomorrow, for her beautiful skin.

665
01:01:09,571 --> 01:01:12,718
He says it's all for the girlfriend and gains her trust.

666
01:01:12,718 --> 01:01:14,088
Mission clear.

667
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:15,435
I wouldn't bother going clubbing.

668
01:01:15,435 --> 01:01:16,780
I know.

669
01:01:16,781 --> 01:01:21,426
To accomplish their goals, men lie as easily as they eat.

670
01:01:21,426 --> 01:01:23,551
Who wrote this book that you're reading?

671
01:01:23,551 --> 01:01:25,223
You shouldn't be too relaxed.

672
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,839
Seo Jun Hui...

673
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,345
Should I call him brother-in-law now?

674
01:01:29,345 --> 01:01:31,245
Forget it.

675
01:01:32,095 --> 01:01:34,609
Anyway, all men have secrets.

676
01:01:34,609 --> 01:01:37,109
They have dozens of them.

677
01:01:38,813 --> 01:01:41,764
Isn't there a way to find out the secrets?

678
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,251
- It's a big problem if you find out.
- Why?

679
01:01:44,251 --> 01:01:46,308
Once it's out there, it isn't a secret.

680
01:01:46,308 --> 01:01:48,956
All their pride was on the line with those secrets.

681
01:01:48,957 --> 01:01:53,257
Even if you find out, they say you should pretend not to know.

682
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:56,909
Were men always such complicated animals?

683
01:01:56,909 --> 01:02:00,564
I don't know either. I can't believe her words.

684
01:02:00,564 --> 01:02:02,530
I read it in a book.

685
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:04,561
Those sunglasses looked good on you.

686
01:02:04,561 --> 01:02:06,262
Then you can buy them for me.

687
01:02:06,263 --> 01:02:09,481
"Me"? I make much less than you.

688
01:02:09,481 --> 01:02:12,237
- Hello.
- Hello.

689
01:02:12,237 --> 01:02:15,800
Section Chief Yun, it's especially nice to see you.

690
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,584
Last time the person from the US branch...

691
01:02:18,584 --> 01:02:20,592
Section Chief Yun, have you seen this movie?

692
01:02:20,593 --> 01:02:22,964
- No, I haven't.
- Come and see it with me.

693
01:02:22,964 --> 01:02:25,604
I don't want to.

694
01:02:25,604 --> 01:02:27,417
Yes, you have someone to see it with.

695
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:29,277
I'll include you if you want.

696
01:02:29,277 --> 01:02:31,310
Section Chief Geum, do you want to watch it with me?

697
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:32,264
After you.

698
01:02:32,264 --> 01:02:35,392
Let's go.

699
01:02:35,392 --> 01:02:38,102
Is Seo Jun Hui leaving the country again?

700
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:39,172
Who said that?

701
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:42,272
Those people from China were just saying so.

702
01:02:42,272 --> 01:02:43,522
What did they say?

703
01:02:43,522 --> 01:02:47,572
"Is that person who came back from the U.S. joining us on the project?"

704
01:02:47,573 --> 01:02:48,964
"Yes, he is."

705
01:02:48,964 --> 01:02:50,384
"Didn't you say he isn't coming?"

706
01:02:50,384 --> 01:02:51,612
"No, he will go."

707
01:02:51,613 --> 01:02:54,713
"He can go for an extended time too." That's what they said.

708
01:02:56,643 --> 01:02:59,443
Section Chief Yun must not have known.

709
01:03:11,944 --> 01:03:13,945
Have you eaten?

710
01:03:14,952 --> 01:03:17,652
Do you want to have coffee on the roof?

711
01:03:21,941 --> 01:03:23,740
Are you busy?

712
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,500
The game character is good, who did the design?

713
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,060
This one next to me.

714
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,710
He is the main designer here.

715
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:47,540
They really liked your idea.

716
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:48,760
Thanks.

717
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,100
Not at all.

718
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,400
We are hoping the characters are designed as how we just mentioned.

719
01:03:53,400 --> 01:04:00,160
We think we could achieve it here, and that's why we came here.

720
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:22,709
You must be mad because I didn't reply your messages.

721
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:25,290
How can I make it up to you?

722
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:26,899
You're crazy.

723
01:04:26,899 --> 01:04:29,450
Someday, I will succeed up here.

724
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:31,662
Were you very busy?

725
01:04:31,662 --> 01:04:33,192
No.

726
01:04:33,192 --> 01:04:35,231
There was a sudden meeting so I couldn't pick up.

727
01:04:35,231 --> 01:04:37,168
The Chinese project?

728
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:38,687
How did you know?

729
01:04:38,687 --> 01:04:40,638
I heard about your business trip.

730
01:04:40,638 --> 01:04:42,052
Do you have a spy at my work?

731
01:04:42,052 --> 01:04:43,679
When are you going?

732
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,888
I'm not going.

733
01:04:44,888 --> 01:04:47,570
It's three months. How can I last, not seeing you?

734
01:04:47,571 --> 01:04:49,519
I told them I could never go.

735
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,819
Why did you do that?

736
01:04:51,819 --> 01:04:55,468
I could use all my vacation days and go with you.

737
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:56,469
How nice would that be?

738
01:04:56,469 --> 01:05:00,669
We wouldn't have to worry about anything. It would be complete freedom.

739
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,563
Freedom...

740
01:05:03,564 --> 01:05:06,064
You must be really stressed.

741
01:05:08,986 --> 01:05:12,269
I'm just saying.

742
01:05:12,269 --> 01:05:14,878
Let's do something fun today. What do you want to do?

743
01:05:14,879 --> 01:05:16,388
Should we watch a movie?

744
01:05:16,388 --> 01:05:20,100
Sounds good. Tell me which one so I can buy tickets.

745
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:23,700
What should we see? What's on these days?

746
01:05:29,971 --> 01:05:31,671
Yes.

747
01:05:36,049 --> 01:05:37,364
One moment.

748
01:05:37,364 --> 01:05:39,164
One minute.

749
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,752
What should I do? I don't think I can do the movie today.

750
01:06:06,752 --> 01:06:07,883
Who called?

751
01:06:07,883 --> 01:06:09,477
My dad.

752
01:06:09,477 --> 01:06:14,278
My mom caught a cold so he wants me home early if possible.

753
01:06:14,872 --> 01:06:17,673
Then you should go. Let's go down.

754
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:23,079
What time are you done later?

755
01:06:24,323 --> 01:06:26,623
I'm not sure. In a bit.

756
01:06:27,513 --> 01:06:29,164
Call me. I'll drive you.

757
01:06:29,164 --> 01:06:31,065
No, it's okay.

758
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,360
Will you run off somewhere?

759
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:37,100
Delusional jealousy?

760
01:06:38,133 --> 01:06:40,233
Just run off.

761
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,347
How is this one?

762
01:06:59,347 --> 01:07:01,177
Doesn't this look too strong?

763
01:07:01,177 --> 01:07:03,459
Then this one.

764
01:07:03,459 --> 01:07:04,846
This is too common.

765
01:07:04,846 --> 01:07:06,146
This looks like a copy.

766
01:07:06,146 --> 01:07:08,120
It's boring.

767
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,744
Isn't this character better?

768
01:07:09,744 --> 01:07:13,391
It's a side character, but the face is too strong.

769
01:07:13,391 --> 01:07:16,691
- Well.
- Yes, it isn't bad.

770
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,490
It's okay.

771
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:34,930
Look at this.

772
01:07:37,646 --> 01:07:39,255
I'm leaving now. Work hard.

773
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:42,455
Have a good dinner. Kisses.

774
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:47,130
Also, this one.

775
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:50,981
What's going on?

776
01:08:00,966 --> 01:08:03,158
I could have come to you.

777
01:08:03,158 --> 01:08:05,855
I'm taking up your time. I should come here.

778
01:08:05,855 --> 01:08:07,727
I have a lot of time.

779
01:08:07,727 --> 01:08:11,455
No, a young person shouldn't waste their time.

780
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:13,189
You should go on dates.

781
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:15,089
My boyfriend...

782
01:08:16,315 --> 01:08:19,314
Did your boyfriend say it's okay to meet me?

783
01:08:20,924 --> 01:08:22,703
You can't make me get in trouble.

784
01:08:22,703 --> 01:08:25,072
Of course. You haven't eaten yet, have you?

785
01:08:25,072 --> 01:08:27,783
There's a quiet restaurant nearby. What do you think?

786
01:08:27,783 --> 01:08:30,360
I will follow your lead.

787
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,662
Don't lose me.

788
01:08:47,574 --> 01:08:49,075
Yes?

789
01:08:49,699 --> 01:08:51,831
Where are you going?

790
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:54,031
Oh, home.

791
01:08:59,499 --> 01:09:01,699
Can you see me?

792
01:09:07,616 --> 01:09:09,775
The thing is...

793
01:09:09,775 --> 01:09:11,576
Just come back.

794
01:09:12,756 --> 01:09:14,656
Jun Hui.

795
01:09:15,243 --> 01:09:16,862
I said, just come back.

796
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:19,441
Don't be like this and...

797
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:21,941
Can't you hear me telling you to come back?

798
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:40,710
♫ Sometimes it's hard to be a woman ♫

799
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:49,230
♫ Givin' all your love to just one man ♫

800
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,528
I can't reach him by phone.

801
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:52,080
He didn't come to work either.

802
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,557
- Didn't you two break up?
- He's hurt?

803
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:57,124
Why don't you like my Jun Hui?

804
01:09:57,124 --> 01:10:01,148
It's wonderful that you're with Jun Hui.

805
01:10:01,148 --> 01:10:03,108
Your father is that kind of person.

806
01:10:03,108 --> 01:10:04,308
How different could you two be?

807
01:10:04,308 --> 01:10:07,310
A person I never wanted to see appeared and said he's my father.

808
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:09,080
And he said it to the woman I love.

809
01:10:09,081 --> 01:10:09,954
He is your father.

810
01:10:09,954 --> 01:10:11,573
What do you mean, a conciliation?

811
01:10:11,573 --> 01:10:13,620
Section Chief Yun went too far.

I can make up things that never happened. Do you want to experience it?

813
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,896
How could you hurt him like this?

814
01:10:18,896 --> 01:10:22,190
I won't see him. I won't see him anymore.

Jun Hui.

816
01:10:24,663 --> 01:10:27,263
Let's end things here.

817
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:36,170
♫ And if you love him, oh, be proud of him ♫
