[Final Episode]

2
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,655
Okay, you should go now.

3
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll get you an expensive gift to make up for it.

4
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:46,870
Hello? Yes.

5
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:50,168
Yes, but why should we do that?

6
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:56,346
Yes, but why... I'll just go there.

7
00:00:56,347 --> 00:01:00,068
I'll head over right now, so prepare my passport. I'm hanging up.

8
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:01,926
I'll call you.

9
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,352
Hello?

10
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:12,266
Oh, hello. Yes.

11
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:15,546
Yes.

12
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:29,967
Seo Jun Hui, long time no see.

13
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:32,188
- I know, right?
- Hey, it's been a long time.

14
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,729
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

15
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,238
- Let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

16
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:38,574
- You look good.
- You haven't changed a bit.

17
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:42,611
You look so much better than you did before.

18
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:12,954
- Seung Ho.
- Hey.

19
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:15,415
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

20
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:19,267
- See you later.
- You look good.

21
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:21,052
Congrats.

22
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,973
See you later.

23
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:30,758
How did you get here?

24
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,605
By plane, of course. Hey, did I have to find out about it through rumors?

25
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:38,502
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:43,475
See you later. Anyway, congrats.

27
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:45,794
Thanks.

28
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:48,241
You look good.

29
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:56,150
Oh, you're here.

30
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:58,045
Have you been well?

31
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,081
Yes.

32
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,912
Are you doing well, too?

33
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:08,403
Of course. Congratulations.

34
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:13,098
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

35
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,592
Thanks.

36
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:22,732
Groom, Yun Seung Ho, and bride, Kim Hui Won

37
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:27,168
do you swear to love each other no matter the situation

38
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:31,501
respect each other, and fulfill your duties

39
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,250
as husband and wife?

40
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,398
- Groom.
- Yes.

41
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,341
Bride?

42
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:10,192
There will be a photoshoot with both sides of the family

43
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:12,449
so please come up on stage.

44
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,497
I should take pictures of this.

45
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,629
When you come up, please have the children and people in hanboks

46
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,397
assemble first.

47
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:27,592
I ask that all family members and relatives come up.

48
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:29,191
Family and relatives, please come up.

49
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:31,960
Jun Hui. Seo Jun Hui.

50
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:35,779
Who is that besides the father?

51
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:40,268
- Doesn't he have an older sister?
- Right?

52
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:45,013
Wow, why didn't he tell us that his sister was so pretty?

53
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:46,537
I know, right?

54
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:50,498
- Hey, has she always looked like this?
- Let me see.

55
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:54,857
- How would I know?
- Wow, she's so pretty. She's definitely my type.

56
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:58,850
I thought your families were close. Didn't you see each other growing up?

57
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:01,355
Get that out of my sight.

58
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,016
So cute.

59
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,499
Don't you think Seo Jun Hui has become more attractive?

60
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,006
You think they're all attractive.

61
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:20,258
Don't listen to what this weird aunt has to say.

62
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:21,734
But are they still dating?

63
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:24,761
Didn't they break up when Seo Jun Hui went to the States?

64
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,229
They did.

65
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,687
- Then why is he here? 
- Because it's his friend's wedding.

66
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:36,713
Goodness, Section Chief Yun must feel uncomfortable.

67
00:05:36,714 --> 00:05:38,848
Why?

68
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,943
What do you want to drink? Do you want milk?

69
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:48,566
Next, there will be a photoshoot with the bride and groom's colleagues and friends

70
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:51,107
so please come up on stage.

71
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:58,266
I ask all colleagues and friends to come up on stage.

72
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:02,192
Please assemble in an orderly fashion.

73
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,905
Please come up on stage.

74
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:11,967
Please stand here.

75
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:13,438
Please come down.

76
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,592
Let's get together.

77
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:19,893
Friends and colleagues, please step forward.

78
00:06:19,894 --> 00:06:24,761
It's not that way. Please go that way and come up.

79
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:29,385
What?

80
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:32,595
Do you want a mirror? Do you know how you look?

81
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:33,938
How do I look?

82
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:37,828
You look like you lost it after seeing the ex you thought was dead.

83
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:41,706
If your boyfriend didn't have a business trip, he would've caught you.

84
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:50,062
You said you forgot everything. You said you didn't remember Seo Jun Hui anymore.

85
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,177
Don't be like that. Yun Jin Ah, don't make a huge mistake.

86
00:06:57,946 --> 00:07:01,506
It's only because you saw him all of a sudden after so long.

87
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,447
I was surprised, too.

88
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:10,384
Running into an ex makes you feel sentimental

89
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:13,084
and reminds you only of the good times.

90
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:15,509
How should I say it?

91
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:21,648
A delusion. It's just a delusion you'll wake up from tomorrow.

92
00:07:25,607 --> 00:07:27,588
Let's be rational about this.

93
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:30,271
Don't be sentimental.

94
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:33,248
What do I do?

95
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:39,653
Yun Jin Ah, it's not true.

96
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:43,049
What are you trying to do?

97
00:07:56,273 --> 00:08:01,904
Okay, the bride and groom will share a kiss after this.

98
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:10,665
No, I'm just tired, that's all.

99
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:19,870
But then again, I'm not the one who went off on a last-minute business trip.

100
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,695
No, it's not over yet.

101
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:32,848
I'm not sure. The guests who live far away might stay over at our house...

102
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:46,322
Do you have to work and talk to me at the same time?

103
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:51,434
No, it's not that I don't understand...

104
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:57,969
Never mind. Forget it.

105
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,480
♫ I feel you now from here ♫

106
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,400
♫ Our time is not done yet ♫

107
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,650
♫ You've given me my fullest heart ♫

108
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,830
♫ We'll never be apart ♫

109
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:42,780
♫ I'm breathing through you now ♫

110
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,560
♫ The love we have, so true ♫

111
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:56,760
♫ I never thought that I could need someone  ♫

112
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,780
♫ The way I do ♫

113
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:11,020
♫ And we're meant to be ♫

114
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,100
♫ This is one thing I know ♫

115
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:21,426
You should have come inside or called me...

116
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,538
Get up.

117
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:33,230
It's raining. Spring rain.

118
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:39,458
- Get up already.
- It's raining a lot though.

119
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,488
I know, so get up already.

120
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:49,553
What's wrong?

121
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:53,115
My leg's asleep.

122
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,359
I know this tactic. You're only saying that so I won't get angry.

123
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,388
It's true. I'm dying here.

124
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,930
You're early.

125
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,668
- Yes.
- It doesn't look like you drank either.

126
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:37,372
Why hasn't anything changed?

127
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:41,981
I was just lazy. It's not because we have the same taste.

128
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:45,117
- My suitcase arrived, right?
- It's in there.

129
00:12:45,117 --> 00:12:49,359
But why were you in such a rush at the airport?

130
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:52,051
I told you I didn't have much time to get to the wedding.

131
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:04,260
♫ And we're meant to be ♫

132
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,430
♫ This is one thing I know ♫

133
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:17,540
♫ I feel everything ♫

134
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,520
♫ Never been so exposed ♫

135
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:30,230
♫ Are there pieces still yet to be discovered  ♫

136
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:37,190
♫ With your love, I can see anything through  ♫

137
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,250
♫ Wherever you are ♫

138
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,710
♫ I can feel you ♫

139
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:03,140
♫ Your smile, your touch, your voice ♫

140
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:10,100
♫ Each detail in your face ♫

141
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,810
♫ I could study everything  ♫

142
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:22,080
♫ About you forever more ♫

143
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:31,190
- What are you doing?
- What?

144
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,604
Oh, nothing.

145
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:37,970
- Is something wrong?
- No.

146
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:54,509
So you're saying Yun Jin...

147
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,237
Wait, I can't say that.

148
00:14:57,237 --> 00:15:01,325
You're saying that Noonim is still on your mind, right?

149
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,222
No.

150
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:07,287
I should just...

151
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:10,061
Drink.

152
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:15,981
While you were in the states, did you see any woman for more than three months?

153
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,513
You can't do that.

154
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:25,232
If you see a bunch of women while having someone else in your heart

155
00:15:25,232 --> 00:15:29,475
you'll punished for that, you punk.

156
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:35,894
And you said it seemed like she has a boyfriend.

157
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:41,604
Did that piss you off?

158
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:44,838
This is very important.

159
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:52,272
Seung Chul.

160
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:01,234
I...

161
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,800
know I'll be punished for this...

162
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:15,201
but while I was in the states...

163
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:19,081
what I thought the most was...

164
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:31,047
"I hope Yun Jin Ah isn't too happy."

165
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,994
I hate this.

166
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:48,360
Why? Did she look really happy?

167
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,258
I would have preferred that better.

168
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:59,495
Did she look miserable?

169
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,894
So...

170
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:18,294
when that crappy wish of yours came true...

171
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:22,744
did your heart rip into pieces?

172
00:17:26,203 --> 00:17:29,120
So what will you do now?

173
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:32,588
Are you going to come back to Korea and give it another try?

174
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:36,984
Don't do that.

175
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:41,851
You just got settled there.

176
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:46,230
Just stay in America for good.

177
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,549
Why?

178
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:54,819
Hey, you bastard.

179
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:58,869
Are you afraid I'll take your place back?

180
00:18:02,993 --> 00:18:06,795
You said I could take my time giving you the security deposit.

181
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:14,188
Hey, I'm not saying this for the hell of it.

182
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:19,688
After you broke up with Deputy...I mean Section Chief Yun,

183
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:24,129
you went around acting like a piece of crap.

184
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,788
Did you forget?

185
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:34,102
Don't worry. I won't do that again.

186
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:53,095
You aged ten years in a quarter of a day.

187
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:56,585
Didn't I warn you when you broke up with Seo Jun Hui?

188
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:59,453
I told you how much you'd regret it.

189
00:18:59,453 --> 00:19:02,048
This is good. It serves you right.

190
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:07,028
You left him hanging to wait for things to happen.

191
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:09,527
Of course, nothing is going right.

192
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:12,470
Even a saint would be exhausted.

193
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:17,446
I would have just ended it, too. I wouldn't want to look back.

194
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:20,919
That's why I didn't talk to him.

195
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:23,992
Let's get things straight.

196
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:27,091
You couldn't talk to him because Seo Jun Hui put up a wall.

197
00:19:28,926 --> 00:19:33,878
Forget it. Let's stop talking about this.

198
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:36,749
It's all in the past now.

199
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,405
Listen to you.

200
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:41,994
This is just...

201
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:47,446
a mixup of all sorts of things.

202
00:19:56,436 --> 00:20:05,490
By saying this now, it could sound like I have other intentions... but your boyfriend...

203
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,324
I should do my best to keep him.

204
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:10,400
It sounds like it's an obligation.

205
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:15,258
He works hard, he's capable,

206
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:18,501
and his future is guaranteed.

207
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:24,460
And it seems like... he likes me.

208
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:30,979
Most importantly, my family welcomes him with open arms. It'd be a shame to lose him.

209
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:39,715
It'd be more of a shame to lose Seo Jun Hui. Why...

210
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:48,020
I'm sorry. I must be drunk.

211
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:23,440
I thought I forgot everything...

212
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:30,757
but when I saw him...

213
00:21:36,654 --> 00:21:39,778
I felt like we broke up just yesterday.

214
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:44,975
If I had lost my focus for just a moment...

215
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,471
I would have run over to hug him.

216
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:04,135
In my opinion, it's just a matter of time until your boyfriend finds out.

217
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:06,948
"Find out what"?

218
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:10,170
I'm not doing anything.

219
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,544
Is having feelings for another guy no big deal?

220
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:16,088
What feelings?

221
00:22:19,746 --> 00:22:23,511
Didn't you say it was just a delusion?

222
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:27,153
I'll probably forget all of this by tomorrow.

223
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,848
Dear...

224
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:41,583
How about you end everything and come live with me?

225
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,917
It's the best way to live without any thoughts.

226
00:22:46,523 --> 00:22:50,424
Are you suggesting we grow old together?

227
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:55,926
I'll just grow old by myself in this house.

228
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:01,599
How did Jun Hui come?

229
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,939
Don't talk to Jin Ah about Jun Hui.

230
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:10,079
She finally met a good man. Let's not start an affair.

231
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:18,150
If we had just let them be Jin Ah would already be married.

232
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,681
They broke up themselves. Why are you blaming me?

233
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:26,342
No, I just don't think it was right

234
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:30,733
to get so involved in our child's matters.

235
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:35,281
What are parents for?

236
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:40,588
If parents can't even do that, we might as well be strangers.

237
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:43,499
I shouldn't have started this.

238
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:48,045
Good thinking. You can't get through to me, so don't--

239
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:50,518
Turn off the lights.

240
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:52,746
You turn off the lights.

241
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,091
Section Chief Yun.

242
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,926
- Section Chief Yun.
- Yes?

243
00:24:48,926 --> 00:24:51,869
You got a call asking why you're not at the meeting.

244
00:24:57,575 --> 00:25:04,895
The items with subdivided marks-of-origin need more specific...

245
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:08,479
- Hey, Section Chief Yun.
- Yes?

246
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:14,074
Why haven't you submitted the country of origin inclusion plan that I asked you to modify?

247
00:25:14,074 --> 00:25:16,903
- Oh.
- "Oh?"

248
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,545
I apologize. I finished it, but I forgot to submit it to you this morning.

249
00:25:22,546 --> 00:25:29,353
Then what about the more detailed monitoring of the marks-of-origin?

250
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:32,763
It's being tracked at the moment.

251
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:37,522
Are you even doing it? What's wrong with you these days?

252
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:40,283
Is there a problem at home?

253
00:25:40,283 --> 00:25:44,225
I apologize. I won't make any more mistakes.

254
00:26:08,394 --> 00:26:12,321
I'll take some time off tonight so we can eat together.

255
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,541
Are you asking me to do that?

256
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:27,290
Why?

257
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:33,013
Okay, I'm hanging up.

258
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,655
Where were we?

259
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,895
Hello?

260
00:26:46,895 --> 00:26:48,540
Yes.

261
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:03,084
Yes.

262
00:27:04,145 --> 00:27:08,121
It's in the second drawer on the right. Find that

263
00:27:08,121 --> 00:27:13,001
talk to them, and then report back to me, okay? I'm hanging up.

264
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:19,445
Oh, that's right. I forgot your present.

265
00:27:19,445 --> 00:27:22,563
I left it in my shoe closet. Guess what it is.

266
00:27:23,752 --> 00:27:26,516
- Guess.
- What is it?

267
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:28,226
Guess.

268
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:31,525
Wait, hold on.

269
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:34,284
Hello?

270
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:37,671
Didn't you find it yet?

271
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,284
Yes.

272
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:48,482
No, I... I told you not to talk about that yet.

273
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:53,388
We have to talk about it when we sign the contract.

274
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:57,638
They'll sign, even if we don't agree to that.

275
00:27:57,638 --> 00:27:59,744
It's about the order.

276
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:07,119
Don't talk back and do as I say. I'll take the responsibility.

277
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:29,180
[Best 10 for the last week of April 2018]

278
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:48,675
Aren't you being too generous? Can you make a living like that?

279
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:51,958
How else would I be alive?

280
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:55,154
I told you to consider living in the states.

281
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:58,318
Are you just going to stay there?

282
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,293
If I can.

283
00:30:01,293 --> 00:30:02,978
Why?

284
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:06,029
There's nothing bad about it.

285
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:11,234
But what's good about it? Is it because you won't have to run into someone?

286
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:13,227
What are you saying?

287
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:19,511
If you don't have a better way to spend your vacation, work here.

288
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:22,417
I was thinking of traveling to sketch.

289
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:28,724
The house is Seung Chul's now. I'll make him uncomfortable.

290
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:31,466
There's an extra room at my place.

291
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:33,524
Do you think it's because I have no place to stay?

292
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:35,525
I want to figure things out myself.

293
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:42,265
This is why I wasn't happy about you coming back to Korea.

294
00:30:42,265 --> 00:30:45,906
- Why?
- Why did you go to that wedding?

295
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:48,210
Did anyone want you there?

296
00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:53,279
I only went because it was a friend's wedding. That's it.

297
00:30:56,912 --> 00:30:58,977
What is it that you want to say?

298
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:03,809
Did I do something wrong? Why is everyone attacking me?

299
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:06,339
You probably bring it upon yourself.

300
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:12,314
Is forgetting everything the normal thing to do?

301
00:31:12,314 --> 00:31:14,829
Is it like that for everyone else?

302
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:19,550
It's normal to remember someone you used to date.

303
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,506
That's true.

304
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:25,805
But the problem is that you're always thinking about her.

305
00:31:25,805 --> 00:31:28,339
That doesn't make any sense.

306
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:31,326
You're the one that doesn't make sense.

307
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,638

Do you...

484
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:17,273
just want me to be your little brother who asks you to buy me food?

485
00:52:17,273 --> 00:52:20,055
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm talking here.

486
00:52:21,497 --> 00:52:23,330
Is that what you want?

487
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:26,630
I'm asking if you're able to do that!

488
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,655
I'm sorry.

489
00:52:31,655 --> 00:52:32,890
Come here.

490
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:35,880
- Let go. Let go.
- Come here.

491
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,901
You're way too drunk right now.

492
00:52:54,901 --> 00:52:57,176
Let's talk again when you're sober–

493
00:52:57,176 --> 00:52:58,779
I'm drunk.

494
00:52:59,753 --> 00:53:02,531
I'm really drunk,

495
00:53:02,531 --> 00:53:04,830
but nothing will change when I'm sober.

496
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,589
I'm going to ask you the same question and hear your answer.

497
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:10,253
Tell me.

498
00:53:11,473 --> 00:53:13,700
Can you see me

499
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,320
and pretend as if nothing happened?

500
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:19,678
Can you do that?

501
00:53:21,205 --> 00:53:24,263
I'm asking, wouldn't that be nice?

502
00:53:24,263 --> 00:53:26,971
For whom?

503
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,213
Not me.

504
00:53:29,213 --> 00:53:32,358
I can't do that, even if you beat be to death.

505
00:53:33,642 --> 00:53:35,547
Can you do it?

506
00:53:37,668 --> 00:53:39,378
Is that possible?

507
00:53:42,268 --> 00:53:44,542
Why not?

508
00:53:47,092 --> 00:53:51,107
I'm sure it'll be uncomfortable at first.

509
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:55,551
But it can't be difficult forever.

510
00:53:55,551 --> 00:53:58,096
Wouldn't we get used to it?

511
00:54:02,734 --> 00:54:04,643
You're cruel.

512
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,134
You're really cruel.

513
00:54:34,848 --> 00:54:37,194
Why did you drink so much?

514
00:54:49,615 --> 00:54:52,290
Wait, are you drinking more?

515
00:56:05,636 --> 00:56:08,303
Seo Jun Hui is inside, isn't he?

516
00:56:08,303 --> 00:56:09,884
Yes.

517
00:56:09,884 --> 00:56:12,382
Excuse me for a moment.

518
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:23,820
Hey, Seo Jun Hui.

519
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,700
Get up.

520
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:29,201
I told you to get up.

521
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:32,458
Get up.

522
00:56:47,356 --> 00:56:48,844
That's right.

523
00:56:50,132 --> 00:56:52,868
What I said was ridiculous.

524
00:56:54,618 --> 00:56:57,580
I said it, even though I wasn't confident I could do it.

525
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:00,199
Why, you ask?

526
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:04,806
Because we'll run into each other again just like we did at the wedding.

527
00:57:05,562 --> 00:57:12,064
I don't want to be cautious and feel my heart sink every time.

528
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:16,692
It'll be difficult...

529
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:22,114
but I wanted to see each other without feeling so uncomfortable.

530
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:28,083
Because it might be a little easier that way.

531
00:57:29,728 --> 00:57:32,279
Because it might hurt less that way.

532
00:57:33,337 --> 00:57:35,855
Was I wrong to think that way?

533
00:57:35,855 --> 00:57:39,273
Did I deserve to be called cruel by you?

534
00:57:42,409 --> 00:57:44,168
Okay.

535
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:47,703
Good job.

536
00:57:52,858 --> 00:57:55,632
What did I do wrong?

537
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:58,922
What did you do that was so great?

538
00:58:00,202 --> 00:58:04,172
You wanted to forget everything and run off together!

539
00:58:04,977 --> 00:58:09,163
But that was because you couldn't stand any of it!

540
00:58:09,163 --> 00:58:12,067
You just used me as an excuse.

541
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:13,530
Am I wrong?

542
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:16,840
If I am, set me straight!

543
00:58:22,868 --> 00:58:25,567
After you left like that...

544
00:58:26,623 --> 00:58:29,808
do you think I lived comfortably?

545
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,072
I stood by myself...

546
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,089
on the edge of a cliff.

547
00:58:42,138 --> 00:58:45,528
Even the way people stared at me...

548
00:58:47,312 --> 00:58:50,147
disgusted me and drove me crazy.

549
00:58:50,837 --> 00:58:52,527
And...

550
00:58:53,262 --> 00:58:56,250
I hated the way I hung in there

551
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,620
and endured everything.

552
00:59:02,424 --> 00:59:04,815
I endured it all...

553
00:59:04,815 --> 00:59:09,714
while hating and resenting myself every single day.

554
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:18,439
I considered it a punishment for hurting you and Kyung Sun and thought I deserved worse

555
00:59:18,439 --> 00:59:22,310
as I cursed myself until now!

556
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,177
Do you know what kind of hell I lived through?

557
00:59:30,137 --> 00:59:32,494
Do you even know?

558
00:59:45,508 --> 00:59:47,966
Why do I have to know that?

559
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:54,090
Why... Why should I care

560
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:57,372
how Yun Jin Ah lived until now?

561

Please take this.

01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,140
It's raining out.

564
01:00:30,058 --> 01:00:33,429
- That's okay.
- No, please take it.

I mean, no matter how confused you may be,

how can you be so childish at your age?

578

I was already speechless about you quitting your job. But what now?

has already settled down there, so I don't have to prepare much.

Is she your husband or something?

583

Aren't you going to get married?

584
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:30,941
I told you I'm not interested in marriage for the time being.

Hey, be honest with me.

You're doing this to get back at me, aren't you?

01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:13,891
You're still holding a grudge from when I was against you and Jun Hui

01:05:13,891 --> 01:05:16,302
being together, aren't you?

598
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,312
I'll be honest, just like you asked.

599
01:05:22,925 --> 01:05:28,650
If I said I was no longer sad and that I didn't resent you

600
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:32,314
any longer, I'd be lying.

There's no way to pay Jun Hui and Gyeong Seon back for the pain they went through.

I'm so shameless...

603
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:51,554
that I still haven't given them a proper apology.

604
01:05:53,808 --> 01:06:00,500
Well, should we beg them for forgiveness after all this time?

605
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:05,063
You were the ones who broke up. Why are you blaming me?

606
01:06:05,063 --> 01:06:07,720
I'm only sitting here in front of you

607

because I don't blame you.

608

You always say this to me.

"You're not young."

610
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:23,320
Since I'm not young anymore, I'm going to make good decisions and live diligently.

611
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,491
I know I'll still never meet your expectations, though.

01:06:28,132 --> 01:06:30,530
Don't worry.

613
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:34,335
My life is precious to me, too.

614
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,100
That's right.

615
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:40,960
This is an important matter since your life depends on it.

616
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,448
So you should think about this carefully before you decide.

there's a role that I need to fill as well.

01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:31,190
I can't just sit back and let my child do whatever she wants.

630
01:08:36,429 --> 01:08:42,640
I wasn't able to be the daughter that you've wanted, either,

631
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,809
so I understand how you feel.

632
01:08:45,932 --> 01:08:47,580
That is true...

633
01:08:52,074 --> 01:08:54,799
Why are you like this today?

634
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:57,639
Just be how you've always been.

635
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:02,219
I had enough of you. Go.

636
01:09:08,736 --> 01:09:12,740
Mom, let's hug each other!

637
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:46,151
Mom.

638
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,126
I'm okay now.

639
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:04,830
If...

640
01:10:05,957 --> 01:10:09,898
things get hard, come back, okay?

641
01:10:15,465 --> 01:10:20,376
We're not very compatible with one another

642
01:10:20,376 --> 01:10:23,171
so it might be better to live apart.

643
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,362
I'll visit when I can, okay?

644
01:10:34,362 --> 01:10:36,775
- Go inside.
- Go.

645
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:39,228
I'll call you.

646
01:10:39,228 --> 01:10:41,543
You'll miss your flight.

647
01:10:41,543 --> 01:10:43,180
I'll be going.

648
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,130
Bye.

01:11:59,332 --> 01:12:01,018
Here you go.

650
01:12:23,932 --> 01:12:26,218
What are you doing?

651
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:28,361
I'm just...

652
01:12:28,361 --> 01:12:31,829
Oh my. Hey, what are you doing?

653
01:12:35,057 --> 01:12:39,033
You little... Hey, Yun Jin Ah! Hey! Hey!

654
01:12:39,033 --> 01:12:41,260
Hey! Come here!

655
01:13:07,362 --> 01:13:09,219
Jun Hui.

656
01:13:10,623 --> 01:13:13,364
Jun Hui, it's me.

657
01:13:14,714 --> 01:13:17,737
I had your cellphone

658
01:13:17,737 --> 01:13:21,290
when I thought of something I wanted to say to you.

659
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:24,803
Thank you.

660
01:13:25,772 --> 01:13:30,733
For cherishing me and loving me.

661
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:34,226
I never expected

662
01:13:34,226 --> 01:13:37,927
to be loved like this by someone.

663
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:41,704
You probably don't know.

664
01:13:41,704 --> 01:13:43,900
You have no idea

665
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,100
how thankful and

666
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:49,880
and happy I am.

667
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,053
I'm learning a lot, too.

668
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:55,260
That love...

669
01:13:56,289 --> 01:13:59,972
is when you endlessly and generously...

670
01:13:59,972 --> 01:14:02,720
pour everything you have

671
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,380
into one person.

672
01:14:06,967 --> 01:14:08,930
So...

673
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:12,050
when we love...

674
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:14,619
we should do it like Seo Jun Hui.

675
01:14:14,619 --> 01:14:16,393
Jun Hui.

676
01:14:18,265 --> 01:14:20,212
I love you.

677
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,675
I love you very much.

678
01:14:23,675 --> 01:14:27,681

Who are you here for?

682
01:14:46,068 --> 01:14:48,528
Is Yun Jin Ah home?

683
01:14:48,528 --> 01:14:51,371
No one lives here right now.

684
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:57,655
A woman lived here, so you won't have to fix many things either.

685
01:14:57,655 --> 01:14:59,391

Seung Ho, where's your sister?

Where's Yun Jin Ah?

696
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,265
Are you drinking again?

697
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:15,829
This is why I quit my job and came down here.

698
01:16:15,829 --> 01:16:17,839
Get over here.

699
01:16:22,605 --> 01:16:24,140
Okay.

700
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:28,190
We need such pleasures to remind us why we came to Jejudo.

701
01:16:30,697 --> 01:16:32,219
Okay.

702
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:46,095
Why are you looking at me like that?

703
01:16:47,328 --> 01:16:49,574
What's with that necklace?

704
01:16:53,242 --> 01:16:54,930
It's nothing.

705
01:17:00,938 --> 01:17:04,503
It was rolling around, so I just put it on.

706
01:17:04,503 --> 01:17:07,661
Does it have wheels? How does it roll around?

707
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:11,286
I can't throw away a perfectly good necklace.

708
01:17:11,286 --> 01:17:13,292
I can...

709
01:17:13,292 --> 01:17:16,606
only wear it because I don't have feelings anymore.

710
01:17:25,068 --> 01:17:28,050
I don't want to stir things up

711
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:31,520
when you've finally settled down...

712
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,358
Give it a try.

713
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,560
Are you really okay?

714
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,830
Isn't there anything?

715
01:17:40,067 --> 01:17:41,870
Anything like what?

716
01:17:43,349 --> 01:17:45,319
You know.

717
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:48,894
A tingle in your heart every time you hear his name.

718
01:17:50,355 --> 01:17:53,679
Can you think of a more sensible expression?

719
01:17:58,086 --> 01:18:01,257
People say this pretty often.

720
01:18:03,827 --> 01:18:06,375
"I don't think we're meant to be."

721
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:14,537
I don't have an appetite...

722
01:18:15,646 --> 01:18:18,806
I can't sleep very well...

723
01:18:20,598 --> 01:18:25,532
and I can't breathe properly pretty much every single day...

724
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:31,297
but I just want to get out of this situation.

725
01:18:33,866 --> 01:18:37,243
My words say I could die without that person...

726
01:18:38,264 --> 01:18:41,005
but the truth is, I just want to live.

727
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:47,360
So

728
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,112
