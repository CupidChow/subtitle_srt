[Episode 11]

3
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,574
You're going to Gui-dong, right?

4
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:59,275
- Yes. Please hurry.
- Okay.

5
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:24,135
How much longer?

6
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:27,012
- About...
- Go a bit slower.

7
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:29,717
- Slowly.
- What? Okay.

8
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,799
What should I do?

9
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,593
Is Gyeong Seon here?

10
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,095
No, Seung Cheol.

11
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:25,299
He comes by sometimes when he's drunk.

12
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,500
I'll send him away so don't come out.

13
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:36,828
Don't come out.

14
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,298
- Open the door.
- I'm sorry.

15
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,520
Open the door right now!

16
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,921
I won't open it. I'm sorry.

17
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:30,995
I'll send her home.

18
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:34,008
I'll go in and send her home right away.

19
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:38,409
So... please leave Noona alone.

20
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,709
What?

21
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,426
"Leave her alone"?

22
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,727
You have some nerve.

23
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,860
Did you think I'd be grateful and bow to you

24
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,294
if you protect my daughter in front of me?

25
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:54,221
Move.

26
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,922
I can be even ruder.

27
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:04,315
It's my fault. I'm the one at fault.

28
00:06:04,316 --> 00:06:06,516
So take it out on me.

29
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:13,470
I think she would be so hurt if she sees you right now.

30
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:19,490
Don't think of it as doing it for me, but please do it for your daughter.

31
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:24,137
Please look the other way this once.

32
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,319
I'll get her home soon.

33
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:32,038
I'm asking you for this favor.

What happened? Did he leave?

40
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,713
No.

41
00:07:53,713 --> 00:07:58,373
He brought a friend with him and was being stubborn.

42
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:00,144
What should I do then?

43
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:02,325
I sent him out to buy beer.

Jun Hui.

83
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:05,660
You know how much I thought of you and your sister.

84
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,383
I don't have to tell you how much I cared for you two, right?

85
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:13,717
- No, you don't.
- You know that yet you allowed this to happen?

86
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,653
Fine, fine.

87
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,768
Everyone makes mistakes.

88
00:12:19,768 --> 00:12:23,869
Who doesn't make a mistake in their lifetime?

89
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,992
Dating Jin Ah isn't a mistake.

90
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,684
Well, I'm sure it doesn't feel that way right now.

91
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:36,653
That's how you came this far.

92
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:41,332
But, Jun Hui, we need to look further ahead.

93
00:12:41,332 --> 00:12:44,534
Both you and Jin Ah have bright futures.

94
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:48,635
You can't waste precious time like this.

95
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,214
You might find my words upsetting.

96
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:59,520
Do you think I don't know that?

97
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,442
But from my point of view, this is something I have to do.

98
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:06,521
We are practically family.

99
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:11,122
Is this something that can happen between family members?

100
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:17,543
We are just dating as any ordinary man and woman would.

101
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:20,194
Can't you see it that way?

102
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,333
Can't you let it go for me?

103
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:29,201
Please understand me. I'm asking you like this.

104
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:31,845
Jun Hui. Jun Hui, I'm pleading with you.

105
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:35,774
Mother, please stop this. Mother.

106
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,654
Please sit up.

107
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,201
You understand what I'm saying, right?

108
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,802
No.

109
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,688
I know that I'm lacking in many ways.

110
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,799
Because I know that,

111
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,200
I want to show you and Jin Ah that I can make up for those failings.

112
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,875
Trust me this once and give me a chance.

113
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,237
All right, then...

114
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:34,339
It is you, after all. Why bother hiding things?

115
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:41,049
You know what kind of standards I have, don't you?

116
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,749
You can't meet my standards.

117
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,279
When people care about such standards, they're called materialistic.

118
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:55,918
Even worse, people say they only see their children as products to sell.

119
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,807
I don't care. Why? Because they're my children.

120
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:06,580
Which parent in this world wouldn't choose the best for them?

121
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,679
Most don't because they can't get it.

122
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,779
There's no one in this country who would reject it on purpose.

123
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,437
If Jin Ah's father was still working, I would have even higher standards.

124
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:23,406
Do you think I'm doing this to get something in return for raising my kids?

125
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:26,007
Not at all.

126
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:29,156
It isn't just for Jin Ah and Seung Ho, but also for the generations to come.

127
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:31,886
I want them to live an affluent life.

128
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:34,996
You need power to live in this world.

129
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:37,329
What gives you power in a capitalist society?

130
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:39,930
Where does success come from?

131
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,178
I am... I'm still young.

132
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,878
In the future...

133
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,116
You're an intelligent guy.

134
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:57,034
I know you understand what I'm saying.

135
00:15:57,034 --> 00:16:00,412
I won't tell her you gave up because I talked you out of it.

136
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:02,712
So don't be stubborn for no reason.

137
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,940
Mother, I'm sorry, but I can't give up on Noona.

138
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,582
It doesn't matter what you say.

139
00:16:11,582 --> 00:16:13,882
I can never give up on her.

140
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,353
Let's not end this with more fighting and hurtful words.

141
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:42,558
I don't feel good doing this to you, either.

142
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:46,019
Let's rid ourselves of this sooner than later.

143
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,838
Let's meet again on good terms like before.

144
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:50,639
I'm sorry.

145
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,156
I can't do as you say.

146
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,528
Do you intend to fight me to the end?

147
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,832
If that's how you interpreted it, then I guess so.

148
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,045
I... thought too highly of you.

149
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:14,280
I thought too highly of you.

150
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,606
I'm sorry.

151
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,282
I just can't be without Noona.

152
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:49,163
Why did you lie? Why?

153
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:52,215
Be quiet. Come out.

154
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,705
Did you have to do this?

155
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:58,445
Is this the level you're at, Mom?

156
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,445
Have you done something that's right?

157
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:05,075
What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong? What?

158
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:07,873
Did you do nothing wrong?

159
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:10,174
I didn't!

160
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,152
How could you?

161
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:16,505
What were you two doing? What were you doing?

162
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:18,806
It's what you're imagining.

163
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,799
Why? Do you want more detail?

164
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,156
Why, you! Move. Move!

165
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:29,666
Move! Move.

166
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,127
Stop it! Stop it!

167
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:33,870
Move!

168
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,046
Stop hitting him!

169
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:37,537
Noona.

170
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:39,610
- Noona.
- Move.

171
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:44,993
Noona, I'm okay. I'm really okay.

172
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,280
What's okay? What?

173
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:53,429
Why are you always saying you're okay?

174
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,230
Oh...

175
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,340
I'm okay.

176
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,130
I'm okay, too.

177
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,948
I can handle all of it.

178
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,278
I'll get going now.

179
00:22:56,826 --> 00:23:01,225
It looks like Jin Ah left for work already.

180
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:03,725
Did she say she had to go to work early?

181
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:08,066
Honey.

182
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:10,928
When you both went for that morning workout before,

183
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:13,311
did you really wake her from her sleep?

184
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:14,683
Of course.

185
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:17,132
Are you saying you woke her?

186
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:18,632
Yes.

187
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:24,767
You should know what you're doing.

188
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:27,668
Don't regret it later.

189
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:40,473
Section Chief Yun, it's been a long time.

190
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:42,326
I thought I would forget your face.

191
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:45,735
I came to give you a report on the store before that happened.

192
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:49,035
If the store is still in trouble, don't report that to me.

193
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,935
You're making me worry.

194
00:23:51,935 --> 00:23:56,282
Even with you at the store, we weren't sure if things would improve.

195
00:23:56,282 --> 00:23:59,368
You shouldn't date so much.

196
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:05,124
If dating kept you from work, that is grounds for punishment.

197
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:09,343
If that's the case, then I'll have to accept.

198
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:15,542
By the way, did you enjoy the movie with Senior Manager Gong?

199
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:19,223
It was a bromance film and I thought of you two so I gave you two tickets.

200
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:22,456
I forgot to mention that when I gave them to you separately.

201
00:24:22,456 --> 00:24:24,555
Did you two meet at the theater?

202
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:27,345
Well... it was good.

203
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:30,192
The movie... the movie.

204
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:31,951
I'm glad to hear that.

205
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:33,951
I envy you.

206
00:24:35,753 --> 00:24:37,653
- Let's get in.
- Yes.

207
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:47,157
What is this about?

208
00:24:48,427 --> 00:24:50,327
Yun Jin Ah is here.

209
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,472
An employee is at work. What about it?

210
00:24:53,473 --> 00:24:56,773
Chairman Jo called her to his office as soon as she arrived.

211
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,580
Do you think Yun Jin Ah is talking?

212
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,322
You said you're innocent.

213
00:25:03,323 --> 00:25:06,853
I am. All I do is get along well with the employees.

214
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:08,953
You know it well, don't you?

215
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,280
Don't you know me?

216
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:14,233
What good does it do if I know?

217
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:17,734
It matters what the female employees think.

218
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,520
Wh-What do you think they're thinking?

219
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:27,286
Instead of thinking about that, shouldn't you find a way to survive?

220
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:30,664
"A way to survive"?

221
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:33,964
How do you think I can get out of this?

222
00:25:40,863 --> 00:25:42,590
Director Nam?

223
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:45,984
Yes.

224
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,620
It needs to be someone at the executive level.

225
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,715
Then this issue won't last long, right?

226
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:56,879
I know many women who are victims of Director Nam.

227
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:01,438
Thank you. Thank you.

228
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:23,222
Well, I think I need to check it again later.

229
00:26:23,223 --> 00:26:28,111
I wouldn't say I'm happy, but it's heading in the right direction.

230
00:26:28,111 --> 00:26:30,515
I'll work harder.

231
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:32,752
You should come back now.

232
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:35,554
We can't leave someone like you out there.

233
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:38,906
Thank you for the compliment.

234
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:40,551
Do you not want to come back?

235
00:26:40,552 --> 00:26:43,253
Your reaction is a bit bitter.

236
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:47,423
It isn't that.

237
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:54,062
Regarding the issues the female employees have faced,

238
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:56,662
is it actually much worse than they say?

239
00:26:58,393 --> 00:27:04,293
All this time, I just ignored things so we get along.

240
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:10,382
Honestly, I'm reflecting a lot on my own actions.

241
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:15,122
So it's hard for me to say anything at the moment.

242
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:16,723
However...

243
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:21,367
I do plan on speaking up.

244
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:26,313
Yes, you should. That's the right thing.

"Your lipstick color is especially provocative today."

248
00:27:48,342 --> 00:27:51,192
"You smiled at me at the karaoke yesterday." A heart?

249
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:53,339
Hey, you ought to curse back at these messages.

250
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,492
Do you really want to reply with a smiley face?

251
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:58,101
We have to reply with something to get them to stop.

252
00:27:58,101 --> 00:27:59,623
Gosh, they're so nasty.

253
00:27:59,623 --> 00:28:01,916
I really think I'm going to vomit.

254
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:03,717
What is this?

255
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:08,608
It always happens during company dinners.

256
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:13,486
Maybe I've become used to it. I stopped noticing it one day.

257
00:28:14,496 --> 00:28:18,196
So I don't really recall anything in particular.

258
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,170
There's nothing you can do about that.

259
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,184
The thing is...

260
00:28:26,112 --> 00:28:28,612
I'm a little worried about you guys.

261
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:31,842
What?

262
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:36,350
Just because of a few dirty people...

263
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:42,800
the image of innocent male employees is being ruined, and they have to bear it.

264
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,883
Honestly, I think that's what the chairman is most worried about too.

265
00:28:46,883 --> 00:28:50,420
- The chairman?
- Yes.

266
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,120
Let's just hope that things work out.

267
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,949
It has to. What can we do?

268
00:28:55,949 --> 00:29:01,960
If something unfair happens to you guys... what can we do?

269
00:29:10,844 --> 00:29:12,144
Excuse me.

270
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:15,815
Yes?

271
00:29:15,816 --> 00:29:19,080
- I didn't film this on purpose.
- Yes.

272
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,598
I was just filming it for fun during the company dinner.

273
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:25,798
Yes, what is it?

274
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:47,066
I'm doing this for you girls, how can you just back out?

275
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:50,943
It isn't that we want to, but what if things don't work out?

276
00:29:50,944 --> 00:29:54,165
We would just become the topic of an embarrassing conversation.

277
00:29:54,165 --> 00:29:56,918
There's no guarantee we won't face backlash at work.

278
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:59,545
What if we get fired?

279
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:02,403
Even if we don't get fired, people will stare at us.

280
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:04,403
I'll probably end up leaving on my own.

281
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:05,580
That's true.

282
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,980
It's hard to get a new job and even if you do, rumors will follow.

283
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:16,070
Section Chief Kang, what do you think we should do?

284
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,256
We should hope that things work out.

285
00:30:19,257 --> 00:30:22,366
Why don't I sense even a bit of sincerity?

286
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:25,727

haven't directly been victimized.

They have their own situations to think of.

290

I don't think we should force anyone.

291
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,730
I think we should take some time and think about it.

292

Then let's think about it and discuss later.

So do you want her to quit a job she's doing well at?

329
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:23,036
You're getting worse and worse.

330
00:35:23,036 --> 00:35:25,744
Also, do you think getting a job is easy these days?

331
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:28,715
That's why I want you to use your connections somehow.

332
00:35:28,716 --> 00:35:31,110
Stop saying such nonsense.

333
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:38,740
How can you have worked for over thirty years and not have any proper connections?

334
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,785
If you were employed and had a good job,

335
00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:46,436
a kid like Jun Hui wouldn't even dare to look at our Jin Ah.

336
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:52,157
How lowly did he think of our family to think that we were the same as his?

337
00:35:52,157 --> 00:35:56,178
Yes, it's all my fault. It's my fault. What should I do?

338
00:35:56,178 --> 00:35:59,226
Should I make a resume and go look for a job?

339
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:01,025
It would be good if someone hired you.

340
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:05,310
You really shouldn't be like this. You shouldn't!

341
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:10,789
It's nothing to get mad over.

342
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:39,809
My goodness!

343
00:36:58,274 --> 00:37:02,303
Is it too much? Nothing stands out.

344
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,863
Are they asking for anything else in China?

345
00:37:04,863 --> 00:37:07,352
Nothing else regarding this.

346
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,332
We need to talk to them.

347
00:37:09,332 --> 00:37:11,494
When is someone from our side going there?

348
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:13,903
Once they're all set for it.

349
00:37:13,903 --> 00:37:17,103
We still have some time.

350
00:37:20,352 --> 00:37:24,128
Are you still unwilling to go, even if we beat you to death?

351
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:25,528
Yes.

352
00:37:25,528 --> 00:37:27,594
Hey, this is an organization–

353
00:37:27,594 --> 00:37:30,495
I was in the U.S. for three years.

354
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:35,335
I have to finish some things. I'll head out.

355
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:41,517
Ever since he got a girlfriend, he doesn't care about anything else.

356
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:44,204
- Right?
- Yes.

357
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:46,705
I can't stand to watch them.

358
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,510
Jeez.

359
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,850
Hey, Seo Jun Hui.

360
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,731
There's a limit to rebelling.

361
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:08,191
What if you really get fired?

362
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:09,812
Then I'll get fired.

363
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:11,831
Excuse me.

364
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,731
Even if you're crazy, keep your craziness in check.

365
00:38:15,653 --> 00:38:18,353
Do you think I can control that?

366
00:38:24,562 --> 00:38:26,930
Do you happen to have any time?

367
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:29,535
Why?

368
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,601
Yum, yum.

369
00:38:42,484 --> 00:38:44,484
You startled me.

370
00:38:47,721 --> 00:38:50,521
Gosh, they are both weird.

371
00:39:17,615 --> 00:39:21,830
I know you'll say not much happened with your mom, so I won't ask.

372
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,588
It wasn't just nothing much. Literally nothing happened.

373
00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:27,389
That's a relief.

374
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:32,589
She must have been very understanding.

375
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:40,253
Don't force yourself to talk that way.

376
00:39:40,968 --> 00:39:44,931
You can get angry if you want. You can curse out my mom.

377
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:47,369
I can accept all of it.

378
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:50,032
"What's so great about Yun Jin Ah that you look down on me?"

379
00:39:50,032 --> 00:39:53,599
Curse and get mad. I won't get angry at all.

380
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,699
I won't be upset, I can take it.

381
00:39:57,715 --> 00:40:00,215
For the first time, you don't look pretty.

382
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:06,215
I know what kind of person you are.

383
00:40:06,215 --> 00:40:08,985
You're saying mean things because of me.

384
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:13,195
You look like you're planning to be worse at home.

385
00:40:13,195 --> 00:40:17,195
Don't do that. It makes me feel uncomfortable.

386
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:22,883
It's because I'm upset.

387
00:40:22,883 --> 00:40:26,380
When I see you act and say things you don't mean...

388
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,230
I told you, I'm okay, no matter what.

389
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:35,490
If it keeps you from being hurt, I'm okay with whatever it is.

390
00:40:36,385 --> 00:40:39,315
Should I just watch you go through a hard time?

391
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:43,115
Why would you just be watching? You would be by my side.

392
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:54,396
Like this?

393
00:40:55,222 --> 00:40:57,677
Yes, like this.

394
00:40:57,678 --> 00:41:00,518
I look pretty again, right?

395
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:02,308
Yes, you're so pretty, I could die.

396
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:05,596
You can't die without my permission.

397
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:08,097
Then what can I do?

398
00:41:10,227 --> 00:41:12,227
Nothing.

399
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,928
Stay still!

400
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:19,697
Do you see? Seo Jun Hui's arms and legs now move on my command.

401
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:21,765
- Seriously!
- Lift up your right leg.

402
00:41:21,765 --> 00:41:23,712
Lift your left arm.

403
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,312
- That's your right arm.
- I just can't win with Yun Jin Ah.

404
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:28,843
Were you trying to win?

405
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:31,643
It isn't that.

406
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:39,139
What was that?

407
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,639
Were you worried that some woman who can't know about us would walk by?

408
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:48,351
You're crazy!

409
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:52,420
What? What?

410
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:55,821
A man you can't get caught by must be walking by.

411
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:58,906
Wait, wait.

412
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:01,099
Why wait? Come here, come here.

413
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:02,628
Okay, okay.

414
00:42:02,629 --> 00:42:04,629
"Okay"?

415
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,940
[Incheon Airport Maglev]

416
00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:03,729
Thank you.

417
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:44,068
Where are you going?

418
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:47,068
I'm going to meet Gyeong Seon for a bit.

419
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:51,084
You can come with me.

420
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:55,371
Take your medicine. I won't be late.

421
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,248
If something disappears from here, it was me.

422
00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:26,040
If you're going to steal, take it all.

423
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,640
You're such a bonehead.

424
00:44:31,256 --> 00:44:34,578
Are you dating Yun Jin Ah because you're so smart?

425
00:44:34,578 --> 00:44:37,678
Why are you dating her anyway?

426
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:43,243
Because she's pretty.

427
00:44:46,086 --> 00:44:48,186
That guy...

428
00:44:52,821 --> 00:44:54,889
You should call me.

429
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:58,489
It feels like you're mad at me.

430
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:02,079
I'm being careful. That's all.

431
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,678
It's obvious you'll get nagged by your mom for seeing me.

432
00:45:07,678 --> 00:45:10,660
What nagging?

433
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:15,478
So will you keep this up?

434
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:20,579
I'm keeping you out of trouble. It's better if I don't call.

435
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,630
You and Jun Hui must have been born for my sake.

436
00:45:28,814 --> 00:45:32,275
I was a General in my past life who saved you and Jun Hui.

437
00:45:32,276 --> 00:45:35,337
So you two are repaying me for it now.

438
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:38,237
Should we start by hitting you?

439
00:45:39,138 --> 00:45:41,638
I'm being serious.

440
00:45:42,676 --> 00:45:45,707
Who thinks of me this much?

441
00:45:45,707 --> 00:45:48,507
All while enduring their difficulties.

442
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:54,138
Is Jun Hui having a hard time?

443
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,346
If only he would tell me...

444
00:46:09,524 --> 00:46:13,158
Should we have just one drink, Friend?

445
00:46:13,158 --> 00:46:16,157
Shall we do that, Friend?

446
00:46:16,157 --> 00:46:19,595
Go bring the drinks.

447
00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:21,797
"Just one drink"?

448
00:46:22,523 --> 00:46:24,596
Hey, tell her let's bet.

449
00:46:24,596 --> 00:46:27,097
Seung Ho wants to bet.

450
00:46:27,796 --> 00:46:32,430
Yun Jin Ah, don't get into trouble and go home.

451
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,330
Did you hear that?

452
00:46:35,343 --> 00:46:39,343
Okay. Don't drink too much.

453
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,730
Yes, just one drink.

454
00:46:43,513 --> 00:46:46,913
Okay, I'll call you later.

455
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,110
♫ Doing things that you don't ♫

456
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:54,772
Gosh, stop it.

457
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:56,072
Oh, right.

458
00:46:56,073 --> 00:47:00,320
I shouldn't have come here. How annoying.

459
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,420
People really ought to listen to their mothers.

460
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,421
My mom told me not to hang out with you.

461
00:47:09,897 --> 00:47:12,997
How did such a mama's boy disobey her?

462
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:16,188
Hey.

463
00:47:16,188 --> 00:47:20,312
I'll give you a tip from now on.

464
00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:24,606
Most moms in the world like a role.

465
00:47:24,606 --> 00:47:27,486
That's why I play the mama's boy.

466
00:47:27,486 --> 00:47:32,318
I pretend I'm not fully grown so she thinks I still need her.

467
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:36,318
On the outside, she's lecturing me, but inside she's feeling proud.

468
00:47:38,176 --> 00:47:41,421
So what's your tip?

469
00:47:41,421 --> 00:47:45,056
Actually, this is more for Yun Jin Ah, not you.

470
00:47:45,057 --> 00:47:48,076
She needs to pretend to depend on Mom and ask for her opinion.

471
00:47:48,077 --> 00:47:52,177
Then slowly manipulate her while acting like a thoughtless daughter.

472
00:47:52,177 --> 00:47:54,842
Though she is actually thoughtless.

473
00:47:55,767 --> 00:47:58,367
It will work.

474
00:47:59,566 --> 00:48:05,032
You know your mom very well, but you don't know your sister.

475
00:48:05,032 --> 00:48:06,528
What about her?

476
00:48:06,528 --> 00:48:08,528
Everything.

477
00:48:10,077 --> 00:48:11,899
This guy.

478
00:48:11,899 --> 00:48:14,164
What? Did Yun Jin Ah change?

479
00:48:14,164 --> 00:48:16,694
Gosh, as if!

480
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:19,186
Today it's because of Seo Gyeong Seon.

481
00:48:19,186 --> 00:48:20,884
It's because of Yun Jin Ah.

482
00:48:20,884 --> 00:48:22,405
No, it's not.

483
00:48:22,406 --> 00:48:25,206
How much could you really know about Yun Jin Ah?

484
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:28,896
- How about you?
- Hey, I'm her brother.

485
00:48:28,896 --> 00:48:31,396
I'm her boyfriend.

486
00:48:34,505 --> 00:48:37,429
Are you going to go there now?

487
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,476
Hey, should I call you brother-in-law?

488
00:48:40,477 --> 00:48:45,554
- Hey, hey!
- What? "Brother-in-law"?

489
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:49,956
- Sorry, Brother-in-law.

Seung Ho.

00:50:56,393 --> 00:51:01,166
I've never asked you for a favor of any kind, right?

525
00:51:02,008 --> 00:51:04,056
Why so serious?

526
00:51:04,057 --> 00:51:07,027
Okay, you want me to be there for Jun Hui, right?

527
00:51:07,027 --> 00:51:09,120
No, Jin Ah.

528
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:14,021
Be there for Jin Ah and help her. That would help Jun Hui, too.

529
00:51:15,078 --> 00:51:19,628
Well, I know what you mean.

530
00:51:19,628 --> 00:51:21,809
I'm sure you must've thought about it.

531
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:24,709
Jin Ah and Jun Hui...

532
00:51:25,746 --> 00:51:28,172
I don't know what will happen to them.

533
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:29,711
That's how I feel.

534
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:33,380
I will never lose my friend, Yun Jin Ah.

535
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,568
No matter what happens.

536
00:51:36,568 --> 00:51:41,177
That's what I'm going to do, so you do that, too.

537
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:45,844
Usually, in these situations, people say, "I hope you do that, too."

538
00:51:45,845 --> 00:51:47,935
Just do it if I tell you to.

539
00:51:47,935 --> 00:51:50,145
I don't like Seo Jun Hui that much.

540
00:51:50,146 --> 00:51:52,134
Just stay by him even if you don't like him.

541
00:51:52,134 --> 00:51:54,863
Don't get closer to any other friends either.

542
00:51:54,863 --> 00:52:00,180
What kind of nonsense is that? I also have my own thoughts and preferences.

543
00:52:02,557 --> 00:52:05,557
Do you dislike Jun Hui that much?

544
00:52:06,428 --> 00:52:10,728
Even if I get on my knees and beg?

545
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:13,649
Seung Ho, I'm sincerely asking you.

546
00:52:13,649 --> 00:52:16,831
- Oh, why are you doing this?
- You terrible kid.

547
00:52:16,832 --> 00:52:18,972
You punk!

548
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:22,973
Just say yes when I tell you to do it. How dare you talk back to me.

549
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,073
- Will you play with my Jun Hui or not?
- Stop. Stop that.

550
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:29,093
My gosh.

551
00:52:29,093 --> 00:52:32,593
Let's not betray each other, okay?

552
00:52:33,709 --> 00:52:35,909
Cheers.

♫ Save it, save ♫

554
00:54:07,253 --> 00:54:11,162
I'm not forcing you to make a statement.

555
00:54:11,162 --> 00:54:14,170
I won't blame you, whatever you decide to do.

556
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,871
However...

557
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:22,228
I feel I've placed a heavy burden on you so I don't feel good about it.

558
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:30,593
I am Section Chief Yun Jin Ah of the Franchise Operations team.

559
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:34,911
I've been working as a supervisor for the past ten years.

560
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:39,212
I'm writing about the incidents I have endured during that time.

561
00:55:45,063 --> 00:55:48,801
Everything I'm writing is the truth.

562
00:55:48,801 --> 00:55:52,502
I'm prepared to attest to that at any time.

563
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:08,029
- Oh.
- Oh, hello.

564
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:11,608
You must be doing the housework since your mom hurt her arm.

565
00:56:11,609 --> 00:56:13,956
Well, not that much.

566
00:56:13,956 --> 00:56:16,350
You could get married.

567
00:56:17,035 --> 00:56:19,156
- Go on in.
- Yes, bye.

568
00:56:19,156 --> 00:56:20,957
Bye.

569
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:36,109
What's the big deal? Why are you three working?

570
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:38,100
You can sit down.

571
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,501
- I'll just do this.
- Sit. You're giving me a headache.

572
00:56:54,793 --> 00:56:56,693
It's today at 3:00 p.m.

573
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,255
I told you about the blind date.

574
00:56:59,255 --> 00:57:02,056
I told you to make time on the weekend.

575
00:57:03,282 --> 00:57:06,182
I've made the arrangements so just go.

576
00:57:06,182 --> 00:57:08,150
- Come on, Mom.
- Be quiet!

577
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:11,955
No one better get involved in her marriage issues from now on.

578
00:57:11,955 --> 00:57:15,206
Mom, are you pretending to be from a rich family?

579
00:57:15,206 --> 00:57:18,446
People meet on social media lately. What's with the blind date?

580
00:57:18,446 --> 00:57:22,098
That's what rich families do when they match-make their children.

581
00:57:22,098 --> 00:57:24,287
Just shut your mouth.

582
00:57:24,287 --> 00:57:26,088
It's at 3:00 p.m.

583
00:57:27,151 --> 00:57:29,252
I have plans.

584
00:57:29,252 --> 00:57:31,053
What?

585
00:57:31,053 --> 00:57:34,129
Didn't you hear me? I have a prior engagement.

586
00:57:34,129 --> 00:57:36,030
Don't play around.

587
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,700
Mom.

588
00:57:42,438 --> 00:57:44,511
You better listen to me.

589
00:57:44,511 --> 00:57:47,161
Don't listen. You don't need to listen to your mom.

590
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:50,752
You'll get in big trouble with me if you do!

591
00:57:50,752 --> 00:57:52,380
What do you think you're doing?

592
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,917
You're the one who didn't even ask for Jin Ah's opinion.

593
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:58,583
She may be your child, but must you always control what she does?

594
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,958
Why are you acting so uncultured?

595
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:02,442
"Uncultured"?

596
00:58:02,442 --> 00:58:04,492
Why, you... do you think you can just say anything?

597
00:58:04,493 --> 00:58:06,893
Yes! What will you do?

598
00:58:06,893 --> 00:58:08,400
Dad.

599
00:58:09,088 --> 00:58:10,435
You're the same.

600
00:58:10,435 --> 00:58:13,935
Why can't you clearly say no and that you don't want to?

601
00:58:15,026 --> 00:58:16,773
I'm saying this as the head of this family.

602
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:19,871
From now on, we will prioritize individual freedom.

603
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:23,072
Anyone who opposes it, get out of my house.

604
00:58:43,277 --> 00:58:45,978
You went way overboard this time.

605
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:55,897
How is it my concern if you want to cook for her?

606
00:58:55,897 --> 00:58:58,339
Is Yun Jin Ah my girlfriend?

607
00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:00,440
She can't be.

608
00:59:01,013 --> 00:59:04,212
- Seriously.
- I'm not good at picking out ingredients.

609
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:05,390
Go grocery shopping with me.

610
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:08,511
Why are you dating my friend? I can't even insult her.

611
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,991
What's there to insult? She's just cute.

612
00:59:10,991 --> 00:59:14,392
- Again?
- Oh, phone. Your phone.

613
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,929
Why aren't you picking up?

614
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:28,741
It's an important call. Go home.

615
00:59:28,741 --> 00:59:30,342
Hurry.

616
01:00:06,347 --> 01:00:08,205
Yes, hello.

617
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:10,546
- Where are you going?
- Oh.

618
01:00:10,546 --> 01:00:12,599
To run an errand for Mom.

619
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:14,191
Should I go with you?

620
01:00:14,191 --> 01:00:16,472
No.

621
01:00:16,472 --> 01:00:18,072
When are you coming back?

622
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,030
I won't be too late.

623
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:23,290
Let's have dinner instead of lunch.

624
01:00:23,291 --> 01:00:26,291
Well, that's not important.

625
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:31,360
Okay, call me when you're done.

626
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,210
I'm sorry.

627
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:34,624
Why?

628
01:00:34,624 --> 01:00:37,174
For breaking my promise.

629
01:00:38,057 --> 01:00:40,969
You're not breaking it. You're just delaying the time.

630
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:42,869
Nonetheless.

631
01:00:45,182 --> 01:00:47,171
Are you sure I shouldn't come along?

632
01:00:47,171 --> 01:00:50,730
There are lots of things I know how to do alone.

633
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:53,235
Oh my. I'm proud of you.

634
01:00:53,236 --> 01:00:57,137
I'll call you. Don't cry and wait for me.

635
01:00:59,751 --> 01:01:00,722
Stop.

636
01:01:00,722 --> 01:01:03,822
Okay. Call me.

637
01:01:22,608 --> 01:01:26,908
I can't go grocery shopping with you. Something came up at the store.

638
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:45,000
[Rosemont]

639
01:02:03,472 --> 01:02:06,947
Our Jin Ah is such a good daughter.

640
01:02:06,947 --> 01:02:10,409
You're doing something you don't want so you don't hurt Mom.

641
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:13,209
You're all grown up. You're a grown-up.

642
01:02:14,747 --> 01:02:19,666
Yes, just think of it as going out for a bit to keep Mom from being upset.

643
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:25,614
Rather than fighting with her, if you continue like this, things will go in the direction you want.

644
01:02:25,614 --> 01:02:27,685
Dad.

645
01:02:27,685 --> 01:02:31,443
I know you want to help me.

646
01:02:31,443 --> 01:02:34,552
It's harder for me if that's how you do it.

647
01:02:34,552 --> 01:02:36,544
I meant what I said.

648
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,972
I know.

649
01:02:38,972 --> 01:02:43,421
Dad, I know that, but there's only one thing I want.

650
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:45,640
I want people to stop taking an interest in me.

651
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,611
Whether it's home, work, or wherever, I wish people would leave me alone.

652
01:02:49,611 --> 01:02:53,711
I would like nothing more than to not be put in the center of things.

653
01:02:56,052 --> 01:03:00,174
Also, today isn't for Mom.

654
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:02,621
Sorry, but it's not for you either.

655
01:03:02,621 --> 01:03:04,860
It's for Jun Hui.

656
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,760
I'm going for Jun Hui.

657
01:03:19,658 --> 01:03:21,658
I'll get going then.

658
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:39,086
I'll be at the store for a bit.

659
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:40,886
Wait.

660
01:03:42,104 --> 01:03:44,282
Are you going to the store like this?

661
01:03:44,282 --> 01:03:47,481
What? It's just something I had.

662
01:03:50,921 --> 01:03:52,892
I have to go. I'll tell you once I'm back.

663
01:03:52,892 --> 01:03:56,093
Tell me before you go so I don't follow you.

664
01:03:57,941 --> 01:03:59,941
Our father is here.

665
01:04:01,994 --> 01:04:03,923
So?

666
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,623
He wants to see me.

667
01:04:06,863 --> 01:04:08,202
And so?

668
01:04:08,202 --> 01:04:11,128
Why do you keep asking that? I have to hear him out to know.

669
01:04:11,128 --> 01:04:13,850
Why would you hear him out at all? What's the point?

670
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,780
So I can kill him or let him live!

671
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,760
I feel so wronged by him that I can't just let it go.

672
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,629
I have to see him sometime and say my piece.

673
01:04:20,629 --> 01:04:22,829
I'll be back.

674
01:05:39,912 --> 01:05:43,726
Yun Jin Ah. What are you doing here?

675
01:05:43,726 --> 01:05:45,526
Gyeong Seon.

676
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,660
Don't tell me...

677
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:52,405
Oh, for crying out loud.

678
01:05:52,405 --> 01:05:54,205
Gyeong Seon.

679
01:05:55,204 --> 01:05:59,086
Could you keep this from Jun Hui?

680
01:05:59,086 --> 01:06:01,233
Jun Hui knows about it.

681
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:02,635
How does he know?

682
01:06:02,635 --> 01:06:05,672
Did Seung Ho already tell him I'm being set up on a blind date?

683
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:07,425
What?

684
01:06:07,425 --> 01:06:10,316
Wasn't it my father who called you? "A blind date"?

685
01:06:10,316 --> 01:06:13,180
Are you here for a blind date?

686
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:16,046
Yun Jin Ah, are you crazy?

687
01:06:16,046 --> 01:06:17,916
Are you in your right mind?

688
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:21,625
What about Jun Hui? What is he to you?

689
01:06:21,626 --> 01:06:24,378
Gyeong Seon, the truth is–

690
01:06:24,378 --> 01:06:26,678
End things with Jun Hui.

691
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:50,170
♫ Sometimes it's hard to be a woman ♫

692
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:57,880
♫ Givin' all your love to just one man ♫

693
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,028
- Aren't you Jin Ah?
- Going on that date means her family looks down on you.

694
01:07:02,028 --> 01:07:04,564
They don't even acknowledge your existence.

695
01:07:04,564 --> 01:07:06,006
Is Seo Jun Hui leaving the country again?

696
01:07:06,006 --> 01:07:07,588
Section Chief Yun must not have known.

697
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:10,109
Once Seo Jun Hui says no, you can't beat him to change his mind.

698
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:13,682
If this gets exposed, I don't know if Yun Jin Ah will be okay.

699
01:07:13,682 --> 01:07:15,211
Director Nam, are you okay?

700
01:07:15,211 --> 01:07:17,561
Can I see Jun Hui?

701
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:20,961
What else can I do for you?

702
01:07:22,192 --> 01:07:24,146
Why didn't you call?

703
01:07:24,146 --> 01:07:26,180
I was scared.

704
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:28,641
That I would get angry?

705
01:07:28,641 --> 01:07:30,501
That you wouldn't pick up my call.

706
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:32,601
I'm going to do what I want.

707
01:07:33,271 --> 01:07:35,331
With what?

708
01:07:35,331 --> 01:07:38,364
Loving and adoring Yun Jin Ah.

709
01:07:38,364 --> 01:07:40,199
Is that not allowed?

710
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:45,870
♫ Oh, be proud of him ♫
