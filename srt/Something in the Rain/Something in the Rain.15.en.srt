[Episode 15]

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,700
It is clean.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,340
It's perfect for those living alone.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,259
Someone saw it this morning.

5
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,589
That person liked it so much and said they'd sign tonight.

6
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:22,658
I put that person off for a bit.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,888
I'll go with this place.

8
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:30,392
Oh, will you?

9
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:34,751
Then should we do it today?

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,310
Yes, I'll do that.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,541
One moment, please.

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,948
Yes?

13
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:54,577
Where are you?

14
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,617
Oh, I'm at a store.

15
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:59,742
When are you finished?

16
00:00:59,742 --> 00:01:02,786
Oh, I-I don't know.

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,371
- Why?
- My business trip.

18
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:10,934
It has been delayed. I'm going tomorrow. We should see each other.

19
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:13,261
Oh.

20
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:15,682
What's with your reaction?

21
00:01:15,682 --> 00:01:20,145
Since you're leaving, I was wondering where we should eat.

22
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:22,438
I want you to eat something good before you go.

23
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:24,586
Are you my mom?

24
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:26,445
I'm your noona.

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,100
Did you wait long?

26
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,901
You said you were almost here, so I ordered already.

27
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:48,184
Oh, good.

28
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,120
Were you busy? You didn't send me any messages all day.

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,751
Oh, I was so busy all day.

30
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:04,160
I hope you'll be busy while I'm on my business trip too.

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,651
Why?

32
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,445
So you won't think about anything else.

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,041
"Anything else"? Like what?

34
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:17,881
I'm worried you'll be scared and worried about the issue of your move alone.

35
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:21,036
Let's talk about it once I get back.

36
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,458
I told you that you're enough.

37
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:29,111
Don't think that you must do something for me.

38
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,661
It is not that I want to. It is that I have to.

39
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:36,016
Whatever I can do, I'll do everything.

40
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,883
Have you ever thought about quitting your job?

41
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,607
What are you talking about?

42
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,457
Well...

43
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,300
I was going to bring it up after my business trip.

44
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,434
But I put in a request to work at the U.S. office.

45
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,205
I don't know the exact date yet.

46
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:03,200
At the latest, it would be the end of the year.

47
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,477
Do you want me to quit my job and go with you?

48
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,570
I think that would be the best thing now.

49
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,439
In what way?

50
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,728
I know it is sudden.

51
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,894
Are you asking me to run away?

52
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,027
I like to think we are putting the problem behind us.

53
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,825
I told you that I'm okay with things even now.

54
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,740
I'm not.

55
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,714
Why do we need to go so far? We can just live here together.

56
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:48,473
You asked me if I was crazy.

57
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:51,714
Do you think going to the U.S. is sensible?

58
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:54,176
You said all you needed was me.

59
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:56,054
Yes.

60
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,911
That also meant that I'm happy with how things are now.

61
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:02,111
I said I don't feel that way.

62
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,883
I can't stand to see you running around and hurting yourself.

63
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,455
Let's talk again once I get back from my business trip.

64
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,140
Okay.

65
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,290
Don't go through it on your own and suffer.

66
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,278
Be well while I'm gone.

67
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:17,860
Okay.

68
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,864
Have a good trip.

69
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,311
Go on in.

70
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,561
Bye.

[Rental Contract]

72
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,236
Hi.

73
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,787
- You're here.
- Yes.

74
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,836
Good morning.

75
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,420
Hello.

76
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,254
Yes, Gyeong Seon.

77
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,284
Though it may sound like I'm blaming Jun Hui...

78
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:56,778
I can't do anything about that.

79
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,263
I think Jun Hui felt very pressured because I was in this situation.

80
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:05,333
He let his feelings go too far.

81
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,174
He probably didn't think it through before he said it.

82
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,929
He isn't someone who is hasty.

83
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:14,097
If he was being rash, would he have spoken to me about it?

84
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:17,299
He would have just told the landlord that he is moving out.

85
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,159
What are you two up to anyway?

86
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,741
I know this may be annoying to hear.

87
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,566
But don't group us together.

88
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,994
Is Jun Hui sticking his neck out alone because he wants to live with Yun Jin Ah?

89
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,006
If anything, I want it more.

90
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:45,709
Honestly...

91
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,190
whether I get beat up by my mom and dad,

92
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,757
or you pull my hair out, I'm not scared.

93
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:58,299
Just like Jun Hui wants...

94
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:02,371
I want to pretend that we can't win.

95
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,490
When I'm hiding behind Jun Hui...

96
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,060
maybe I will be safe.

97
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,422
I have thought that way.

98
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:21,209
But...

99
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:27,183
I'm just not that selfish.

100
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:32,644
On the outside, I say I don't want Jun Hui to get cursed at.

101
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:36,478
I use sad excuses like that.

102
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:39,357
But I'm actually making sure that I get what I want.

103
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:43,377
I still have a lot that I want to do.

104
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:51,039
I can't throw that all away and go all in with Jun Hui.

105
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:58,215
I want to date like I am right now.

106
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:03,556
I'll continue doing what I need and want to do.

107
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:16,021
Should I be thanking you or telling you that you're annoying?

108
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,525
I'm sorry.

109
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:25,229
This is all I amount to.

110
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,775
Look at me.

111
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:40,146
Have you changed or did I not know you?

112
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:48,377
Whichever you choose...

113
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:52,322
I would be thankful if you think of it in a good way.

114
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,553
I can be disappointed in Yun Jin Ah, can't I?

115
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:08,372
Is it that bad?

116
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:14,819
I can't stand to be here any longer.

117
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,459
You said it yourself.

118
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:24,709
You're putting yourself before Jun Hui.

119
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:26,958
You better stand by those words.

00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:16,725
Okay.

Yes.

It is me.

Yes.

126
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:47,171
How long were you going to be in a bad mood?

127
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,802
It wasn't just me.

What are you doing on your day off?

I'm just... just doing nothing.

You feel like dying without me, right?

131
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:02,555
It is so relaxing that I could die.

132
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,306
I miss you so much that I could die.

Amazing.

Did Yun Jin Ah really leave?

151
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:05,637
Sit down if you haven't eaten.

What about Mom?

153
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:11,936
She must have no appetite.

154
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:23,911
Jun Hui... have you heard anything from him?

155
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:25,551
Like what?

156
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:28,615
I only know that he is in China on a business trip.

157
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:31,990
Oh, the move...

158
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:35,524
Do you think Yun Jin Ah did it without even telling him?

159
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:42,800
I thought she seemed to be rushing it.

160
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:45,861
She caused trouble again.

Seriously.

162
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,948
Don't go telling Jun Hui about it.

163

I wouldn't tell him even if you told me to.

164
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,396
He'd come flying over if he knew.

Dad... do something about Mom, would you?

166
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:09,651
It won't do her any good to continue provoking them.

167

I'm just saying, he may not show it, but Seo Jun Hui's pride is at its limit.

00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,775
He doesn't get stepped on anywhere.

169
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:20,938
He is doing everything he can to endure it because it is our family.

170
00:20:20,938 --> 00:20:25,159
How long do you think that will last? He is a person, too.

171
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:39,986
How come there's no end to your stuff even though you live alone?

172
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:43,057
I know.

173
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:45,662
I made you suffer on your day off. What should I do?

174
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:50,138
Once I get paid, I'll treat you to something really good.

175
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:52,339
Immature young lady.

176
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:54,686
Rent, water...

177
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,807
Also, electricity, gas, and so on. What will you do about that?

178
00:20:57,807 --> 00:20:59,849
I already feel overwhelmed.

179
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,815
Over just that?

180
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:04,251
What else?

181
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:08,133
Work, house, Seo Jun Hui...

182
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,579
Eat, eat.

183
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:16,682
Do you think you can do it?

184
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,636
I'll have to do it.

185
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:26,855
I like your false confidence.

186
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:30,484
Use that to survive.

187
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:34,530
Yes.

188
00:21:57,411 --> 00:21:58,999
Yes.

189
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:03,256
Good. You made it very well.

190
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:06,492
A lawyer will meet with Yun Jin Ah.

191
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,288
That's good then.

192
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:13,908
What will happen with Senior Manager Gong?

193
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:18,955
- With these issues...
- Yes.

194
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:22,178
they need to be tied up in order to be finished.

195
00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:24,029
Yes.

196
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:30,779
Once things are tied up, I...

197
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,244
you know.

198
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:38,270
You need to move up from being a senior manager.

199
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,125
It's not good to be at one job for too long.

200
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:45,908
- Well.
- With these issues...

201
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,159
it shouldn't be dragged out.

202
00:22:52,828 --> 00:22:55,356
I will take care of it quickly, Director.

203
00:22:57,822 --> 00:23:01,117
I understand you feel like you represent the female employees.

204
00:23:01,117 --> 00:23:04,791
Nothing good will come from rumors circulating externally.

205
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,019
We need to think of the company's image.

206
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:10,148
It's not that I don't know that.

207
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:12,123
For the sake of trust in the company,

208
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:15,270
I believe a legitimate punishment is necessary.

209
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:17,027
We decided on a fact-finding committee.

210
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,828
Is that after Director Nam gets away with it?

211
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:27,138
Do you want the company to face major embarrassment?

212
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:32,006
That isn't enough. Will you only be satisfied once it's completely destroyed?

213
00:23:32,006 --> 00:23:34,869
We need to minimize the risk as much as possible.

214
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:38,367
Must we close because of one or two people?

215
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:42,363
You should be able to stay objective as a manager!

216
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:46,518
I complimented you too much...

217
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:50,049
Do you think I gave you that job to listen to female employees whine?

218
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:55,221
Jeong Yeong In... get it together.

219
00:23:58,788 --> 00:24:00,143
You have to take the punishment.

220
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:02,609
Just shut your eyes and make a public apology.

221
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,024
That's easy to say.

222
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:10,235
You know this could get bigger after the fact-finding committee.

223
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:11,411
Do you want to go to court over this?

224
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:14,432
I have a lot of evidence too. There's a lot that's unfair for me!

225
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:17,163
Think about your family.

226
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:21,056
It is better to have things be unfair once than to be unemployed.

227
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:29,471
Even if I make a public apology, there will be some sort of discipline.

228
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:33,134
Listen, it won't go as far as a resignation.

229
00:24:33,134 --> 00:24:34,855
Only if you end things quietly.

230
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:38,212
Things will be arranged so you don't end up in a department with Yun Jin Ah.

231
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:43,002
If things don't work out, I will ask them for the favor myself.

232
00:24:44,603 --> 00:24:49,731
You never have an interest in other people, but you're really interested in this.

233
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:53,910
You're the one always coming to me and complaining.

234
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,409
I'll stop caring if you want.

235
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:59,732
No, why are you doing this to me? I'm going crazy here.

236
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:30,141
I'm representing the company. I'm with the law firm...

237
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:32,106
You told me over the phone.

238
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:40,349
I didn't know what you would like, so I ordered both coffee and tea.

239
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:41,943
I'll have the tea.

240
00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:43,192
Okay.

241
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:49,733
I'm sure you already guessed why I asked to meet you.

242
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:52,984
I wanted to discuss some things regarding the sexual harassment issues.

243
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:58,944
I already told the company I wanted a public apology and appropriate action.

244
00:25:58,944 --> 00:26:04,499
Besides that, I don't want a settlement or mediation with the perpetrators.

245
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:06,070
Wait.

246
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,551
Why do you call them perpetrators?

247
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:14,899
It hasn't yet been confirmed that you are a victim.

248
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:17,499
- What?
- You're shocked, right?

249
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:21,000
This is only the beginning.

250
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:28,995
You've seen similar cases on the news and other mediums, right?

251
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:32,076
What was the progress of those cases?

252
00:26:32,077 --> 00:26:33,972
They were frustrating, right?

253
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:37,232
There was no conclusion and they just fizzled out.

254
00:26:38,402 --> 00:26:40,484
Why do you think that is?

255
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,411
I'll explain it simply.

256

[I had a nice time.]
[I am waiting in your room, Director.]

257
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:23,228
Once these things spread, people react in only one way.

258
00:27:24,755 --> 00:27:26,600
"The woman is also a problem."

259
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,775
"The woman is even worse."

260
00:27:28,775 --> 00:27:32,745
At the worst, "The woman must have wanted..."
- Hold on.

261
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:35,998
Where did you get this video?

262
00:27:35,998 --> 00:27:38,026
Is it the original?

263
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:41,727
All of these messages...

264
00:27:42,731 --> 00:27:47,925
I have never had these conversations with Director Nam.

265
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:51,067
- If you compare it with my messages–
- It's too late.

266
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:57,599
I'm saying it is too late to change the perception that people already have.

267
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:05,607
I sympathize with your feelings of frustration and feeling wronged.

268
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:09,706
However, I would like you to think about it carefully once more.

269
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:14,056
Which decision will profit you more?

270
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:16,524
"Profit"?

271
00:28:17,657 --> 00:28:20,287
I have already lost more.

272
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:25,760
I started this knowing that things could get harder.

273
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,139
Yes, I understand.

274
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:35,084
Director Nam is even considering suing you for defamation.

275
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:41,787
If you apologize to him sincerely before he does, he says he may reconsider.

277
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,998
In my experience...

278
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:58,540
dragging these types of cases on for long only results in wounds.

279
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:03,098
I am telling you this because I truly feel bad for you.

280
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:06,885
I feel worse for you.

281
00:29:06,885 --> 00:29:11,269
You studied that hard just to conspire with this fake evidence.

282
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:14,660
Go and tell them. They thought too easily of me.

283
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,273
Tell them I'm ready to take it to the end.

What?

He called me and said he couldn't reach you.

295

He was really panicked like the time you got in a car accident.

You should've told me. I would've come to the airport.

317

Why did you hide the fact that you moved?

318
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,343
Is it because I might worry again?

319

You might say it's always the same excuse, but it is the truth.

00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:17,177
I told you I would do everything that I can.

330
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:19,387
What position does that put me in?

331
00:35:19,945 --> 00:35:22,419
When I think about Gyeong Seon,

332
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:26,657
I worry a hundred or a thousand times more than you do about my mom.

333
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:29,538
How much more do you want me to disappoint her?

334
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:31,657
I can't do it.

335
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,969
Then what about me?

336
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:37,617
Should I just stand by and do nothing?

337
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,739
What am I to Yun Jin Ah?

338
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:43,189
A boyfriend, since it's better than being single?

339
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:47,788
- Why would say something like that?
- You make me say it.

340
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,943
Do you have to do something for me?

341
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:58,144
Isn't it enough just to have feelings for each other?

342
00:35:58,144 --> 00:36:00,202
What does that do?

343
00:36:00,764 --> 00:36:06,793
If we hold on long enough, will we, someday, have a happily ever after like in a fairytale?

344
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,662
You don't have to be sarcastic.

345
00:36:13,532 --> 00:36:16,043
I can't keep going on like this.

346
00:36:20,357 --> 00:36:22,465
What does that mean?

347
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,676
Having people watch us and wait for us to get worn down and give up.

348
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:28,862
I can't bear it anymore.

349
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:34,420
Don't always think negatively.

350
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,950
- Let's take time to think–
- You can do that by yourself.

This is the first time ever since I've been coming here.

366
00:39:07,113 --> 00:39:10,190
There were a few food products past their expiration dates.

367
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,820
I took them out to be thrown out.

368
00:39:14,011 --> 00:39:16,637
I meant to take them out but forgot.

369
00:39:18,062 --> 00:39:21,238
Is there something you're concerned about?

370
00:39:21,798 --> 00:39:24,497
If there is, will you fix it?

371
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:25,947
Just tell me.

372
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:30,828
If it's anything about the store, I'll do whatever I can.

373
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:34,346
The store runs on its own just fine.

374
00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:37,007
It will get cold. You should drink it.

375
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:41,069
Just to change the atmosphere, I'll come up with a promotion soon.

376
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:44,797
Right now, the mood in the company isn't so good.

377
00:39:44,797 --> 00:39:46,600
I'll have to see when I can.

378
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,848
What's wrong with the company?

379
00:39:48,848 --> 00:39:52,490
Well... it's just some stuff.

380
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:56,897
Haven't you seen Section Yun lately?

381
00:39:56,897 --> 00:40:00,208
You must be sacrificing your time with her for your brother.

382
00:40:14,777 --> 00:40:16,607
What is this?

383
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:19,088
We both know better.

384
00:40:19,088 --> 00:40:22,097
It's not like we are children.

385
00:40:22,097 --> 00:40:24,468
It's because we aren't children.

386
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,383
There are things we should do as adults.

387
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:30,619
There are things we should not do and I'm doing this to make that clear.

388
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:33,281
Do we really need to go this far?

389
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:37,168
It seems you're not quite prepared yet.

390
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,571
I have three kids.

391
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:44,962
My youngest daughter isn't even in elementary school yet.

392
00:40:44,962 --> 00:40:49,641
People can make mistakes while trying to make a living and working.

393
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:52,540
If I end up getting fired here, it's not just my life ending.

394
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:56,203
My daughter and my whole family will be over!

395
00:40:56,203 --> 00:41:01,914
If you were worried about that, why were you more passionate about things outside your job duties?

396
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:09,348
What if your youngest daughter grows up and goes through something like I did?

397
00:41:09,348 --> 00:41:12,220
Is that something to say?

398
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:26,658
Didn't you ask me why I'm going this far?

399
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:29,837
I don't want to become a shameful child.

400
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:35,478
My father is not someone who brought shame to his children.

401
00:41:38,524 --> 00:41:42,205
I made some mistakes.

402
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:47,942
Sure, I'll... apologize.

403
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:54,245
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

404
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,450
I was wrong.

405
00:42:00,756 --> 00:42:05,877
I was really wrong. This will never happen again.

406
00:42:07,187 --> 00:42:09,346
I'm really sorry.

407
00:42:12,725 --> 00:42:15,600
Put up a public apology on the company's internal site.

408
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,674
Otherwise, I will upload this audio file myself.

409
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,991
Yes.

410
00:42:44,209 --> 00:42:46,291
Did you ask to see me?

411
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:50,089
Sit down.

412
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:53,938
If it won't take long, I'll stand and listen.

413
00:42:58,575 --> 00:43:01,207
I heard you met the lawyer.

414
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:05,160
Section Chief Yun, this isn't something to be stubborn over.

415
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:09,108
You're still young, so... what's the word?

416
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:13,058
It's reckless courage. You shouldn't do it.

417
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:20,060
I'm not young or foolish enough to do this with just reckless courage.

418
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:25,419
If you go the legal route... you could be at a disadvantage.

419
00:43:25,419 --> 00:43:28,789
What is that? Yes, a red line in your record.

420
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:30,749
Would you like that?

421
00:43:30,749 --> 00:43:33,928
You wouldn't get another job then.

422
00:43:33,928 --> 00:43:37,109
If you're worried about me, then thank you.

423
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:39,508
You're so frustrating.

424
00:43:39,508 --> 00:43:41,517
You know...

425
00:43:41,517 --> 00:43:45,687
You've done enough pretending as a victim.

426
00:43:47,778 --> 00:43:52,948
So... will you do it now, Director?

427
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:11,404
I've already eaten.

428
00:44:11,404 --> 00:44:14,404
I haven't eaten yet.

429
00:44:17,052 --> 00:44:18,839
Is something wrong?

430
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:22,914
Can you take out the deposit on your place and give it to me?

431
00:44:22,914 --> 00:44:26,263
I want to spend the money and travel without any thought.

432
00:44:28,673 --> 00:44:33,951
You've been taking care of me so much that you haven't really had a break.

433
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:37,373
I guess it does sound like I'm showing off about taking care of you.

434
00:44:37,373 --> 00:44:41,435
I was just saying that I need to recharge myself.

435
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:44,142
I've been doing this for a long time too.

436
00:44:46,582 --> 00:44:48,524
By any chance...

437
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:55,107
Don't jump to conclusions. It has nothing to do with Yun Jin Ah.

438
00:44:56,564 --> 00:45:00,624
Do whatever you want to do. It will be good for you.

439
00:45:00,624 --> 00:45:02,435
I'll do everything from now on.

440

Manager.

441
00:45:05,618 --> 00:45:09,518
I'd rather go to a seniors' home than live off of you.

442
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:27,715
Yes, you should think about it.

443
00:45:27,715 --> 00:45:30,241
Okay, I'll call you again.

444
00:45:31,691 --> 00:45:33,442
Did you go see a shaman?

445
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:34,788
What?

446
00:45:34,788 --> 00:45:36,890
That was Team Leader Son from the U.S. office.

447
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:40,321
I guess his son can't adjust to school because he is too young.

448
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,631
He wants to come back here.

449
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:45,582
Then do I need to go right away?

450
00:45:45,582 --> 00:45:48,629
Why? You said as soon as possible.

451
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:51,109
Have you changed your mind again?

452

No.

What do you mean by that?

459

I heard your girlfriend didn't agree.

460
00:46:24,021 --> 00:46:26,192

No need for the awkward acting.

489
00:49:18,226 --> 00:49:20,185
You can be happy about your promotion.

490
00:49:20,185 --> 00:49:22,825
You don't need to worry about me.

491
00:49:22,825 --> 00:49:25,316
I'm not worrying about you. I think you're strange.

492
00:49:25,316 --> 00:49:29,702
They just called yours a promotion. It's actually a punishment.

493
00:49:29,702 --> 00:49:34,336
I sort of expected it so I'm not surprised.

494
00:49:34,336 --> 00:49:39,468
Don't worry. I'm going to endure and fight back with all my might and return with glory.

495
00:49:39,468 --> 00:49:41,663
Who am I?

496
00:49:41,663 --> 00:49:43,223
Give it a rest.

497
00:49:43,223 --> 00:49:46,560
It's not a good sign when a person changes so much.

498
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,278
You were the one egging me on.

499
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:50,295
I didn't realize you had such a fighting spirit.

500
00:49:50,295 --> 00:49:53,051
You're totally malicious. Totally.

501
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:56,299
So? Should I buy you a celebratory drink?

502
00:49:56,299 --> 00:49:58,197
Aren't you seeing your boyfriend? It's your birthday.

503
00:49:58,197 --> 00:50:01,892
I have time. He has a meeting outside so I'm seeing him later.

504
00:50:01,893 --> 00:50:06,353
Forget it. You can make yourself look pretty in that time.

505
00:50:06,353 --> 00:50:09,067
Why would I be doing that?

506
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:10,679
- Won't you be?
- What?

507
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:14,200
Are you sure you haven't booked full body makeup at a Gangnam shop?

508
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,599
It's not like it's our first night.

509
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:18,405
Oh my.

510
00:50:18,405 --> 00:50:21,219
Then, you...

511
00:50:22,006 --> 00:50:25,245
- You've already...
- What are you saying?

512
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:24,289
Are hiccups contagious too?

513
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:02,347
I was reminded of the first day we held hands.

514
00:52:02,347 --> 00:52:05,403
Yun Jin Ah definitely seduced me first.

515
00:52:10,403 --> 00:52:17,590
Happy birthday to you.

516
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:25,750
Happy birthday, dear Jin Ah. Happy birthday to you.

517
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:34,872
Congratulations on both your birthday and the promotion.

518
00:52:34,872 --> 00:52:37,188
My daughter is amazing. You're the best!

519
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:39,901
Thank you, Dad.

520
00:52:39,901 --> 00:52:44,021
How lacking in talent are they at the company that you became a manager?

521
00:52:44,022 --> 00:52:45,968
You have no manners.

522
00:52:45,968 --> 00:52:49,307
Do I have to say congratulations in words? It's so tacky.

523
00:52:49,307 --> 00:52:53,071
You're supposed to say it's because you feel shy.

524
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,668
How could you not see Seo Jun Hui on a day like today?

525
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,133
He is busy with work.

526
00:53:01,133 --> 00:53:02,903
Here, here.

527
00:53:02,903 --> 00:53:06,763
You're one year older and you got promoted.

528
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:09,802
Just make the right choice and get married from now on, okay?

529
00:53:09,802 --> 00:53:14,252
I heard from some people who are from good families and went to Seoul University.

530
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:18,720
I'll select someone from them and choose the best person.

531
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,118
Here.

532
00:53:21,945 --> 00:53:23,590
Jin Ah.

533
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:35,381
Don't think about arguing with me on this good day.

534
00:53:35,381 --> 00:53:37,483
My mind won't change.

535
00:53:37,483 --> 00:53:40,410
I never thought about changing it.

536
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,691
I know that it is impossible.

537
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:47,142
But I told you already. I won't change my plans.

538
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:49,622
It will be impossible.

539
00:53:49,622 --> 00:53:51,843
Shut your mouth before I say something worse.

540
00:53:51,844 --> 00:53:54,602
Stop it, would you?

541
00:53:54,602 --> 00:53:56,700
Jin Ah, pick up your spoon, okay?

542
00:53:57,552 --> 00:54:00,202
You don't even know how to be embarrassed!

543
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:03,329
You're dating a guy who has absolutely nothing.

544
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,400
Why are you so bold about it?

545
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,421
Do you know how important a person's roots are?

546
00:54:07,421 --> 00:54:09,280
You know a person's prospects by looking at their family.

547
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,271
- Stop it, Mom.
- You need to listen too.

548
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:16,271
Cut ties with useless girls before you get your PhD.

549
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:21,560
If your plan is to drag it out and try to get Jun Hui in here,

550
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,190
give it up now.

551
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:27,552
Even if I die, I won't let him step into this house.

552
00:54:34,162 --> 00:54:36,589
Why? Are you leaving?

553
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:40,334
Mom says she won't allow Jun Hui to take one step in here.

554
00:54:40,334 --> 00:54:43,700
I want to see him now so what can I do? I have to go.

555
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:46,759
Hey, Yun Jin Ah.

556
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,061
Noona.

557
00:54:55,796 --> 00:54:57,395
Gosh.

558
00:55:26,097 --> 00:55:28,175
I'm done with my meeting and on my way.

559
00:55:28,175 --> 00:55:31,072
Eat a lot of yummy food and take your time coming.

560
00:55:31,072 --> 00:55:33,376
Do you want to be dropped off before the big road?

561
00:55:33,376 --> 00:55:34,681
Yes.

562
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:43,012
Oh, you can drop me off here.

563
00:56:21,568 --> 00:56:24,050
Something happened at home, right?

564
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:35,867
You know my mom.

565
00:56:35,867 --> 00:56:38,184
Why? Did Yun Jin Ah say something?

566
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:53,153
Did you wait long?

567
00:56:55,718 --> 00:56:58,328
It is so pretty here.

568
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:38,209
What is this?

569
00:57:38,209 --> 00:57:40,168
Happy birthday.

570
00:57:42,744 --> 00:57:44,565
Thank you.

571
00:58:01,046 --> 00:58:04,515
[Seo Jun Hui's whole heart for Yun Jin Ah.]

572
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,157
It is really pretty.

573
00:58:54,093 --> 00:58:55,878
Do you like it?

574
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:00,213
Yes, so much.

575
00:59:34,981 --> 00:59:36,832
Wow.

576
00:59:36,832 --> 00:59:38,969
How is it? Is it pretty?

577
00:59:40,434 --> 00:59:44,712
But not as much as Yun Jin Ah.

578
01:00:19,374 --> 01:00:21,195
Seriously...

579
01:00:22,137 --> 01:00:26,080
I like these things so much.

580
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,580
I think I must be a person that gets easily swayed by material things.

581
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:33,140
It is so pretty.

582
01:00:34,233 --> 01:00:35,929
It suits you well.

583
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:37,895
Thank you.

584
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:01,709
Thank you for today.

585
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:14,393
It felt a little shady,

586
01:02:14,393 --> 01:02:18,216
but I was still promoted. Won't you congratulate me?

587
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:25,318
You don't have to force yourself.

588
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:29,366
Honestly, I'm saying this to you, but I'm annoyed too.

589
01:02:29,366 --> 01:02:33,029
They want to try and reform me. Do they think I'll be scared?

590
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:37,374
I'll show them just how tough I can be.

591
01:02:39,557 --> 01:02:41,877
I'm going to the U.S.

592
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,210
Come with me.

593
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:00,326
I'm not telling you to cover up the issue you have at work.

594
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:03,538
They should be punished.

595
01:03:03,538 --> 01:03:07,989
But you don't need to be here to do that.

596
01:03:12,316 --> 01:03:14,752
I know many things are in the way.

597
01:03:15,686 --> 01:03:19,005
So I'm being careful about asking.

598
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:21,147
I feel sorry too.

599
01:03:22,787 --> 01:03:26,901
People would think we are running away.

600
01:03:26,901 --> 01:03:29,560
That hurts my pride.

601
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,381
But...

602
01:03:32,663 --> 01:03:34,593
I want to ignore that.

603
01:03:36,327 --> 01:03:39,268
I can't stand to see you struggling anymore.

604
01:03:53,436 --> 01:03:55,230
Let's go...

605
01:03:56,028 --> 01:03:57,550
together.

If you had asked me to go...

612
01:04:40,673 --> 01:04:43,470
