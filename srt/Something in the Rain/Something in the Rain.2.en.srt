[Episode 2]

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,540
♫ You follow behind me, but I'm only running forward ♫

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,340
♫ I'm just around the table you're sitting at, I don't care ♫

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,890
♫ If you touch me you won’t be able to handle it. I’m hot hot hot hot fire ♫

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,540
♫ Someone please stop me before I flip something over ♫

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,950
♫ I open my closet and put on the freshest outfit ♫

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,300
♫ I carefully check the reflection of my face in the mirror ♫

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,350
♫ Right now it’s 8 p.m., I’m supposed to meet up at 8:30 p.m. ♫

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,950
♫ Tonight I set out with bold steps ♫

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,790
♫ I am the best ♫

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,890
♫ I am the best ♫

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,980
Look at her go.

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,710
♫ I am the best ♫

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,600
♫ I am the best ♫

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,660
♫ I am the best ♫

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,256
What's this?

17
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,550
♫ Whoever looks at me can see I’m kind of fabulous, all right ♫

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,990
♫ Even if you were me... ♫

19
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:14,941
Why aren't you picking up?

20
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,000
♫ Right ♫

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,860
♫ Guys keep on staring at me, girls always copy me ♫

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,530
♫ They keep eyeing this spot I'm at; it gets so tiring ♫

23
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,090
♫ This clumsy player keeps pretending to be a pro ♫

24
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,996
♫ I'll dump you as if you're a flat tire ♫

25
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:33,937
I think he saw everything.

26
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:39,290
♫ I'm incomparable to anyone else; I'm being humble ♫

27
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,610
♫ If you want to know my value, I'm a billion-dollar baby ♫

28
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:43,216
Why are you here?

29
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:45,900
Why didn't you pick up my call?

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,434
I was working.

31
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:49,652
You were dancing.

32
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:51,774
I was working too.

33
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:55,584
Why are you here? You said you were going clubbing.

34
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:56,766
That's why I'm here.

35
00:01:56,766 --> 00:02:00,966
I came clubbing to kill time, but the crowd isn't so good.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,440
Woo!

37
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,116
Woohoo!

00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:55,360
I finally managed to get out.

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,869
You haven't finished yet, right?

55
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:05,704
I'm almost done. Don't worry, go in. Thanks for going.

56
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:15,074
This is so much faster this way.

57
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:20,343
It was taking me so much time to pack and tape these individually.

58
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,590
It is, isn't it?

59
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,213
You're supposed to use your head.

60
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,070
Is that right?

61
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,469
Gosh, was that a boulder just now? So heavy.

62
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:39,670
Sorry, I was wrong.

63
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:41,993
Seriously, you...

64
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:44,201
Once I catch you...

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,672
What the heck!

66
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,735
I got you.

67
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:17,098
- Section Chief!
- Oh my. Oh no.

68
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,767
- Section Chief Yun!
- Yes!

69
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,969
- Where are you?
- Ye Eun.

70
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:24,510
- You're still here!
- Yes.

71
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,680
- Section Chief Yun.
- Why did you come here?

72
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,786
I thought you'd still be here alone.

73
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:31,636
No, I'm fine.

74
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:34,307
I'm almost done. It's so messy there. Come here.

75
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:37,119
I'll help you. We can talk while we wrap up.

76
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,518
No, you're being too ambitious.

77
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:42,468
I can clean up once I get to work tomorrow.

78
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,075
What?

79
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:52,586
Karaoke wasn't a great time, was it?

80
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:58,140
It's so annoying. He kept touching me.

81
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,565
I thought I'd die. It was so creepy.

82
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:04,366
It's my fault for leaving you there.

83
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:06,358
It would've been worse if you were there.

84
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:11,450
Senior Manager Gong acts up when you're around because you don't say anything.

85
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,101
Gosh, I'll cover for you next time.

86
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:16,112
Shake it off and forget it.

87
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:19,181
You should stop letting him off the hook like that.

88
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:22,174
And they keep bringing up the fact that you broke up with your boyfriend.

89
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:25,700
Why don't you say anything? I would never let that go!

90
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,776
You're already having a really hard time. You really liked him.

91
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:31,584
When did I?

92
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:35,832
Well...

93
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:38,652
It's just...

94
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:41,662
It isn't like I liked him to death or anything.

95
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:46,132
When most people date, they have their good times.

96
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:48,528
Yes, so what I mean is...

97
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:52,261
- I really, really love you.
- Yes, Ye Eun.

98
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:53,632
But I think you're really drunk.

99
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:57,282
- I'm not.
- Stand up. Do you think you can stand? Try standing.

100
00:06:57,282 --> 00:06:59,058
Section Chief Yun, I want to help you though.

101
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:01,042
- Can you go?
- I came to help you.

102
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:04,841
Let's go, let's go. Don't move and stay here.

103
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,241
I'll be back soon.

104
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:11,990
- Are you doing that all alone?
- No, no.

105
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,899
I'll finish it tomorrow morning.

106
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,350
Oh, I'll turn off the lights.

107
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,927
I'll do that. I can do it. Wait!

108
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:21,157
Gosh.

109
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:24,457
You don't need to... turn off the lights.

110
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:27,269
My back.

111
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,877
The alarm has been set.

112
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:50,207
I'm okay, Section Chief Yun.

113
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:52,397
Try to pull yourself together.

114
00:07:52,397 --> 00:07:56,127
- I'll call a car.
- No, I'll do it. I'll do it.

115
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:59,027
- I can do it.
- I have somewhere to drop by.

116
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:02,717
- I have to drop by my friend's store.
- Oh, that place.

117
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:05,548
The franchisee there is named Seo Gyeong Seon.

118
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:07,267
That's right.

119
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,240
You must be very close.

120
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,789
I guess so.

121
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,883
This is Sangam-dong, around DMC.

122
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:16,416
- Yes.
- Yes, Yeongdeungpo.

123
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,650
- And the other car...
- It's cold.

124
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,780
I'll call you back.

125
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,149
Yes.

126
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,599
- Are they coming?
- Yes. Let's hurry.

127
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,895
Oh, Section Chief Yun.

128
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:31,147
- Pull yourself together.
- You know I like you a lot, right?

129
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:34,286
Yes. I really, really like you, too.

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,064
I'm going crazy here.

131
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:51,169
Get in now.

132
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:53,030
- Section Chief!
- Yes, why?

133
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,024
I'm going to become a cool career woman just like you.

134
00:08:57,024 --> 00:09:00,899
- Okay, you do that, but go home first.
- Are you getting in or not?

135
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,114
Hold on! Why do you keep trying to send me away?

136
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:05,678
I like being with you.

137
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,992
The driver is waiting.

138
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:09,142
- You must not like me.
- You should go home.

139
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:12,748
I like you so much, so much. But you should go home now.

140
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:15,722
Oh, okay.

141
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,718
Mister.

142
00:09:16,718 --> 00:09:19,661
Section Chief Yun, I love you. I love you.

143
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:22,678
Me, too. I love you, too.

144
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:24,635
Please go.

145
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:26,977
Goodbye!

146
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,580
♫ You can dance ♫

147
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,680
♫ Every dance with the guy that gives you the eye, and let him hold you tight ♫

148
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,960
♫ You can smile ♫

149
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:11,280
♫ Every smile for the man that held your hand beneath the pale moonlight ♫

150
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,500
♫ But don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be ♫

151
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,445
Jun Hui!

152
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:23,104
Hey! Where are you?

153
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:27,694
Where is he?

154
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:32,309
Jun Hui!

155
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:37,930
♫ Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun ♫

156
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,500
♫ (Yes I know) Laugh and sing ♫

157
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,793
What took you so long?

158
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:46,965
I came as fast as I could.

159
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:50,740
Yeah, right. You must've crawled here.

160
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,180
♫ Don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be ♫

161
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:04,069
♫ Please darlin', save the last dance for me ♫

162
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:06,268
I got home safely.

163
00:11:06,268 --> 00:11:08,150
Good night.

164
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:13,570
♫ Can't you feel it when we touch ♫

165
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:15,700
Good night.

166
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,960
♫ I will never ever let you go, I love you oh so much ♫

167
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,170
♫ Save ♫

168
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,400
♫ Save the, save ♫

169
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,580
Are you coming in or going out?

170
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,871
Can't you tell? I'm going to work.

171
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:53,740
You come and go whenever you please. I can't figure it out.

172
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,982
You should acknowledge the hard work of your brother who works all night.

173
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:01,250
How would I know if you were working or partying at a club?

174
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,042
I did both.

175
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,050
Paying rent to leave your place empty half the time is such a waste.

176
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,654
Let's live together to save.

177
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,509
Are you crazy?

178
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:20,261
Do you have to be crazy to live with me?

179
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:25,060
We may be siblings, but let's keep our privacy, Noona.

180
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,893
- Do you have a woman?
- "A woman"?

181
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:30,109
Which woman are you talking about?

182
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:32,600
I'll get into an accident.

183
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,652
A car accident isn't the only kind of accident you can get into.

184
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:39,725
Do you know how shocked I was when you pretended to call the police as Jin Ah's boyfriend?

185
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,602
I thought you got into a fight with some guy over a girl.

186
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:45,449
I felt like my insides were turning inside out.

187
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:47,271
I'd win, of course.

188
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:49,332
Don't joke around and listen carefully.

189
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:53,001
The day you bring around some rude and thoughtless girl to marry,

190
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,649
you'll both die by my hand.

191
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,550
But what if she's very pretty?

192
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:03,701
If her looks can compete with mine, I'll think about it.

193
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:07,288
I think my ears are rotting from hearing that.

194
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:10,894
Ouch! All right.

195
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,573
Section Chief Yun, come see me.

196
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:30,735
Do you expect me to read this or look at it like it's a picture?

197
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:34,294
I worked hard on it. Does it not meet your standards?

198
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,662
Section Chief Geum, bring me a ruler.

199
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:47,583
Standby.

200
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,415
Do the lines meet or not?

201
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:52,915
The content changed, so we had to replace it.

202
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,865
Are you a novelist?

203
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:56,992
Don't focus on such useless things.

204
00:13:56,992 --> 00:13:59,941
Focus on the original goal of the report.

205
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:01,471
Standby.

206
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,753
Hey, do you call this a Powerpoint presentation?

207
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:17,824
We went with the method most commonly used in the past three years.

208
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:20,395
Who said to copy that?

209
00:14:20,395 --> 00:14:22,746
Didn't you consider making it original at all?

210
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:26,987
If you were going to use a template and just change the words and numbers,

211
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:30,777
all you did was press Ctrl-C and Ctrl-D.

212
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:33,547
It's not 'D'. It's Ctrl-V.

213
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:39,885
You're so knowledgeable about that, so why was this done so poorly?

214
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:41,808
Do it all over again.

215
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:43,948
Make it original and new.

216
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:47,937
Standby. Come here, Section Chief Kang.

217
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:01,987
Yesterday...

218
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:07,500
our young friends like Dong Wu and Ye Eun stayed until the end of our dinner.

219
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,300
You should be convincing people to come, but you were all missing.

220
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,950
What's the purpose of a company outing?

221
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,080
It's to create a bond and devotion.

222
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,470
You should know better.

223
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,499
Working in an organization means that you shouldn't just think of yourself.

224
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:26,790
There should be a sense of camaraderie.

225
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,200
Speaking of which...

226
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,849
does our company discriminate based on gender?

227
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,450
Do we force you to drink?

228
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,773
We all get along, as equals.

229
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,283
You don't even have the basics down.

230
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,044
What are you doing? Go!

231
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:48,693
Take this with you!

232
00:15:57,941 --> 00:15:59,210
Let's go eat.
[What a bastard.]

233
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:01,762
Let's go. Dong Wu, come on.

234
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:03,163
Yes.

235
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,192
If I just sat at a desk all day like them,

236
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,309
I would want to go to company outings, too.

237
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,366
The stores are constantly expanding and we are out all day.

238
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:20,599
How would we have the energy to go out?

239
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,599
I know.

240
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:25,299
It's getting harder to wake up lately.

241
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:26,469
I must be getting old.

242
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:29,099
What's with you two?

243
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,820
We aren't that old yet.

244
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,020
You don't know how much difference a year makes.

245
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,809
Don't bring up age when we are colleagues.

246
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,459
Should I start calling you Unnie?

247
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,251
I welcome that anytime.

248
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:44,198
Old or young, we need to energize ourselves.

249
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:45,352
How about some healthy food?

250
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:47,160
Sounds good.

251
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,211
Rice noodles.

252
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:50,259
What?

253
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,549
How is that healthy food?

254
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,072
It's all the same if it's good.

255
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:57,318
Let's go.

256
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:00,051
Thank you.

257
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,544
Please enjoy.

258
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:05,069
Hey, hook me up with her, please.

259
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,178
Welcome.

260
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:10,078
If your friend is lonely every night, he will end up sick...

261
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:11,592
Hello.

262
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:13,002
Oh, Noona.

263
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:16,183
Oh, you were here.

264
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:18,253
Please sit.

265
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:41,124
Where do you live?

266
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,799
Me? My parents live outside the city.

267
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,942
So I live in Mok-dong.

268
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:54,536
- I live alone.
- That's the best.

269
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:56,866
No, I meant...

270
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:59,665
You live in the best area. Yes.

271
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:02,889
Where do you live?

272
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:06,219
- Bundang.
- I live in Bangbae-dong.

273
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,059
I have somewhere to be.

274
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,519
Enjoy your food.

275
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,728
Bye then.

276
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,934
You're paying for the noodles, right? I helped you yesterday.

277
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:23,542
Be quiet.

278
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:25,451
Thanks for the meal.

279
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,062
How do you two know each other?

280
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:35,921
I transferred schools when I was in second grade.

281
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:37,963
Wow, it's already been over twenty years.

282
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:42,453
Yes, his older sister was my classmate.

283
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:44,200
Oh...

284
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,175
You're practically family.

285
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:50,971
Maybe you know my sister. She's a franchise owner there.

286
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:54,093
Oh, really?

287
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:56,153
Where?

288
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,220
Which one?

289
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:11,053
I thought you left already.

290
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,808
Why? Is something going on?

291
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:18,100
About Seo Gyeong Seon's store, since you're in charge of it,

292
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,555
I'll take over from now on.

293
00:19:20,555 --> 00:19:22,249
That will be a problem.

294
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,753
I think my friend would get upset.

295
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:27,908
I'll treat her well so that she isn't upset.

296
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:30,361
You took over the Gasan store.

297
00:19:30,362 --> 00:19:33,873
I did that because of trouble between you and the owner there.

298
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,441
This is a different situation.

299
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,797
So do you not want to?

300
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:44,497
It's not that I don't want to. It's just a little difficult from my point of view.

301
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,480
All right. Never mind.

302
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,740
I'll handle it.

303
00:19:57,522 --> 00:20:01,915
Why would he mention that his sister runs a franchise?

304
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:05,119
Did he really have nothing else to say?

305
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,929
Who are you talking to?

306
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:10,005
Oh, I was just spewing nonsense.

307
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:12,304
I'll get going first.

308
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:15,179
If that plane leaves the ground

309
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,651
and you're not with him

310
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,548
you'll regret it.

311
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:23,851
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon.

312
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:27,248
And for the rest of your life.

313
00:20:27,248 --> 00:20:30,739
We'll always have Paris.

314
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,339
What did you buy?

315
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:46,090
Look at this later and get me some water. I'm so hot.

316
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,799
Is it hot outside?

317
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:50,673
It's because I'm so upset.

318
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,436
We will end up broke giving people money at weddings.

319
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:15,248
This is for the youngest son of my youngest sibling.

320
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:19,449
They seem to like the girl he's marrying.

321
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:24,179
Sister-in-law was showing off so much, I thought she was from a great family.

322
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:28,047
She had nothing going for her except that her dad is a district representative.

323
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:29,240
That's something.

324
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,190
Forget it.

325
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,094
This must be your friend.

326
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:39,435
Seocho-dong, their second child is getting married.

327
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:45,388
Their in-laws are in banking and finance and have power there.

328
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,914
She shows off every time I see her.

329
00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:51,044
You should see how she acts when someone says they envy Jin Ah.

330
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:56,809
She goes on and on endlessly about how great her in-laws are.

331
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:58,664
I guess she has the right to.

332
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:02,298
From what I heard, they're a really successful family.

333
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:04,295
We can marry Jin Ah to a good family, too.

334
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:07,015
That's what I'm worried about.

335
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:11,375
If we just believe in Jin Ah, there will be no hope next year either.

336
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:15,595
Why don't you call Gyu Min and talk to him?

337
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:18,145
- Me?
- Aren't you going to get her married?

338
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:21,144
Will you just give other people wedding gifts?

339
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:22,473
Okay.

340
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:27,886
Don't just say okay and do nothing. All right?

341
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:30,514
For goodness' sake.

342
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,184
You better do it.

343
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:36,149
He has to.

344
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,318
What is it? Don't you like it? Should we go somewhere else?

345
00:22:52,318 --> 00:22:54,463
Have you been here before?

346
00:22:54,463 --> 00:22:57,149
I came here with work colleagues before. It wasn't bad.

347
00:22:57,149 --> 00:22:59,293
We can go somewhere else if you don't like it.

348
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,773
I don't mind it.

349
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,723
You're here, Sir. I'll take you to your seat.

350
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,508
The employees here must have a really good memory.

351
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,036
Can we sit over there?

352
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,319
Yes, sit where you'd like.

353
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,090
Do you want something to drink?

354
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,291
What should we drink?

355
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,194
Something you've had before.

356
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:59,599
- What?
- You must've had something recently.

357
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,521
I wasn't here recently.

358
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,398
What is it?

359
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,900
I'm going to the restroom.

360
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,860
Okay.

361
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,212
Hey, I wouldn't want to sit with him for even one minute.

362
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:23,048
Why are you even dealing with him at all?

363
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:27,293
Just pour the wine, throw it in his face, and leave!

364
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,399
What do you mean you're going to see?

365
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:35,848
Are you going to date Lee Gyu Min again?

366
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:40,050
If you won't, then why are you dragging things out?

367
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,722
You better not do anything stupid.

368
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,584
Okay.

369
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,886
Who is it?

370
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,858
Why bother asking? It's Yun Jin Ah.

371
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:52,497
Lee Gyu Min came to see her again. Seriously.

372
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:53,708
Why?

373
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:56,258
Why else? He's playing games to start dating her again.

374
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:59,308
Doesn't Jin Ah know he's playing games? Why does she keep seeing him?

375
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:01,457
That's what I...

376
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:04,908
Who says she's seeing him? He's the one who keeps showing up.

377
00:25:04,908 --> 00:25:07,633
That's because she keeps giving him an opening.

378
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:10,778
She'll make things clear today. She couldn't possibly...

379
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,496
I doubt it.

380
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,996
But why are you getting annoyed?

381
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,539
I'm not.

382
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,303
I'm trying hard to make things work again.

383
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:50,213
You won't stop being angry, so it's really hard.

384
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,449
Is it hard?

385
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:55,669
Of course, I don't know what to do.

386
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,054
Are you shameless or thoughtless?

387
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,606
What?

388
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,906
How could you come here?

389
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,459
Especially when you're trying to make things work.

390
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,290
Lipstick, stocking...

391
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:27,023
What? Do you want to sue me? Let me add assault to that.

392
00:26:27,023 --> 00:26:29,180
Jin Ah.

393
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,023
I came here to try and end it with good memories.

394
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,595
You're cruel.

395
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,043
You're truly the worst.

396
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,041
I'm not the only one who cheated.

397
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,821
Who was the guy who took you away in front of your office?

398
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:02,910
Seriously?

399
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,120
You see.

400
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,521
You met someone else, too. Why am I the only bad one?

401
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:10,299
We both did wrong. Can't we just call it even?

402
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:15,749
It's not you. I was the worst for dating you!

403
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:18,884
How can you leave like that?

404
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,549
What? Do you need cash for the valet again?

405
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:25,652
Oh, you drank. Do you need money for a designated driver?

406
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,959
Are you upset about something?

407
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,780
Hello.

408
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,910
Oh, hello.

409
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,200
Your outfit today is... wow.

410
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,780
Thank you.

411
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,600
You look like you're in a bad mood today, Jun Hui.

412
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,207
Right? I told you.

413
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:00,887
No, I'm fine.

414
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:11,103
You said you live in Mok-dong, right? Where in Mok-dong?

415
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:12,899
Five minutes from the subway stop.

416
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,540
The famous five minutes from the station?

417
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,490
Yes.

418
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,143
Hi.

419
00:28:19,143 --> 00:28:21,333
- Hello.
- Yes.

420
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,847
There's a hot oven pizza place by the subway.

421
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:29,298
Do you know it?

422
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:31,466
Yes, it's quite good.

423
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:33,285
They have a location in this area.

424
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:35,409
Oh, really? Where?

425
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:39,687
Then could you take us sometime?

426
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:41,699
Why not?

427
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:46,669
Speaking of which, how about having lunch there today? Do you have time?

428
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:48,067
Yes, of course.

429
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:50,392
Even if we don't, we will have to make time.

430
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:51,622
Is this the army?

431
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:54,621
Oh, by the way...Your phone number.

432
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:56,300
Oh, mine?

433
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,911
Noona, do you want to come, too?

434
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,440
Where?

435
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,204
I didn't hear what you were talking about. I was texting.

436
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,391
I'll get going now.

437
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:17,435
Goodbye.

438
00:29:17,435 --> 00:29:19,771
I'll message you later.

439
00:29:45,928 --> 00:29:48,149
Stay seated.

440
00:29:52,872 --> 00:29:55,050
I have something to say before the meeting.

441
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,290
Did you see the news yesterday?

442
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,059
There's no way you would have.

443
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,579
The size of the coffee market was 6.4 trillion won last year.

444
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,511
Wow.

445
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,180
How much of that do you think was our company's share?

446
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:16,025
I'm not hearing about any new stores.

447
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:18,099
Business Development Team, don't you have anything?

448
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,100
I'm sorry. We will work harder.

449
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,282
That doesn't mean that existing stores can feel safe.

450
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:26,172
We need development.

451
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:30,362
If we only open the doors and do nothing, will customers just come in?

452
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,448
- What is it?
- There is a store that hasn't opened yet.

453
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:36,650
And we still can't reach the owner.

454
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,700
How can they not be open at this time of day?

455
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,663
- Where is it?
- The Gasan-dong location.

456
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:48,575
If it doesn't open in thirty minutes, everyone here is fired.

457
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:50,717
Everyone, get out!

458
00:30:56,702 --> 00:31:01,429
We suddenly had something come up at another store.

459
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,353
Yes, hello.

460
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:04,650
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Senior Manager.

461
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:07,862
- I'll contact you again.
- Sorry about that. Yes.

462
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:10,672
We will be there in about seventeen minutes.

463
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:14,250
Hello, this is Geum Bo Ra.

464
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,375
About our appointment at 11:00 a.m...

465
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:21,176
- Yes, I understand.
- Can we reschedule?

466
00:31:21,176 --> 00:31:22,826
Yes, Senior Manager.

467
00:31:23,646 --> 00:31:26,158
- Yes, yes.
- It's an urgent head office matter.

468
00:31:26,158 --> 00:31:29,319
- We need to handle a matter.
- Seventeen minutes.

469
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:31,268
Then, perhaps, after work?

470
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:35,656
Jun Hui, hello. This is Kang Se Yeong.

471
00:31:35,656 --> 00:31:38,723
Yes. What do I do?

472
00:31:38,723 --> 00:31:44,056
An urgent matter came up, so I'll be at a store today.

473
00:31:44,056 --> 00:31:47,599
Sorry, I know I suggested lunch first.

474
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:52,459
I feel worse if you say that.

475
00:31:54,906 --> 00:31:59,800
I'll make sure to treat you to a big meal within a few days.

476
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,165
Yes, please contact me.

477
00:32:02,165 --> 00:32:06,326
Yes. It's fine.

478
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:09,528
I'm sure there will be another chance.

479
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:12,138
Yes. Thanks.

480
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:16,398
What next time? Call her right now and tell her tonight is okay too.

481
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:19,798
She says she's busy. Why are you being so pathetic?

482
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:23,199
Hey, I'm not being pathetic. I'm being straightforward.

483
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:26,346
This is why you're bad at dating.

484
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:33,311
Hey, let's see how good you are then.

485
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:39,548
I think he's screwing with us because of the report.

486
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:41,900
All the required products are here.

487
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,849
We will get what we need from the manager, so let's decide on our positions.

488
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,971
I'm on the POS.

489
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,108
Section Chief Geum is on pastries, right?

490
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:54,009
Who can do better than you who has a SCA license?
(T/N: Specialty Coffee Association license)

491
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:56,269
Is that a compliment or a joke?

492
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:59,779
You two can divide the work on your own. Two and three.

493
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:02,677
- Three covers the back room.
- Okay.

494
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:14,026
Welcome!

495
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:20,436
She was supposed to pay for these out of pocket, so why is the company paying?

496
00:33:20,436 --> 00:33:25,059
Even Chairman Jo told Yun Jin Ah to take care of it.

497
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:29,149
It's because it wasn't Yun Jin Ah's mistake. I feel it was settled unfairly.

498
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:32,548
What? This matter was already settled.

499
00:33:32,548 --> 00:33:35,016
What do you mean, "unfair"?

500
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:36,966
Who will pay for it then?

501
00:33:36,966 --> 00:33:39,838
Someone needs to pay for it.

502
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,700
What are you looking at?

503
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:53,006
I... let many things go without saying anything.

504
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,834
I'll fix it and hand it in again.

505
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,609
She is subtly arrogant.

506
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:18,251
Someday... I have to deal with her.

507
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,757
Where is Director Nam?

508
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:30,907
He's inside.

509
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,937
Were you looking for me?

510
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,077
Let's have lunch together if you don't have plans.

511
00:34:36,078 --> 00:34:39,735
Yes. Let me just get my shoes.

512
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,097
Manager Jung, you should come, too. I have something I want to ask you.

513
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:45,502
Yes, Sir.

514
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:58,430
How is the Gasan store doing?

515
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:00,700
Oh, right.

516
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,380
It seems to be doing well.

517
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,880
I heard from them.

518
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,821
Well, all the players are there, so it should do well.

519
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:13,718
It seemed like Yun Jin Ah was diligent.

520
00:35:13,718 --> 00:35:16,399
Why do I keep hearing about her lately?

521
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,536
Yes, I know.

522
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:24,099
Well, I guess you really can't judge a book by its cover.

523
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:25,798
Gosh.

524
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,153
What caused the payment issue for the promotion last time?

525
00:35:37,464 --> 00:35:40,643
I have yet to figure that out. I'm sorry.

526
00:35:40,643 --> 00:35:43,543
Are there times when you procrastinate your work too?

527
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:47,659
I'll find out as soon as possible and report it to you.

528
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:51,610
Investigate it thoroughly.

529
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:05,651
Manager Jeong... one moment.

530
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:08,463
Just one moment.

531
00:36:18,085 --> 00:36:19,654
Let me see.

532
00:36:19,654 --> 00:36:24,905
About the report to Chairman Jo, what are you going to say?

533
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:27,898
Like you said, Yun Jin Ah would pay it.

534
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:30,559
I have to tell the truth about the payment.

535
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,733
What do you mean, "the truth"?

536
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,099
To find errors easily, we make copies of all settlement requests.

537
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:44,046
I looked into it and sent in that request.

538
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,433
I thought about it and...

539
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:56,555
she's only a section chief.

540
00:36:56,555 --> 00:36:58,606
How would she have that kind of money?

541
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,829
It's like a company dinner.

542
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:04,780
I'll think of it like treating you all to a company dinner.

543
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,521
Wouldn't that work?

544
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:09,749
A hundred lipsticks is 2.1 million won.

545
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,198
A hundred mobile coupons is 320,000 won.

546
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:15,850
That's a total of 2.42 million won.

547
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,018
Okay.

548
00:37:18,955 --> 00:37:21,114
I can do the math, too.

549
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:24,314
So, to confirm, I will report to the chairman–

550
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:26,717
I'll do it.

551
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,440
[Coffee Bay]

552
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,537
Gosh, you all worked hard.

553
00:37:45,537 --> 00:37:48,199
Our team works quite well together.

554
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,499
I worked until my nails broke.

555
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,599
You only worked on the POS. I think I dislocated my shoulder.

556
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,087
What about tomorrow?

557
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,205
I'll have to meet the franchise owner.

558
00:37:58,205 --> 00:38:01,073
The company will have to use its reserves depending on the situation.

559
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:03,049
If they don't, I don't know,

560
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:05,446
- but I won't come tomorrow. Bye.
- Goodbye.

561
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:08,299
- Goodbye.
- Thanks for working hard.

562
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:10,600
It's our job, too.

563
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,826
You should feel apologetic to me.

564
00:38:13,826 --> 00:38:17,316
- I'll be off.
- Bye.

565
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:22,414
You two should get going. I need to return the car to the office.

566
00:38:22,415 --> 00:38:25,476
I have to go look for the owner. I'll use it and return it.

567
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:27,906
- You two worked hard, too.
- Should I come with you?

568
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:31,642
Stop making me feel worse. Go home and rest.

569
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,842
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

570
00:38:32,842 --> 00:38:35,644
Yes. You worked hard.

571
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:43,253
Oh, my legs.

572
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:14,349
Mister Franchisee, Avoiding me is not the answer.

573
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:16,488
Please call me.

574
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,130
[Coffee Bay]

575
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:59,949
He said you were like this, right? That punk.

576
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:01,870
"That punk"?

577
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,099
Should I call him brother-in-law?

578
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,700
Now that you're in love again?

579
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,884
What are you talking about?

580
00:41:10,884 --> 00:41:14,733
Did Gyeong Seon say that I'm dating him again?

581
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,853
Well, your relationship was so intense, it must be hard to end.

582
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:24,399
As if!

583
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,445
You sure are funny.

584
00:41:26,446 --> 00:41:29,445
What do you know to assume such things?

585
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,948
I heard everything, okay?

586
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:35,869
What kind of relationship was it that even your junior feels bad for you?

587
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:39,299
When dating someone, do you just ask how they're doing?

588
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:40,899
It should be hot.

589
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:43,048
Otherwise, you're the weird one.

590
00:41:43,049 --> 00:41:46,562
It isn't right to the person you date. You mistreated that person.

591
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,551
You should be crazy, passionate, and intense when you like each other.

592
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:53,318
That's normal. Do you know that?

593
00:41:53,993 --> 00:41:55,649
Oh, really?

594
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:57,410
You're also a professional when it comes to love.

595
00:41:57,411 --> 00:42:00,360
I'll make sure to remember that and use it.

596
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,262
Why do you keep speaking so sarcastically?

597
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:09,332
Who? Me?

598
00:42:10,973 --> 00:42:12,999
Even that tone right now.

599
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,549
I wasn't.

600
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:16,140

601
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:25,333
I apologize if I made you feel bad.

602
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:26,989
Sorry.

603
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,203
It's raining.

604
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,466
Yes, it is.

605
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,303
They didn't say it would rain.

606
00:42:58,303 --> 00:43:00,465
You don't have an umbrella, right?

607
00:43:00,465 --> 00:43:02,215
I don't.

608
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:04,299
I'll just get rained on.

609
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:06,655
Why would you get rained on for no reason?

610
00:43:07,243 --> 00:43:10,385
Because you've made me upset so I'm burning up.

611
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,809
I've said I'm sorry. Stop being angry.

612
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,560
Fine.

613
00:43:24,299 --> 00:43:26,415
I should be the one who's sorry.

614
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:31,399
I kept you from eating hot, hot oven pizza with Kang Se Yeong.

615
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:35,539
It couldn't be helped, so please forgive me.

616
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,649
No need for forgiveness.

617
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,099
You could come, too.

618
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:43,020
Why would I go when I'm being included against your will?

619
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:44,470
What do you mean, "against my will"?

620
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:46,049
What do I mean?

621
00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:48,141
Didn't you say, "Noona, do you want to come, too?"

622
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:51,530
It wasn't even, "Let's go." It was, "You want to come."

623
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:54,100
Did I say that?

624
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,654
I was making plans without thinking, so I misspoke.

625
00:43:56,654 --> 00:43:59,805
Yes, I'm sure you couldn't focus.

626
00:44:00,502 --> 00:44:02,299
Hey.

627
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:06,094
Do guys like girls just because they're pretty?

628
00:44:06,788 --> 00:44:08,878
We do.

629
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:12,480
So annoying.

630
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,354
You're prettier, Noona.

631
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:35,399
It doesn't look like it will stop.

632
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:37,600
Let's call a taxi here.

633
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,054
How will we get to the street?

634
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:41,300
Stay here. I'll buy an umbrella.

635
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,449
Oh, we should just go...

636
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,002
How much?

637
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:29,663
What?

638
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:33,769
Come here.

639
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,301
You said I shouldn't get rained on.

640
00:45:43,302 --> 00:45:44,503
I got rained on a bit.

641
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:48,202
Geez, why did you only buy one umbrella?

642
00:45:48,202 --> 00:45:50,099
A red one, at that?

643
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,087
Don't you know? Buying umbrellas and lighters is the biggest waste of all.

644
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,199
Okay, rich man.

645
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:59,971
We will both end up half-wet like this.

646
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:02,214
There's a solution for that.

647
00:46:02,215 --> 00:46:03,657

813
00:59:20,899 --> 00:59:23,000
It's quite a spectacle.

814
00:59:28,154 --> 00:59:31,110
Gosh, seriously.

815
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:34,106
- Sorry.
- Hey, Man.

816
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,593
What's with you?

817
00:59:39,857 --> 00:59:42,177
Come on, you punk.

818
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,533
Jin Ah.

819
00:59:50,533 --> 00:59:54,006
Why are you standing there like that?

820
00:59:54,006 --> 00:59:58,005
Gyu Min bought me and your dad some couple scarves.

821
00:59:58,005 --> 01:00:00,025
You don't know how nice they are.

822
01:00:00,025 --> 01:00:02,349
- Come look.
- I need to change.

823
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:03,862
Hey.

824
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:09,200
Gyu Min, eat up. There's lots of food.

825
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,149
Why would you do something like this?

826
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,918
Be quiet.

827
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,028
We heard from Gyu Min that you fought.

828
01:00:21,029 --> 01:00:22,817
"A fight"?

829
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,292
When you date, you can fight once in a while.

830
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:30,102
He made a decision to come and yet you glare at him like that?

831
01:00:30,103 --> 01:00:34,100
I don't know why you're getting more indifferent.

832
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,397
Did you drink?

833
01:00:35,397 --> 01:00:37,198
How can I not drink?

834
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:39,749
He's made it so that I can't be sober.

835
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:44,049
- How old am I that you and Dad are–
- Exactly.

836
01:00:44,049 --> 01:00:46,899
How old are you that you can't even keep a man?

837
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,000
Why must your parents get involved?

838
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,200
Aren't you embarrassed at all?

839
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,500
Be better, would you?

840
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,452
I keep telling you this.

841
01:00:55,453 --> 01:00:58,153
Where do you think you'll meet another guy like Gyu Min?

842
01:00:58,153 --> 01:01:02,267
He works at one of the top law firms, and look at his family.

843
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:05,167
His parents went to Seoul University.

844
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:08,036
There's nothing more to hope for.

845
01:01:08,788 --> 01:01:10,509
Your future husband is important,

846
01:01:10,509 --> 01:01:14,342
but your future parents-in-law are also important.

847
01:01:14,342 --> 01:01:19,705
It's a great fortune for you to meet someone like Gyu Min.

848
01:01:19,705 --> 01:01:22,299
You should be incredibly grateful.

849
01:01:22,299 --> 01:01:24,647
You should know that before you act up.

850
01:01:25,747 --> 01:01:28,147
You better not frown when you come back out.

851
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:49,293
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

852
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,173
Come home with me.

853
01:01:53,173 --> 01:01:54,422
It's okay.

854
01:01:54,424 --> 01:01:56,600
Is it because of my sister's boyfriend?

855
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,593
Why does it matter? We will be in my room.

856
01:01:58,594 --> 01:02:00,300
It's fine.

857
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:04,254
I should meet your parents sometime, though, so I'll make time for another day.

858
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:07,463
I was going to ask you to put games on my console.

859
01:02:07,463 --> 01:02:09,550
That's why I'm not going.

860
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:13,244
Bye.

861
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:20,212
Seung Ho!

862
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,310
What is taking her so long?

863
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:29,962
Oh my.

864
01:02:30,899 --> 01:02:32,399
Mom, Dad.

865
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,300
Don't be surprised.

866
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:38,589
It seems like Gyu Min wants me to look this way.

867
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:41,499
He says that I'm too much like konjac jelly.

868
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,472
He's saying I'm too bland.

869
01:02:44,472 --> 01:02:48,300
Honey, why are you just sitting there? You should look at me.

870
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,385
How do I look?

871
01:02:50,385 --> 01:02:53,849
Do you like it?

872
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,681
It's not enough for you, is it?

873
01:02:58,904 --> 01:03:01,649
Should I have worn something shorter?

874
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:04,399
Should I have put on redder lipstick?

875
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,996
Net stockings!

876
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:10,467
- I don't have any, so...
- Hey!

877
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,500
Right, Mom and Dad are here.

878
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,900
That's a bit overboard, right?

879
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,928
Yes. Sit down, sit down.

880
01:03:21,929 --> 01:03:24,359
Sit down, okay?

881
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:36,432
I'm craving wine, though.

882
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:42,120
Aren't you dating anyone?

883
01:03:43,218 --> 01:03:44,318
No.

884
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:46,799
Wow. How unusual for you.

885
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,753
Not even a little something with anyone?

886
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:54,290
So you do have something. Tell me about it.

887
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,299
What do you want to know?

888
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,250
Oh, something's not going well.

889
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:01,072
Is she difficult?

890
01:04:01,072 --> 01:04:02,381
She's scary.

891
01:04:02,382 --> 01:04:04,662
Why? Who is it? How old?

892
01:04:04,663 --> 01:04:07,027
Twenty-three? Twenty-four?

893
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,601
Thirty-five.

894
01:04:11,822 --> 01:04:14,733
You crazy punk. Are you crazy?

895
01:04:14,733 --> 01:04:17,346
You've become a psycho after coming back from the U.S.

896
01:04:17,346 --> 01:04:19,404
What? Thirty-five years old?

897
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:23,100
That's the same age as our sisters.

898
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,736
Can you actually have something with her?

899
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:29,019
To put it simply, it'd be like dating Yun Jin Ah.

900
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:32,299
Oh, I'm getting goosebumps.

901
01:04:32,299 --> 01:04:35,250
Hey, don't go any further and end it.

902
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:38,246
Don't get chained down and suffer.

903
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,345
Mom.

904
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:03,556
When you were dating Dad, did he ever cheat on you?

905
01:05:03,556 --> 01:05:08,267
Come on. What kind of person do you think I am?

906
01:05:08,267 --> 01:05:13,100
For me, Kim Mi Yeon is my one and only.

907
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:16,145
Here's looking at you, kid.

908
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:19,749
"One and only"? Yes, right. I even caught him.

909
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,678
Really?

910
01:05:21,678 --> 01:05:24,898
Why would you bring that up?

911
01:05:24,898 --> 01:05:27,099
So what did you do, Mom?

912
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,414
Did you let it go?

913
01:05:28,414 --> 01:05:32,501
Let it go? Why would I? I hit him on the back of his head.

914
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:35,918
- Like this?
- Ouch!

915
01:05:35,918 --> 01:05:38,392
- That hurts.
- Hey.

916
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:41,750
There's a limit to joking around.

917
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,499
Why are you acting like that?

918
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,292
Honey, stay put.

919
01:05:47,292 --> 01:05:48,844
Gyu Min.

920
01:05:49,538 --> 01:05:50,814
Yes, Mother.

921
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:53,415
You had another woman besides Jin Ah.

922
01:05:58,675 --> 01:06:01,483
This is so absurd.

923
01:06:01,484 --> 01:06:05,187
I never saw you that way. How could you betray us like that?

924
01:06:05,187 --> 01:06:08,592
Did you really? You punk...

925
01:06:08,592 --> 01:06:10,267
Dad!

926
01:06:10,979 --> 01:06:13,080
Dad!

927
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:25,499
He's probably still there, right?

928
01:06:25,499 --> 01:06:29,178
Gosh, they're probably making such a scene.

929
01:06:29,178 --> 01:06:31,350
You said your parents are home.

930
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:33,828
Mom and Dad encourage them.

931
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,047
You should just use words.

932
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:49,957
Goodness. Really?

933
01:06:49,957 --> 01:06:52,840
Honey, my gosh.

934
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,824
What kind of a punk...

935
01:06:54,824 --> 01:06:57,502
Honey, you'll get hurt.

936
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,509
I... I admit I was wrong.

937
01:07:02,509 --> 01:07:03,713
But it wasn't just me.

938
01:07:03,713 --> 01:07:06,450
She cheated, too. She has another man.

939
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:07,549
Lee Gyu Min!

940
01:07:07,549 --> 01:07:10,048
What? It's not like I'm making things up.

941
01:07:10,049 --> 01:07:12,749
Is this why you came here? Is this why you came?

942
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,669
Do you think it was easy for me to come?

943
01:07:14,669 --> 01:07:16,368
Then why did you come?

944
01:07:16,368 --> 01:07:18,867
Your parents told me to come. Am I supposed to say no?

945
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,899
You should have.

946
01:07:20,899 --> 01:07:25,488
If you had any respect for me or my parents,

947
01:07:25,488 --> 01:07:28,200
you should have politely declined.

948
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,607
If I had drunk more today, it wouldn't have ended with just one hit.

949
01:07:31,607 --> 01:07:34,167
- Jin Ah, what's going on?
- Fine, fine. Hit me.

950
01:07:34,168 --> 01:07:37,909
If that will make you feel better, I'll accept it, so hit me.

951
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:39,008
How pathetic.

952
01:07:39,009 --> 01:07:41,908
I'm trying to make it work and go back to how it was.

953
01:07:41,909 --> 01:07:44,710
Dream on. That will never happen!

954
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:47,649
Are you saying that you're really going to break up with me?

955
01:07:47,649 --> 01:07:49,347
Didn't we break up already?

956
01:07:49,347 --> 01:07:52,557
Yun Jin Ah, what's going on here?

957
01:07:52,557 --> 01:07:54,301
I'll explain it all later.

958
01:07:54,301 --> 01:07:58,077
Why later? Do it now.

959
01:07:58,077 --> 01:08:00,209
Should I say it in front of your parents?

960
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:03,646
Who was that guy who took you away in front of your office?

961
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:06,107
Who was it?

962
01:08:06,107 --> 01:08:07,124
You pretend.

963
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:11,360
You just turn me into the trash that cheats, but what about you?

964
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:15,309
Does it make you feel better to twist things that way?

965
01:08:15,309 --> 01:08:18,409
Then why can't you tell me who he is?

966
01:08:18,409 --> 01:08:20,360
You have no reason to fool me if you didn't cheat.

967
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:23,539
I'm going crazy because you won't tell me!

968
01:08:23,539 --> 01:08:25,409
I like him!

969
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:29,897
Yes, he's someone I like. So, what?

970
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,498
Oh my. What do I do?

971
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,585
I'm home.

972
01:08:34,585 --> 01:08:37,336
Seung Ho's home. What am I going to do?

973
01:08:37,336 --> 01:08:38,640
Oh, Jun Hui.

974
01:08:38,641 --> 01:08:40,260
Oh, dear.

975
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,918
Oh.

976
01:08:44,336 --> 01:08:45,276
What's going on?

977
01:08:45,276 --> 01:08:47,327
What happened is...

978
01:08:47,328 --> 01:08:49,211
Oh, it's him!

979
01:08:49,211 --> 01:08:52,199
What do you mean, "It's him"?

980
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,604
Who? Jun Hui?

981
01:08:53,605 --> 01:08:55,845
Tell them!

982
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:04,843
Let go of that hand.

983
01:09:04,843 --> 01:09:06,150
Hey.

984
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,858
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing?

985
01:09:18,858 --> 01:09:20,278
Oh my, my son.

986
01:09:20,278 --> 01:09:22,199
Hey, Seo Jun Hui!

987
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,380
- Hey, hey!
- Oh no.

988
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,150
♫ You can dance ♫

989
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:39,030
♫ Every dance with the guy that gives you the eye, and let him hold you tight ♫

990
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:44,652
Jin Ah said she liked him. She said she likes him.

991
01:09:44,652 --> 01:09:46,099
I heard you came to my place.

992
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:49,394
I'm asking if you came to me.

993
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:51,384
You keep being cute, Noona.

994
01:09:51,384 --> 01:09:53,505
Don't you know how old I am?

995
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:57,546
Doesn't that depend on who's looking?

996
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,749
Relationships between men and women are about timing.

997
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,617
What if the timing is always off?

998
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:05,957
I better move fast.

999
01:10:05,957 --> 01:10:08,142
Make things hot.

1000
01:10:08,142 --> 01:10:10,280
Noona, you know...

1001
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,050
If by chance...

1002
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:13,203
"If by chance"?

1003
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:14,935
If by chance, I...

1004
01:10:14,935 --> 01:10:16,489
You what?

1005
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:18,115
If...

1006
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,122
If I asked you to buy me food tomorrow, would you?

1007
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:35,700
♫ And don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be ♫
