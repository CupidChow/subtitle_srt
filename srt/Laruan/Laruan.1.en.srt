1
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,350
Maybe a lounge room?

2
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,220
For you and your close friends?

3
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,016
You really impressed me!

4
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,750
You’ve done your homework.

5
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,100
My wife? She likes these.

6
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,041
She’ll fall in love with these.

7
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,475
How much?

8
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:54,195
Expensive. But, one of a kind sir.

9
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,345
I have a specialty supplier
called Haven.

10
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:58,157
It’s small.

11
00:03:58,182 --> 00:03:59,516
But, very exclusive.

12
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:02,149
How much are the rates
of your supplier?

13
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:04,008
They’re a little pricey.

14
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,225
But, for a reason.

15
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,500
I have a relationship with them...

16
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:11,235
so, I can get up to 75 percent
discount on those Italian sofas.

17
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:15,624
And up to 25 to 30 percent off
on those furnitures.

18
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:17,398
- Okay.
- Just for you.

19
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:20,335
And those art pieces

20
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,933
by your famous husband, Rene...

21
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,930
Will he make originals for us?

22
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:27,908
Yes, of course Mr. Avila
just for you.

23
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,933
My wife and I love his work.

24
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:33,548
And we’d like to
meet him one day.

25
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,948
I heard he’s a recluse.

26
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:38,142
But, maybe for us?

27
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:40,783
He will be thrilled, Mr. Avila.

28
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:41,901
Okay.

29
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:43,714
Let’s do this.

30
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,509
My lawyer will get in touch with you.

31
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,141
What did he say?!

32
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:51,597
‘Yes’ to everything.

33
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:52,622
‘Yes’ to us.

34
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:53,933
‘Yes’ to Haven.

35
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,321
And ‘yes’ to Rene.

36
00:04:55,673 --> 00:04:56,908
You know what?

37
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:58,808
This calls for a celebration.

38
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,283
- We need good wine.
- Save the wine for later.

39
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:02,016
All of it.

40
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,110
He wants to
formalize everything.

41
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:08,135
Wow. You’re amazing.

42
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:12,017
Can you imagine?

43
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:15,017
Yeah.

44
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,667
I can imagine.

45
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:19,032
Yes, I can.

46
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,554
Don’t forget.

47
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,017
We have dinner tonight.

48
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,167
And as always,

49
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:24,946
bring a date.

50
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,081
What did my wife do
this time?

51
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:33,356
Your beautiful wife...

52
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:35,006
just made ten million today.

53
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:37,706
Oh, wow!

54
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:39,556
Are you also in sales?

55
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,184
God forbid, no!

56
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:42,986
Well. I’m in sales.

57
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:45,722
I don’t think I’ll meet
my quota this month.

58
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:46,806
What’s your secret?

59
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:47,931
Her legs.

60
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:49,956
That is so sexist, Geoff!

61
00:05:58,114 --> 00:05:59,364
Easy, Cam...

62
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:01,714
Camille.

63
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:04,739
Oh my God.
You’re my girl crush right now.

64
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,067
Cheers!

65
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,457
It’s research.

66
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,214
I will find out

67
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:13,964
all details from my clients.

68
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:16,530
The secrets are in their houses.

69
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,089
That’s where they show
who they really are.

70
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:20,780
Listen to this.
It’s a masterclass.

71
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:22,059
Quiet, Geoff!

72
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:24,271
If they’re insecure

73
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:26,005
and need to show off...

74
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:27,457
If they’re married

75
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:28,661
I will find out...

76
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:30,364
Are they still in love?

77
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,830
But, what if...

78
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,755
they’re not in love anymore?

79
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,332
- Separate bedrooms...
- Damn, Geoff! I’m telling the story here!

80
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,489
Private dressing rooms.

81
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:43,839
Places they can hide in.

82
00:06:43,864 --> 00:06:45,530
Soundproof walls.

83
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:53,106
I also have good news
for you, love.

84
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:54,739
What can that be?

85
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:55,714
The client

86
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:57,464
is a big fan of
your works!

87
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,405
And you will make three.

88
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,489
- Congratulations, Rene.
- Wow, congrats!

89
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:03,051
- Let’s go!
- Nice.

90
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:07,030
Where will I be now
without you?

91
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:10,589
Just the opposite, love.

92
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:12,614
What will I do without you?

93
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,739
Look at that, Geoff.

94
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:18,762
They’re so sweet.

95
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:23,155
Oh...

96
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:25,903
The client wants
a few changes.

97
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:26,964
To the office?

98
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,489
Take a look at the draft.

99
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:30,989
And bring your glass.

100
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:32,655
Don’t take too long, Geoff.

101
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,764
Excuse me.

102
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,239
More wine?

103
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:39,614
No.

104
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:41,364
I’m okay with this beer.

105
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:49,239
So, you’re an artist?

106
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,614
How long do you think
they’ll take?

107
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:05,114
Forty minutes to...

108
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:06,780
One hour.

109
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,155
One hour?!

110
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,864
Ready anytime...

111
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:16,780
This feels like
senior high all over again.

112
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:19,780
Just like prom night.

113
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:21,389
You’re so naughty.

114
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,839
Do you want to go in?
Let’s go?

115
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:31,286
Yeah. Let’s go.

116
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:36,043
How did you and Geoff meet?

117
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:38,404
Online.

118
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:40,552
- Online?
- Yeah.

119
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:42,122
Actually...

120
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:44,113
I’m impressed with him.

121
00:08:44,364 --> 00:08:45,589
Because

122
00:08:45,614 --> 00:08:48,530
I thought he was a catfish. But...

123
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:49,305
Catfish?

124
00:08:49,372 --> 00:08:50,325
A fish?

125
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:54,714
I needed to search his profile

126
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:56,589
in BizLinks.

127
00:08:56,614 --> 00:08:57,839
Bizlink?

128
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:59,786
The networking site.

129
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:03,589
I don’t do computers.

130
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:05,607
I only have a cellphone... basic.

131
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:11,294
- Marry me.
- What?

132
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:12,364
No!

133
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:14,544
Why? Why not?

134
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:15,614
Huh?

135
00:09:16,114 --> 00:09:17,489
Can you paint?

136
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:18,964
What do you mean?

137
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:21,514
Are you a famous artist?

138
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:22,950
Shh. No.

139
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,739
Precisely.

140
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:29,964
What do you paint?

141
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:31,083
Those.

142
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,989
Those are my works.

143
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,739
Look around.

144
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:38,137
Thanks.

145
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:49,655
Wow.

146
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:51,740
Beautiful.

147
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:45,364
Geoff?

148
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:47,464
Fuck.

149
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:50,013
Camille, I can’t do this.
We’ll get caught.

150
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:53,060
Come on. Don’t stop.

151
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,339
What do you mean... hey!

152
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,552
I can’t.

153
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:01,655
Hey.

154
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,339
Can you stop?
We’ll get caught.

155
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,732
Fuck you!

156
00:11:05,757 --> 00:11:07,364
- Next time.
- Geoff!

157
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:09,214
Geoff!

158
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,864
I wanna go home!

159
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,405
Geoff!!!

160
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,966
Geoff!

161
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:17,154
What happened?

162
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:25,128
I’m gonna throw up.
I’m going home.

163
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:26,864
Wait.

164
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,136
Hold on. Wait...

165
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,489
What happened?

166
00:11:35,964 --> 00:11:37,464
I don’t know. Maybe...

167
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,905
She’s allergic to seafood.

168
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:41,989
We didn’t serve
any seafood.

169
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:43,972
- Geoff!
- Come again for dinner next week.

170
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:45,489
I gotta go.

171
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:46,514
Lovely dinner.

172
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:53,364
I want you to start immediately
for our new client.

173
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:54,589
‘Your’ client.

174
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,690
He has no taste in art. But...

175
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:58,706
He wants your works.

176
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,464
Create for...

177
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,630
bigger spaces.

178
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:07,925
Make the pieces
bigger than usual.

179
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:09,659
The color palette...

180
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,339
It should be warm.

181
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Maybe amber or ochre.

182
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:15,880
Modern.

183
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:18,214
And don’t make the same
pieces you’ve done before.

184
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,565
I’ll make sure this client
pays at least five million.

185
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,409
This client is so rich.

186
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,231
He’s your fan.

187
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:32,256
But, he’s clueless
about art.

188
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:33,756
You already said that.

189
00:12:34,215 --> 00:12:35,590
He has no taste in art.

190
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,686
I’m just reminding you
so you won’t forget.

191
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:42,905
More money for you.

192
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,405
Whatever you need.

193
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:46,989
Thank you, love.

194
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,405
That’s the only way
for me to make money.

195
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:51,864
Darling.

196
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,456
We will both make money
from your works.

197
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:15,405
Was Geoff’s date cute?

198
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:25,030
I don’t know.

199
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:27,780
I can’t even
remember her name.

200
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:29,864
I think

201
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:32,245
she’s pretty.

202
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:37,530
If you say so.

203
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,655
I think

204
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,280
she’s pretty.

205
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:46,780
What?!

206
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:49,989
No!

207
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:53,239
I’m not in the mood anymore.

208
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:24,030
What are you doing?!

209
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,186
Stop it!

210
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:30,686
Stop it!

211
00:14:33,114 --> 00:14:34,389
Please!

212
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:37,739
Stop it!

213
00:14:37,764 --> 00:14:39,717
Why are you doing this?!

214
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:41,239
Fuck you!

215
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:42,614
Stop!

216
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,725
Whore!

217
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:49,489
Don't! What are you doing?

218
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:57,364
Next time

219
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,755
let’s lock the door.

220
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,342
No. That’s more suspicious.

221
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:04,730
You know what? Admit it.
You want to get caught.

222
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:06,130
You want Rene
to know about me.

223
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,280
That’s the last thing
that I want.

224
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:10,364
How come it’s not us?

225
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:12,963
You have an expiry date.

226
00:15:12,988 --> 00:15:15,279
You’re only good from
high school until college.

227
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:17,214
Wow!

228
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,614
We were so in love.

229
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:19,988
Not really.

230
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,714
By the way, where do
you find your dates?

231
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,505
The girls you bring
are so boring!

232
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,405
- Yes, ma’am. Yes, ma’am.
- Do better!

233
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:30,505
- I’ve told you before...
- Huh?

234
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,864
Follow the rules.

235
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:38,405
You know what, Camille?

236
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,645
I’m tired of your rules.

237
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:45,864
Why can’t we just fuck in the office
like normal people?

238
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:47,432
- Stupid!
- What?

239
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:49,332
Normal people don’t
have sex in the office.

240
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:50,364
They might.

241
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:52,319
You know, given the situation...

242
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:53,714
Just saying.

243
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:55,130
As your boss...

244
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,811
I’m giving you permission then.

245
00:15:56,903 --> 00:15:57,528
Go.

246
00:15:57,614 --> 00:16:00,178
Take five minutes
and jerk off in the bathroom.

247
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,155
Hey!

248
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,006
Don’t be so sensitive.

249
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,334
Where are you going?
We have work.

250
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,084
I’ll take a day off.

251
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:13,309
I’ll go home.

252
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:14,625
I’m gonna take five.

253
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,100
And jerk off.

254
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,059
And then...

255
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:18,750
Look for a real girlfriend.

256
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,702
Make the pieces bigger
than your usual.

257
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,375
The color palette...

258
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,934
It should be warm.

259
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,358
Maybe amber or ochre.

260
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:58,125
Who’s the prettiest
of them all?

261
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,334
No.

262
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,084
Maybe.

263
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,959
Oh, fuck.

264
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,875
Hello?

265
00:17:32,193 --> 00:17:33,647
What do you want?

266
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,209
You, stupid.

267
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:37,678
It’s after office hours.

268
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,875
Hey...

269
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:40,888
I’m sorry about earlier.

270
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:42,334
I was just playing.

271
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,625
Can we make up already?

272
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,084
I was just about to get a shower.

273
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,584
I’m caressing my boobs.

274
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:52,341
You know that
I can’t see you, right?

275
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:54,499
Use your imagination.

276
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:56,654
Forget it.

277
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,434
I found someone already.

278
00:17:58,459 --> 00:17:59,309
Fine.

279
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,334
Fuck you!

280
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,443
Bye!

281
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:03,607
Wow.

282
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,591
Thea.

283
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,210
I’m just gonna get a shower.

284
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,459
Thea, Thea...

285
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:38,121
Okay.

286
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:39,334
“We’re on...”

287
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:43,015
“Dinner tomorrow night.”

288
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:45,125
“I’ll make it up.”

289
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,584
“Ok, we're on. Dinner tomorrow night.
I’ll make it up.”

290
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:32,865
- Geoff!
- Hey!

291
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:35,849
This is Thea.

292
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,975
Hi Thea!

293
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,934
It’s Thea.

294
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,334
Thea Aldea.

295
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:40,678
Funny.

296
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:41,834
Welcome.

297
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,875
Come in, Thea Aldea.

298
00:19:53,768 --> 00:19:54,559
Thea, here...

299
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,184
is an art major.

300
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,334
An art major?

301
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,084
- Yeah.
- Where?

302
00:19:58,109 --> 00:19:59,585
City Fine Arts.

303
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,084
Top of her class.

304
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,125
Very impressive, Thea Aldea.

305
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:10,858
City Fine Arts?

306
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,702
Do you know

307
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:13,875
Fred Holazo?

308
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,608
Yes, sir.
I attend his classes.

309
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,084
Small world.

310
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,750
Oh my god!

311
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:28,608
Oh my god!

312
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:30,709
Oh my god!

313
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:32,412
Mr. Menendez?

314
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:35,373
You’re Rene Menendez?

315
00:20:36,224 --> 00:20:37,388
My God...

316
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:38,434
Shit.

317
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:40,139
Oh, shit.

318
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:42,812
Oops...

319
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:44,537
I’m sorry.

320
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,835
It’s an honor
to meet you, sir.

321
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:49,750
Just ‘Rene.’

322
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,882
You have a new fan.

323
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:53,998
He doesn’t speak up for anyone.

324
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,250
What criticisms have you heard?

325
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:05,250
Do your professors

326
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:06,775
talk trash about my works?

327
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,709
- Since when did you care?
- We study...

328
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,584
We study about you

329
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,303
and your works.

330
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,918
Let’s go inside, guys.

331
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,318
Bring the pizza, Geoff.

332
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:19,419
Okay.

333
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:25,513
Sir?

334
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,601
Oh my god.

335
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:37,334
Is that a Degas?

336
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,709
No. I made that.

337
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:46,334
The only sculpture I made
from school days.

338
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,193
Hundred percent not a Degas.

339
00:21:48,218 --> 00:21:49,343
It’s beautiful.

340
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:50,435
Thank you.

341
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:51,677
Do you like it?

342
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:52,707
You can have it.

343
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:53,725
No, sir.

344
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,684
We’re not giving away
one million tonight...

345
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:57,084
to Thea Aldea.

346
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,359
One million?

347
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,469
Sure.

348
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:01,953
I’ll take it.

349
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:05,031
Can I have a selfie?

350
00:22:05,295 --> 00:22:06,469
Not tonight.

351
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:08,084
With the Degas?

352
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,132
Sure.

353
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:12,375
I’ll hold it for you.

354
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,209
Hey, we should go.

355
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:22,334
- Thea.
- Sit, Thea.

356
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,025
Thea. Sit here.

357
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,107
Okay?

358
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:31,834
Don’t worry, I got you.

359
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,552
Relax.

360
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:44,209
How do you study my works?

361
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,731
They let us copy
the techniques.

362
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:50,021
We all got bad grades.

363
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:52,672
If I flunk, sir...

364
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,500
It will be your fault.

365
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,459
Maybe, next time...

366
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,709
You can show me your works.

367
00:23:00,638 --> 00:23:01,792
No!

368
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,209
That’s shameless of me.

369
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:12,300
It’s so trippy to be
surrounded by your works.

370
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,980
I’m like a kid in a museum.

371
00:23:15,684 --> 00:23:17,934
Those kids in the museum

372
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,584
maybe they’ll get bored
with my works.

373
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:22,834
Not me.

374
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:25,559
Thea, do you want
red wine or white?

375
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,475
Just beer please.

376
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,589
I have my period.

377
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:31,809
Beer for...

378
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:33,459
Dysmenorrhea.

379
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:36,386
Sorry. TMI.

380
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:37,934
What’s TMI?

381
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,709
Too much information!

382
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,084
Geoff...

383
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,900
The client has moved the deadline.

384
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:46,740
Geoff?!

385
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:48,224
Yeah? What?

386
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:51,183
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

387
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:52,750
The client moved the deadline.

388
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:53,500
Got it.

389
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:54,875
So?!

390
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,834
You want us
to share my beer?

391
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:02,809
Thea. You know, this house?

392
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:05,375
Including all of Rene’s art works.

393
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,066
It can cost, up to...

394
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:09,714
About a hundred million.

395
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:13,459
I hope you have fire insurance.

396
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:15,400
So what, if these all
burns to the ground?

397
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:16,184
Right?

398
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:17,084
Oh my...

399
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:20,184
I will die and cry.

400
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,261
Oops.

401
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:24,714
I will cry first and then die.

402
00:24:25,555 --> 00:24:26,889
Let’s go to the office?

403
00:24:26,914 --> 00:24:28,250
We still have work.

404
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:30,334
Work?

405
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,434
Geoff?!

406
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:31,959
Yeah.

407
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:33,745
- Let’s go to my office.
- Okay.

408
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:35,355
So hardworking.

409
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,284
Excuse me guys.

410
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,750
Duty calls.

411
00:24:41,334 --> 00:24:43,750
Who is this new toy of yours?

412
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:45,750
Who?

413
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,120
Thea?

414
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,000
I know her funny name.

415
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:53,084
Nothing...

416
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:55,206
She’s just...

417
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,449
Y’know, maybe she’ll
hit it off with Rene.

418
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,084
More time for us.

419
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:04,880
Hmm?

420
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,256
Put some ketchup.

421
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,042
What?

422
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:18,677
Ketchup. On the pizza.

423
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:21,904
Where did you meet her?

424
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,459
How long have you known her?

425
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:25,459
Hey!

426
00:25:27,476 --> 00:25:28,560
I don’t know.

427
00:25:29,184 --> 00:25:30,809
Probably yesterday.

428
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:32,834
I just swiped right.

429
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:37,834
What kind of house
doesn’t have ketchup?

430
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:39,834
Ketchup is red.

431
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:42,100
It won’t match with

432
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,584
the design of the house.

433
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,459
Sorry.

434
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:48,375
What could possibly
match you two?

435
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,431
Do you like her?

436
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:52,934
- Camille...
- No.

437
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,434
I can’t do this anymore.

438
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:56,184
What’s wrong with you?

439
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:56,834
Are you...

440
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,712
- What?!
- Jealous?

441
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:00,041
Fuck you!

442
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:02,902
Is there...

443
00:26:03,084 --> 00:26:04,459
anything cheap here?

444
00:26:04,484 --> 00:26:05,560
I’m afraid

445
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:08,118
to break these cup noodles.

446
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:11,056
Aha!

447
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:16,709
Ketchup...

448
00:26:18,325 --> 00:26:21,329
Yummy with anything.

449
00:27:13,302 --> 00:27:15,052
What the fuck is that?

450
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:21,959
Now, seriously.
What the fuck was that?!

451
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,234
- Will you stop?
- Why are they laughing?

452
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,584
Geoff, come back next week.

453
00:27:39,622 --> 00:27:40,728
Thea?

454
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,250
- Of course.
- Uhm...

455
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:43,559
- Really?
- Art talk?

456
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:44,875
- Why?!
- Next week?

457
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,859
- Why not?
- Sure.

458
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,434
- Bye, guys!
- Uhm...

459
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,000
I wanted to...

460
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:52,382
can you...

461
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:54,309
pose for me sometime?

462
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:57,334
- Oh my god.
- I want to paint to paint your portrait.

463
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,500
- Oh my god.
- What?!

464
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:00,025
You don’t do portraits!

465
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,000
There’s always a first time.

466
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:04,709
Yes?

467
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:06,625
I’ll pose for you.

468
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,509
It will be an honor.

469
00:28:08,696 --> 00:28:12,287
Rene, what’s up with you?
You have work to do!

470
00:28:15,334 --> 00:28:16,334
Bye, Geoff!

471
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,084
Bye.

472
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:20,353
Bye.

473
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:27,209
Thank you.

474
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:28,059
No.

475
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:28,975
Perfect night.

476
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,709
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

477
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,159
You don’t have to
take me home.

478
00:28:33,184 --> 00:28:34,559
I just wanna make sure
you’re safe.

479
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:35,625
Come on.

480
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:37,709
So, are you gonna do it?

481
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:39,834
Will you really pose for Rene?

482
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:43,001
I’m flattered.
But, I don’t have the time.

483
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,803
Have you started my project?

484
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:55,125
What are you doing?

485
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,875
Nothing.

486
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:58,625
Not a portrait?

487
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,309
No.

488
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:02,309
So, you’re really going
to paint Thea Aldea.

489
00:29:02,334 --> 00:29:03,525
Yes.

490
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,459
Paint me.

491
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:07,750
Are you serious?

492
00:29:08,265 --> 00:29:09,508
Yes.

493
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:12,360
But, who will buy it?

494
00:29:19,142 --> 00:29:20,209
Come in.

495
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:21,234
Thank you.

496
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,000
You have some

497
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,084
interesting pieces here.

498
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:34,834
You’re good.

499
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:37,209
Not really.

500
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,866
Sorry.

501
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:41,709
I only have water.

502
00:29:42,084 --> 00:29:44,084
Nah, I’m good.
It’s okay.

503
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:46,459
You know what?

504
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,625
You should pose for Rene.

505
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,500
You’re so beautiful.

506
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,834
You must be

507
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,959
painted by

508
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:59,125
a great artist like Rene.

509
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,709
Wow...

510
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,125
Weeks?

511
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:07,312
I’ll be absent
on some days.

512
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:08,462
Huh?

513
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,684
I was starstruck

514
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:17,211
and I was also
being nice to him.

515
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:19,000
He’s so friendly.

516
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:24,500
But, you’ll learn
a lot from him.

517
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,584
Right?

518
00:30:25,872 --> 00:30:28,872
I won’t learn anything
by just merely posing.

519
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:31,000
Don’t kid yourself.

520
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:32,607
Are you serious?

521
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,250
You’ll learn a lot.

522
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,459
Do it.

523
00:30:36,146 --> 00:30:37,771
You could make
some cash.

524
00:30:38,576 --> 00:30:40,576
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

525
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,475
I’ll pay you.

526
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,125
I just sent you
Rene’s number.

527
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:52,834
Give him a call.

528
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,834
Yeah?

529
00:30:57,459 --> 00:30:59,084
It’s gonna be worth it.

530
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:02,709
I like this one.

531
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:13,209
Thea Aldea.

532
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:17,209
Who the fuck are you?

533
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:23,875
Damn.

534
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:27,062
Even her paintings are beautiful.

535
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,594
Hey, I’m off.

536
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:48,204
Stupid smile.

537
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,226
Give me your bank details.

538
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:54,961
I’m nervous.

539
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,891
This is an easy gig for you.

540
00:31:58,404 --> 00:31:59,820
How much is it?

541
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:01,625
200 thousand.

542
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,639
200 thousand?

543
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,633
Oh, shit.

544
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:15,834
Give me your details
so I can send the 200 thousand.

545
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,000
Hey. What’s that?

546
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:19,309
My sister.

547
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:20,834
Alright. I’ll talk to you later, okay?

548
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:21,907
Bye.

549
00:32:22,396 --> 00:32:24,396
Who is that this time?

550
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,930
Camille, privacy.

551
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:41,834
Muse?

552
00:33:46,685 --> 00:33:48,688
Or artist.

553
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,059
I’m Rene’s muse.

554
00:33:55,084 --> 00:33:58,477
Always have been.
Always will be.

555
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:04,469
Hey!

556
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,164
What?

557
00:34:08,189 --> 00:34:09,855
I’m your secretary now.

558
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,552
Camille’s office.
May I help you?

559
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:17,834
Mr. Avila...

560
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:22,459
Yes, Mr. Avila. I’m sorry.
Camille is just in another meeting.

561
00:34:22,484 --> 00:34:23,650
Can I get a message?

562
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,625
Of course, sir.

563
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,834
I’m really sorry again
for the hassle.

564
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:28,725
Okay, thank you.

565
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,584
Have a good day.

566
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,359
Bye.

567
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,375
Camille, that sounded urgent.

568
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:34,959
He wants a callback.

569
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,459
- Camille, it’s Mr. Avila.
- I will! Yes!

570
00:34:40,334 --> 00:34:41,959
I’m busy right now.

571
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:44,334
That’s our biggest client.

572
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:47,959
Ah...

573
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:50,084
I know this place.

574
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,584
What are you talking about?
What’s that?

575
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:53,693
I’m researching
for a new client.

576
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:55,459
Who?

577
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,287
Someone new!

578
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:58,646
Camille, who?!

579
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,844
You’re a pro, Thea.

580
00:35:28,953 --> 00:35:30,059
Camille.

581
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:32,334
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?!

582
00:35:32,703 --> 00:35:34,203
Are you following me?

583
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:36,459
What does it look like?

584
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,532
Whatever happened to privacy?

585
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:40,093
Privacy?

586
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:41,188
Camille!

587
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:42,713
Hey, Camille!

588
00:35:48,655 --> 00:35:49,839
You know...

589
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:52,084
This painting will be like shit.

590
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:56,188
I don’t believe you, sir.

591
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,398
Rene.

592
00:35:57,974 --> 00:35:59,086
It’s true.

593
00:35:59,111 --> 00:36:00,736
You’re my very first portrait.

594
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:04,937
You really haven’t
painted a portrait?

595
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:07,434
In art school.

596
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:08,309
Assignment.

597
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,850
Not even a portrait of your wife?

598
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,334
She can’t really

599
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:14,834
stay put in one place.

600
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,133
I’m sure you’ve noticed it.

601
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:20,032
You two look incompatible.

602
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:22,834
You’re brutally honest.

603
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,184
But, I don’t complain.

604
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,724
She’s able to sell my pieces

605
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,584
for the projects
that she designs.

606
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:35,209
I’d still be unknown and hungry

607
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,818
if she didn’t do any of those.

608
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:39,334
So...

609
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,850
Your wife commissions

610
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,584
all your works.

611
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:48,834
Yes.

612
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,459
Well...

613
00:36:55,584 --> 00:36:57,707
She tells me what to make.

614
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,000
And...

615
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:00,834
how big.

616
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,250
Up to...

617
00:37:03,084 --> 00:37:04,625
the last...

618
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,334
- Uhm.
- I’m ready.

619
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:13,750
It’s okay.

620
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:17,125
I’ve posed naked
for my classmates.

621
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:23,418
You have a beautiful body. But...

622
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,652
I only wanted to paint
your face.

623
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,599
Just the face?

624
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:31,492
Yes.

625
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:35,826
You don’t paint
naked women?

626
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:38,934
Nude.

627
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:40,334
Nude painting.

628
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,525
What?

629
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,121
Not, ‘naked.’

630
00:37:47,084 --> 00:37:49,125
”Nakedness reveals itself.”

631
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:55,709
- “Nudity is placed on display.”
- “Nudity is placed on display.”

632
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:56,859
John

633
00:37:57,043 --> 00:37:58,122
Berger.

634
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,957
- “Ways Of Seeing”
- “Ways Of Seeing”

635
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,920
You’re so beautiful.

636
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,459
Have there been many guys...

637
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:18,375
and women who told you that?

638
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,459
This is fun.

639
00:38:20,484 --> 00:38:21,443
Always.

640
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:23,125
Rene is busy.

641
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:24,459
Yeah.

642
00:38:24,484 --> 00:38:26,193
Is he busy
painting Thea?

643
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:27,709
Wait. What?

644
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,746
Many guys have told me that.

645
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:38,748
I date a lot.

646
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:44,614
I’m super broke that’s why...

647
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:46,973
I date a lot.

648
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:50,709
Do you know what
a “booty call” is?

649
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,902
I don’t know anything
about those.

650
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:56,959
That’s good to know.

651
00:38:58,209 --> 00:38:59,959
I’m what you’d call
a ‘Foodie Call.’

652
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:04,527
I date so I can
get free food.

653
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:06,959
I bring home the leftovers.

654
00:39:10,023 --> 00:39:12,732
I feel guilty sometimes. But...

655
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:19,334
Good times.

656
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:46,709
I hurt myself often.

657
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,209
Sometimes...

658
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,334
We deliberately hurt ourselves.

659
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:57,488
Because...

660
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,959
There’s nothing we can do.

661
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,184
I didn’t know she’ll be here.

662
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:05,225
Did you drive her here?

663
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,375
No. I didn’t drive her here.
What do you mean?

664
00:40:07,758 --> 00:40:09,184
She’s Rene’s subject.

665
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:11,160
Yeah. She’s Rene’s subject.

666
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:13,453
Fuck!

667
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,709
Yes, I’m fucking you right now.
What are you talking about?

668
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:16,801
No!

669
00:40:16,826 --> 00:40:18,309
Fuck Thea!

670
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:19,959
You want me to fuck, Thea?

671
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,500
No!

672
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:21,754
Shit!

673
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,500
I’m now officially
a sad girl subject

674
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:29,959
for the portrait.

675
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,294
You’re right.

676
00:40:33,637 --> 00:40:35,250
Let’s start.

677
00:40:37,816 --> 00:40:38,875
Okay?

678
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,025
Are you okay, now?

679
00:40:42,554 --> 00:40:43,888
I want a smile.

680
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:50,475
Why didn’t you tell me
that you invited her?

681
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,750
I did not, Camille.

682
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:53,084
Relax!

683
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:55,875
Your husband Rene
is doing a portrait.

684
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,709
Okay?

685
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:59,084
It might take
weeks or months...

686
00:40:59,613 --> 00:41:00,732
Hey.

687
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:04,209
Can’t you see that Thea
is the perfect girl for us?

688
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,250
- Perfect girl?
- Yeah!

689
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:07,225
What’s going on?

690
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,058
I’m the perfect girl!

691
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:12,059
You are the
perfect girl for me.

692
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:13,434
I love you.

693
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:14,459
Geoff!

694
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:17,709
Fuck!

695
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,209
What, right now?
I’m fucking you, come on.

696
00:41:20,234 --> 00:41:21,644
Enough!

697
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:50,388
Hey. What are you doing?

698
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:54,584
You think they’re
having sex like us?

699
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:56,459
- Fuck you.
- Go, Rene!

700
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,084
Can you stop
being like a jealous wife?

701
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,209
Maybe this is karma.

702
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:15,662
Shut the fuck up, Geoff.

703
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,209
Hi, Miss Camille.

704
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,625
Hello, Thea Aldea.

705
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,334
You done?

706
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:30,434
- Well...
- That was too fast.

707
00:42:30,459 --> 00:42:32,500
- Shut the fuck up, Geoff.
- No. We just started.

708
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:35,850
Maybe, same time next week?

709
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,684
Up to you.
Whenever you’re free.

710
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:39,600
- Yes, happy to.
- That’s cool.

711
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:40,684
That’s cool.

712
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:41,709
Everyday?

713
00:42:42,348 --> 00:42:43,959
Please, find time.

714
00:42:43,984 --> 00:42:46,334
- What’s that like?
- Shut the fuck up, Geoff.

715
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:48,441
Two, three hours a session?

716
00:42:48,644 --> 00:42:51,959
Depends on when she’s free.

717
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:55,834
Sandwich, Rene?

718
00:42:58,959 --> 00:42:59,959
Here.

719
00:42:59,984 --> 00:43:02,025
Thank you.

720
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,750
Will you bring me home?

721
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:06,340
Okay, let’s go.

722
00:43:06,365 --> 00:43:07,615
I’ll take these home.

723
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,265
- Thank you.
- Sure.

724
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:11,459
Bye.

725
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,459
Goodbye.

726
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:15,959
Bye.

727
00:43:16,684 --> 00:43:18,059
I don’t like her.

728
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:20,084
Find another girl
to bring next time.

729
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,875
I’ve already invited her.

730
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:23,209
Besides

731
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,084
She’s perfect.
Thea is perfect.

732
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:26,084
Perfect?!

733
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:28,584
There you go again! “perfect.”

734
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:29,934
She keeps Rene busy.

735
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:31,459
I don’t like it anymore.

736
00:43:31,584 --> 00:43:33,334
Let’s go to hotel or...

737
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,084
your place for a change.

738
00:43:35,171 --> 00:43:36,190
Wow.

739
00:43:36,761 --> 00:43:37,880
That

740
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,084
is a change.

741
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,084
Or I can fuck you
right here too.

742
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:43,740
Hey...

743
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,691
What’s going on with you?

744
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:49,475
Who’s that?

745
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,959
None of your business.

746
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,834
These are all your ideas, remember?

747
00:43:58,209 --> 00:43:59,459
You hate my place.

748
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,000
You hate hotels.

749
00:44:03,084 --> 00:44:06,084
You might hate this car.
You might hate me too. What else?

750
00:44:06,184 --> 00:44:08,434
If you don’t want to bring
someone new...

751
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:10,375
then I don’t wanna
play anymore!

752
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:11,600
Play?

753
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:13,125
Yes, play!

754
00:44:14,174 --> 00:44:16,084
This is all just
a game to you?

755
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,584
Hey, how are you?

756
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:36,305
- Hi.
- Hello.

757
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:38,434
Sit down, please.

758
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:39,584
Hi.

759
00:44:42,584 --> 00:44:43,834
So, how are you?

760
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:46,309
I’m okay.
It’s good to see you.

761
00:44:46,334 --> 00:44:49,684
It’s so nice to see you.
How are you? How are you doing?

762
00:44:49,709 --> 00:44:51,875
Very good. And you?

763
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,775
I’m good.

764
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,584
Do you want anything?

765
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,709
You.

766
00:45:37,247 --> 00:45:38,247
Camille?

767
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:41,232
Thea? I was just
meeting a client.

768
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:43,475
Are you okay?

769
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,059
Yeah... accident.

770
00:45:45,084 --> 00:45:47,309
Thea, I’m sorry.
Please come back.

771
00:45:47,334 --> 00:45:49,584
I’m gonna tell
everyone about you.

772
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:57,188
What a bitch.

773
00:45:57,459 --> 00:45:59,600
I ran into Thea earlier.

774
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:00,934
Your model

775
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,875
is not a model citizen.

776
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,875
What?

777
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:07,209
She was on a date.

778
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:08,975
And?

779
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,977
She left her date.

780
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:13,875
As in, she literally
ran away from her date.

781
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:15,946
Why?

782
00:46:15,971 --> 00:46:17,209
I don’t know.

783
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,875
The date was
touching her all over.

784
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,649
In public!

785
00:46:24,709 --> 00:46:25,834
Poor girl.

786
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:30,344
And her date was
way older than her.

787
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:31,461
So...

788
00:46:31,494 --> 00:46:33,133
now you know.

789
00:46:33,334 --> 00:46:35,459
Thea is a gold digger.

790
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:43,669
What?

791
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,084
Why are you laughing?

792
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:49,084
Thea’s not like that.

793
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:50,584
How do you know?

794
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:52,209
Do you meet with her
out of the house?

795
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:54,084
What do you know about her?

796
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,334
Geoff met her on some
dating app. And...

797
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,775
How truthful are people
on those apps?

798
00:47:00,295 --> 00:47:02,086
What is your concern? Huh?

799
00:47:02,475 --> 00:47:03,225
And also,

800
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,584
why were you there
in the coffee shop?

801
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:10,578
It was near the office.

802
00:47:27,568 --> 00:47:28,609
Hello?

803
00:47:33,209 --> 00:47:34,500
Hi, sir Rene.

804
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:44,084
You’re too sexy.

805
00:47:44,834 --> 00:47:46,209
It’s for you, love.

806
00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:49,250
Not for Geoff?

807
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,809
I can’t hear you.

808
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:53,209
Love you too!

809
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:07,584
What?!

810
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:08,459
Thea?!

811
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,529
Come in.

812
00:48:11,037 --> 00:48:13,162
I don’t recall
Geoff inviting you?

813
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,459
I invited her.

814
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,000
For another session.

815
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,500
What ‘session?’

816
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,883
Portrait.

817
00:48:25,709 --> 00:48:27,375
How’s your hand, Thea?

818
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,490
Let’s go.

819
00:48:36,084 --> 00:48:37,985
Oops. Be careful.

820
00:48:38,164 --> 00:48:39,959
Those steps...

821
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,365
...they’re not leveled.
Come inside.

822
00:48:47,334 --> 00:48:48,959
What happened to your hand?

823
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:50,388
- Well...
- What happened?

824
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:54,023
I had a fist fight

825
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:55,734
with a glass.

826
00:48:57,687 --> 00:48:58,662
That’s funny.

827
00:48:58,750 --> 00:48:59,309
Here...

828
00:48:59,334 --> 00:49:00,334
sit down.

829
00:49:00,587 --> 00:49:01,587
Thank you.

830
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,584
- This is Emma.
- Emma, Camille.

831
00:49:11,459 --> 00:49:12,250
Hey,

832
00:49:12,334 --> 00:49:14,209
your place is beautiful.

833
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:16,434
Where’s Rene?

834
00:49:16,459 --> 00:49:17,875
In his basement

835
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:19,209
with Thea.

836
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:21,180
- Painting.
- Thea?

837
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:23,225
She came over?

838
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,309
- Yah!
- She’s here?

839
00:49:24,334 --> 00:49:25,959
I guess she doesn’t
need you anymore.

840
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:28,047
You're just a ride to her.

841
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:32,625
There’s no way
that we can be alone tonight.

842
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:34,434
I didn’t know she’d be here.

843
00:49:34,459 --> 00:49:35,250
It’s too late.

844
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:36,282
Fuck!

845
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:38,225
Oh...

846
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,125
So, your husband is a painter?

847
00:49:40,196 --> 00:49:42,836
I haven’t met a real painter.

848
00:49:44,101 --> 00:49:46,005
Your house is full of art.

849
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:48,680
There’s a lot of paintings
in our hotel.

850
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,084
I’m a concierge,

851
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:52,209
you know,

852
00:49:52,381 --> 00:49:54,006
at the Overlook?

853
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:55,740
Have you been there?

854
00:49:57,709 --> 00:49:59,309
Oh my god!

855
00:49:59,334 --> 00:50:01,118
This is so beautiful.

856
00:50:02,304 --> 00:50:03,560
Geoff, look.

857
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,959
It’s so pretty.

858
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:07,750
Another one.

859
00:50:12,584 --> 00:50:14,334
I want to meet your husband

860
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,853
and her model.

861
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:18,084
I bet she’s beautiful.

862
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,084
Is it nude?

863
00:50:21,959 --> 00:50:23,750
You know, I was
almost a model.

864
00:50:24,459 --> 00:50:26,209
- When I was in school.
- Really?

865
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:28,709
There was this talent scout.

866
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:30,125
He saw me...

867
00:50:30,709 --> 00:50:32,684
- Then, he said...
- Thea’s Geoff’s ex!

868
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:34,375
Didn’t he tell you that?

869
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,559
That’s not true.

870
00:50:37,584 --> 00:50:40,985
And where did you
find that kind of bitch?!

871
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:43,084
She’s so below you!

872
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:44,834
Online.

873
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,209
I mean, I follow her.

874
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,559
- And...
- You follow her?

875
00:50:47,584 --> 00:50:49,469
I bet you follow her.

876
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:51,559
I follow her art. Okay?

877
00:50:51,584 --> 00:50:52,684
You follow her?

878
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:55,559
- Yeah, I follow her art.
- Now, she has a new follower!

879
00:50:55,584 --> 00:50:57,375
- Good job, Geoff.
- Come on, Camille.

880
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,684
- Really?
- Hello?

881
00:50:58,709 --> 00:50:59,434
Guys?

882
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:01,334
- You’re like...
- Like what?!

883
00:51:01,373 --> 00:51:02,969
Yes, we fuck!

884
00:51:03,788 --> 00:51:05,559
I wanna go home, Geoff.

885
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:06,959
Emma, I’m really sorry.

886
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:08,430
I wanna go now.

887
00:51:08,934 --> 00:51:10,725
- What’s wrong with you?!
- Go!

888
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,282
And fuck here there!

889
00:51:35,709 --> 00:51:37,375
You can be a model too.

890
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:39,959
Do you know that?

891
00:51:42,412 --> 00:51:44,537
I can paint you next time.

892
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:46,709
Shh. Quiet.

893
00:51:52,287 --> 00:51:54,953
Won’t Camille get jealous?

894
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:57,584
It’s just the two of us here.

895
00:51:58,084 --> 00:51:59,375
She’s busy.

896
00:52:04,687 --> 00:52:05,896
Busy with Geoff.

897
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:09,834
Sorry.

898
00:52:11,334 --> 00:52:12,125
Sorry?

899
00:52:13,709 --> 00:52:14,959
For what?

900
00:52:44,768 --> 00:52:45,559
Finally!

901
00:52:45,584 --> 00:52:46,959
You guys are done.

902
00:52:46,984 --> 00:52:49,434
For now.
Thea’s coming back.

903
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:50,475
Why?

904
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,209
Going out for a date, Thea?

905
00:52:52,234 --> 00:52:53,313
No.

906
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:54,459
Too bad.

907
00:52:54,484 --> 00:52:56,891
You’re not going back
to the coffee shop soon?

908
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,684
There’s smudges on your shirt!

909
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:05,334
This will get ruined.

910
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:06,818
I’ll get a towel.

911
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,500
Don’t mind it.

912
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,584
This is easy to clean.

913
00:53:13,459 --> 00:53:14,559
I’ll take you home.

914
00:53:14,584 --> 00:53:17,084
- She’s a big girl, love.
- I’ve already booked my ride.

915
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:18,532
It’s on its way.

916
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:20,850
- Thank you.
- Thank you, too.

917
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,688
I think your ride’s here.

918
00:53:25,257 --> 00:53:26,258
Let’s go.

919
00:53:26,388 --> 00:53:27,388
I’ll take you out.

920
00:53:38,725 --> 00:53:40,559
There’s smudges on your shirt!

921
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,516
This will get ruined.

922
00:54:39,703 --> 00:54:40,946
What?!

923
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:45,493
I don’t want Thea in my house.

924
00:54:45,523 --> 00:54:47,266
Get rid of her.

925
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:50,000
Let Rene finish his painting.

926
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:52,063
This will be over soon.

927
00:54:52,643 --> 00:54:54,434
- I can’t fucking sleep!
- Let’s go.

928
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:55,584
Because of her.

929
00:54:57,459 --> 00:54:58,500
Oh my god!

930
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,750
Are you getting laid?!

931
00:55:01,163 --> 00:55:02,421
Go to sleep.

932
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:04,875
Sorry, love.

933
00:56:05,584 --> 00:56:07,875
The client wants to
see your new works.

934
00:56:07,913 --> 00:56:09,039
Right away.

935
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:10,328
So...

936
00:56:10,404 --> 00:56:13,154
prioritize this and
drop what you’re doing please.

937
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:15,625
It’s a lot of money.

938
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:18,334
I need a break.

939
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:20,459
What?

940
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:22,250
We don’t take breaks.

941
00:56:25,084 --> 00:56:25,875
I want to.

942
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,211
So...

943
00:56:27,236 --> 00:56:28,125
No!

944
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,584
You want a break?

945
00:56:31,584 --> 00:56:32,584
Why?!

946
00:56:33,084 --> 00:56:34,875
I need this client, Rene.

947
00:56:37,372 --> 00:56:40,038
If you want,
look for another painter.

948
00:57:13,938 --> 00:57:16,834
This is real food!

949
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:18,650
Wow. These are
my favorites.

950
00:57:19,194 --> 00:57:20,194
Did you know

951
00:57:20,365 --> 00:57:21,865
that during college

952
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:24,500
my classmates and I will fight over these.

953
00:57:24,959 --> 00:57:27,250
There was this tiny food place
outside school.

954
00:57:27,275 --> 00:57:30,516
- My appetite for this is...
- You better eat a lot.

955
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:32,209
You’ll join me of course.

956
00:57:32,234 --> 00:57:33,234
Oh, yes.

957
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:34,959
Yummy.

958
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,334
Aha!

959
00:57:38,459 --> 00:57:40,125
Let me. I’ll help you.

960
00:57:43,959 --> 00:57:44,459
Here.

961
00:57:44,709 --> 00:57:45,375
You can bring this.

962
00:57:45,584 --> 00:57:47,084
- I’ll take these.
- Sure. Okay.

963
00:57:49,084 --> 00:57:50,584
It’s difficult to believe

964
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:51,459
that you were once

965
00:57:51,484 --> 00:57:52,734
a starving artist.

966
00:57:53,709 --> 00:57:54,834
Years ago,

967
00:57:54,989 --> 00:57:56,184
even if I had nothing

968
00:57:56,209 --> 00:57:58,084
I never stopped painting.

969
00:57:58,959 --> 00:58:01,625
Sometimes, I don’t have
any money to buy a paintbrush.

970
00:58:06,209 --> 00:58:07,625
Up to the point when

971
00:58:07,834 --> 00:58:10,459
my last set of brushes

972
00:58:12,154 --> 00:58:13,029
were useless.

973
00:58:14,084 --> 00:58:15,000
That’s why

974
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:17,334
I was forced to

975
00:58:17,584 --> 00:58:18,834
finger paint.

976
00:58:20,084 --> 00:58:22,709
And eventually,
I used a toothbrush.

977
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,209
Oh my God.

978
00:58:28,459 --> 00:58:30,725
Your early masterpieces

979
00:58:31,116 --> 00:58:33,491
finger plus toothbrush?

980
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,500
No wonder
it’s so hard to copy.

981
00:58:37,959 --> 00:58:41,125
Camille was the first
to sell my paintings.

982
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,711
She showed it to
her circle of friends.

983
00:58:43,736 --> 00:58:45,277
Then, that’s where it...

984
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,125
started to become ‘vay’

985
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,209
va...

986
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:50,109
What’s the term for that?

987
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,584
‘Viral.’

988
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:53,875
It went ‘viral.’

989
00:58:53,915 --> 00:58:54,599
That’s it.

990
00:58:54,624 --> 00:58:55,852
That was it.

991
00:58:55,877 --> 00:58:57,127
That’s where I had
my exposure.

992
00:58:59,076 --> 00:59:02,701
She was able to
sell my original works.

993
00:59:05,787 --> 00:59:07,172
I wouldn’t know

994
00:59:07,388 --> 00:59:08,513
where I’d be

995
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:10,958
if not because of her.

996
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:18,959
That’s my

997
00:59:20,334 --> 00:59:22,209
nightmare scenario.

998
00:59:27,459 --> 00:59:29,008
It’s funny

999
00:59:29,459 --> 00:59:30,875
because I have money

1000
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,334
but I’m still hungry.

1001
00:59:33,412 --> 00:59:34,162
That’s me.

1002
00:59:35,888 --> 00:59:37,013
How about you?

1003
00:59:37,584 --> 00:59:38,334
What are your plans?

1004
00:59:38,359 --> 00:59:40,818
What are your future plans?

1005
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:44,809
I hope I can travel...

1006
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:46,000
- All over the world.
- Wow!

1007
00:59:46,232 --> 00:59:47,446
I like that.

1008
00:59:47,486 --> 00:59:48,640
I really like that.

1009
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:52,571
I want to go to

1010
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,934
all famous and beautiful museums

1011
00:59:54,959 --> 00:59:56,334
all around the world.

1012
00:59:56,389 --> 00:59:57,530
Particularly...

1013
00:59:57,555 --> 00:59:58,430
Louvre.

1014
01:00:01,225 --> 01:00:03,225
Also the British Museum.

1015
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,834
There. British Museum...

1016
01:00:05,554 --> 01:00:09,569
Van Gogh in Amsterdam.

1017
01:00:09,594 --> 01:00:10,680
Then...

1018
01:00:11,038 --> 01:00:12,247
All those...

1019
01:02:23,235 --> 01:02:24,834
Excuse me.

1020
01:02:30,656 --> 01:02:32,740
- Hey, Geoff.
- Hello.

1021
01:02:32,802 --> 01:02:34,343
I came from Haven.

1022
01:02:34,725 --> 01:02:36,475
I just checked the inventory.

1023
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,584
Where are you?

1024
01:02:39,334 --> 01:02:40,459
At the office.

1025
01:02:40,834 --> 01:02:41,834
Really?

1026
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,834
You’re not getting
laid in the car?

1027
01:02:43,959 --> 01:02:44,709
Wow.

1028
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:45,959
I can’t really talk right now.

1029
01:02:45,984 --> 01:02:47,234
Later. Bye.

1030
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:51,750
Fucking asshole.

1031
01:02:57,834 --> 01:02:59,084
Sorry.

1032
01:02:59,349 --> 01:03:01,224
What was I saying
a while ago?

1033
01:03:03,163 --> 01:03:06,038
Whatever it is
you’re doing to Rene,

1034
01:03:07,036 --> 01:03:09,286
darling, just keep on doing it.

1035
01:03:09,593 --> 01:03:10,968
How about the payment?

1036
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,486
- Just finish the job...
- How will you pay me?

1037
01:03:14,511 --> 01:03:15,853
Just finish the job.

1038
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,640
I want Rene out
of Camille’s life.

1039
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:20,705
Like...

1040
01:03:21,154 --> 01:03:23,029
Gone. Vanished.

1041
01:03:23,244 --> 01:03:24,625
Rene’s done.

1042
01:03:26,123 --> 01:03:27,248
He’s not stupid.

1043
01:03:27,273 --> 01:03:29,189
Look, if Rene’s ‘done’,

1044
01:03:29,398 --> 01:03:33,394
then why don’t I see
him doing anything about it?

1045
01:03:33,419 --> 01:03:35,044
- That’s not my problem anymore.
- Thea...

1046
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,077
Not your problem? Thea...

1047
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,320
I’m paying you a lot.

1048
01:03:40,209 --> 01:03:41,584
Please. Just...

1049
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,359
Just do something about it.

1050
01:03:44,572 --> 01:03:45,709
Please?

1051
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:48,607
Come on.

1052
01:03:48,934 --> 01:03:51,934
See? The money
is there. Relax.

1053
01:03:51,959 --> 01:03:53,775
- But, this is just half.
- Yes. it’s half.

1054
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,459
Yes. Just half for now.

1055
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:01,209
Are you going to pay,
or nothing will happen?

1056
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:03,334
You’ll get the money.

1057
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,080
Just finish the job.

1058
01:04:05,797 --> 01:04:07,416
Come on, please?

1059
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,906
Yes, so this will all
be over.

1060
01:04:13,334 --> 01:04:14,459
Mr. Avila!

1061
01:04:14,709 --> 01:04:16,125
I wasn’t expecting you.

1062
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:18,627
But, thank you
for dropping by.

1063
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:27,625
This is not a social call.

1064
01:04:28,709 --> 01:04:30,584
Is there a problem, sir?

1065
01:04:32,584 --> 01:04:34,584
Take a look at those pictures.

1066
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:37,834
Beautiful pegs for
your house Mr. Avila.

1067
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:40,734
Except, that’s not my house.

1068
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:43,349
That is my friend’s house.

1069
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,560
The one who
recommended you to me.

1070
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:51,584
And looks almost...
exactly the same design!

1071
01:04:51,609 --> 01:04:55,525
You, you and your friend
have the same perfect taste, Mr. Avila.

1072
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,781
Not really. No!

1073
01:04:58,701 --> 01:04:59,701
But...

1074
01:05:01,169 --> 01:05:03,794
we do have
the same designer.

1075
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:06,056
You.

1076
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:09,458
Those things happen sometimes.

1077
01:05:09,483 --> 01:05:12,361
Some clients just
choose the same...

1078
01:05:12,386 --> 01:05:14,533
We have the same favorite...

1079
01:05:14,558 --> 01:05:18,447
We bought everything
from the same company....

1080
01:05:18,472 --> 01:05:20,306
you recommended!

1081
01:05:20,576 --> 01:05:21,576
Haven?

1082
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:26,391
And do you know
who owns Haven?

1083
01:05:27,084 --> 01:05:28,625
You!

1084
01:05:29,798 --> 01:05:31,070
But, sir...

1085
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:32,345
Don’t worry.

1086
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:34,771
I don’t want a scandal.

1087
01:05:35,959 --> 01:05:38,125
And I don’t want to look stupid

1088
01:05:38,186 --> 01:05:40,270
in front of everyone

1089
01:05:40,295 --> 01:05:43,150
especially my wife!

1090
01:05:44,258 --> 01:05:46,809
Well, she likes everything

1091
01:05:46,834 --> 01:05:49,625
so I’m not gonna return
any of it back to you.

1092
01:05:51,658 --> 01:05:52,809
What do you...

1093
01:05:52,834 --> 01:05:55,334
I will not pay
you back the balance!

1094
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:56,568
But, sir...

1095
01:05:56,593 --> 01:05:58,093
Shut up.

1096
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:04,538
And that huge downpayment
I gave to your husband, Rene?

1097
01:06:04,563 --> 01:06:07,834
I want it back
within forty eight hours!

1098
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:09,972
But, we have
an agreement Mr. Avila...

1099
01:06:09,997 --> 01:06:12,997
- I...
- Don’t even go there young lady.

1100
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:17,958
My lawyers would
get in touch with you.

1101
01:06:25,236 --> 01:06:26,584
Fuck!

1102
01:06:27,709 --> 01:06:29,517
Ah, shit!

1103
01:06:30,555 --> 01:06:32,059
I’m excited.

1104
01:06:32,084 --> 01:06:34,459
Oops. You can’t
look at it yet.

1105
01:06:34,484 --> 01:06:35,525
Are you done?

1106
01:06:36,853 --> 01:06:38,084
Not yet.

1107
01:06:49,364 --> 01:06:50,405
- Rene?
- What?

1108
01:06:57,584 --> 01:06:58,750
Thea...

1109
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:04,474
If you’re worried about
what happened to us....

1110
01:07:05,304 --> 01:07:07,103
I have no regrets at all.

1111
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,607
I know I’m married.

1112
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,064
But...

1113
01:07:12,089 --> 01:07:15,658
you know that
there’s nothing in there.

1114
01:07:21,377 --> 01:07:22,375
That’s...

1115
01:07:23,326 --> 01:07:24,992
It’s not that.

1116
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,093
I wanted to...

1117
01:07:42,646 --> 01:07:43,771
I love you.

1118
01:07:48,257 --> 01:07:49,341
Sorry

1119
01:07:49,627 --> 01:07:54,000
if it’s too fast.

1120
01:07:54,025 --> 01:07:55,234
I’m sorry...

1121
01:08:14,302 --> 01:08:16,677
Hey, you’re late!
Where’ve you been?

1122
01:08:16,702 --> 01:08:17,827
What’s going on?

1123
01:08:20,599 --> 01:08:22,099
I came from a client.

1124
01:08:22,906 --> 01:08:24,115
Who is she?

1125
01:08:24,717 --> 01:08:26,967
What made you think it’s a woman?

1126
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,562
It’s always a woman, Geoff.

1127
01:08:32,161 --> 01:08:33,952
So fucking what, Camille?

1128
01:08:34,294 --> 01:08:35,794
We need clients.

1129
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,020
We are running out

1130
01:08:38,045 --> 01:08:42,150
of clients that can afford
your overpriced stuff in Haven.

1131
01:08:42,232 --> 01:08:44,232
You’re not being serious, right?

1132
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:47,991
The millions that you pay
to your husband? Stop that.

1133
01:08:48,016 --> 01:08:51,127
Rene won’t move his money.

1134
01:08:52,209 --> 01:08:54,084
It’s in our joint account.

1135
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,125
Plus, he lives like a monk.

1136
01:08:57,795 --> 01:09:00,211
So technically, you have the money.

1137
01:09:03,459 --> 01:09:05,834
Speaking of art,
how’s your girlfriend?

1138
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:07,859
What girlfriend?
What are you talking about?

1139
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,250
The art major?

1140
01:09:10,963 --> 01:09:12,084
God.

1141
01:09:17,459 --> 01:09:18,584
You’re jealous.

1142
01:09:18,802 --> 01:09:19,927
I should be!

1143
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:21,695
She’s got your attention,

1144
01:09:21,786 --> 01:09:23,661
and now Rene has a new muse.

1145
01:09:24,002 --> 01:09:27,125
I’m losing him
and she’s got you too!

1146
01:09:27,502 --> 01:09:29,334
You’re obsessed with Thea.

1147
01:09:29,506 --> 01:09:30,934
You’re just like your husband.

1148
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:33,209
The three of us
are obsessed with her.

1149
01:09:33,664 --> 01:09:36,373
Camille, she’s not my girlfriend.

1150
01:09:42,334 --> 01:09:44,334
You know that
I love you, right?

1151
01:09:44,896 --> 01:09:47,896
And now we are
going to talk about ‘love?’

1152
01:09:50,459 --> 01:09:52,404
Will you marry me
right now if I asked you?

1153
01:09:52,428 --> 01:09:53,600
Yes, I will.

1154
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:56,559
- You’re joking, right?
- No, I’m not. I’m serious. I will.

1155
01:09:56,584 --> 01:09:57,875
You’re crazy!

1156
01:09:57,911 --> 01:10:00,536
I’m not leaving Rene
for anyone.

1157
01:10:01,484 --> 01:10:03,068
Not even for you.

1158
01:10:04,271 --> 01:10:05,771
What happened to us?

1159
01:10:07,468 --> 01:10:08,782
We were in love.

1160
01:10:09,088 --> 01:10:12,375
Then all of a sudden you fucking
married a guy twice your fucking age!

1161
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,642
Why are we talking about love?

1162
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:19,838
We’re not in high school,
or college anymore, Geoff!

1163
01:10:19,863 --> 01:10:21,125
Enough!

1164
01:10:39,959 --> 01:10:41,934
No model today?

1165
01:10:41,959 --> 01:10:43,959
No more. I’m finished.

1166
01:10:43,984 --> 01:10:45,184
Great!

1167
01:10:45,209 --> 01:10:47,084
Go back to work.

1168
01:10:47,922 --> 01:10:50,506
Time to make
some real money?

1169
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,584
I’ve been telling you...

1170
01:10:56,609 --> 01:10:58,275
those steps are not even.

1171
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,091
Don’t insult my design!

1172
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:16,334
Where do you live?

1173
01:11:17,474 --> 01:11:18,750
Where?

1174
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,484
Where is this?

1175
01:11:22,459 --> 01:11:24,459
I’ve seen this place before.

1176
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:33,875
Found you.

1177
01:11:38,248 --> 01:11:39,664
I want out.

1178
01:11:39,998 --> 01:11:42,857
I can’t go on with
everything you asked me to do.

1179
01:11:51,059 --> 01:11:52,309
I know that this would happen.

1180
01:11:52,334 --> 01:11:53,334
Well...

1181
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:54,818
Eventually.

1182
01:11:57,615 --> 01:11:59,615
You’re in love with Rene.

1183
01:12:00,217 --> 01:12:01,383
Yes, I am.

1184
01:12:07,834 --> 01:12:08,875
I know

1185
01:12:10,334 --> 01:12:11,500
he loves you.

1186
01:12:14,023 --> 01:12:15,607
It’s obvious.

1187
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:21,670
I don’t want this
anymore, Geoff.

1188
01:12:23,263 --> 01:12:26,388
Just pay me
so we’re good.

1189
01:12:32,709 --> 01:12:34,500
Two hundred thousand?

1190
01:13:35,521 --> 01:13:36,756
Thea!

1191
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,732
- Camille.
- Geoff gave me your address.

1192
01:13:39,757 --> 01:13:42,173
I’m interested to see your art.

1193
01:13:43,404 --> 01:13:45,334
Come on! Show me.

1194
01:13:46,779 --> 01:13:48,625
They’re not really good.

1195
01:13:54,107 --> 01:13:55,857
Don’t you want to answer that?

1196
01:13:56,904 --> 01:13:58,209
Is that, Geoff?

1197
01:14:03,334 --> 01:14:07,380
Geoff didn’t mention
anything to me.

1198
01:14:08,513 --> 01:14:11,396
My place is...

1199
01:14:11,974 --> 01:14:14,225
Geoff didn’t tell you?

1200
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,875
God, he’s such an idiot.

1201
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:19,544
We’re designing a new building.

1202
01:14:19,569 --> 01:14:22,194
The client wants
something new.

1203
01:14:22,654 --> 01:14:24,250
Geoff told me

1204
01:14:24,396 --> 01:14:27,646
you have paintings
in your studio.

1205
01:14:27,974 --> 01:14:29,959
He’s seen it.

1206
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:30,875
Answer. Please.

1207
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:44,036
Fuck you, Rene!

1208
01:16:19,521 --> 01:16:21,834
Answer please, Thea.

1209
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:47,084
Thea, please answer me.

1210
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:28,607
How about making
a painting of your own wife?

1211
01:17:33,334 --> 01:17:34,750
You can call it

1212
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,900
“Naked female with a cigarette.”

1213
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:42,250
After everything
I’ve done for you?!

1214
01:17:42,437 --> 01:17:44,396
The money that
I made for you?!

1215
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:47,875
You fall for a girl
half your age.

1216
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:49,997
I earned that money too.

1217
01:17:51,076 --> 01:17:52,326
I’m leaving.

1218
01:17:52,937 --> 01:17:54,896
I want to start all over again

1219
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:56,934
and be a real painter.

1220
01:17:56,959 --> 01:17:58,834
Maybe it’s not too late.

1221
01:18:01,709 --> 01:18:03,250
You’re really stupid!

1222
01:18:03,275 --> 01:18:04,525
You are stupid!

1223
01:18:06,966 --> 01:18:09,271
You have an affair with Geoff.

1224
01:18:09,296 --> 01:18:12,296
I would have understood it
if you were both in love.

1225
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:13,946
But, there’s nothing real there.

1226
01:18:14,146 --> 01:18:15,934
Even you, Camille.
You’re not real!

1227
01:18:15,959 --> 01:18:17,584
You’re a fucking fool!

1228
01:18:21,209 --> 01:18:23,459
I withdrew my share
from our joint account.

1229
01:18:23,484 --> 01:18:24,734
Fifty fifty.

1230
01:18:25,849 --> 01:18:27,442
I’m leaving.

1231
01:18:29,553 --> 01:18:32,053
Going to Europe, maybe?

1232
01:18:38,138 --> 01:18:39,709
What have you done?!

1233
01:18:39,734 --> 01:18:41,434
You can’t leave me.

1234
01:18:41,459 --> 01:18:43,875
You are gonna die
just like your dead Thea!

1235
01:18:44,584 --> 01:18:46,209
What have you
done to Thea?!

1236
01:19:37,959 --> 01:19:39,834
Thea?!

1237
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,084
Thea!

1238
01:19:42,709 --> 01:19:43,500
Thea!

1239
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:48,834
What happened?

1240
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,834
Are you alright?

1241
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,625
Camille was here.

1242
01:20:01,084 --> 01:20:02,084
You okay?

1243
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:17,500
Can I have this?

1244
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,834
This is very expensive.

1245
01:20:35,959 --> 01:20:38,709
We'll never meet
if not because of you.

1246
01:20:40,209 --> 01:20:41,709
He was happy

1247
01:20:41,959 --> 01:20:43,584
when he learned

1248
01:20:43,834 --> 01:20:45,709
that you paid me.

1249
01:20:45,734 --> 01:20:46,875
That’s nothing.

1250
01:20:48,084 --> 01:20:49,500
It’s nothing.

1251
01:20:58,959 --> 01:21:00,584
Where’d you get this?

1252
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,334
You left it
in the coffee shop.

1253
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,375
Time to quit, Geoff.

1254
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:23,500
It’s obviously
not good for me. Yeah?

1255
01:21:24,125 --> 01:21:25,959
I just don’t know
how to quit.

1256
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,709
Sorry about Camille.

1257
01:21:41,584 --> 01:21:43,209
Quit now, Geoff.

1258
01:21:45,709 --> 01:21:46,834
Starting now?

1259
01:21:48,584 --> 01:21:49,500
Can I?

1260
01:21:50,834 --> 01:21:51,959
Right now.

1261
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:36,334
Any news?

1262
01:22:38,209 --> 01:22:40,709
That was the police investigator.

1263
01:22:40,827 --> 01:22:42,302
What did they say?

1264
01:22:42,327 --> 01:22:43,786
They’ve ruled it out...

1265
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:48,584
that the fire
was an accident.

1266
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:50,221
Let’s go.
