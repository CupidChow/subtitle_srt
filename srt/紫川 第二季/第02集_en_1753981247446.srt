00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,640
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,440

I'm sorry.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,440
I'm sorry.

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
I'm sorry.

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,440
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,440
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,440
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,440
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
I'm sorry.

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,440
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440

00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,440
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,440
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
I'm sorry.

61
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
I'm sorry.

64
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
I'm sorry.

65
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
I'm sorry.

66
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
I'm sorry.

67
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
I'm sorry.

68
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
I'm sorry.

69
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
I'm sorry.

70
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm sorry.

71
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
I'm sorry.

72
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
I'm sorry.

73
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
I'm sorry.

74
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
I'm sorry.

75
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
I'm sorry.

76
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
I'm sorry.

77
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
I'm sorry.

78
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
I'm sorry.

79
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
I'm sorry.

80
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
I'm sorry.

81
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,440
I'm sorry.

82
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm sorry.

83
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm sorry.

84
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
I'm sorry.

85
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
I'm sorry.

86
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
I'm sorry.

87
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
I'm sorry.

88
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
I'm sorry.

89
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm sorry.

90
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
I'm sorry.

91
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
I'm sorry.

92
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
I'm sorry.

93
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
I'm sorry.

94
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
I'm sorry.

95
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
I'm sorry.

96
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
I'm sorry.

97
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
I'm sorry.

98
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
I'm sorry.

99
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
I'm sorry.

100
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
I'm sorry.

101
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
I'm sorry.

102
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
I'm sorry.

103
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
I'm sorry.

104
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
I'm sorry.

105
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
I'm sorry.

106
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
I'm sorry.

107
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
I'm sorry.

108
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
I'm sorry.

109
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
I'm sorry.

110
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm sorry.

111
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
I'm sorry.

112
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
I'm sorry.

113
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
I'm sorry.

114
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
I'm sorry.

115
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
I'm sorry.

116
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
I'm sorry.

117
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
I'm sorry.

118
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Episode 2

119
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
I'm Zichuan Xiu.

120
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,440
I'm now fighting with a group of newbies.

121
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Compared to our current strength,

122
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,440
even if we meet a demon security team,

123
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
we have to be ready.

124
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,440
Luckily, my master left me a lot of martial arts secrets.

125
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
Like Golden Fist,

126
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Little Cuihua,

127
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Wait a minute.

128
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
Why is there a soul-stirring mirror?

129
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Ha ha ha ha.

130
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
You have to train these newbies.

131
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
How can you not win the world?

132
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
What?

133
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,440
Luo Jie said that a group of demons came to the village.

134
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
What are you waiting for?

135
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,440
It's just right for those bastards to come.

136
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Go.

137
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Sir, have you rested?

138
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Come in.

139
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,440
Didn't you just come to kick your legs?

140
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
Luo Jie,

141
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,440
isn't it too much?

142
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
I'm fast.

143
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
I'm light.

144
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
Ha ha ha.

145
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
No, no, no.

146
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,440
The more you tie, the faster you will be.

147
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Besides,

148
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
this bandage is going to expire if you don't use it.

149
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Luo Jie,

150
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
you tied the person like this.

151
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
How can he do the work?

152
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
Ha ha ha.

153
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
Little Chuan Chuan,

154
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,440
I need to recuperate.

155
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Let's talk about it later.

156
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Sir, go back.

157
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Sir,

158
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,440
the people in the camp have been settled.

159
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
651 people in the Sleeve Camp.

160
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
No injured or seriously ill people.

161
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Sir,

162
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
of course it's an exception.

163
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,440
The morale and strength in the camp are very problematic.

164
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,440
The Sleeve Camp has not had proper training since its establishment.

165
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,440
If we encounter demons,

166
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
even a brigade can help us.

167
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Brigade?

168
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
What are you thinking?

169
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
A group of demons,

170
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
we have to run around.

171
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
I'll think about it tomorrow.

172
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
No, no, no.

173
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Right now.

174
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Ha ha ha.

175
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
For you guys,

176
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,440
I almost died.

177
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Sir,

178
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
Old Man.

179
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Old Man.

180
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Do I look like you?

181
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
My face looks like a frog.

182
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
I'm in a bad mood.

183
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
It will affect my creation.

184
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,440
I wonder where your old man is going again.

185
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Fortunately, the thing is still here.

186
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Thank you,

187
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
old man.

188
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Who?

189
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Oh my god.

190
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Hmm.

191
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Huh?

192
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Wang Quan Sheng jumped off.

193
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Don't eat things.

194
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
He's so good.

195
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
The Sleeve Camp is going to be a mess.

196
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,440
I'm going to be the best in the world.

197
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Ming Yu.

198
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Sir Ming Yu.

199
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
The demon is trying to capture the land.

200
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,440
The demon is trying to capture the land.

201
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Back off.

202
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
The land is about to collapse.

203
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Back off.

204
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,440
The demon is trying to capture the land.

205
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Report.

206
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Morning, Sir Ming Yu.

207
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Morning.

208
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
I must be dreaming.

209
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Who?

210
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Who is it?

211
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
I've made it clear.

212
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
I can directly reach the heart of the heart.

213
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Thank you.

214
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Thank you.

215
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Sir Ming Yu.

216
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,440
I think you're a good dancer.

217
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
Do you want to join us?

218
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Sir, you're a five-year-old child.

219
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Sir Bo Jie, aren't you going to play boxing?

220
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Come on.

221
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
One, two, three.

222
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Cut the sword.

223
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Go.

224
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Sir, I've got all the weapons.

225
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Go, Sir.

226
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Sir, I took the sword.

227
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
I took the sword.

228
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Stop fighting.

229
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
I've got all the weapons.

230
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
I've got all the weapons.

231
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Go.

232
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Hurry up.

233
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Hurry up.

234
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Hurry up.

235
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Hurry up.

236
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
What's wrong?

237
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Which village is it?

238
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
It's the village of Bo Luo.

239
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Get some money.

240
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
After we take this village,

241
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
our mission will be completed.

242
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Yes.

243
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Go.

244
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
I...

245
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Gu Mei Xiu,

246
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
this is the new weapon.

247
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Sir,

248
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
something bad happened.

249
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
What happened?

250
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
The demon group's food and clothing team is here.

251
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
They're almost at the mountain.

252
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Didn't we teach them?

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Food and clothing team?

254
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
How many people are there?

255
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
About 200.

256
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Should we kill them?

257
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
We can't report it now.

258
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Inform the people of the Embroidered Camp

259
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
to retreat immediately.

260
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Yes.

261
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
I'll send some people to deliver the food.

262
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
We'll send them secretly.

263
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
If it's not enough,

264
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
we can count the seed.

265
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
I'll inform the villagers first.

266
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Deng Lun,

267
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
don't fight with them.

268
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Okay.

269
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Where did these food and clothing teams come from?

270
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
They're pulling the food and looking at the direction.

271
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
They should have just come from the village of Lei Nuo.

272
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Go and check it.

273
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
Is Luo Jie in the camp?

274
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
Did he bring them back?

275
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
It should be soon.

276
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
What's wrong?

277
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Nothing.

278
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Maybe I'm overthinking.

279
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
It's not easy for the soldiers of the Eastern Region.

280
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
They need to work harder.

281
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
It's what we should do.

282
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Let's start.

283
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Go.

284
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Why is there food?

285
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
It's cold.

286
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Sir,

287
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
the food and clothing in our village is running out.

288
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Why does it look like it's not over?

289
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,440
There have been six carts in our village.

290
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
This time, there are ten carts.

291
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Sir,

292
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
we really have no food.

293
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Let's go.

294
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Do we have food now?

295
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Sir,

296
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
are you okay?

297
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
I'm fine.

298
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
Sir!

299
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
Sir,

300
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
those green-skinned guys are so bad.

301
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Something happened in the village of Lei Nuo.

302
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
When we got there,

303
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,440
the village of Lei Nuo was burned to the ground.

304
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Half of the people who burned the glue were buried in the tree at the entrance of the village.

305
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,440
It doesn't matter how much water you drink.

306
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,440
It's enough if you come out from the house at half past one.

307
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Sir,

308
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,440
this is really all the food in the village.

309
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,440
We even stole the seed food.

310
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
There's really no more.

311
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
That's not our fault.

312
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
Come here.

313
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Come here.

314
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
What are you doing?

315
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Let him go.

316
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Sir.

317
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Sir.

318
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Sir,

319
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
give us a few days.

320
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,440
We'll figure out a way to get it.

321
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,440
I can't give you a job today.

322
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
You're really human beings.

323
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Let go.

324
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
You guys.

325
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,440
You're all trying to kill me.

326
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
They're all dead.

327
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
How can you fight?

328
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Kill me.

329
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Bastard.

330
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
You're so strong.

331
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
Compared to the village of Lei Nuo,

332
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
you guys are more responsive.

333
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
If that's the case,

334
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
then it's no fun.

335
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
God of War,

336
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,440
look at your death.

337
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Okay.

338
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
Di Xi.

339
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
I won't let you live.

340
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Go.

341
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
De Lun.

342
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Sorry, I'm late.

343
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
Guang Ming Xiu.

344
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
The area is 300 miles away.

345
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Except for the village of Bulu,

346
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,440
there's a lot of soil and sweat.

347
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Xia Ruo and the village of Lei Nuo are all dead.

348
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
They're all dead.

349
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
They're all dead.

350
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
They're all dead.

351
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
They're all dead.

352
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
They're all dead.

353
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
They're all dead.

354
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Xia Ruo is like the village of Lei Nuo.

355
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,440
These green-skinned guys are worse than pigs.

356
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
The tax paid by the demons is already very high.

357
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
The land of the head of the Yuan Dong,

358
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Zhong Bao Si,

359
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
has been increased several times.

360
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
As a result, the people below have a blood sample.

361
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
In the end,

362
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
it turned into a village of soil and feed.

363
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,440
What do these demons think Yuan Dong people are?

364
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Don't they know that they're killing the land and raising the eggs?

365
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,440
The demons didn't plan to take Yuan Dong as their land.

366
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
When they kill Yuan Dong,

367
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
they'll go back.

368
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
Brothers,

369
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
between the demons and the family,

370
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
a big battle is inevitable.

371
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
But we're here,

372
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
and the people of the whole Yuan Dong.

373
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,440
We have nothing.

374
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Isn't this chaos

375
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
our great opportunity?

376
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
The first head of the family, Si Chuan Yun,

377
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,440
can rise from the ruins of the light empire.

378
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Who can predict that

379
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
there will be no high-ranking generals

380
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
among you?

381
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
Yes, sir!

382
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,440
If we can get Yuan Dong with Ban Shou Ren,

383
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,440
then we can prove it with our strength.

384
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
We're not traitors,

385
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
but the workers of the family!

386
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
We're not traitors!

387
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
We're not traitors!

388
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
We don't want to be the tyrants of the family!

389
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Don't kill Yuan Dong!

390
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Don't humiliate the people of the family!

391
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Don't humiliate the people of the family!

392
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
We're not traitors!

393
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
Ming Yu,

394
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
don't you think

395
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
this idea is a bit unrealistic?

396
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
It's a bit unrealistic.

397
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
Just because of our strength now,

398
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
it's a bit...

399
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,440
Of course we can't rely on each other.

400
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
We have to let the whole Yuan Dong

401
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
stand with us.

402
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,440
But...

403
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Will they?

404
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
I've already discussed with Delun.

405
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
He told me

406
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
as long as we can convince one person,

407
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,440
with his support,

408
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Yuan Dong will respond to it.

409
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Who?

410
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
The result of the Holy Temple of Yuan Dong

411
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
is not simple.

412
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
I'm sorry.

413
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
I'm sorry.

414
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
I'm sorry.

415
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
I'm sorry.

416
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,440
I'm sorry.

417
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
I'm sorry.

418
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm sorry.

419
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
I'm sorry.

420
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,440
I'm sorry.

421
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,440
I'm sorry.

422
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,440
I'm sorry.

423
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm sorry.

424
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,440
I'm sorry.

425
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,440
I'm sorry.

426
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
I'm sorry.

427
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,440
I'm sorry.

428
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
I'm sorry.

429
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
I'm sorry.

430
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,440
I'm sorry.

431
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,440
I'm sorry.

432
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
I'm sorry.

433
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm sorry.

434
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,440
I'm sorry.

435
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
I'm sorry.

436
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
I'm sorry.

437
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,440
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
I'm sorry.

439
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
I'm sorry.

440
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
I'm sorry.

441
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
I'm sorry.

442
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
I'm sorry.

443
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,440
I'm sorry.

444
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
I'm sorry.

445
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
I'm sorry.

446
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
I'm sorry.
