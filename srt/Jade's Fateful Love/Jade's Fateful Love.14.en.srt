Vice-general Wang.

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,200
Your Highness.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,150
How's Li's injury? Take him to me.

40
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,580
Yes, Your Highness.

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,430
I'm really not a scout.

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,670
You get me wrong.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,760
What are you doing here?

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,990
You didn't lose the trail.

45
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,620
I was about to ask you.

46
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,020
What are you doing here?

47
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,300
Aren't you supposed to see a Miss Lee?

48
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,500
Lee?

49
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,620
Is that supposed to be me?

50
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,540
I'm Wang Xiaoli. L-I, Li.

51
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,580
So, this is the one

52
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,100
you came to see?

53
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,380
Who else do you think it should be?

54
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,020
Come on. This is my consort.

55
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,020
All hail Your Highness.

56
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,580
Get up.

57
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,380
How's your injury?

58
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,100
Thanks for caring.

59
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,140
I've recovered a lot.

60
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,340
Rest more for recuperation lately.

61
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,380
Injured for the test of new weapons,

62
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,460
you have bravery.

63
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,220
You're meritorious.

64
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,820
Your Highness, this minor injury is nothing.

65
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,620
But the new weapons can't be slighted.

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,100
If you hadn't tested them,

67
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,860
the tenacity problem of the last batch

68
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,020
wouldn't have been revealed.

69
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,980
I'll count on you for more checks.

70
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,900
I get it. I won't fail my duty.

71
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,300
What? You think

72
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,580
I was out there dating someone?

73
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,540
Who knows?

74
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,580
Since you walked in on us,

75
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,460
I won't hide anything.

76
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,420
Yueling,

77
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,780
do you want to know what I'm doing?

78
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,980
Do you remember the nursery rhyme?

79
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,860
The Beishou court had too many coups.

80
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,180
Weak emperor, powerful ministers,
and numerous lords.

81
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,740
The Prime Minister takes charge of everything.

82
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,620
The two princes can do nothing.

83
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,900
One is an idiot and the other is a coward.

84
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,380
This rhyme

85
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,900
describes the court of Beishuo.

86
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,260
My brother has been physically weak.

87
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,380
All these years, Uncle has been

88
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,660
in charge of the court.

89
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,980
His power has seeped into everywhere.

90
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,380
And almost all the foreign wars

91
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,460
were started by him.

92
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,500
Since you and I met,

93
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,140
he's been sending assassins

94
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,380
to break the marriage between the two states

95
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,740
and put the world in chaos.

96
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,500
Only in this way can he have command

97
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,740
over military and politics.

98
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,340
You pretended to be a useless prince

99
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,660
just to take cover, huh?

100
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,620
So, you're accumulating power
to fight against him, huh?

101
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,420
Right.

102
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,740
His Majesty and I have a long-set plan.

103
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,660
Marrying you is also part of it.

104
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,140
So, I've always wanted to apologize.

105
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,900
Sorry to get you involved.

106
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,940
Don't say that.

107
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,700
I didn't know

108
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,860
you were so foresighted.

109
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,500
But to get the two states in peace

110
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,940
without wars,

111
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,300
everything will be worth it.

112
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,340
Shiyu, I'll always support you

113
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,420
and do it with you.

114
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,300
Aren't you scared?

115
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,860
It will be rather dangerous.

116
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,580
You experienced the danger all this time.

117
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,060
To be honest,

118
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,420
I am scared.

119
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
But I know

120
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,020
you're doing the right thing

121
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,820
and it's what I've been expecting.

122
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,740
So, I also want to do something.

123
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,980
Don't forget.

124
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,300
When we're together, miracles will happen.

125
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,780
You can't do without me.

126
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,580
And of course,

127
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,860
I can't do with you, either.

128
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,220
The chosen ones meet.

129
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,580
Fate refreshes everything.

130
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,860
It won't be over

131
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,060
until the couple know and love.

132
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,340
All right.

133
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,420
Let's do it together.

134
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,780
This is so annoying.

135
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,660
Why didn't she tell me she loved me?

136
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,340
The kiss was rash, wasn't it?

137
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,980
If it continues like this,

138
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,700
will I

139
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,620
disgrace Dongyu men?

140
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,460
How can I break the awkwardness?

141
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,260
Su Nian,

142
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,820
Mr. Xingyi has been
peeping out there for a long time.

143
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,780
Don't tease him anymore.

144
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,940
He can't take a joke.

145
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,620
Fine, then.

146
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,260
I don't think

147
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,660
he'll bother us recently.

148
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,540
Su Nian, he has come in.

149
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,020
Lingxi,

150
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,100
may I have a talk with Miss Su Nian?

151
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,180
What's up, Xingyi?

152
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,340
Miss Su Nian, do you like me?

153
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,580
What... What are you laughing at?

154
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
A Dongyu man like me

155
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,820
is always so honest and brave.

156
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,180
If you like me, tell me about it.

157
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,100
We should

158
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,740
talk before acting.

159
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,380
What do you mean

160
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,460
by "talk before acting"?

161
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,860
Do you like me?

162
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,900
Yes.

163
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,260
This is "talk".

164
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,340
And then?

165
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,860
I have no feelings for you.

166
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,300
Is she

167
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,540
playing hard to get?

168
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,700
There's flour on your face.

169
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,780
Oh, my tea cake.

170
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,300
It's not for you.

171
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,660
Not for me?

172
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,180
Today,

173
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,020
I'll count on the cake.

174
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,620
Thank you for coming, Your Highness.

175
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,060
(Treasure Pawnshop)
It's an honor to have you here.

176
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,260
(Righteousness Comes Before Gold)

177
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,700
Today, I'm here to thank you.

178
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,220
Thank me?

179
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,100
For what?

180
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,140
You really flatter me.

181
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,380
I should thank you.

182
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,140
You'll donate 500 taels of silver
for victims in Liuzhou.

183
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,660
This is a huge merit.

184
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,740
But...

185
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,340
But...

186
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,580
We were supposed to watch Miss Su Nian dance.

187
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,700
But...

188
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,860
We not only missed the dance

189
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,380
but were also scared by some assassins.

190
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,260
When I was back home, I felt unwell.

191
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,140
I'm too weak to hold here.

192
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,740
I guess I can't talk anymore.

193
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,700
Another day. I'll visit you
and apologize another day.

(Treasure Pawnshop)

195
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,220
Well, Your Highnesses, please have some tea.

196
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,680
I'll go get the money.

(Treasure Pawnshop)

198
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,900
I didn't watch the dance

199
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,380
and even lost some money.

(Rainbow Clothing Store)

201
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,220
Let's go.

202
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,940
It's worth a hundred taels.

(Silver Note of Beishuo Bank)

206
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,700
Is it heavy? Let me carry it for you.

207
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,180
It's not heavy.

208
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,500
It's not money,
but a great sense of achievement.

209
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,900
You don't understand.

210
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,460
Fine.

211
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,740
We've got plenty today.

212
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,540
So much money.

213
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,020
There's no shortage of money
for the reconstruction of Liuzhou.

214
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,140
After all, early this morning,

215
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,860
I made so much tea cake.

216
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,340
Hope they'll enjoy it.

217
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,140
So much tea cake was handed over.

218
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,620
I don't even know how it tastes.

219
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,580
Do you want some?

220
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,900
How much will you donate, then?

221
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,220
Thanks.

222
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,860
Thanks.

223
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,280
Thanks.

224
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,940
Thanks to your tea cake, Yueling,

225
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,140
we've raised a lot of money for people here

226
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,740
so that they get through this difficult time.

227
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,660
It has nothing to do with my tea cake.

228
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,900
It's because of everyone's concerted efforts.

229
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,220
Thank you.

230
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,820
Everything is fixed here.

231
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,730
We can return to the Capital City soon, huh?

232
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,620
Yes.

233
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,620
I've asked Nie Chen to get prepared.

234
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,900
In three days, we're going back.

235
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,080
Thank you.

236
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,860
Why... Why did he collapse?

237
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,740
What's wrong with him?

238
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,060
Make way.

239
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,100
My Lord, does he have an epidemic?

240
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,340
With rash all over and weak limbs,
he's foaming at the mouth.

241
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,340
Such are signs of an epidemic.

242
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,380
Send him to the clinic.

243
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,220
Yes.

244
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,100
For no reason,

245
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,900
why is there an epidemic here?

246
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,940
It has to be figured out soon.

247
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,620
Your Highness,

248
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,540
most people in town are infected.

249
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,740
You and Her Highness should go back now

250
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,020
in case you're infected too.

251
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,940
The civilians are badly sick.

252
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,500
At this moment, how can I

253
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,780
leave them alone?

254
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,980
Go give out my order.

255
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,540
Open my private house

256
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,900
for the treatment of sick people.

257
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,780
Get all the physicians here.

258
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,060
Have my dark guards and soldiers help them.

259
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,380
Yes, Your Highness.

260
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,620
These days, a lot of people get sick in town.

261
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,620
The physicians assume it's an epidemic.

262
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,380
Do not go out

263
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,980
unless you have to.

264
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,460
I wondered why people

265
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,060
looked sick on the street.

266
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,020
Can we do something to help them?

267
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,500
We've done everything we can.

268
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,260
I ordered the Magistrate of Liuzhou

269
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,060
to set up many temporary clinics

270
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,500
for treating patients.

271
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Physicians from Linzhou

272
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,660
are also traveling here day and night to help.

273
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,340
It's thoughtful of you, Your Highness.

274
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,700
I'm just hungry. Come on.

275
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,100
Keep our strength up before having solutions.

276
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Shiyu,

277
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,980
I have something to tell you.

278
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,340
South Prince? Why?

279
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,220
The situation is serious out there.

280
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,660
I need precautions.

281
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,060
What do you want me for, Zhixuan?

282
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,580
The guards I took to Liuzhou

283
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,660
have been infected.

284
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,780
No one can escort me back.

285
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,780
So, I want to borrow some guards from you.

286
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,500
I came in such a hurry

287
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,700
that I didn't have lunch.

288
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,220
I'm starving.

289
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,580
Tastes great.

290
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,620
You have nice pastry.

291
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,340
The tea is good, too.

292
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,500
Why do I feel itchy?

293
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,140
Xu.

294
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,900
Check on me.

295
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,540
Your Highness, you...

296
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,780
Are you infected?

297
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,980
What are you talking about?

298
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,020
I'm wrapped like this.

299
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,100
How can I get infected?

300
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,220
Rash. You're indeed infected.

301
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,100
Get out. Get out now.

302
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,420
I don't think I can return alive.

303
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,020
Xu.

304
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,940
Your Highness.

305
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,820
If I die,

306
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,340
you and Shiyu must

307
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,260
hold a decent funeral for me.

308
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,060
Your Highness.

309
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,700
Sadly, before I die,

310
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,300
I can't see Brother and Piggy.

311
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,500
And Mr. Siyuan's painting...

312
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,420
Come on.

313
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,060
You're not dying.

314
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,820
Oh, Your Highness.

315
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,340
Thank you.

316
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,860
Mother.

317
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,980
Physician.

318
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,900
Come on.

319
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,700
Be careful.

320
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
Physician, come and check.

321
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,100
Physician,

322
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,810
- check that man.
- It's worse.

323
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,500
Your Highness, local physicians
are doing their best

324
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,180
to receive all the patients.

325
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,100
This disease broke out so suddenly.

326
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,100
It has something in common with epidemics.

327
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,420
But based on my consults,

328
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,300
I'm sure this isn't an epidemic.

329
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,700
As for what it is,

330
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,500
I need more time to confirm.

331
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,460
So please,

332
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,060
figure out the cure as soon as you can.

333
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,500
If you need anything,

334
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,620
my men are at your disposal.

335
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,340
Your Highness, don't worry.

336
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,260
I will do my best.

337
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,100
Let's go.

338
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,580
Don't scratch.

339
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,740
Your Highness.

340
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,600
Shh.

341
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,820
The physicians made a dozen prescriptions.

342
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,940
None of them can help.

343
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,100
Now, the civilians are in panic,

344
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,540
trying to get away from Liuzhou.

345
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,580
Magistrate Liu ordered a lockdown.

346
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,180
Before that,

347
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,780
you'd better go back with Her Highness.

348
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,420
We'll take care of everything here.

349
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
When Yueling wakes up,

350
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,860
you send her back.

351
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,260
I will stay

352
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,020
and get through this with local people.

353
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,180
I'm not going, either.

354
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,340
Yueling.

355
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,220
You go back there for a prescription

356
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,740
and I'll stay in Liuzhou for solutions.

357
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,460
Let's try separately, shall we?

358
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,780
I'll take care of Xingyi and Su Nian.

359
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,980
You don't need to worry.

360
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,580
Send me to the safe Capital City?

361
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,180
If I have to live alone,

362
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,260
I would rather die.

363
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,100
Yueling,

364
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,860
do as you're told.

365
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,300
You're not like me.

366
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,820
The civilians in town are my responsibility.

367
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,380
I can't just leave.

368
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,860
Besides,

369
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,820
when you're here in Liuzhou,

370
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,540
you've done quite a lot for me.

371
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,380
How can I get you further involved?

372
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,020
Further involved?

373
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,020
Wherever this problem happens,

374
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,260
I will not leave there.

375
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,620
Nie Chen,

376
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,540
take her out of town.

377
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,420
Shiyu, I'm not leaving.

378
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,500
We must not separate.

379
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,580
We have the jade pendants.

380
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,660
Yueling, listen.

381
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,220
I can't let you get hurt again.

382
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,300
I beg you.

383
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,260
Let me stay.

384
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,380
Let me stay by your side.

385
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,580
All right.

386
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,300
You don't leave, then.

387
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,860
We will stay

388
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,340
and fight together.

389
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,890
♪Ceaseless, love lingers and lingers♪

390
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:34,280
♪You and I both know it♪

391
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,380
Su Nian, take the antidote.

392
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,180
You used some poison, right?

393
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,140
You thought too much.

394
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,340
So,

395
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,700
I did it for you.

396
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
How could you hurt so many innocent people?

397
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,820
This is our mission.

398
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,100
Su Nian,

399
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,340
how do you feel?

400
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,180
I'm fine.

401
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,820
Xingyi, are you all right?

402
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,060
A martial artist like me

403
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,660
is very strong.

404
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,220
Don't worry about me.

405
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,580
But you look pale.

406
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,100
How about you go back to your room and rest?

407
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,460
I'm fine. I'll stay here with you.

408
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,740
A girl like you

409
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,180
must be weak. You should be kept company.

410
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,340
Stop bothering me.

411
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,020
I need some rest.

412
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,860
Lingxi,

413
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,140
see him out.

414
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,140
Please, Mr. Xingyi.

415
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,380
(Xingyi,)

416
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,140
(only when you stay away from me)

417
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,220
(can you be safe.)

418
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,540
Carry him away.

419
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,500
Come on.

420
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,780
(Sealed by Liuzhou Prefecture)

421
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,700
- Your Highnesses.
- No need of that.

422
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,500
What have you got?

423
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,540
I've confirmed.

424
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,300
Something was done to the well in town.

425
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,700
That's why most people
get sick one after another.

426
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,060
So, it's the water.

427
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,900
Is there a cure?

428
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,740
Gather all the physicians

429
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,020
to discuss the antidote thing.

430
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
Yes, Your Highness.

431
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,740
Your Highness,

432
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,260
we summarized the treatments.

433
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,900
Many prescriptions have been used,

434
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,340
but the process still goes slowly.

435
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,100
Luckily, there's evidence

436
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,180
that this disease isn't infectious.

437
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,580
So, I guess...

438
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,860
The patients don't have an epidemic.

439
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,940
They are actually...

440
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,780
Whatever it is,

441
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,260
just tell the truth.

442
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,580
I think they're poisoned.

443
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,180
Poisoned?

444
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,020
Yes.

445
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,740
Here.

446
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,780
I don't want it, Yueling.

447
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,020
It doesn't work at all.

448
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,460
Drink it, Xingyi.

449
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,260
Drinking it can make you hold longer.

450
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,260
Physicians are trying to get an antidote.

451
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,780
This decoction is bitter and useless.

452
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,260
I want no more.

453
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,340
Now, I just want
the glutinous rice wine in our hometown.

454
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,500
Do you think I can

455
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,740
ever taste it again?

456
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,780
Yes, you can.

457
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,060
You'll live a long life.

458
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,140
You can enjoy plenty of wine.

459
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,260
Be a good boy and drink it.

460
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,850
Come on.

461
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,060
Su Nian.

462
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,420
Su Nian,

463
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,980
are you going to detoxify Xingyi?

464
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,420
You didn't use the antidote yourself.

465
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,060
But you'll give it to that Dongyu man?

466
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,380
This is the only antidote we have now.

467
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,980
I'm strong enough to hold on.

468
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,020
But Xingyi is dying.

469
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,660
But if you detoxify him now,

470
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,100
the North Prince may suspect you.

471
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,260
Have you thought of the consequences?

472
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,460
I know.

473
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,900
But I have to save him.

474
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
Su Nian.

475
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,300
If you reject the mission,

476
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,940
Master will not let you go.

477
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,740
I'll just die in the worst case.

478
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,460
Since the moment I became an assassin,

479
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,220
I've given up my life.

480
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,060
You still remember you're an assassin, huh?

481
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,020
Doesn't an assassin live to do missions?

482
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,620
But what are you doing now?

483
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,340
I always do Master's mission with my life.

484
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,460
But to hurt all the people in town

485
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,540
just to destroy one single man,

486
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,220
I can't do that.

487
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,620
Su Nian,

488
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,780
I hardly understand you now.

489
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,380
Shiyu,

490
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,100
I always think you're resourceful

491
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,380
and courageous.

492
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,580
I'll count on you

493
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,340
for my antidote.

494
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,820
When you keep pulling me like this,

495
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,380
how can I go find it for you?

496
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,940
I'll stop, then.

497
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,660
Off you go.

498
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,740
Take more men with you.

499
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,020
If you're short of men,

500
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,820
ask our brother for more.

501
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,660
This is a dire situation.

502
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,340
No one in Liuzhou is available.

503
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,340
We have to rely on ourselves.

504
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,500
If you fail to find the poisoner

505
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,700
and get the antidote,

506
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,340
I'll have to die, right?

507
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,060
Shiyu,

508
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,540
if I die,

509
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,060
do let go of what happened between us

510
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,180
and hold a grand funeral for me.

511
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,860
Don't be ridiculous.

512
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,660
Take good care of him.

513
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,300
Your Highness.

514
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,220
My youngest brother

515
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,900
still cares about me.

516
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,140
Isn't there a way

517
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,940
to save them?

518
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,300
Maybe we can have a try.

519
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,100
I agree.

520
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,500
Shiyu,

521
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,180
I think I know

522
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,980
the biggest meaning of our shared life.

523
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,220
Drinking the poisonous wine,

524
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,180
- Hope we'll help.
- we can do it again.

525
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,220
Why am I back in the palace?

526
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,020
Where's Zhou Shiyu?

527
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,540
Shiyu, you had a hard trip to Liuzhou.

528
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,020
Do you like today's banquet

529
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,220
that is held for you?

530
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,740
Brother?

531
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,540
Shiyu, why do you stare at me in surprise?

532
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,300
Do you not like this banquet?

533
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,780
Or do you think your consort is aggrieved?

534
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,460
(Banquet?)

535
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,020
(The trip to Liuzhou is over?)

536
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,500
(Am I back when the incident is over?)

537
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,380
Shiyu?

538
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,140
I appreciate it, Brother.

539
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,740
Brother,

540
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,020
how was the epidemic in Liuzhou solved?

541
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,180
You and the Princess found the Red Rhizoma

542
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,980
and helped local physicians
to make the antidote.

543
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,500
Oh, I wondered who this was.

544
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,100
Aren't you the shameless Princess of Dongyu?

545
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,580
Who do you mean shameless?

546
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,260
You!

547
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,860
Before you got married,

548
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,140
you went to Liuzhou for my cousin.

549
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,980
You even dined at his table.

550
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,620
Aren't just shameless?

551
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,740
We're back in the Capital City?

552
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,700
Don't play innocent.

553
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,860
What are you talking about?

554
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,020
I won't bother to argue.

555
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,660
Tell me. What will make you
break the engagement with my cousin?

556
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,700
His Majesty got us engaged.

557
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,020
Why would I break it?

558
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,140
Gao Luoyi, let go of me.

559
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,980
I won't.

560
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,580
Gao Luoyi, let me go!

561
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,460
I just won't!

562
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,820
- Let me go.
- Explain to me.

563
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,980
We're back here?

564
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,060
Looks like the pendants

565
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,060
took us to the future.

566
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,740
Future?

567
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,180
Did the pendants change?

568
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,340
Maybe they changed

569
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,140
for the stains of blood.

570
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,740
Yueling,

571
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,380
do you know the Red Rhizoma?

572
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,860
The Red Rhizoma?

573
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,460
Why do you ask?

574
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,140
According to Brother, we found the Red Rhizoma

575
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,140
and helped local physicians make the antidote.

576
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,740
The Red Rhizoma...

577
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,780
It's a herb on the snow mountains of Dongyu.

578
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,000
Is it also available here?

579
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,820
The mountains in Liuzhou
are extremely cold, too.

580
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,620
Maybe the herb is also available.

581
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,620
Let's go find it now.

582
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,500
Yueling.

583
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,340
You haven't rested well lately.

584
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,020
You stay for a rest.

585
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,860
I can go alone.

586
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,380
I'm fine. I'll go with you.

587
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,060
(Xingyi, I won't let you die.)

588
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,820
Come on, Xingyi.

589
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,940
Su Nian,

590
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,700
I'm dying.

591
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,100
You...

592
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,860
I had wanted to take you
back to the grassland

593
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,700
in Dongyu

594
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,900
where we could ride a horse

595
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,740
and enjoyed a big feast.

596
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,260
Then,

597
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,340
you don't need
to play music or dance in the Capital City.

598
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,940
I always feel

599
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,740
you aren't happy to do that.

600
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,620
You're not dying.

601
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,820
I won't let you die.

602
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,100
Actually,

603
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,940
I don't care if you like me.

604
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,820
I'm serious.

605
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,460
I'll always care for you.

606
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,340
Because

607
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,660
you're my first friend in the Capital City.

608
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,820
You're strong with good martial arts.

609
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,780
You'll get better.

610
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,860
After having some porridge you fed me,

611
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,100
I do feel better.

612
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,860
And the rash isn't itchy.

613
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,540
It's true, huh?

614
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,260
So, don't worry.

615
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,980
Xingyi.

616
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,900
I figured out how to detoxify you.

617
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,220
When I'm back, I'll save you.

618
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,500
So, it's poison instead of epidemic?

619
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,900
Someone poisoned the water.

620
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,940
But rest assured.

621
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,740
Tomorrow, Shiyu and I are going
to the mountains for the Red Rhizoma.

622
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,500
Yueling, you just go.

623
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,820
Such poison will not kill me.

624
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,460
And I feel much better now.
