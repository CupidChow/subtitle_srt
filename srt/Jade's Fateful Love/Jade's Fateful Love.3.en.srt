it's not that I'm scared.

21

So, you might as well

24
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,380
stay in the room and protect me.

I'll loosen it.

Then you can sleep on the ground.

We're friends.

35
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,340
Don't say thank you.

I'm not sure

if anything will happen tonight.

Mr. Xingyi,

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,410
I won't.

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,780
I'll show my sister

Mr. Xingyi, you get us wrong.

67
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,170
We didn't mean to leave you alone.

68
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,050
It was just an emergency.

69
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,340
I left some soldiers there,

70
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,530
- searching for you.
- You know what?

71
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,780
Don't find excuses.

72
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,260
I came back by myself!

73
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,700
You didn't help at all!

74
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,220
I had a narrow escape.

75
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,730
I nearly died.

76
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,050
I'll say no more.

77
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,100

78
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,460
Mr. Xingyi.

79
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,860
- Yueling!
- Mr. Xingyi.

80
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,930
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

81
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,580

Yueling.

85
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,460
You're finally back.

86
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,580
Oh,

87
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,050
how is your injury?

88
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,700
How is it?

89
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,660
It's all right now.

90
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,020
You have no idea

91
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,690
how miserable I was in the past dozen days.

92
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,580
In the first few days, I was poisoned.

93
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,460
I crawled through the forest on my knees.

94
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,460
In the latter days, I was crippled.

95
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,620
I had to walk with a cane.

96
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,740
Yueling,

97
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,540
it was so cold.

98
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,020
I had nothing to eat, either.

99
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,900
Yueling,

100
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,140
I really...

101
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,740
Sorry, Xingyi.

102
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,700
I failed to protect you.

103
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,300
Never mind.

104
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,940
Did they give you the antidote?

105
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,460
They gave me the antidote?

106
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,060
Not at all!

107
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,740
They discarded me at first.

108
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,220
If I hadn't convinced the female assassin

109
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,260
with my smart head

110
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,300
and got the antidote,

111
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,340
I would have been dead!

112
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,820
Mr. Xingyi,

113
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,260
I've been explaining this all the way here.

114
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,720
I didn't mean to discard you.

115
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
I was just in a hurry to return.

116
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,140
How could you still find excuses?

117
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,060
How could you?

118
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,060
You know what? They're so unreliable.

119
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,380
Yueling, let's leave here.

120
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,980
Yueling.

121
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,600
(Pleasant and Harmonious)
When we found Mr. Xingyi,

122
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,940
we ran into assassins of the Roufeng Sect.

123
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,020
Later, the reinforcements

124
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,780
scared them away.

125
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,860
We caught only two of them.

126
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,860
But they held some toxins in the mouth

127
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,420
and killed themselves.

128
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,300
The Roufeng Sect

129
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,980
nearly sent all their assassins.

130
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,340
They must have been fully prepared.

131
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,820
They even had the route map

132
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,100
of the escort.

133
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,540
The biggest sect, indeed.

134
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,380
They appeared to assassinate the princess.

135
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,700
But actually, they were against me.

136
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,580
The one behind them

137
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,740
must be a politician.

138
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,300
A politician?

139
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260
That explains.

140
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,660
The scout we sent Dongyu for Yueling...

141
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,660
Any word from him?

142
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,180
Not yet.

143
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,380
Your Highness,

144
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,540
do you not trust Yueling?

145
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,060
Keep a close eye on her and her brother.

146
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,140
But if they need anything,

147
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,300
help them as much as you can.

148
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,140
Oh,

149
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,860
don't let them run away.

150
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,020
I won't.

151
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,060
I'll take my leave.

152
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,620
Yueling, the food here is so delicious.

153
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,460
Xingyi,

154
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,220
they're friendly to the princess, right?

155
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,300
These are imperial dishes.

156
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,820
Yueling,

157
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,620
you don't want to stay here

158
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,940
and get married, do you?

159
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,580
I can't leave now.

160
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,100
If I do,

161
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,940
Beishuo will put pressure on Dongyu.

162
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,540
I'm afraid there will be a war again.

163
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,340
Then the escape of our eldest sister

164
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,180
will be exposed.

165
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,940
That's right.

166
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,660
It's thoughtful of you, Yueling.

167
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,740
Yes, of course.

168
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,460
Let's just wait and see.

169
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,300
There are weird local rules.

170
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,100
I guess I won't be summoned lately.

171
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,380
Get out of the way.

172
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,400
The Prime Minister is back.

173
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,940
Isn't he suppressing a rebellion in Yongzhou?

174
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,260
- How come he's back so soon?
- What happened?

175
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,020
Brother,

176
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,620
I escorted the Eldest Princess of Dongyu

177
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,780
to her mansion.

178
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,020
(Hall of Politics)
Soon, she can come and see you.

179
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,980
Brother,

180
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,260
I heard

181
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,540
the North Prince was assassinated

182
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,580
on his way back.

183
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,700
Many of his men were dead or injured.

184
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,140
Even the Princess of Dongyu had a narrow escape

185
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,460
before she arrived.

186
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,180
She nearly died of starvation.

187
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,620
You're hyper-informed.

188
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,020
But I nearly died of starvation, too.

189
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,140
Why haven't you cared about me?

190
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,020
You look all right now.

191
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,060
And the Eldest Princess of Dongyu matters most.

192
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,340
You should focus on the most important thing.

193
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,420
Brother,

194
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,940
I think

195
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,460
the North Prince is to blame

196
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,500
for the victims of the escort.

197
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,060
He deserves to be punished

198
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,860
as a warning.

199
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,980
Just because I care
about the most important thing,

200
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,180
I'm advising you

201
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,900
to stop instructing our brother.

202
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,220
I'm not instructing him.

203
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,020
I'm asking for your punishment.

204
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,340
Zhou Shiyu, don't set me against His Majesty.

205
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,820
Set you against His Highness?

206
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,100
I think that's what you're doing.

207
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,100
With a narrow escape,

208
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,780
I finally returned to the Capital City.

209
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,460
Then someone couldn't wait

210
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,140
to send his maid to poison me.

211
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,300
Poison?

212
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,820
I wonder who...

213
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,020
Oh, Brother.

214
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,540
I think

215
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,180
the Eldest Princess of Dongyu
should be greatly awarded

216
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,420
to calm her down from the scary trip.

217
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,820
You're right, Zhixuan.

218
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,460
I also heard

219
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,540
about the assassination thing.

220
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,340
The Princess of Dongyu didn't die.

221
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,500
She was lucky enough to survive.

222
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,780
She is here to get married.

223
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,180
The marriage between the two states
is a happy event.

224
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,700
In this case,

225
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,980
the North Prince will be exempted

226
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,140
from his careless protection.

227
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

228
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,900
- How could this be?
- Yeah.

229
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,140
This is inappropriate.

230
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,140
He can't be redeemed!

231
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,940
The Prime Minister is back.

232
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,500
Prime Minister.

233
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,500
The Prime Minister is back.

234
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,340
- Prime Minister.
- Oh, Prime Minister.

235
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,540
Your Majesty, I rushed back
to report the success.

236
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,140
You won't blame me for offending you,

237
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,620
will you, Your Majesty?

238
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,980
You're an important official.

239
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,380
And during the suppression in Yongzhou,

240
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,820
you did really hard work.

241
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,700
Your holding a sword in the court

242
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,980
doesn't seem to be wrong.

243
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,700
Your Majesty,

244
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,300
the Prime Minister is meritorious

245
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,860
for the suppression in Yongzhou.

246
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,620
How about Your Majesty
follows Emperor Xuan of Xichuan

247
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,900
to allow important officials
to carry a sword in the court?

248
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,140
Yeah.

249
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,140
The Prime Minister
is meritorious enough to do this.

250
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,300
Minister Liu has a point.

251
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,840
Then, I will...

252
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,540
Thank you for understanding, Your Majesty.

253
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,700
Your Majesty,

254
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,340
I heard

255
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,700
the Eldest Princess of Dongyu was sent here

256
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,820
to get married

257
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,180
an become one of your consorts.

258
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,100
Dongyu is a small state of minority.

259
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,460
Their Eldest Princess

260
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,420
isn't good enough to marry our emperor.

261
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,380
That's right.

262
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,220
Yeah.

263
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,940
Uncle, are you saying
we'll break the engagement

264
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,460
and the alliance between the two states?

265
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,700
Shiyu,

266
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,460
I just said Dongyu was small

267
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,340
and their Eldest Princess

268
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,140
wasn't good enough to marry our emperor.

269
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,340
When did I offer to break the engagement?

270
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,180
And when did I advise

271
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,300
breaking the alliance between the two states?

272
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,740
If you have an idea, Uncle,

273
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,220
feel free to talk.

274
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,340
The Eldest Princess of Dongyu

275
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,700
is a princess after all.

276
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,580
She isn't good enough for His Majesty.

277
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,580
But

278
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,820
she can match

279
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,860
one of our imperial family.

280
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,780
You have a point, Prime Minister.

281
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,020
But I don't think

282
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,380
doing this will reassure Dongyu.

283
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,180
Your Majesty, rest assured.

284
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,820
The diplomat of the Taxila Tribe, Dongyu,

285
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,020
and I had crossed paths.

286
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,020
He will convince the emperor of Dongyu.

287
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,860
Even if the emperor of Dongyu approves,

288
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,980
which one of our imperial family

289
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,020
can be good enough

290
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,900
for the Princess of Dongyu?

291
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Me.

292
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,220
Brother, I'd like to help you.

293
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,980
I heard the Eldest Princess of Dongyu

294
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,900
was the most beautiful lady there.

295
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,020
She should marry me,

296
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,500
the most handsome man in Beishuo.

297
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,540
Umm...

298
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,740
Uncle, what do you think?

299
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,660
Your Majesty,

300
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,260
I think

301
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,540
the North Prince did hard work
to get the princess back.

302
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,980
And he isn't married yet.

303
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,020
How about we marry the Princess of Dongyu

304
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,500
to the North Prince?

305
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
What do you say, Your Majesty?

306
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,340
- The Prime Minister is so thoughtful.
- Yeah.

307
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,860
I don't think I'm good enough for Her Grace.

308
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,700
Yeah. Let me do it.

309
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,820
I'll do it.

310
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,660
All right.

311
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,940
We'll do what the Prime Minister advised.

312
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,460
The Princess of Dongyu
will be married to the North Prince

313
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,940
and the wedding will be held.

314
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,260
Good.

315
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

316
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,420
I'm your elder brother.

317
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,380
Don't you disrespect me
only because you're the North Prince.

318
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,380
First come, first served.

319
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,620
Even my elder brother can't break the rules.

320
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,700
Zhou Shiyu, just you wait!

321
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,380
In every morning court, the two princes

322
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,420
antagonize each other.

323
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,620
His Majesty is weak

324
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,980
and has no children.

325
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,380
If the reign of the imperial family

326
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,700
falls in the hands of the two foppish princes,

327
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,900
it will be risky.

328
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,500
Luckily, in the court,

329
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,180
the Prime Minister is still in charge.

330
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,750
- Yeah.
- If we had to rely on them...

331
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,620
Uncle.

332
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,850
Long time no see.

333
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,530
It's been a long time.

334
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,600
Shiyu,

335
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,780
you've been full of vigor and vitality.

336
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,740
I'd like to congratulate you.

337
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,740
Speaking of this,

338
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,420
thank you for recommending me.

339
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,700
So, the South Prince

340
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,320
failed to marry
the most beautiful lady in Dongyu.

341
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,460
Shiyu, you were brave enough

342
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,860
to get rid of the danger,

343
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,140
come back smoothly,

344
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,420
and get the pretty woman.

345
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,620
All right.

346
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,620
I should go.

347
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,740
Your Highness,

348
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,940
all of a sudden,

349
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,380
why do you have to marry
the Princess of Dongyu?

350
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,700
Uncle pushed it, obviously.

351
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,380
But why did he ask you to marry Her Grace

352
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,420
instead of His Majesty?

353
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,580
Does he want to give you the power of Dongyu?

354
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,660
He can't be that nice.

355
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,300
I guess he'll do something soon.

356
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,500
Our emperor

357
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,300
has really grown up.

358
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,300
When I was away for the suppression,

359
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,820
he had a private alliance with Dongyu.

360
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,620
I was traveling day and night

361
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,300
and three great horses died

362
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,660
before I stopped him
from marrying the Princess of Dongyu.

363
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,000
Prime Minister.

364
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,580
His Majesty has been reigning for three years

365
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,740
within our restriction in the court.

366
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,340
So, after you left the Capital City,

367
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,540
His Majesty negotiated with Dongyu,

368
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,300
trying to get their power to impede us

369
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,620
through marriage.

370
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,940
His Majesty wants to marry
the Princess of Dongyu

371
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,740
without any fear of disappointing us.

372
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,820
He's accumulating his own power.

373
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,460
I don't understand.

374
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,900
(Lin Su, the Prime Minister's counselor)
You always fear the North Prince.

375
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,500
Then why did you marry
the Princess of Dongyu to him?

376
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,980
If the Princess of Dongyu

377
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,340
successfully marries the North Prince,

378
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,860
he'll easily get the power of Dongyu.

379
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,260
But if the princess

380
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,940
fails to marry the North Prince

381
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,700
and even dies in his mansion,

382
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,900
Zhou Shiyu

383
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,660
will have

384
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,380
a hard time.

385
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,780
Brilliant, Prime Minister.

386
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,940
Really brilliant.

387
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,780
These days,

388
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,980
have our men completely repair

389
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,220
the eastern yard.

390
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,420
By the way,

391
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,100
do some decorations

392
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,780
in the chambers there

393
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,700
according to Dongyu style.

394
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,300
Your Highness,

395
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,540
will you really marry that fake princess?

396
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,780
Whether she's a real or fake princess,

397
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,620
she'll be my real wife after the wedding.

398
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,620
Get used to that early.

399
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,260
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

400
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,660
Be careful. Careful.

401
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,500
- Yes.
- Yes.

402
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,740
(Catalogue of Gifts)

403
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,540
A decree for Ashina Zhu.

404
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,420
(Royal Decree)
His Majesty hereby announced this.

405
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,700
"I hear Ashina Zhu,
the Eldest Princess of Dongyu,

406
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,260
behaves elegantly

407
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,820
and remains respectful

408
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,220
with a gentle personality

409
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,620
and a beautiful appearance.

410
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,340
Quite happy to know this,

411
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,930
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)
I decided to relate our two states by marriage.

412
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,860
Zhou Shiyu, the North Prince,
is over 20 years old

413
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,220
and he should get married.

414
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,940
He deserves a good girl.

415
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,500
Ashina Zhu, the Eldest Princess,

416
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,700
makes a perfect couple with the North Prince.

417
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,780
I should help them get together.

418
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,620
Hereby, I marry Ashina Zhu to the North Prince.

419
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,500
The wedding will be held in three months
on the national day of Beishuo.

420
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,180
All the ceremony things

421
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,100
will be handled by the Ministry of Rites
and the Bureau of Astronomy."

422
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,710
Respect this.

423
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,300
Yueling,

424
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,780
they're totally disrespecting our state.

425
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,900
They modified the engagement.

426
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
A princess consort can't be
as good as an imperial consort.

427
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,940
This is ridiculous.

428
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,300
Yeah.

429
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,180
I didn't see this coming, too.

430
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,340
If our eldest sister suffered this here,

431
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,220
she wouldn't tell us.

432
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,820
Luckily, she left.

433
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,660
But on the catalogue of gifts,

434
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,340
many more gold, silver, silk, cattle, sheep,
and horses

435
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,540
are given to Dongyu.

436
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,740
With so many things,

437
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,580
I don't think our people

438
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,940
will complain too much.

439
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,460
They will not complain.

440
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,580
But I have something to say.

441
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,220
You don't get married.

442
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,260
Yueling, I've heard all about it lately.

443
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,500
The North Prince you're going to marry

444
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,580
isn't a good guy.

445
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,540
Run.

446
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,500
All right.

447
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,300
But we haven't heard
from our eldest sister yet.

448
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,140
Forget it.

449
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,580
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

450
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,500
The yard in Beishuo looks fancy.

451
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,900
But compared to our grassland,

452
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,540
it's far inferior.

453
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,380
Yueling!

454
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,100
Yueling!

455
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
Yueling, look who is here.

456
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,780
Your Grace.

457
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,940
Qianqian.

458
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,050
Your Grace.

459
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,060
I've finally found you, Your Grace.

460
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,940
You have no idea.

461
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,900
Hardly had I got the Eldest Princess settled...

462
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,380
Hardly had I got the Eldest Princess settled

463
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,820
than I set out for you.

464
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,140
But it was too far away.

465
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,060
I ran into some refugees on my way

466
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,100
and was robbed of every penny I had.

467
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,740
I had a hard trip, too.

468
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,060
I understand you, Qianqian.

469
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,060
Thank you for your hard work, Qianqian.

470
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,420
Come on.

471
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,420
How is my sister?

472
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,500
Princess Ashina Zhu and Diplomat Du Er

473
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,860
have settled down in the northwest tribe

474
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,860
of Dongyu.

475
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,700
That's great.

476
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,020
She can finally marry

477
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,900
the man she loves.

478
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,060
Yeah. You can be relieved, Yueling.

479
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,980
Moreover,

480
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,660
the three of us are back together again.

481
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,060
- We're back together.
- Yeah.

482
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,460
Now, what will we do?

483
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,620
Run away.

484
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,900
- Piggy.
- Piggy.

485
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,180
- Come. So cute.
- Good piggy.

486
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,420
Eat some more.

487
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,940
Come to me.

488
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,620
I'm the most handsome man in Beishuo!

489
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,060
Why can Zhou Shiyu surpass me?

490
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,420
That's right.

491
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,700
Your Highness, you're handsome

492
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,620
and charming.

493
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,860
You're a perfect match
for the Princess of Dongyu.

494
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,300
But His Majesty

495
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,460
obeys the Prime Minister in every way.

496
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,340
So, we should stay on friendly terms with him.

497
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,860
We should.

498
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,700
Uncle is temperamental.

499
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,220
I don't dare to mess with him.

500
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,260
Is there any other way

501
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,420
to make me marry the Princess of Dongyu?

502
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,020
Oh.

503
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,940
Your Highness,

504
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,620
if you build a relationship with the princess

505
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,260
before she marries the North Prince

506
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,380
and she asks His Majesty to marry her to you,

507
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,420
maybe there'll be a ray of hope.

508
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,580
It's a good idea.

509
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,980
Mr. Xingyi.

510
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,180
Mr. Xingyi.

511
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,540
Why are you here again?

512
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,540
I've brought you something to eat.

513
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,500
Flower-shaped Goose Cake,

514
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,620
Cheese Cherry,

515
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,380
Sliced Fish in Sauce,

516
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,900
and Roast Quail.

517
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,140
These are the most famous local snacks.

518
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,260
You haven't tasted any, right, Mr. Xingyi?

519
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,540
Don't think I'll forgive you

520
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,620
just for these snacks.

521
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,700
I get it.

522
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,420
But Mr. Xingyi,

523
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,900
are you

524
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,020
going out?

525
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,700
No.

526
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,300
I'm just tidying up the room.

527
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,340
I just... I'm a clean man.

528
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,180
What's the problem?

529
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,940
Nothing.

530
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,100
Who's eating alone?

531
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,020
Yueling,

532
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,580
Lin Mu brought me these snacks.

533
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,860
I want to check how they taste.

534
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,900
If they taste good, I'll bring them to you.

535
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,900
Really?

536
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,220
I'll take my leave, then.

537
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,660
Yueling, everything is packed.

538
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,500
Are we leaving today?

539
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,020
Not now.

540
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,220
We can't leave without a plan

541
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,540
in case we alert them.

542
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,540
Yueling,

543
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,460
we've been in the Capital City

544
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,620
for quite a long time

545
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,060
but have never gone out for fun.

546
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,340
I heard about the nearby House of Romance

547
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,180
which is quite popular.

548
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,260
How about

549
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,100
you take me there to experience it?

550
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,260
Yueling, take me there.

551
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,620
Please take me there.

552
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,900
- Yueling.
- Let's go there, then.

553
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,300
Your Highness, Her Grace came out.

554
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,260
At last.

555
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,020
Will we stick to the plan?

556
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,220
- Approved.
- Yes.

557
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,100
Chunhua.

558
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,220
Here.

559
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,860
Get me changed.

560
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,780
I'm going to do something serious.

561
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,940
Yes.

562
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,620
Look.

563
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,660
That one is good.

564
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,140
So pretty.

565
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,020
You're gorgeous, girl.

566
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,900
How about you have fun with us?

567
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,860
You must have a death wish!

568
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,260
You've just recovered.

569
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,900
They're mere roaches.

570
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,180
I can take care of them.

571
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,500
You sound arrogant.

572
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,580
Let me teach you how to please a man.

573
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,620
- You have a death wish!
- Stop!

574
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,380
Beat him!

575
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,940
What's going on?

576
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,020
What are they doing?

577
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,420
How come they're fighting?

578
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,340
Oh, my ear.

579
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,540
Don't be scared, Miss.

580
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,300
When I'm here,

581
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,740
they won't dare to hurt you.

582
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,300
Gentleman, you have great martial arts.

583
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,780
I certainly do.

584
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,300
I've been practicing martial arts since little.

585
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,860
In the Capital City,

586
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,620
no one can defeat me.

587
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,940
No one can defeat him.

588
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,900
So impressive?

589
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,740
How about I compete with you?

590
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,660
Oh, I don't know.

591
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
I'm a strong man.

592
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,740
How can I fight a girl?

593
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,580
Watch this.

594
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,020
Yueling, stop.

595
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,100
Or you may kill him.

596
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,020
How dare you beat...?

597
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,460
Me.

598
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,820
- Young Master.
- Yang...

599
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,260
- Young Master.
- Yang Xu.

600
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,300
Don't cry, Young Master.

601
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,140
Don't cry.

602
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,020
I thought you were a strong martial artist.

603
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,060
I'm sorry.

604
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,420
I didn't know you were so weak.

605
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,020
Shall I go to the clinic with you

606
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,500
and then walk you home?

607
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,860
However much I have to pay,

608
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,060
I'll give it to you.

609
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,900
Right.

610
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,820
She...

611
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,260
She even offers some money.

612
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,020
Our young master has something important to do.

613
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,660
We should go.

614
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,900
- Let me walk you.
- Hey, don't go.

615
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,140
This local guy is weird.

616
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,940
One moment he was rather hospitable

617
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,540
and the next moment, he became indifferent.

618
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,460
I think

619
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,260
Beishuo men are just weak.

620
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,500
Without martial arts,

621
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,100
he planned to save you.

622
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,300
I think he just had a great wish.

623
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,420
Forget him.

624
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,860
- Let's go to the House of Romance.
- All right.

625
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,200
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

626
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,950
- Calm down, Your Highness.
- Don't be angry, Your Highness.

627
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,820
Your Highness, cool down.

628
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,340
Your Highness, calm down.

629
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,820
Calm down?

630
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,140
Look what you've done!

631
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,300
And you asked me to calm down?

632
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,700
I didn't expect that, either.

633
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,900
Chunhua, Qiuyue, Xiachan, and Dongxue.

634
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,740
- Here.
- Here.

635
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,100
Punish him.

636
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

637
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,460
Your Highness, I...

638
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,860
Oh, Your Highness.

639
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,700
Your Highness.

640
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,100
Your Highness.

641
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,780
Mercy, Your Highness.

642
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,980
Please spare me.

643
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,300
I didn't know the Princess of Dongyu

644
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,260
could be so tough.

645
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,300
I... I have...

646
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,460
I have another plan, Your Highness.

647
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,260
I still have...

648
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,700
Stop.

649
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,420
Tell me about it.

650
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,140
Come on, Your Highness.

651
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,780
When we fail to get the princess,

652
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,460
we can do something to the North Prince.

653
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,340
Well, tell me.

654
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,940
What can we do to him?

655
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,540
Your Highness.

656
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,660
We can...

657
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,020
Your Highness.

658
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,740
(Invitation)

659
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,660
The South Prince had this sent,

660
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,020
inviting you to talk in the House of Romance.

661
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,140
I'm not going. I have no time for his drama.

662
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,900
I'll go reject him now.

663
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,940
Your Highness.

664
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,580
Miss Yueling is going to escape.

665
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,060
Before that, she has gone
to the House of Romance for fun.

666
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,340
Butler Wen.

667
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,420
Yes, Your Highness.

668
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,660
Don't reject him.

669
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,940
Since the South Prince wants some fun,

670
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,380
let's go have fun with him.

671
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,620
After all, someone in the palace will love

672
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,340
the disputes between us.

673
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,020
Yes.

674
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,060
Tonight, the unsurpassed lady will dance.

675
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,460
It's been a long time

676
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,100
since Miss Su Nian danced last time.

677
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
Yeah.

678
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,260
Look, the guests to watch the performance

679
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,380
have more than doubled than usual.

680
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,300
How did you get the bruises on your face?

681
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,740
When I came out earlier today,

682
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,460
I fell accidentally.

683
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,610
If you had fallen accidentally,

684
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,500
you wouldn't have so many bruises.

685
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,620
Unless you were chased by a dog,

686
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,700
you wouldn't be so badly injured.

687
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,940
Then pretend I met a mean dog in the day.

688
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,700
Mean dog.

689
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,740
Someone cursed me.

690
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,740
Can it be anyone thinking of you?

691
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,580
No.

692
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,300
Someone must have cursed me.

693
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,100
Never mind.
Look over there. So bustling.

694
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,940
Let's go take a look.

695
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,900
Come in, please.

696
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,380
Today, our unsurpassed lady Miss Su Nian

697
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,300
will dance for the guests.

698
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,000
Let's welcome her.

699
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,060
- Look over there.
- Madam Sang.

700
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,150
- This way, please.
- All right.

701
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,220
When is she coming out?

702
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,980
- Soon. Please wait.
- Sir, get in first.

703
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,860
She's coming out soon.

704
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,860
Whatever good wine or dishes you have,

705
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,940
serve them.

706
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,780
All right.

707
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,660
Enjoy the food, sir.

708
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,420
Miss Su Nian is here.

709
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,820
Miss Su Nian, you've come at last.

710
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,700
Miss Su Nian has finally come.

711
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,540
We've been waiting for a long time.

712
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,060
(Su Nian, the unsurpassed lady
in the House of Romance)

713
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,820
Miss Su Nian dances even better than before.

714
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,940
She does?

715
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,980
I think she's ordinary.

716
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,820
In no case

717
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,060
can she dance better than the Persian girls

718
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,900
I've been keeping.

719
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,220
Shiyu, I hear you keep
many beautiful ladies, too.

720
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,620
But you have no Persian girls,

721
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,140
do you?

722
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,700
In collecting beautiful girls,

723
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,580
I do far worse than you.

724
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,460
You're rather experienced, after all.

725
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,620
I'm no match for you.

726
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,740
I usually see the most beautiful ladies

727
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,020
and I'm too fed up

728
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,540
to enjoy their charm.

729
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,380
Today, in this ordinary house,

730
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,020
I see some ordinary girls

731
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,260
and I find them a little bit attractive.

732
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,140
Just a little bit.

733
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,820
Bravo!

734
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,700
Why does that girl

735
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,380
look so familiar?

736
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,300
Impressive.

737
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,800
The real fairy.

738
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,780
Who's there?

739
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,580
She's that vicious assassin!

740
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,340
Bravo!

741
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,540
Don't be ridiculous.

742
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
What assassin?

743
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,740
Come on, Yueling.

744
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,580
She was the assassin in Dongyu.

745
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,660
I'm sure.

746
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,670
If you keep making trouble,

747
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,650
I'll send you back.

748
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,220
Fine, Yueling.

749
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,060
Fill my cup.

750
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,060
(I will prove)

751
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,820
(you're that vicious assassin.)

752
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,220
(And you'll have to pay double)

753
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,540
(for how you humiliated me.)

754
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,060
How is everything going?

755
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,980
It's what the Prime Minister wants

756
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,060
and I'll do the best I can.

757
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,020
Here. Have a look.

758
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,980
(Account Book)

759
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,740
Well done.

760
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,900
The North Prince's men didn't find it, huh?

761
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,140
Rest assured, Mr. Wang.

762
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,020
I've made a fake account book

763
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,860
as the substitute.

764
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,100
It looks totally real.

765
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,260
Good.

766
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,340
Come on, Mr. Wang. A toast to you.

767
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,660
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

768
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,820
(Since it's something to the North Prince,)

769
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,940
