Who's skulking back there?

20

Show yourself!

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,880
Officer,

22
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,510
I'm too shy

23
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,760
to see anyone.

24
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,560
This...

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,280
Miss?

26
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,350
You look strong.

27
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,430
You're tall and slim.

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,350
Come on.

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,560
I'm just tall.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,430
Don't be so rude.

31
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,470
Officer,

32
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,400
you've checked us.

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Can you let us go now?

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,750
The two of you

35
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,750
are free to go.

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
But this one...

37
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,990
Stay.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,150
You look quite suspicious.

39
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,730
You can't get in now.

40
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,360
Su Nian,

41
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,270
let's go.

42
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,870
Without evidence,

43
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,190
- why can you stop me?
- What?

44
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,680
It's just a command from above.

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,120
We're just following it.

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,870
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,080
Here.

48
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,870
- Don't worry.
- Thanks.

49
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,150
Everything is being arranged.

50
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,190
- With Her Highness's help, the victims
- Thank you.

51
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,120
- calmed down.
- Thanks.

52
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
You're welcome.

53
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,360
Your Highness,

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,150
a girl outside the city gate looks suspicious.

55
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,990
Shall I bring her here?

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,840
Thank you.

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,400
Let go of me. I can walk myself.

58
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,080
Yueling, Yueling.

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,030
- Let him go.
- Yueling.

60
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,710
Yueling!

61
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,470
- Xingyi?
- Yueling!

62
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,750
Yueling.

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,870
Yueling.

64
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,870
(Why is he dressed up like this?)

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,030
Everything went smoothly on my way here.

66
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,560
But at the city gate of Liuzhou,

67
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,030
I was stopped.

68
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,520
If I saw you dressed up like this,

69
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,630
I would also detain you at the city gate.

70
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,470
Yueling,

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,910
do I not look good in this?

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,800
Good.

73
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,360
You look really good.

74
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,710
Oh.

75
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,470
You said you came with Miss Su Nian.

76
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,960
Why do I not see her?

77
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,160
Su Nian has settled down

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,000
in Madam Sang's house.

79
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,830
They'll do a charity show for local victims.

80
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,390
- Charity show?
- Yeah.

81
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,630
They'll do music and dance

82
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,920
for local victims.

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,040
The House of Romance

84
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,830
is very famous throughout Beishuo.

85
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,480
I believe a lot of people will come.

86
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,750
After they watch Su Nian's performance,

87
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,510
they'll cheer up and rebuild their hometown.

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,000
Miss Su Nian is an unsurpassed lady.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,800
I'm sure a lot of men

90
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,000
want to see her performance.

91
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,240
Yes, of course.

92
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,080
Xingyi.

93
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,430
Listen.

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,600
You had a long trip.

95
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,240
Madam Sang's house can't be comfortable.

96
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,750
Tomorrow, you invite Miss Su Nian over

97
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,750
to live with us.

98
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,940
What?

99
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,360
Just do what you're told.

100
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,000
All right.

101
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,200
Yueling,

102
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,870
don't stare at me like that.

103
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
You make me shy.

104
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,750
Go get changed now.

105
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,720
You look ridiculous.

106
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,110
All right.

107
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,590
Tell me.

108
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,040
What wicked idea do you have?

109
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,070
I know how to raise money.

110
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,630
You want Miss Su Nian to help us?

111
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,240
She is the whole point.

112
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,000
Su Nian,

113
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,510
I searched the whole yard

114
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,430
but didn't find Nan Xun.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,630
Is he not kept in the North Prince's house?

116
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,950
He isn't found anywhere else.

117
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
He must be there.

118
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,270
Search more carefully

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,190
to see if there's a secret cell.

120
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
Yes.

121
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,800
Greetings, Your Grace.

122
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,800
No need of that, Miss Su.

123
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,430
It's really kind-hearted of you.

124
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,510
Now, Liuzhou is being rebuilt.

125
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,630
Your charity show

126
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,600
gave a lot of hope to local people.

127
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,310
You flatter me, Your Grace.

128
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,630
But people

129
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,560
need more than hope.

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,480
In Liuzhou, too many things wait to be done.

131
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,310
A lot of money is needed
for house reconstruction

132
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,070
and waterway repair.

133
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,680
How can I help you, Your Grace?

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,480
I will do my best.

135
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,680
You do not hover, Miss Su.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,950
We've invited you over

137
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,000
because we want you

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,600
to give another performance.

139
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,600
I'll invite some guests to watch and donate

140
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,070
to help the affected people.

141
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,240
I'll get well prepared.

142
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,270
Thank you, Miss Su.

143
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,860
(Rich Merchants)

144
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,740
(List of Rich Merchants in Liuzhou)

145
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,070
The list doesn't miss

146
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,310
any rich merchants nearby.

147
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,120
I guess you'll raise a lot of money.

148
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,920
Are you sure?

149
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,190
I spent a lot of time asking around

150
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,360
before I made this list.

151
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,190
I screened them

152
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,510
and sent invitations to the richest ones.

153
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,120
You're so clever, Yueling.

154
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,120
With your help,

155
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,630
Liuzhou will be rebuilt soon

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,630
and people will enjoy a stable life.

157
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,310
You're good, too.

158
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,320
These days, you work personally

159
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,240
to command the reconstruction of Liuzhou.

160
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,360
I haven't seen you for days.

161
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,790
Who would know

162
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,720
the famous North Prince in Liuzhou

163
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,480
used to be a useless prince?

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,080
Yueling, now,

165
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,960
do you still I'm useless?

166
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,550
I need to observe for more time.

167
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,150
Then here in Liuzhou,

168
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,840
observe carefully.

169
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,120
Why isn't he back yet?

170
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,500
(Zhao's Teahouse)

171
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,920
What food is this?

172
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,910
I've searched everywhere,

173
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,480
only to find the melon seeds.

174
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,320
And they're wet.

175
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,630
Make do with them.

176
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,630
What a terrible town it is!

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
Can my brother's donation really help?

178
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,200
Your Highness,

179
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
be careful about what you say and do here.

180
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,270
If others hear you,

181
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,440
you'll get in trouble.

182
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,000
Shut up.

183
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,960
It's just your bad idea.

184
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,440
Or I wouldn't be here

185
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,480
with even nothing to eat!

186
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,790
The North Prince and his future wife

187
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,750
really have an enviable relationship.

188
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,270
That's right.

189
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,240
They hand out porridge together.

190
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,030
Such a nice couple.

191
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,360
I hear His and Her Highnesses

192
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,240
will hold a charity show.

193
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,720
Su Nian, the best dancer in the Capital City,

194
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,600
is invited to perform

195
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,030
to raise money for victims in Liuzhou.

196
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,720
They're real saviors.

197
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,000
We people are really lucky.

198
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,240
Zhou Shiyu.

199
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Ashina Zhu.

200
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,960
She promised to marry me.

201
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,120
One tried to kill me

202
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,120
and the other fooled me.

203
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,720
Your Highness,

204
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,510
calm your nerves.

205
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,190
The tea tastes good.

206
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,160
Whatever it may take,

207
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,670
I'll watch the show.

208
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,560
Go get prepared.

209
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,270
No problem, Your Highness.

210
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,840
I'm on it now.

211
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,160
Now.

212
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,470
Su Nian,

213
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
I've figured out

214
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,280
where Nan Xun is kept.

215
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,790
On the day of the show, stick to our plan.

216
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,630
Go have it arranged.

217
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,990
Yes.

218
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,030
Feels really good.

219
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,870
You look gorgeous, Su Nian.

220
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,150
You will fascinate some rich merchants.

221
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,390
The princess will take advantage.

222
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,840
Tonight, I guess these rich merchants

223
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,030
will have to donate a lot of money.

224
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,000
The donations will be used for victims.

225
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a good thing.

226
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Be very careful later.

227
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,960
Don't worry, Su Nian.

228
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,600
I will only make a mess

229
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,150
to distract them.

230
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,480
The rest will count on you.

231
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,960
Does Nan Xun have to be killed?

232
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,600
Su Nian, are you being soft?

233
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,200
I'll pretend you didn't say this.

234
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,600
I just think Nan Xun...

235
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,000
Su Nian, say no more.

236
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,480
It's just our destiny.

237
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,200
- Bravo!
- Nice!

238
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
- Brilliant!
- Nice!

239
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,600
- Bravo!
- Nice!

240
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,030
Miss Su plays such beautiful music.

241
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,390
How enchanting!

242
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,550
Well, Miss Su can do

243
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,120
more than music.

244
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,120
Do you want to see her

245
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,320
perform something else?

246
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,720
Yes. Yes, of course.

247
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

248
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,390
Thank you for inviting us, Your Highness.

249
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,720
Miss Su Nian

250
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,240
is indeed the best performer
in the Capital City.

251
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,440
I heard she could also

252
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,280
dance gracefully.

253
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,790
I wonder if she will

254
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,910
perform for us

255
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,480
so that we can enjoy her beautiful dance.

256
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,240
- Yeah.
- That's right.

257
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,670
Yeah.

258
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,960
She will, of course.

259
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,150
But Miss Su performs today

260
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,390
for people in Liuzhou.

261
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,720
It's righteous of her.

262
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,960
Hearing about the disaster in Liuzhou,

263
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,670
she couldn't eat or sleep well.

264
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,790
She kept worrying.

265
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,440
Only when she heard

266
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,030
rich merchants like you
would donate money and things

267
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,750
did she cheer up

268
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,960
and decide to perform with gratitude.

269
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,270
Gentlemen, you saved her

270
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,870
and also the people in Liuzhou.

271
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,030
It's such a beautiful story.

272
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,120
I'd like to thank you, gentlemen.

273
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,870
I will

274
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,200
go get prepared for the dance.

275
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,510
I can't wait to see.

276
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,320
Miss Su Nian is doing so much

277
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,600
for our people in Liuzhou.

278
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,080
She's really admirable.

279
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,040
I decided

280
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,870
to donate 500 tales of silver

281
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,910
for her righteousness!

282
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,150
I'll donate 300 taels.

283
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,440
I'll give 100.

284
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,360
I'll do 200.

285
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,320
Me, too.

286
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,270
100 taels.

287
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,110
I'll do 50 taels.

288
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,710
Su Nian.

289
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,000
Weird. Why is she gone?

290
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,750
Thank you for your generous donations.

291
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,670
The North Prince will tell His Majesty
about your good deeds

292
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,750
and you'll be memorialized in stone

293
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,200
so that people in Liuzhou

294
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,840
will remember your great help

295
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,720
for generations.

296
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,030
I'll give 1,000 taels.

297
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,790
Your Highness?

298
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,310
Ask people in Liuzhou
to be grateful to the South Prince

299
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,960
instead of the North Prince.

300
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,350
Got it?

301
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,030
What are you doing here?

302
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,920
To get you back home.

303
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,030
Who are you to get her back?

304
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,750
You have no idea, huh?

305
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,310
She promised to marry me.

306
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,310
Too lucky for this young man.

307
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Who would know that?

308
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,920
Don't be ridiculous.

309
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,000
Let's talk over here.

310
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,110
Don't ruin my charity show.

311
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,480
Zhou Shiyu,

312
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,880
you have no idea, huh?

313
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,880
When you were slandered for rebellion,

314
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,960
she became my consort.

315
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,830
That was my stopgap to come to Liuzhou.

316
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,920
What stopgap?

317
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,350
I don't understand.

318
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,830
You promised to marry me and you must do it.

319
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,070
Yueling, I believe you anyway.

320
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,790
Anyone intelligent

321
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,030
can see you're flirting, huh?

322
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,550
Assassins!

323
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,590
Catch the assassins!

324
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,560
- Let's go!
- Run!

325
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,030
Yang Xu, it's you again!

326
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,270
I haven't given the signal yet!

327
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,310
Your Highness, they're not our men.

328
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,440
Come on, Zhou Zhixuan. It's you again.

329
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,830
Not me. I haven't smashed my cup.

330
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,440
Zhou Zhixuan, unless you want to die,

331
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,790
get your men here to help.

332
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,510
I'm not going to help you.

333
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,510
Don't try to scare me.

334
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,790
If I die, do you think

335
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,630
you can survive?

336
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,880
Su Nian?

337
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,560
Nan Xun,

338
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm sorry.

339
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,590
What do you wish for?

340
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
I'll do it for you.

341
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,480
To be killed by you

342
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,720
will be my last wish.

343
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,830
You must have suffered a lot

344
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,350
before you became the best performer
in the House of Romance.

345
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,670
Yeah.

346
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,680
I'm from a humble family

347
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,640
and now I'm a musician.

348
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,720
Who will really protect me?

349
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,520
Su Nian?

350
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,080
Female assassin?

351
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,760
Your Highness,

352
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,750
if Shiyu returns to the Capital City

353
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,270
and tells His Majesty about this,

354
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,790
you'll be the sinner

355
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,350
who rebels and kills his brother.

356
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,000
Come on, Your Highness. Do it.

357
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,200
It's your best chance.

358
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,040
You have to seize it.

359
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,560
But...

360
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
He saved my life just now.

361
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,590
Then, let's wait and profit.

362
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,000
Yang Xu, Yang Xu.

363
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,110
The cup.

364
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,960
Give me the cup!

365
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,750
Yueling, Yueling.

366
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Yueling.

367
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,950
Fight.

368
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,030
Who said I was here to kill my brother?

369
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,070
I'm here to rescue him.

370
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,270
Take them down.

371
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,440
You'll be rewarded later!

372
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,830
Where are we?

373
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,030
This place is void

374
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,790
without anything to see.

375
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,200
I guess we're inside the jade pendants.

376
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,640
Inside?

377
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,270
But it has never happened before.

378
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,640
And our injuries are gone.

379
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,880
"The chosen ones meet.

380
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,720
Fate refreshes everything.

381
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,200
It won't be over

382
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,550
until the couple know and love."

383
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,270
What does it mean?

384
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,640
Maybe nothing unusual happened

385
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,830
until the pendants were stained with blood.

386
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,070
This aphorism

387
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,590
must be explaining to us

388
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,920
why we got the pendants

389
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,960
and had such adventures.

390
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,310
You have a point.

391
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,400
Then I should keep it in mind.

392
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,550
What if it'll help someday?

393
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,240
"The chosen ones meet.

394
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,200
Fate refreshes..."

395
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,300
(The South Prince)

396
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,800
Yang Xu.

397
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,590
Take me out of this trouble immediately.

398
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,430
Yes.

399
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,480
Come on.

400
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,000
Assassin, you can't flee!

401
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,200
Why is she gone?

402
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,240
Her eyes...

403
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,790
Prime Minister.

404
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,720
Taoist Master,

405
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,510
why did I

406
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,830
feel punchy just now?

407
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,670
Umm...

408
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,960
When I was sitting for meditation,

409
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,590
I also felt a trace of abnormal fluctuation.

410
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,960
Abnormal fluctuation?

411
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,070
Time is like paper.

412
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,720
Time fluctuation is like the crease of paper.

413
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,830
When the crease is unfolded,

414
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,310
everything goes back to square one.

415
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,640
Taoist Master,

416
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,400
can you please be more straightforward?

417
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,310
When time folds, everything goes still.

418
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,440
When time unfolds,

419
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,830
everything goes back to square one.

420
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,400
Time folds?

421
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,350
Taoist Master,

422
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,640
Was the abnormal fluctuation

423
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,480
caused by time folding?

424
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,240
Su Nian, Su Nian!

425
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,350
Su Nian!

426
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Xingyi.

427
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,800
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,350
A female assassin broke in.

429
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,510
Worried about you,

430
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,200
I broke in hurriedly.

431
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,960
It's all right.

432
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,590
I'm here to get changed

433
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,960
for my next dance.

434
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,110
The audiences are gone.

435
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,440
You don't need to dance.

436
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,480
She has great martial arts.

437
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,790
I fear she would hide here.

438
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,920
An assassin?

439
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,590
I'm so scared.

440
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,510
Don't... Don't be scared.

441
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,800
I'm here.

442
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,310
I'll protect you.

443
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,070
You...

444
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,030
What?

445
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,880
Thank you for thinking of me

446
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,720
in such a danger.

447
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,950
Su Nian.

448
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,350
Your Highness,

449
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,000
it's almost cleaned up.

450
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,640
The assassins ran away as we outnumbered them.

451
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,920
The South Prince also left in the mess.

452
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
I didn't secure you, Your Highness.

453
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,310
Please forgive me.

454
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,670
You're not to blame.

455
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,680
I also had an oversight.

456
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,680
Luckily, Nan Xun is still
in the secret chamber.

457
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,160
I had him secretly
escorted back to the Capital City.

458
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,280
Oh,

459
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,480
Prince Xingyi said a female assassin

460
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,350
nearly killed Nan Xun in the chamber.

461
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,310
His Highness fought desperately

462
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,750
to have kept Nan Xun alive.

463
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,270
Female assassin?

464
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,110
Xingyi has improved.

465
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,640
Now, he can help a lot.

466
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,550
Go take care of everything.

467
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,550
We should go back to the Capital City soon.

468
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,440
If we linger here,

469
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,880
there may be more trouble.

470
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,440
Yes. I'm on it.

471
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,550
After I get the money from the rich merchants

472
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,480
and give it to Mr. Liu, we'll go.

473
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,480
I don't think it's easy to get the money.

474
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,830
Just now, they were scared.

475
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,000
I'll visit them personally.

476
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,070
Who dares to reject me?

477
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,350
Oh, you're good.

478
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,980
(True Virtues)

479
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,780
Yueling,

480
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,860
where's Zhou Shiyu?

481
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,340
Didn't you invite him to dinner?

482
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,180
The dishes are cold.

483
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,500
He isn't in his room.

484
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,940
He's been weird lately.

485
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,540
He's always out.

486
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,580
Where has he been?

487
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,420
Why did she kiss me?

488
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,380
Weird.

489
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,540
Who kissed you?

490
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,060
No one.

491
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,620
I said, "Let's eat. The dishes are cold."

492
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,220
All you know is to eat.

493
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,180
And don't call him Zhou Shiyu.

494
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,620
He's the North Prince.

495
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,420
How come you're so impolite?

496
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,940
Oh, you defend him.

497
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,060
What do you think he's busy with lately?

498
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,140
The reconstruction of Liuzhou

499
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,500
has been going smoothly.

500
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,340
Magistrate Liu supervises strictly, too.

501
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,960
He doesn't need to supervise.

502
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,200
Weird, indeed.

503
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,700
Can he be in love with some girl?

504
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,900
Focus on your food.

505
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,660
Eat and stop talking.

506
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,020
Li feels unwell lately.

507
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,940
Your Highness, will you check up today?

508
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,300
All right.

509
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,380
Let's go.

510
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,540
(Lee?)

511
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,140
Who is Lee?

512
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,620
Zhou Shiyu can't be

513
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,460
seeking pleasure from girls, can he?

514
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,940
(Seeking pleasure from girls?)

515
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,380
(Seriously?)

516
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,020
Yueling,

517
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,660
you should catch up and check.

518
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,060
If he's really with some girl,

519
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,300
you pop out

520
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,300
and catch him in the act.

521
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,180
I have no time to follow him.

522
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,180
We're going back to the Capital City.

523
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,980
I need to buy

524
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,780
some souvenirs.

525
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,900
I'm going, too.

526
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,980
You must not go.

527
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,380
If I see you run about again,

528
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,700
I'll get you dressed up as a girl

529
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,820
and send you to the guards.

530
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,900
I'm not going, then.

531
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,380
Yueling, don't be so rude.

532
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,820
Your Highness,

533
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,940
I think Her Highness is stalking us.

534
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,100
Shall I walk her back?

535
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,780
No need.

536
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,300
Let her be.

537
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,540
But Your Highness,

538
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,860
she will know about our plan,

539
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,060
won't she?

540
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,220
It's all right.

541
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,740
I was about to tell her.

542
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,700
All right.

543
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,020
What's going on here?

544
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
Isn't he going to see a Lee?

545
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,980
