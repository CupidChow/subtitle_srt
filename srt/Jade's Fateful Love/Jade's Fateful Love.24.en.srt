(Roufeng Sect)
Open the door.

24
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,330
Prime Minister asked me to take them away.

25
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,480
Yes.

26
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,850
Come out.

27
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,240
- Go.
- This way.

28
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,800
Su Nian, you betrayed your master.

29
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,240
Today, I'm going to kill you right here!

30
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,800
No more talking.

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,480
Pay for Lingxi's life.

32
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,440
This time, I'm greatly meritorious.

33
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,210
- Kill!
- Yes!

34
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,530
Yuan, you did a nice trick.

35
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,530
You sacrificed Luoyi's life

36
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,920
for the trust of the Prime Minister.

37
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,410
Luoyi is my sister.

38
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,050
I will save her with whatever it takes.

39
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,730
But you...

40
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,320
You're the most terrible.

41
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,560
If it weren't for you,

42
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,530
Luoyi wouldn't end up like this!

43
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,880
Then Your Lordship, what will you do?

44
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,050
His Majesty passed away.

45
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,920
Luckily, Lady Chen is pregnant.

46
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,770
The reign will be assured!

47
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,440
So, I should give you an early congratulations.

48
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,120
The future Regent with great power.

49
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,000
By then, I'll tell the world.

50
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,880
The North Prince Zhou Shiyu

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,240
lost his life during the fight

52
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,770
against the Prime Minister's rebel forces.

53
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,960
Are you sure?

54
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,090
Who will win is still uncertain.

55
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,240
Isn't it too soon to tell?

56
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,230
You don't think

57
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,820
the fifty thousand soldiers from the South

58
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,440
can get in town, can you?

59
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,560
The city gate is guarded by my men.

60
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,920
The Capital City is strongly fortified.

61
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,800
Your fifty thousand soldiers

62
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,440
can't get in town,

63
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,480
however strong they are.

64
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,490
What?

65
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,970
Zhou Shiyu,

66
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,560
how did you know
I transferred my soldiers here?

67
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,730
Yuan, give in.

68
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Zhou Shiyu,

69
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,970
I never expected

70
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
you would be the one

71
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,730
who stood in my way.

72
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,920
Actually, Brother

73
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,320
knew about your wild ambition a long time ago.

74
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,120
So,

75
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,470
His Majesty isn't as weak or gullible

76
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,850
as he appears to be.

77
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,920
If not,

78
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,880
how would you easily reveal your ambition?

79
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,030
The imperial guards also obey you, huh?

80
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,920
So, before,

81
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,820
they only pretended to obey me.

82
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,400
Zhou Shiyu,

83
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,530
you set such a big trap.

84
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,650
The Lord of the South colluded
with and the Prime Minister for rebellion

85
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,100
and faked a royal decree.

86
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,920
Take him down!

87
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,220
- Yes!
- Yes!

88
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,050
His Majesty is here.

89
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,170
I'm not dead.

90
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,400
Disappointed, huh?

91
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,630
Traitors outside the palace have surrendered.

92
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,350
If you give up now,

93
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,410
I can spare your lives.

94
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,320
You...

95
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,250
You lured me into your trap!

96
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,920
They've decided

97
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,290
to take action on your wedding day.

98
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,720
Liuzhou soldiers have been ambushing in town.

99
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,490
This time, we're prepared for anything.

100
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,720
We will finish off all these evil guys.

101
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,250
By then, we'll know

102
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,560
how everything turns out.

103
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,920
I will do my best.

104
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,650
Don't worry, Brother.

105
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,710
I trust you.

106
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,170
Some decoction again?

107
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,290
Yeah, Your Majesty.

108
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,080
You look energetic after drinking it.

109
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,170
I believe you will recover soon.

110
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,800
This decoction is too bitter to drink.

111
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,490
I don't want it.

112
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,440
His Majesty, even if you don't care for me,

113
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,370
could you please care

114
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,050
for the son I'm carrying?

115
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,010
Susu, are you saying you're pregnant?

116
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,600
The imperial physician checked on me.

117
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,650
I'm indeed pregnant.

118
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,530
I wanted to tell Your Majesty

119
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,720
this good news by myself.

120
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,530
So, he didn't report it to you.

121
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,770
This is great, Susu.

122
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,010
I'll have a son.

123
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,130
So,

124
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,800
Your Majesty should take care

125
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,370
and drink the decoction regularly.

126
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,440
Susu,

127
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,410
go get me my favorite book

128
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,440
Tricks of Governance.

129
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,300
(Respect this.)

131
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,100
(Respect this.)

132
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,130
I lost.

133
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,920
A guilty general like me

134
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,370
was deceived by the Prime Minister.

135
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,160
For the sake generations of my family
has guarded the border

136
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,490
and I've killed the Prime Minister,

137
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,170
please spare my life!

138
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,410
The late emperor ordered

139
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
your family should never stay
in the Capital City.

140
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,770
It has a profound meaning.

141
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,560
Turns out you didn't fully understand.

142
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
That's why you made such a big mistake.

143
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,720
Yueling!

144
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,090

Yueling.

146
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,200
Somebody! Go get a physician! Hurry!

147
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,130
Yueling, hang in there.

148
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,050
We won.

149
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,720
The imperial physician is coming.

150
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,290
Stay with me.

151
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,370
The future indicated in the pendants

152
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,410
has always been right.

153
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,490
It won't be.

154
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,010

190
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,800
I've decided

191
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,500
Dongyu people will
be treated equally in Beishuo.

192
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,840
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

193
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,660
(A few days later, The North Prince's Mansion)

194
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,770
Shiyu!

195
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,920
Shiyu!

196
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,640
Yueling!

197
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,840
Oh, you're back.

198
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,050
Yueling.

199
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,640
Your Highness.

200
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,840
Your Highness, did you

201
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,450
dream about Her Highness again?

202
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,530
You're not dead.

203
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,490
You're just asleep, right?

Xingyi, stop drinking.

225
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,970
Xingyi.

226
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,360
Father wrote to me,

227
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,970
asking me to take
Yueling's body back to Dongyu.

228
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,250
But Shiyu keeps her day and night,

229
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,640
letting no one touch her.

230
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,690
His Highness loves Yueling.

231
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,640
When we can't even accept

232
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,160
her death,

233
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,930
His Highness certainly can't

234
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,490
handle the truth.

235
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,970
Drink no more,

236
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,250
Xingyi.

237
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,080
I hear the North Prince refuses

238
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,490
to bury the Princess of Dongyu

239
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,160
and Her Grace looks ruddy

240
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,000
like a living woman.

241
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,120
It's now a tale of mystery.

242
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,840
- Your Highness.
- Yeah.

243
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,400
Your Highness, would you like
to check on the North Prince?

244
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
I don't want to go.

245
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,250
I don't want to compete.

246
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,480
I guess

247
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,730
Zhou Shiyu is very sad now.

248
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,120
Now, Your Highness

249
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,560
thinks of others.

250
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,240
This is nice.

251
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,490
Yeah. The two princes

252
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,400
start to look like brothers.

253
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,000
After all,

254
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,970
Zhou Shiyu kind of saved my life.

255
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,840
You'd better watch out for Yang Xu.

256
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,870
He has secret dealings with the Prime Minister.

257
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,050
What?

258
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,120
How's that possible?

259
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,840
Xu loves me.

260
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,050
- He's so nice to me.
- Zhixuan,

261
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,730
what are my benefits

262
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,880
of lying to you like this?

263
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,600
But he's been serving me for years.

264
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,690
Why would he betray me?

265
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,770
Maybe he's never been loyal to you.

266
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,320
Anyway, stay alert.

267
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,640
So, it's the North Prince

268
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,490
who found the problem of Butler Yang

269
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,530
and promptly reminded you.

270
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,210
We never knew he cared about you.

271
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,210
He's my younger brother.

272
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,730
Isn't it natural that he cares for me?

273
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,250
Your Highness, you're different

274
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,120
from what you used to be.

275
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,440
Indeed.

276
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,560
Before, every time His Highness

277
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,770
mentioned the North Prince...

278
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,610
Say no more.

279
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,160
I am no different.

280
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,010
You all leave me.

281
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,690
I want to stay alone.

282
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,610
Yes.

283
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,210
- Yes.
- Yes.

284
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,640
(I've competed for long.)

285
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,530
(What difference does a lineal identity make?)

286
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,690
(It's just the pride thing.)

287
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,840
(Hope Yueling can wake up soon)

288
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,730
(and live a good life with Shiyu.)

289
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,720
After all,

290
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,010
assisting His Majesty alone

291
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,730
is really hard for me.

292
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,660
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

293
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,400
Shiyu.

294
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,320
Shiyu!

295
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,440
Yueling.

296
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,400
I knew you would wake up.

297
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,250
Yueling.

298
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,970
Yueling,

299
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,320
we won't be apart again.

300
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,290
We won't.

301
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,850
Here, Your Grace.

302
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,490
Why is it raw?

303
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
That's right.

304
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,400
- May you have a baby soon.
- May you have a baby soon.

305
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,840
- Let's go out.
- Come on.

306
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,840
Yueling,

307
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,450
I'm not dreaming.

308
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,560
You're not.

309
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,770
Greetings, Brother.

310
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,610
Shiyu,

311
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,560
are you really going to Dongyu?

312
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,200
For one reason,

313
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,250
Yueling always wants to be free.

314
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,160
If she has to stay indoors,

315
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,490
she won't be happy.

316
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,490
For the other reason, I want to eliminate

317
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,800
Zhou Jingyuan's bad effects
on neighboring states

318
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,600
and totally solve the frontier conflicts.

319
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,930
Sadly, I don't have a son yet.

320
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,930
If only you can stay

321
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,050
and share my burden!

322
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,770
Brother, you're in good health.

323
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,800
You will have a lot of children.

324
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,360
And Lady Chen is going into labor.

325
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,080
According to the physician,

326
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,530
she'll have a son.

327
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,210
There are many ways to protect our state.

328
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,160
I've just chosen

329
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,050
to stabilize our border.

330
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,800
Shiyu, you have high ambitions.

331
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,450
Since you offer to put on your armor

332
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,840
and go to Dongyu to secure our border,

333
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,530
I'll have to approve.

334
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,290
I'll turn wars into peace.

335
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,640
I will do everything I can

336
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,290
for people of the two states.

337
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,080
When you return in triumph,

338
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,770
you and I

339
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,970
will enjoy our grand state together.

340
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,000
We will.

341
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,600
Take care, Brother.

342
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,530
Take care, Shiyu.

343
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,120
Stop running!

344
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,890
I'll catch you.

345
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:43,850
You can't catch me.

346
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,720
I'll catch you.

347
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,080
Come after me.

348
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,240
It's so adorable.

349
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,970
Eat some more.

350
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,370
Why do you come here every day?

351
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,530
Because I also want to play with Piggy.

352
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,720
Don't I, Piggy?

353
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,790
But I don't like you.

354
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Come less often.

355
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,040
Get it?

356
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,160
But I have nowhere else to go.

357
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,890
Please let me stay.

358
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,720
Then I can play with Piggy every day,

359
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,560
right?

360
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,850
Gao Luoyi, why do you still not recover?

361
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,010
You always stay here.

362
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,630
Go see Zhou Shiyu.

363
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,810
Who is Zhou Shiyu?

364
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,560
I only know you, Zhou Zhixuan.

365
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,080
How does it feel, Piggy?

366
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,200
You don't even remember Zhou Shiyu?

367
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,450
He's gone to the grassland for fun.

368
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,970
I don't care who he is.

369
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,560
I just want to play with Piggy.

370
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,120
Piggy, eat.

371
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,960
Eat more.

372
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,680
Luckily, you lost your memory.

373
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,160
So, Brother didn't blame you.

374
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,240
Look how voracious it is.

375
