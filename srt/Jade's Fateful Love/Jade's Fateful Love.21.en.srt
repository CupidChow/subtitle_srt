19
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,090
Your Grace, taste the almond cake.

20
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,450
I made it personally.

21
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,810
Your Grace, if you want to talk,

22
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,730
just get to the point.

23
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,050
Actually,

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,330
I shouldn't have come.

25
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,570
But anyway,

26
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,570
I met you several times

27
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,360
and got you out of the abandoned palace.

28
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,240
I think I should come.

29
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,240
The abandoned palace?

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,330
You opened the door for me?

31
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,480
The North Prince asked me
to secretly protect you.

32
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,170
Without a high position,

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,800
that was all I could do for you.

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,680
Thank you for helping me out.

35
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
You flatter me, Your Grace.

36
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,200
I was just entrusted.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,760
Your Grace, what are you

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
going to tell me?

39
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,570
These days,

40
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,130
you haven't seen the North Prince, right?

41
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,240
He's been very busy lately.

42
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,890
That is true.

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,760
But actually,

44
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,690
he's in some unspoken trouble.

45
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,960
What do you mean?

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,330
His Highness got
the letter of marriage from Dongyu.

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,800
First, he wanted to get you out.

48
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,240
Second, he wanted to show your father

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,800
his determination to marry you.

50
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,890
Third, he wanted peace in the world.

51
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,520
Your Grace, are you aware?

52
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,640
I am, of course.

53
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,330
He did a lot of things for me.

54
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,680
I will defend him.

55
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
That's not enough?

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,600
No.

57
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,800
You should leave him.

58
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,050
I know I shouldn't have said this.

59
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,330
Forgive me, Your Grace.

60
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,520
you must have the right reason

61
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,730
for saying this.

62
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,480
Please be clear.

63
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,760
The North Prince went to Dongyu twice,

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,640
risking his own life.

65
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,010
Who's actually behind this?

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,330
I'm sure you know.

67
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,760
In the marriage case,

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,330
the Prime Minister and his men were weakened.

69
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,050
But the political forces are struggling.

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,240
The Prime Minister is ambitious.

71
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,050
How will he just give up?

72
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,970
I'm afraid he'll take revenge hard.

73
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,970
Then how will His Majesty and His Highness

74
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,440
cope with that?

75
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,560
What's your opinion?

76
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,970
The political forces are divided.

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,240
His Majesty and the Prime Minister
nearly have the same power.

78
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,920
Now, the frontier commanders play a key role.

79
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,290
Among them,

80
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,730
the Lord of the South matters most.

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
The Lord of the South?

82
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,320
Princess Luoyi's brother?

83
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,320
Exactly.

84
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,920
His Majesty needs his help.

85
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,650
And he requested

86
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,410
to marry Princess Luoyi to the South Prince.

87
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,560
Our assassination in Dongyu failed.

88
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,120
Turns out Su Nian betrayed us.

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,770
Do you know

90
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,290
where she is now?

91
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,560
I don't know.

92
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,360
Since Su Nian took the mission,

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,290
she's been away
from the House of Romance.

94
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,320
Your mission is to supervise Su Nian.

95
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,240
But now you tell me
you don't know where she is!

96
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,610
I was negligent.

97
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,730
I thought without the antidote,

98
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,410
Su Nian would die of poison soon.

99
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,680
So, I stopped spying on her.

100
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,880
Bring her back,

101
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,650
dead or alive.

102
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,200
Yes.

103
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm it.

104
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,620
(To Yueling)

105
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,640
(Yueling,)

106
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,800
(Su Nian is missing.)

107
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,970
(I'm so worried.)

108
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
(I'm going to find her. I'll be back soon.)

109
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,610
(Don't worry.)

110
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,120
Actually, I'm jealous of you.

111
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,770
For what?

112
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
Someone will steal my husband.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,440
If a man cares so much for me

114
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,170
and does everything for me,

115
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,770
I'll die without regret.

116
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,770
Not at all, Your Grace.

117
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
In this case,

118
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,440
if the North Prince disapproves,

119
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,360
what will happen?

120
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,770
Something terrible.

121
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,050
His Majesty can't get back his power.

122
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,000
And his reign will be unstable.

123
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,680
The North Prince

124
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
will feel guilty all his life, too.

125
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,090
What storybook can be so attractive?

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,970
You didn't even notice me.

127
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,530
What are you doing here?

128
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,600
Are you saying

129
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,080
you don't want me to come?

130
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,560
Yueling.

131
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,850
Yueling.

132
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,320
You haven't been here for days.

133
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,650
Are you stuck in some trouble?

134
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,800
Trouble?

135
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,050
No.

136
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,650
But recently,

137
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,410
the West Market has been great in revenue.

138
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm carefully making future plans.

139
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,010
These things are complicated.

140
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,250
So, I was held up for some time.

141
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,440
Nothing bothers you?

142
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,050
Nothing.

143
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,250
Why do you ask?

144
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,720
Has His Majesty had

145
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,560
our stamped engagement letter to Dongyu?

146
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,320
When will the wedding be held?

147
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,080
Yueling, you're eager to marry me, huh?

148
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,130
You remind me.

149
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
I should rush His Majesty.

150
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,170
I don't mean that.

151
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,840
Fine. You don't.

152
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,720
Does anything amuse you lately?

153
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,080
No, nothing.

154
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,560
The other day, I visited the West Market.

155
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,610
Xingyi has left,

156
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,640
looking for Su Nian.

157
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,320
Don't worry. I'll send my men to find him

158
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,130
and secretly protect him.

159
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,250
He'll be safe.

160
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,850
Yueling, is something bothering you?

161
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,760
No.

162
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm done talking about me.

163
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,290
Let's talk about you.

164
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,130
In recent days,

165
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,600
has anything happened?

166
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,410
Just some political things.

167
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,490
You may get bored.

168
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,840
I want to listen.

169
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,840
What do you want to hear, then?

170
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,840
I'll tell you all that I know.

171
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,410
Let me think about it.

172
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,800
I hear the Lord of the South is powerful.

173
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,800
Is he very important in current politics?

174
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,440
He has commanded troops in the South for years.

175
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,370
His subordinates

176
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,370
were cultivated by his seniors.

177
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,320
When he was guarding the frontier,

178
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,050
in either an invasion case

179
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,680
or a provoking fight, he never failed.

180
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,420
He's indeed one of the best frontier generals.

181
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,650
He's also a great power we need

182
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,890
to fight the Prime Minister.

183
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,050
Which side is he on now?

184
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,800
He hasn't decided yet.

185
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,770
If his sister Princess Luoyi

186
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,080
marries someone on His Majesty's side,

187
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,370
this problem

188
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,770
will be readily solved, right?

189
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,970
Yueling,

190
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,320
did anyone tell you something?

191
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,640
Shiyu,

192
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,530
if you're stuck in a dilemma,

193
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,680
I want to share the burden with you.

194
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,410
If you don't want to tell me about it,

195
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,250
I believe you have your reason.

196
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,050
I just don't want you

197
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,050
to be restrained

198
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,920
by anyone or anything.

199
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,280
Anyone including me.

200
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,920
You can always choose what you want.

201
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,490
I'll support you and understand you.

202
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,040
All right.

203
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,920
Your Grace,

204
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,770
it's getting cold. Go to bed early.

205
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,800
Qianqian.

206
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,600
I haven't seen the full moon for a long time.

207
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,840
The fifteenth day is only a few days away.

208
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,920
By then, we can see the full moon.

209
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,010
Your Grace, I'll go make the bed.

210
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
(The moon still waxes or wanes.)

211
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,600
(If we can't end up together,)

212
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,530
(I'll only wish)

213
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,680
(for your safety.)

214
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,300
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

215
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,440
Recently, has Yueling

216
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,200
met someone?

217
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,440
Her Highness has been staying indoors.

218
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,770
The other day, she visited the West Market.

219
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,410
Anything suspicious?

220
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,600
On the West Market, Her Highness

221
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,250
ran into Lady Chen.

222
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,250
They talked for a while in her carriage.

223
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,840
Chen Susu?

224
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,460
(Nanfeng House)

225
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,530
We haven't met for days.

226
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,290
Mr. Perfect, your painting...

227
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,560
Fabulous.

228
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,200
Fabulous, indeed.

229
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,530
You flatter me, Your Grace.

230
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
It's modest of you, Mr. Perfect.

231
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,890
Your Grace, is something bothering you?

232
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,800
Tell me about it.

233
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,490
Maybe I can offer some help.

234
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,050
I do have one thing

235
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,320
to ask you.

236
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,760
Go ahead, please.

237
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,010
A good friend of mine

238
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,490
is engaged with the man she loves.

239
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,320
But because of family restrains,

240
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,840
that man

241
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,840
can't marry her.

242
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,130
Though my friend doesn't want to give up,

243
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,770
she won't make her man

244
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,170
get stuck in a dilemma.

245
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,080
What can she do

246
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,910
to make her beloved man give up

247
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,050
and leave her without worry?

248
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,080
You...

249
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,080
Your friend...

250
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,130
If she's worried about the engagement,

251
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,920
how about fighting fire with fire?

252
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,560
She can find another man

253
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,530
and get married before him

254
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,650
to make him give up.

255
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,490
In this case,

256
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,410
he won't hesitate for you.

257
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,010
Oh, no.

258
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,250
He won't...

259
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,370
He won't hesitate

260
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,210
for your friend.

261
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,180
Find another man?

262
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,720
It must be done very soon.

263
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,490
Better in a day or two.

264
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,320
What should I do?

265
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,650
In a day or two?

266
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,010
Such a hurry?

267
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
If you want a suitable man
in such a short time,

268
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,650
you'll have to inform everyone in town

269
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,640
and choose one from them.

270
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,160
Inform everyone?

271
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,300
We can't do that, can we?

272
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,690
Let's do this.

273
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,450
Since the decree isn't issued,

274
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,360
I'm not the North Princess Consort.

275
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,560
I'll inform everybody in town

276
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,360
and have all the regular-age men here

277
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,840
for me to review.

278
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,050
I'll recruit a husband in public.

279
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,260
(Benign and Benevolent)

280
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,640
Your Grace,

281
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,840
are you hesitating

282
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,290
for tomorrow's recruitment?

283
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,560
Your Grace, you always pretend

284
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,730
you don't care about anything.

285
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,840
Actually, you can't forget the North Prince.

286
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,160
In your heart,

287
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,400
you don't really want to recruit a husband,

288
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,240
do you?

289
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,600
Does that

290
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
even matter?

291
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,050
If I don't do something

292
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,770
to make people know he and I won't be together,

293
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,050
I guess he'll be further embarrassed.

294
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,320
Your Grace,

295
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,050
I understand.

296
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,800
But if someone really wins tomorrow,

297
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,210
what will we do?

298
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,010
You can't get a real husband, can you?

299
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,450
No one but him

300
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,010
can be my husband.

301
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,050
The North Prince is here.

302
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,050
Shiyu, you're just in time.

303
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,250
Here's a defective chess game

304
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,290
I don't know how to finish.

305
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,930
I don't think

306
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,840
I can play chess with you, Shan.

307
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,360
So, you're here

308
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,840
to tell me something, huh?

309
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,400
I'm here to explain about Luoyi and me.

310
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,250
You and Luoyi make a perfect couple.

311
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,880
If she can marry you,

312
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,190
I'll be relieved.

313
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,360
Luoyi and I have been cousins.

314
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,360
We were and we will be.

315
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,320
So, Shan, don't try so hard

316
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,640
to let Princess Yueling know about it.

317
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,050
Is this

318
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,210
what you're going to say?

319
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,210
I won't marry Luoyi.

320
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,050
But if I can keep you in the Capital City,

321
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,050
will I still get your support?

322
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,560
If you can do that,

323
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,450
I'll certainly support you.

324
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,640
Your Highness!

325
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,690
Good news, Your Highness. Good news.

326
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,090
Xu.

327
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,640
Look at my bottom.

328
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,330
What, Your Highness?

329
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,730
Rock solid, isn't it?

330
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,770
Rock solid, indeed.

331
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,080
What's the panic for?

332
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,160
Word came from Princess Yueling

333
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,130
of husband recruitment.

334
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,680
Recruit a husband?

335
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,600
Who will she get? Zhou Shiyu?

336
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,640
No.

337
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,770
Your Highness,

338
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,050
we don't know why,

339
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,530
but Princess Yueling suddenly claimed

340
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,490
she wouldn't marry him.

341
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,560
She's recruiting a husband.

342
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,800
Many young talents have gone there.

343
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,120
So, she just thought it all through.

344
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,770
Recruit a young talent?

345
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Isn't it just a hint for me?

346
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,490
That's right.

347
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,290
Your Highness, you're marvelous.

348
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,730
In this recruitment,

349
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,160
you will be the winner.

350
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,320
Besides, the tests are designed

351
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,930
by Mr. Qin.

352
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,800
Your victory is a sure thing.

353
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,880
Siyuan?

354
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,120
Then I'm bound to win.

355
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,880
Get me dressed.

356
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,970
With the best appearance,

357
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,690
I will marry Princess Yueling

358
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,080
and piss Zhou Shiyu off!

359
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,320
Piss him off!

360
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,970
- Let's go.
- Let's go, Your Highness.

361
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,210
I'm exhausted.

362
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,730
Ping'er, look.

363
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,360
How do I look in this dress,

364
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,010
compared to the Princess of Dongyu?

365
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,450
You're born elegant.

366
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,010
You look a hundred times better than her.

367
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,880
You're honey-tongued. You'll be rewarded.

368
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,880
Thank you, Your Grace. Oh, no.

369
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,730
Thank you, the North Princess Consort.

370
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,360
I'll take this one. And I'll pick some more.

371
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,200
All right.

372
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,080
So many dresses.

373
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,490
- What about this one?
- It's good, too.

374
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,770
When I reach the Princess's,

375
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,250
I'll do the best I can.

376
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,050
By then, don't blame me for winning.

377
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,360
You've never seen the Princess of Dongyu.

378
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,800
Isn't it too soon to tell?

379
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,800
If she's extremely hideous,

380
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,080
you'll have no time to regret it.

381
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,920
Ping'er,

382
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,880
what are they saying about the Princess?

383
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,720
Go ask around.

384
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,090
Yes.

385
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,530
The Princess of Dongyu?

386
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,360
Your Grace, I've got the information.

387
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Are you saying

388
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,490
the Princess of Dongyu is recruiting a husband?

389
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,530
Yes, Your Grace.

390
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,640
When she knows you'll marry the North Prince,

391
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,210
she's getting cold feet, I think.

392
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,050
Your Grace.

393
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,530
Shall we go have a look?

394
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,050
All right.

395
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,600
If she gets a good husband,

396
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,120
as the North Princess Consort,

397
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,360
I should congratulate her.

398
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,440
Let's go.

399
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,050
We've been waiting for a while.

400
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,840
Why has nobody come?

401
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,480
Qianqian,

402
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,050
did you get this around?

403
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,120
Yes.

404
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,600
Other servants and I

405
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,530
spread it this early this morning.

406
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,840
This is weird.

407
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,930
In this case,

408
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,690
why has nobody come?

409
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,210
Your Grace, let's just wait.

410
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,490
They don't come because they have poor taste.

411
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,250
But here I am.

412
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,400
Your Grace, he...

413
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,530
Gentlemen.

414
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,480
Gentlemen,

415
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,160
Her Grace has picked a husband.

416
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,120
Thank you for coming.

417
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,690
Here's some lucky money for you.

418
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,840
Take it and leave.

419
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,090
There you go.

420
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,800
So soon?

421
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,120
The recruitment is indeed competitive.

422
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,840
Her Grace looks fabulous.

423
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,800
It has to be fiercely competitive.

424
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,810
Here.

425
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:37,970
What a pity!

426
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,930
I had wanted to see Her Grace.

427
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,770
Take this.

428
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,290
Umm...

429
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,800
Sorry, sorry.

430
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,640
Sorry about that.

431
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,320
You're here for the recruitment?

432
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,640
Of course.

433
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,210
We... We want a young talent.

434
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,560
But Your Highness, you...

435
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,730
Talent?

436
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,450
That's just me, isn't it?

437
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,580
(Talent)

438
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,400
You're here alone.

439
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,930
Who can you compete with?

440
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,690
I think you fear I'd win, huh?

441
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,600
Let's get started, then.

442
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,360
There you go, Mr. Perfect.

443
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,160
In this case,

444
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,320
Your Highness will be

445
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,080
the first candidate.

446
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Come with me.

447
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,610
Wait for me.

448
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
(Arena)
Your Highness,

449
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,120
there are three parts of the recruitment,

450
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,400
the literary test, the martial test,

451
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,450
and the final test by Her Grace.

452
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,930
I have a talent of literary and martial arts.

453
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,120
Mr. Siyuan, test me now.

454
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,010
The mountain remains towering,

455
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,490
but snow covers it.

456
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,450
The water remains still,

457
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,210
but the wind ruffles it.

458
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,330
Nice!

459
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,770
Great.

460
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,080
He answered so smoothly?

461
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,930
Since when was His Highness so knowledgeable?

462
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,160
Mr. Perfect,

463
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,970
is that a good answer?

464
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,930
Mountain to water,

465
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
towering to still, snow to water,

466
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,050
and cover to ruffle.

467
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,570
Perfect match.

468
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,800
More than that.

469
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,450
It has an artistic conception, too.

470
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,690
Your Grace, what is she doing here?

471
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,400
This recruitment

472
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,160
isn't something shameful.

473
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,970
Why can't I be here?

474
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,240
Gao Luoyi,

475
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,250
it's the first time

476
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,690
I think you have good taste.

477
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,610
I also start to think

478
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,560
you're civilized.

479
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,680
Come on.

480
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:44,890
Your Highness.

481
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,210
Your Highness, you're finally out.

482
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,690
The anxiety is nearly killing me.

483
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,730
What happened?

484
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,970
Her Highness is recruiting a husband at home.

485
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,450
What did you say?

486
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,960
Recruiting a husband?

487
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,970
Your Highness, you passed

488
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,560
the literary test.

489
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,490
Prepare for the following martial test.

490
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,810
Yang Xu.

491
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,210
Come on, Your Highness.

492
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,130
Come on, Your Highness.

493
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,850
Come on.

494
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,440
Your Highness,

495
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,450
you'd better give up.

496
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,600
If he hurts you by accident,

497
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,800
I won't be responsible.

498
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,930
He doesn't look strong.

499
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,640
I'd fear I would hurt him.

500
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,320
Yang Xu, do something.

501
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,530
Your Highness,

502
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,640
pick a weapon you want.

503
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,640
Come on.

504
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,770
Bring it on.

505
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,770
No offense.

506
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,930
You have some strength.

507
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,240
Your Highness.

508
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,560
Make a move, Your Highness.

509
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,050
Go ahead, Your Highness.

510
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,450
I just let him get me.

511
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,370
- Beat him, Your Highness.
- Again.

512
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,290
Your Highness, give it up.

513
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,970
Don't try to be strong or get hurt.

514
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,490
Zhixuan, try harder.

515
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,330
Come on.

516
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,800
I can continue!

517
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
How dare you punch me!

518
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,880
My eyes...

519
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,850
- Come on!
- My eyes.

520
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,890
Punch me, huh?

521
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,970
Oh, my eyes!

522
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,810
How dare you!

523
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,530
I said you were no match for me, huh?

524
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,730
The South Prince won!

525
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,730
His Highness won.

526
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,770
His Highness won.

527
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,080
Brilliant, Your Highness.

528
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,160
In this case,

529
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,250
I'll let you win.

530
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,210
He used a dirty trick. How could he win?

531
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,940
(Talent)

532
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,530
Why are you here?

533
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,600
You should be in the palace.

534
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,080
I didn't dare to linger in the palace.

535
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,560
If I came later,

536
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,930
my wife would be stolen.

537
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,930
She's recruiting a husband.

538
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,400
Shiyu, don't see her as your wife.

539
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,730
What dirty trick did I use?

540
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,840
You must be jealous of me.

541
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,290
Not really.

542
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,160
(Talent)
You're awesome, Zhixuan.

543
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,770
But without a rival,

544
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,320
you're kind of lonely.

545
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,160
Do you dare to compete with me?

546
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,810
Shiyu.

547
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,000
All right.

548
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,640
Let's compete, then.

549
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,130
No way.

550
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,320
This is a public recruitment.

551
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,970
Everybody should be equal.

552
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,770
Will you only stop me?

553
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,730
Your Highness, come this way.

554
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,880
Her Grace set the last test by herself.

555
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,160
Here it goes.

556
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,930
I love the most beautiful place in the world.

557
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,330
What is this place?

558
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,160
Beishuo is beautiful everywhere.

559
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,600
But I guess

560
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,450
your favorite place

561
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,010
is the grassland of Dongyu.

562
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,050
It's the pond under a cliff.

563
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,380
(Pond)

564
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,290
The North Prince is correct.

565
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,970
Shiyu.

566
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,370
He gave the right answer.

567
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,080
But that's merely one question.

568
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,850
He won't win unless he passes three questions.

569
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,560
Your Grace, go on, please.

570
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,010
What's the most expensive pastry in the world?

571
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,530
I know.

572
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,850
The Snowflake Pastry in the palace.

573
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,970
It's the tea cake.

574
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,490
Am I wrong again?

575
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,780
(Tea Cake)

576
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,170
Your Grace,

577
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,680
you have the last question.

578
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,410
Zhixuan, you...

579
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,680
There's something I treasure most

580
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,080
and it sticks even when I'm dying.

581
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
What is it?

582
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,050
In a life-threatening situation,

583
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,240
what can be more important than money?

584
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,310
The jade you wear.

585
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,700
(Jade)

586
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,680
Since the North Prince
has all the correct answers,

587
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,400
the winner will be...

588
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,620
Wait a minute.

589
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,360
I won two rounds while he won only one.

590
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,970
How does it count? It doesn't count.

591
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,600
Yeah. I'm the witness.

592
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,850
The South Prince won.

593
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,370
The North Prince won, actually.

594
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,200
He's exactly the man

595
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,560
who knows Her Grace perfectly.

596
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,400
Siyuan.

597
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,330
Siyuan, say something.

598
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,330
Well...

599
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,970
Her Grace is the one to choose.

600
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,120
You answered all the questions correctly.

601
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,560
It's indeed...

602
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,850
Here is the Royal Decree.

603
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,900
Oh, you're all here.

604
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,460
I'm just in time.

605
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,900
North Prince and Princess Yueling, listen.

606
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,540
Here is the decree of His Majesty.

607
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,580
"I hear Ashina Yueling, the Princess of Dongyu,

608
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,180
is virtuous, gentle, kind,

609
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,500
(Royal Decree)
and gorgeous.

610
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,940
She makes a perfect couple
with the North Prince.

611
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,620
I'd like to make peace
with the Emperor of Dongyu for generations.

612
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,580
So, I hereby get them engaged.

613
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,260
Their wedding will be done

614
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,060
by the Ministry of Rites
and the Bureau of Astronomy.

615
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,820
On the fifteenth day of next month."

616
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,340
Respect this.

617
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,460
With pleasure, Your Majesty.

618
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,340
With pleasure, Your Majesty.

619
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,540
You may rise, Your Highness.

620
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,340
Congratulations, Your Highnesses.

621
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,740
Everybody,

622
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,980
