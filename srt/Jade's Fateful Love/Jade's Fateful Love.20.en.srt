it's the Lord
of the South garrisoning the South.

23
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,200
Yeah. What's going on?

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,850
Generals have been coming back
from different places.

25
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,640
Something big seems to happen.

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,570
I heard the court would start a war
against Dongyu.

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,960
Is that true?

28
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,760
Looks like our good days will be over.

29
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,050
Yeah.

30
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,960
- Start a war.
- Indeed.

31
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,610
Silence, everybody.

32
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,010
Silence!

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,130
Silence!

34
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,730
His Majesty has something to say.

35
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,130
About the war against Dongyu,

36
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,960
we need to give it further thought.

37
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,690
Your Majesty,

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,680
all the generals have been summoned back.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,360
Should we put the war against Dongyu

40
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,240
on the agenda?

41
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,920
Yeah, Your Majesty.

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,520
Dongyu deceived us.

43
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,410
Now, the North Prince has been killed by them.

44
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,890
Generals like us really can't bear it anymore.

45
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,330
We will be the vanguard

46
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,570
- to destroy Dongyu, Your Majesty.
- Exactly.

47
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,170
- Destroy Dongyu!
- Destroy Dongyu!

48
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,200
His Majesty said he didn't want a war.

49
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,410
Why are you guys so stubborn?

50
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,130
Your Highness,

51
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,360
this is a state affair.

52
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,200
Stay out of this, will you?

53
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,690
Your Majesty,

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,890
the generals have come all the way here.

55
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,480
They want to make military contributions

56
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,080
for you, Your Majesty.

57
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,640
Your Majesty, Prime Minister is wrong.

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,200
We just went through a famine.

59
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,330
Now, we should recuperate.

60
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,970
We can't start a war so casually.

61
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
If we really do,

62
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,610
I'm afraid our state will be in big trouble.

63
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,650
You don't know anything! Don't be so dramatic!

64
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,530
Will we just bear this?

65
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,560
- Yeah.
- We can't bear it.

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,400
That's right.

67
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,810
Your Majesty,

68
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,360
all the generals are ready to fight.

69
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,480
If we don't fight Dongyu now,

70
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,850
we'll be a joke of the world!

71
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,210
Not to mention Dongyu,

72
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,800
even other small states will bully us.

73
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,090
Yeah. Prime Minister has a point.

74
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:45,970
Indeed.

75
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,440
It's the best time to fight against Dongyu.

76
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,640
That's right.

77
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,970
We'll kill the Princess of Dongyu first.

78
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,770
A small state like Dongyu

79
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,000
is no match for us.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,480
- Yeah.
- That's right.

81
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,440
Your Majesty,

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,050
give a decree.

83
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,050
Otherwise,

84
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,800
you'll really be a joke.

85
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
Shiyu was killed in Dongyu.

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,360
What are you waiting for?

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,730
Your Majesty, please give a decree!

88
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,680
Your Majesty, please give a decree!

89
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,320
Your Majesty, please give a decree!

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,120
Your Majesty, please give a decree!

91
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,320
Somebody.

92
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,530
Declare the decree.

93
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,650
Are you forcing His Majesty to give a decree?

94
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,770
- The North Prince?
- It's really him.

95
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,920
Isn't he dead?

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,000
He isn't dead.

97
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,770
He... He isn't dead.

98
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,360
- Shiyu!
- His Highness isn't dead.

99
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,850
- That's great.
- He's alive.

100
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,800
It's really the North Prince.

101
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,650
Isn't he supposed to be dead?

102
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,970
What is going on here?

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,770
Uncle, you must be disappointed
to see me alive, huh?

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,610
Greetings, Your Majesty.

105
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,610
Shiyu, get up.

106
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,050
Thanks, Your Majesty.

107
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,730
I'm relieved to see you alive.

108
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,850
Sorry to keep you worried.

109
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,870
You may rise.

110
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
I went to Dongyu for the letter of marriage.

111
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,050
This trip was dangerous.

112
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,880
I also didn't expect

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
I could come back alive

114
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,170
and brought back the letter of marriage.

115
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,000
Please review it, Brother.

116
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,180
(Letter of Marriage Between Beishuo and Dongyu)

117
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,240
The Emperor of Dongyu

118
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,050
will not only pay tribute every year

119
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,850
but also offer their special horses to us.

120
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,530
Such a big offer

121
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,120
proves the baseborn princess

122
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,290
is also a beloved daughter.

123
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,240
A baseborn princess gets us such a big offer.

124
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,120
You all underestimated her, huh?

125
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,480
Dongyu people never care
about the lineal identity.

126
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,730
Their emperor

127
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,210
values his children equally.

128
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,090
He even spoils his young daughter.

129
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,410
During our conversation, I could feel

130
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,290
how much he loved Princess Yueling.

131
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,850
The marriage thing has been precarious.

132
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,410
But it now seems

133
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,800
to be a heaven-sent destiny.

134
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,170
In this case,

135
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,800
I think we'll give up

136
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,170
sending our army to Dongyu.

137
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,370
No way!

138
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,290
Your Majesty, the generals came with loyalty.

139
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,530
If you send them away now,

140
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,240
won't you be making fun of them?

141
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,800
Before we decided what to do with Dongyu,

142
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,880
you hurriedly invited the generals

143
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,050
to the Capital City.

144
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,360
Did you do that

145
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,290
to show Dongyu people

146
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,360
we wanted to fight them

147
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,440
and get me killed there?

148
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,050
Shiyu, what are you talking about?

149
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,610
Dongyu deceived us first.

150
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,920
We couldn't just sit around doing nothing.

151
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,800
Uncle, I'd like to ask you.

152
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,240
You promised to give me one month,

153
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,610
but later you summoned the generals.

154
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Didn't you do this

155
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,290
because you were eager to send an army

156
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,800
and start a war?

157
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,440
Mind your language, Shiyu.

158
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,920
A wrong accusation

159
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,530
is too much for me.

160
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,920
Forgive me, Uncle.

161
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,850
I had a narrow escape

162
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,120
back to the Capital City,

163
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,320
only to witness such a stressful scene.

164
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,410
I can't help feeling worried.

165
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,240
Actually, it doesn't matter if I'm dead.

166
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,800
But once the war is started,

167
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,650
the two states will be in chaos.

168
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,650
About the stakes,

169
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,890
I guess you know much better than I do.

170
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,370
His Highness has a point.

171
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,410
Since the misunderstanding is cleared up,

172
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,440
we'd better make peace with Dongyu.

173
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,170
Think it over, Your Majesty.

174
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,250
If we let go of Dongyu so easily,

175
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,320
I'm afraid some other states
will think less of us.

176
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,290
Our frontier soldiers
will also be disappointed.

177
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,370
The Lord of the South,
you've garrisoned the frontier.

178
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,250
What do you think?

179
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,560
Your Majesty,

180
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,250
I am a general.

181
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,080
It is my duty to garrison the frontier.

182
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,410
As for the war thing,

183
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,080
I take orders from Your Majesty.

184
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,200
A war wastes both energy and money.
I don't want it, either.

185
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,080
But if we have to fight,

186
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,890
I will do my best.

187
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,970
I guess

188
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,770
other frontier generals think the same way.

189
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,010
Uncle, you're overthinking.

190
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,370
Everybody, you've see

191
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,050
the big offer from Dongyu.

192
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,170
If we still don't let it go,

193
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,170
we'll be narrow-minded.

194
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,920
I think I'll pick another wedding day for them.

195
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,010
Your Majesty,

196
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,410
the generals came with loyalty.

197
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,840
How could they leave without anything?

198
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,410
Speaking of this,

199
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,320
the generals

200
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,890
indeed traveled a long way here.

201
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,890
I feel quite sorry.

202
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,170
Prime Minister, since you empathize with them

203
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,680
and it's you who summoned them,

204
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,200
please send them back on my behalf

205
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,920
and placate them.

206
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,050
Thank you, Your Majesty.

207
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,280
Xingyi, are you all right?

208
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,610
I'm fine.

209
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,490
Glad you're fine.

210
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,890
Yueling.

211
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,130
Shiyu...

212
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,250
His Highness is fine.

213
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,650
He was just injured.

214
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,560
Now, he has recovered.

215
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,130
Injured?

216
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,490
- Yeah.
- He isn't dead?

217
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,330
No.

218
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,410
He isn't dead.

219
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,370
He isn't.

220
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,200
Shiyu isn't dead.

221
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,080
I was freaked out.

222
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,800
He isn't dead.

223
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,130
What did you just say?

224
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,770
He was injured, huh?

225
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,920
Where's the injury? Is it serious?

226
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,250
Yueling, don't worry.

227
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,370
He's reporting in the palace.

228
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,800
He's totally all right.

229
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,530
You'll meet him soon.

230
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,080
Then why was there a message

231
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,530
that he died?

232
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,720
Never mind.

233
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,960
Yueling, I have some good news.

234
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,800
Come with me.

235
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,050
Come on. Be seated.

236
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,680
Yueling,

237
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,840
Father got back Du Er and Zhu.

238
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Seeing through your faked letter,

239
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,410
he sent someone to get them back.

240
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,680
Oh.

241
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,440
Now, Zhu is pregnant.

242
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,410
Father cares so much about the baby.

243
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,080
He didn't mean to blame anyone.

244
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,130
And when I was back there,

245
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,560
I handled a lot of things.

246
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
The trip was worth it.

247
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,010
- Father didn't blame anyone?
- No.

248
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,410
That's good.

249
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,130
Oh,

250
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,130
on your way back,

251
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,650
what exactly happened?

252
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,050
Why were you assassinated?

253
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,010
On our way back...

254
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,200
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

255
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,840
Look, Shiyu and I are back.

256
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,680
Right?

257
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,680
Oh,

258
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,130
Father and Zhu miss you very much.

259
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,320
They asked me to bring you the letters.

260
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,540
(To Yueling)

261
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,050
You read them.

262
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,530
I... I should go.

263
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,320
I have something to do.

264
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,490
(Yueling,)

265
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,290
(you always keep me worried.)

266
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,530
(Who allowed you to go to Beishuo?)

267
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,960
(Don't you know we would be worried?)

268
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,170
(You went there, fine.)

269
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,890
(But you were bullied like that.)

270
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,890
(You really disgraced your father.)

271
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,440
(One more thing.)

272
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,440
(After you marry the North Prince,)

273
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,920
(you must come back to the grassland.)

274
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,370
(Otherwise, I'll lead the troops)

275
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,770
(to get you back from Beishuo.)

276
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,650
(Keep it in mind.)

277
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,840
You sound so loud, Father.

278
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,560
You must be very healthy.

279
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,090
(Yueling,)

280
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,290
(long time no see.)

281
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,920
(How's everything going with you?)

282
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,320
(Sorry I didn't protect you.)

283
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,770
(You went to Beishuo on my behalf
and suffered really a lot.)

284
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,960
(Luckily, the North Prince loves you.)

285
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,130
(With his love and protection,)

286
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,530
(Father and I will be relieved.)

287
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,560
(Father must have blamed you in his letter.)

288
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,840
(But actually, he cares about you.)

289
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,890
(He must be too shy to tell you
how much he worries about you.)

290
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,680
(But you have to know.)

291
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,170
(We both want you to live a happy life)

292
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,600
(and come back early.)

293
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,410
(Father, Zhu,)

294
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,530
(rest assured.)

295
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,770
(I'll take good care of myself)

296
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,600
(and go back to you as soon as I can.)

297
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,600
- I'll go see Yueling.
- Shiyu.

298
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,760
Shiyu,

299
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,440
knowing you died,

300
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,720
I was so worried.

301
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,010
I couldn't believe it.

302
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,840
The other day, I went
to the temple for praying.

303
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,440
I'm so happy

304
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,720
to see you alive.

305
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm fine. Thanks for caring, Luoyi.

306
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,130
I knew you would be a survivor.

307
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,170
Shiyu, go back with me.

308
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,200
My brother is back.

309
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,320
How about I cook for you

310
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,960
when you can drink and talk?

311
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,170
I should visit Cousin when he's back.

312
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,960
But I have something important to do.

313
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,210
You go back.

314
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,370
- Shiyu.
- Prime Minister.

315
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,210
Shiyu!

316
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,050
The generals are back to their mansions.

317
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,490
But they complain a lot.

318
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,050
I guess you have to console them.

319
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,960
Why is Zhou Shiyu still alive?

320
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,490
What on earth went wrong?

321
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,280
Go check it out.

322
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,680
Yes.

323
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,360

Why are you back so early?

330
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,600
I rushed back immediately
in case you were worried.

331
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,290
What? Want to burn another talisman for me?

332
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,840
After I'm done with this embroidery,

333
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,050
I'll put a talisman in it and give it to you.

334
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,370
It'll keep you safe, then.

335

You're my talisman, aren't you?

what happened to you and Xingyi in Dongyu?

343
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,050
Xingyi came just now,

344
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,730
but he didn't say anything.

345
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,650

Don't you think

351
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,600
she looks familiar?

352
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,290
I'll send a message, saying

353
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,530
the North Prince is dead.

354
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,130
Thanks.

355
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,640
Su Nian? It's really you!

356
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,370
So, it's Su Nian?

357
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,770
I've had my men investigate her.

358
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,450
She's indeed from the Roufeng Sect.

359
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:12,970
Roufeng Sect?

360
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,050
I didn't expect her to stay undercover

361
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,250
for such a long time.

362
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,720
Oh.

363
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,640
She saved you when you were in danger.

364
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,600
Back in the Capital City,

365
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,330
will she be in danger?

366
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,210
Don't worry.

367
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,050
I'll have my men track her.

368
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,250
It's the hour of Hai.

369
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,730
Why hasn't His Highness come out yet?

370
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,880
What if his mansion is closed later?

371
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,690
Dumb head,

372
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,770
don't you understand?

373
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,880
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

374
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,930
His Highness and Her Grace

375
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,600
- haven't met for a long time.
- Grow fonder?

376
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,210
They certainly need more time.

377
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,250
I'll go ask if His Highness
will go home tonight.

378
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,530
Come back.

379
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,960
Come closer.

380
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,920
Come.

381
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,450
Don't ask him.

382
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,490
It hurts.

383
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,360
His Highness decides if he'll stay.

384
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,160
Don't disturb them.

385
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, it hurts.

386
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,880
Qianqian.

387
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,880
Qianqian, let go of my ear.

388
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,880
I'm just thinking of His Highness.

389
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,250
Oh, speaking of their wedding.

390
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,490
when will His Majesty give a decree?

391
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,600
I don't know.

392
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,930
Soon, I guess.

393
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,800
Is Her Grace the North Princess Consort?

394
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,160
Umm...

395
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,120
Umm...

396
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,490
Tell me.

397
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,610
Umm,

398
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,560
I guess so.

399
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,090
You guess?

400
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,770
You suppose so?

401
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,530
His Majesty had Her Grace and me

402
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,800
moved out of His Highness's mansion.

403
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,880
You only guessed?

404
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,530
You...

405
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
I'm so pissed off.

406
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,960
I...

407
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,160
How did I upset you again?

408
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,320
I said it right.

409
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,010
- No.
- You can move back.

410
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,320
- Go away.
- Why?

411
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,740

412
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,970

414

00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,160

(Deqing Hall)

433
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,080
This time,

434
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,010
we frustrated Uncle

435
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
in the court.

436
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,640
But he will not let it go.

437
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,730
I guess he'll make trouble again.

438
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,600
I took the throne at a young age.

439
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,730
So, I had to rely on Uncle.

440
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,290
I pretended to be weak
and made him Prime Minister

441
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,930
to control the ministers.

442
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,050
Sadly,

443
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,400
everything ends up like this.

444
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,690
Don't blame yourself, Brother.

445
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,530
Everything is different than it used to be.

446
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,010
Some important ministers
have paid allegiance to you.

447
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,880
Some other ministers have a wobbler, too.

448
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,250
Even Uncle

449
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,210
doesn't dare to make a rash move.

450
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,690
If we have to fight Uncle one day,

451
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,690
we should do early deployment in Liuzhou.

452
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,360
In today's case,

453
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,250
someone holds the key.

454
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,080
Do you mean

455
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,400
the Lord of the South?

456
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,480
Exactly.

457
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,450
Generals take orders from Uncle.

458
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,050
Over the years, Gao Yuan
has commanded troops in the South.

459
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,320
Among the generals, he's the most prestigious.

460
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,160
If he supports me,

461
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,800
we'll stand a better chance.

462
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,250
But the late emperor ordered

463
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,840
the Gao Family
shouldn't stay in the Capital City.

464
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,290
In case they rebel with their troops.

465
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,450
We can find out what he thinks

466
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,840
before we have a plan.

467
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,770
What's so good about that Dongyu woman?

468
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,840
Why does Shiyu keep breaking my heart?

469
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,690
Don't worry, Your Grace.

470
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,250
His Majesty hasn't made them a couple yet.

471
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,450
But Shiyu is bent on marrying her.

472
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,930
It's just a matter of time.

473
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,690
Ping'er, I don't want this.

474
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,560
I just don't.

475
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,160
Your Grace, you can't drink more.

476
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,930
What's wrong, Luoyi?

477
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,770
Who bullied my sister?

478
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,050
Brother, take me away.

479
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,730
Away from this sad city.

480
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,400
Luoyi,

481
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,730
I want to take you away.

482
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,800
But it's the destiny of our family.

483
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,210
Only when you stay in the Capital City

484
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
can they be satisfied with me.

485
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:10,850
Brother,

486
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,770
don't go, will you?

487
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,680
Then...

488
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,050
Then,

489
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,880
no one will dare to bully me.

490
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,050
Brother.

491
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,570
Luoyi,

492
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,800
when I'm back here,

493
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,730
I'm not leaving again.

494
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,880
Really?

495
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,290
Brother.

496
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
During your trip, I guess

497
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,840
someone wants to get you killed.

498
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,210
Will you really go?

499
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,530
The Lord of the South is now here

500
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,160
who has the biggest army.

501
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,930
Why would I turn against them?

502
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,360
I'll let them get what they want.

503
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,770
When the generals and I go out of town,

504
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,800
we'll discuss a plan.

505
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,490
When the emperor is far away.

506
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,490
It's wise of you, Prime Minister.

507
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,890
But sadly,

508
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,930
I guess the Lord of the South

509
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,010
will take His Majesty's side.

510
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,210
No one from the Gao Family

511
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,970
can be underestimated.

512
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,930
Keep a close eye on them

513
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,490
and take action accordingly.

514
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,960
I get it.

515
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,400
I'll leave you in charge

516
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,450
of affairs in the Capital City.

517
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,770
Yes.

518
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,800
I will

519
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,880
come back.

520
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,290
All dishes are served.

521
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,680
Let's eat.

522
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,640
Why do you not eat?

523
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,050
You come here every day.

524
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,600
Ignorant people will think

525
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,970
it's your own mansion.

526
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,080
Tired of seeing me after only a few days?

527
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,490
Then after you marry me,

528
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,800
will you even kick me out?

529
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,730
That's not what I mean.

530
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,560
Come on. Eat more.

531
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,970
You ate very little these days.

532
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,930
You've been thin.

533
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,290
Some time ago, you gave me

534
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,530
quite a lot of healthy food.

535
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,010
I've eaten my weight in it.

536
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,480
I can't stand it.

537
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,320
Why is the rice so sweet?

538
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,400
I'm done eating.

539
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
No appetite.

540
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,330
Way too sweet?

541
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,960
Only a little bit.

542
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,460
(The House of Romance)

543
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,080
(How shall I get along with Su Nian?)

544
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,930
(She's that assassin.)

545
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,930
(But she also saved my life.)

546
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,610
Su Nian.

547
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,640
I'm in the right place.

548
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,320
Su Nian, Su Nian!

549
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,320
Greetings, gentleman.

550
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,880
My name is Mujin.

551
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,360
Mujin?

552
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,890
Where's Su Nian?

553
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,050
Isn't this her room?

554
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,250
I don't know who you are talking about.

555
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,640
But I also sing and dance very well.

556
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,120
Why don't you stay and enjoy?

557
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,600
No need. Farewell.

558
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,440
Hey, gentleman.

559
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,320
Do come often, gentleman.

560
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,600
I will.

561
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,120
Excuse me, Madam Sang.
I have something to ask you.

562
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,840
May I talk to you for a second?

563
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,360
I want to see Su Nian.

564
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,250
Can you set me up on that?

565
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,970
I can't.

566
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,440
Why?

567
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,690
You have no idea, huh?

568
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,080
Miss Su Nian was the past.

569
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,560
Miss Mujin is the best lady now.

570
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,770
Speaking of Miss Mujin,

571
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,250
she's amazing.

572
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,930
We'll talk another day.

573
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:45,770
All right.

574
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,120
That's right, gentleman.

575
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,450
Why don't you enjoy our new lady,

576
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,320
Miss Mujin?

577
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,640
But her schedule is full
till the middle of the month.

578
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,730
I'm asking about Su Nian.

579
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,570
Where is she?

580
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,160
She has gone back to her hometown.

581
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,400
What about Lingxi?

582
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,010
She's gone.

583
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,360
Gentleman, don't go.

584
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,060
(We should take military precautions
in case of a war.)

585
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,140
(Memorial to the Throne)

586
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,770
In all these memorials,

587
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,400
they request a war renegotiation.

588
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,490
Prime Minister took a beating.

589
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,120
But he hasn't stopped his schemes.

590
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,290
I guess he'll find another chance

591
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,600
to bring up the war thing again.

592
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,050
Since he is so passionate about war,

593
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,050
I'll play against him someday.

594
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,010
In my opinion,

595
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,080
the Prime Minister may have

596
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,120
a bigger ambition.

597
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,330
Over all these years,

598
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,600
Prime Minister has been drawing over forces.

599
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,320
He's been ambitious for a long time.

600
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,770
I don't think we can stop him.

601
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,690
Forming a clique is terrible.

602
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,320
As a general,

603
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,360
I focus on military tactics only.

604
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,530
If we can strike first

605
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,930
and take him down in one stroke,

606
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,600
we're also likely to win.

607
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,450
Are you saying...?

608
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,320
Your Majesty, I can be your vanguard

609
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,320
to kill the treacherous minister.

610
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,250
But I have a wish.

611
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,160
Hope you can satisfy me.

612
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,130
Tell me.

613
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,640
My sister has adored
the North Prince for years.

614
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,530
Please give her what she wants.

615
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,690
If my sister can marry a prince,

616
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,290
my family

617
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,970
will give our all to help you.

618
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,240
Your Highness.

619
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,130
What happened?

620
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,200
Your Highness...

621
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,050
Shiyu,

622
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,450
the Lord of the South

623
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,360
insists that Princess Luoyi should marry you.

624
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,450
It gives me a real headache.

625
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,490
He just wants to see

626
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,770
how sincere we are.

627
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,250
But Princess Luoyi...

628
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,090
I won't marry her.

629
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,490
If it can't be properly solved,

630
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,010
we may push Gao Yuan

631
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,770
to the Prime Minister's side.

632
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,640
We need a perfect plan.

633
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,160
Oh, my earring.

634
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,010
Where is it?

635
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,280
It was here just now.

636
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,720
Maybe I dropped it in the Imperial Garden

637
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,890
when I was there.

638
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,330
I'll go look for it.

639
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,050
Please wait here for me, Your Grace.

640
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,200
Have you lost something, Your Grace?

641
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,280
How may I help you?

642
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,240
Your Lordship, you're strong and thoughtful.

643
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,410
But what I've lost is a heart.

644
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,120
I wonder if I can get it back.

645
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,200
Don't be kidding, Your Grace.

646
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,770
The heart

647
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,010
sticks where it wants to be.

648
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,890
How would it be easily lost?

649
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,850
I've done

650
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,600
all that I can for you.

651
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,810
I know.

652
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,410
You've had a hard time.

653
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,640
A life in the palace is secluded.

654
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,720
I can't see my love anymore.

655
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,280
I've lived a good life.

656
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,490
Don't worry, Your Lordship.

657
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,050
I'm glad

658
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,650
to know that.

659
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,160
Your Grace, shall we eat?

660
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,050
The dishes are cold.

661
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,640
His Highness hasn't come?

662
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,800
He hasn't been here for two days.

663
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,080
Your Grace, how about we visit him

664
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,330
at his mansion?

665
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,370
- All right.
- Go.

666
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,760
What's wrong, Your Grace?

667
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,530
Think about it.

668
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,010
Is it inappropriate?

669
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,720
People may think

670
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:55,600
I'm eager to marry him.

671
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,810
It's thoughtful of you, Your Grace.

672
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:04,080
How about I go get some information?

673
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,410
- Good idea.
- All right.

674
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,250
Your Grace, have something to eat.

675
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,370
I have no appetite. Take them away.

676
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:26,770
Your Grace.

677
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,970
What happened, Luoyi?

678
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,040
It's all right.

679
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
Why do you not eat?

680
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,160
If the dishes don't taste good,

681
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,600
have some new dishes.

682
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,530
That's not the case.

683
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,810
If you don't keep healthy,

684
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,680
when you get married,

685
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,850
you'll look terrible.

686
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,920
Get married?

687
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,290
With whom?

688
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,490
Is it Shiyu?

689
00:37:58,930 --> 00:37:59,930
You look so happy.

690
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,240
Sit down and eat something.

691
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,930
I requested His Majesty.

692
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,160
He'll approved soon.

693
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,690
Brother.

694
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,410
Thank you, Brother.

695
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,050
You're always the best to me.

696
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,280
You care for me most,

697
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,650
Brother.

698
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,450
What happened to His Highness?

699
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,530
He locks himself in the study

700
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,850
without eating anything.

701
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,480
That won't do.

702
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,560
I'll go tell Her Highness.

703
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,330
Your Highness, where are you going?

704
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,330
To see Her Highness?

705
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,600
I'm going to the palace.

706
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,560
The palace?

707
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,170
Your Highness.

708
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,770
Umm...

709
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,720
Your Grace, don't overthink.

710
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,080
I asked Linmu.

711
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,200
His Highness has just been too busy.

712
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,410
But he keeps caring about you.

713
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,280
Dark guards are also protecting you around.

714
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,160
I don't know why,

715
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:06,530
but I feel uneasy.

716
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,080
You're here, Your Grace.

717
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,970
Let me make you some shish kebab.

718
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,280
All right. Thank you, sir.

719
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,080
How's your business coming along?

720
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,370
Since the new policy was issued,

721
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,280
business has been good.

722
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,330
Thanks to Your Grace and His Highness.

723
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,490
Glad to know business is good.

724
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,330
That's right.

725
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,410
Greetings, Your Highness.

726
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,490
