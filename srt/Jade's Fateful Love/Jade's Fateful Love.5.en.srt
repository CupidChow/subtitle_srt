According to the North Prince,

66
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,570
you died after the failed treatment.

67
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,010
I was worried for a long time.

68
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,220
I was stabbed and I was dying.

69
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,500
But His Highness paid
a lot of money for a famous doctor

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,340
who saved my life.

00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,810
Can he really be so helpful?

72
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,730
You said, "The North Prince is righteous

73
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,730
and handsome.

74
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,690
Everybody likes him.

75
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,170
You want to see him

00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,900

77
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,850
But now, you suspect of his kindness?

78
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,900
I used that trick

79
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,780
just to get some information about you.

80
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,580
The North Prince is lecherous.

81
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,850
How could he be a nice guy?

82
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,530
What you see is what he appears to be like.

83
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,220
You haven't really known him.

84
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,820
The North Prince

85
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,610
is not only lecherous,

86
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,530
but also treasonous.

87
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,260
Treasonous?

88
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,460
It records the evidence of his sins.

89
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,020
Where did you get this account book?

90
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,940
Did anyone else see it?

91
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,860
Mr. Zhang, who works for the North Prince,

92
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,540
traded this book in the House of Romance

93
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,100
and I stole it.

94
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,020
This is my amulet.

95
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,900
How come it's your amulet?

96
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,060
If the North Prince wants to hurt me

97
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,220
after he marries me,

98
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,860
showing this account book

99
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,260
will allow me to leave safely.

100
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,700
Sounds feasible, Yueling.

101
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,260
But this account book may get you killed.

102
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,940
I'm afraid this mansion is no longer safe.

103
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,060
Why is it no longer safe?

104
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,780
I guess someone is watching over you.

105
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,620
You think you can

106
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,420
so easily keep this account book?

107
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,500
What... What do I do?

108
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,260
Do you have any idea?

109
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,800
You go to the North Prince's mansion.

110
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,540
Go there?

111
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,660
When you're there,

112
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,580
the North Prince will protect you.

113
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,980
You keep this account book, after all.

114
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,260
Besides, if you're in trouble,

115
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,860
we can struggle together.

116
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,180
It makes sense.

117
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,620
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

118
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,900
Your Highness,

119
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,500
you insisted on going out
in the middle of the night.

120
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,460
Your wound isn't deep.

121
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,500
But you still need to recuperate.

122
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,980
You lost the account book.

123
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,060
With you guys around,

124
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,860
how can I possibly recuperate?

125
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,540
Sorry, Your Highness.

126
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,380
We didn't expect her to steal

127
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,500
the account book
we deliberately gave Mr. Zhang.

128
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,420
Your Highness,

129
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,680
will it affect our plan?

130
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,670
If the plan fails, we can think of another one.

131
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,220
So, you asked her to move in ahead of time

132
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,150
just to protect her?

133
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,100
I can't stop worrying

134
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,820
until she and her brother

135
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,300
live around me.

136
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,980
Looks like we have to go
to the North Prince's mansion.

137
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,260
We don't know about that prince.

138
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,380
What if he offends you,

139
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,460
Your Grace?

140
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,660
If he dares to offend my sister,

141
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,380
I'll kill him immediately.

142
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,220
With this,

143
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,620
(Account Book)
I don't think he dares to offend me.

144
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,420
If the North Prince rebels,

145
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,300
his consort

146
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,420
will also be held accountable.

147
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,740
Your Grace, will you really marry him?

148
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,340
(Account Book)

149
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,420
If I don't marry him,

150
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,740
Beishuo will break our alliance

151
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,340
and destroy our state.

152
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,060
By then, none of our people

153
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,540
can live a good life.

154
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,380
What's worse,

155
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,980
my eldest sister will be caught.

156
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,140
Then you'll be the sinner

157
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,940
of Dongyu.

158
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,100
So will you, Your Highness.

159
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,460
Don't worry.

160
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,380
With this,

161
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,820
he won't dare to hurt us.

162
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,420
If he dares to offend you,

163
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,620
we'll hand over the account book

164
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,140
and report him to the Emperor of Beishuo.

165
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,980
That's right.

166
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,260
So,

167
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,740
we'll have to go there.

168
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,140
(Account Book)
Let's just go.

169
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,140
(The North Prince's Mansion)

170
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,380
Such a big mansion.

171
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,900
The North Prince is rich.

172
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,540
The yard is carefully cleaned.

173
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,500
If he's a better man,

174
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,260
I'll allow Yueling to marry him.

175
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,900
Your Highness,

176
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,700
you said something different last night.

177
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,420
I did?

178
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,340
You're always chatty.

179
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,780
(Benign and Benevolent)

180
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,340
Yueling, this room is so big.

181
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,020
Your Grace, what's wrong?

182
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,660
This room looks beautiful.

183
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,620
I'm just a little bit homesick.

184
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,780
Your Grace, if you want to leave,

185
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,900
I'll always be with you.

186
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,500
Yueling, I hear

187
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,100
the North Prince lives in the western yard

188
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,340
and he gives you the whole eastern yard.

189
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,580
So, he doesn't want you to see him.

190
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,660
He doesn't want to see me?

191
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,540
I don't want to see him, either.

192
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,780
Let's just take whatever comes.

193
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,460
Since we're given such a good place,

194
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,980
let's just enjoy it.

195
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,060
(Memorial to the Throne)
In this case,

196
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,420
I'll leave the mining thing

197
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,740
to the two of you.

198
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,620
Rest assured, Your Highness.

199
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,860
(Stay Modest)

200
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,980
Your Highness.

201
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,940
What?

202
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,180
Is everything ready for my consort?

203
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,380
Don't worry, Your Highness.

204
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,780
Princess Yueling has
settled down in the eastern yard.

205
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,580
They're satisfied with their place.

206
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,340
Your effort for her isn't wasted.

207
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,180
Good.

208
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,180
Give her two cooks
who can make Dongyu dishes.

209
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,140
She love those dishes.

210
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,980
Yes.

211
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,140
Anything else?

212
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,220
I just think

213
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,860
Your Highness cares really a lot

214
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,140
about Princess Yueling.

215
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,700
Thanks to you

216
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,620
who lost my account book of illegal mining.

217
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,740
Your Highness,

218
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,420
Princess Yueling thinks highly of Wen Yu.

219
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,780
So, you want to trick her of it

220
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,300
with Wen Yu's identity, huh?

221
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,540
Oh, not trick her.

222
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,660
You will

223
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,140
just get it from her.

224
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,420
My maid Yueling

225
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,620
received a lot of help
from Wen Yu on her way here.

226
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,940
So, she adores him.

227
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,660
Yesterday, she accidentally heard

228
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,460
Wen Yu was assassinated
in the House of Romance

229
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,060
and she was really worried.

230
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,620
I'm so glad that you're still alive.

231
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,540
You sound so anxious.

232
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,620
I think you actually adore him

233
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,500
instead of Miss Yueling.

234
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,260
Your Grace,

235
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,540
Butler Wen is here.

236
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,660
Butler Wen.

237
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,900
Why did he come so early?

238
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,260
Greetings, Your Highness.

239
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,500
Your Highness ordered me

240
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,900
to take good care of you

241
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,420
and offer you all the best things.

242
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,060
So, I picked the four of them

243
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,180
to serve you.

244
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,740
Come and meet Her Highness.

245
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,020
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Rubing.

246
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,540
I'm good at makeup and hairstyles.

247
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,460
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Rushuang.

248
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,940
I'm good at cleaning.

249
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,740
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Dali.

250
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,100
I'm good at making Beishuo and Dongyu dishes.

251
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,220
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Daqi.

252
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,380
I'm good at making Beishuo and Dongyu pastry.

253
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,100
(What is the North Prince up to?)

254
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,700
Your Highness, His Highness said

255
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,940
you could ask for anything you wanted.

256
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,020
From this day on, the four of them
will work for you.

257
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,380
It's really nice of His Highness.

258
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
His Highness also said

259
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,220
(Indenture)
you can keep half of their indentures.

260
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,740
Use them without worry.

261
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,980
It's quite thoughtful of him.

262
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,380
Thank you, Butler Wen.

263
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,020
Your Highness, since they're here,

264
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,340
I'll take my leave.

265
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,180
In this case,

266
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,780
with Rubing, Rushuang,

267
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,820
Dali, and Daqi

268
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,300
joining us,

269
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,050
we've grown bigger.

270
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,120
Oh,

271
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,620
how about we have a welcome dinner

272
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,100
of Dongyu style right tonight?

273
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,260
Why not?

274
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,100
Really?

275
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,780
Don't be shy.

276
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,060
We're a family now.

277
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,700
There aren't too many rules in our state.

278
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,860
You two look so strong.

279
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,740
Hurry.

280
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,220
Bring that thing here.

281
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,580
- All right.
- And that one.

282
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,460
Rubing and Rushuang,

283
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,500
hurry up.

284
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,340
Come on. Hurry.

285
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,440
The food is done.

286
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,180
- It'll smell great with some spice.
- All right.

287
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,540
This dish is done, too.

288
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,700
Daqi, I want some super spice food.

289
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,620
Wait a minute. You'll have it.

290
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,020
Daqi, give me some.

291
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,340
You'll all have some.

292
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,540
Daqi, give me one.

293
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,680
Come on, just one.

294
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,260
It's for Her Highness.
You'll all have some later.

295
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,420
Slow down.

296
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,460
- It's for all of you.
- Got it.

297
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,980
- All right.
- Wait a minute.

298
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,100
- Give it to me.
- Here.

299
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,300
Come on. All of you can have some.

300
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,260
Yueling, taste it.

301
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,780
It looks delicious.

302
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,060
I'll take it there.

303
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,420
Put it over there.

304
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,260
All right.

305
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,860
Your Highness.

306
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,900
Nie Chen,

307
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,420
do you smell something?

308
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,300
(Nie Chen, the North Prince’s dark guard)
Smells like the roast meat.

309
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,460
Your Highness.

310
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,340
Bad news, Your Highness.

311
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,190
What?

312
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,980
Her Grace is hold a big dinner in her yard.

313
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,220
The smell goes everywhere.

314
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,940
The ladies all went there
to see the roast meat.

315
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,420
Everything is in a mess.

316
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,940
- In a mess?
- Her Grace is roasting meat?

317
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,380
Am I hearing this right?

318
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,820
Yes, Your Highness.

319
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,180
We've never seen it before.

320
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,380
Your Highness, go take a look.

321
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,140
Everybody, come on.

322
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,380
Let's drink together.

323
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,260
Come on.

324
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,460
Cheers.

325
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,340
Come on.

326
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,500
All right.

327
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,340
Wen Yu.

328
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,740
Wen Yu.

329
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,140
Your Highness.

330
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Your Highness?

331
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,740
Nonsense.

332
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,100
This is Wen Yu, my good buddy.

333
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,260
There you are, at last.

334
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,820
Let's go have a drink.

335
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,860
Xingyi, Wen Yu is my good buddy.

336
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,700
- Fill his cup.
- Here.

337
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,980
Cheers.

338
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,540
Fill his cup.

339
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,220
Good buddy,

340
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,140
we'll help each other
and never leave each other.

341
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,420
Cheers.

342
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,500
You're drunk.

343
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,460
Am I drunk?

344
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
I don't know.

345
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,940
Am I drunk?

346
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,020
- No.
- You're not.

347
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,340
Her Grace won't be drunk.

348
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,700
See?

349
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,180
I told you.

350
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,540
I never get drunk.

351
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,860
Why do I see three copies of you?

352
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,020
One.

353
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,820
Two.

354
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,900
Three.

355
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,180
What is happening to Her Highness?

356
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,740
Come on. Let's drink.

357
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,340

You're awake?

379

We...

380
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,700
What is going on here?

381
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,740
His Highness married you to me.

382
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,060
We've been married for three days.

383
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,780
Why are you still not used to it?

384
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,540
We... We're married?

385
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
You told His Highness you adored me.

386
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,580
Why do you not remember?

387
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,020
Be careful, honey.

388
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,060
Your Grace, time to get up.

389
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,500
Your Grace.

390
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,660
Luckily, it was just a dream.

391
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,660
Why would I dream about Wen Yu?

392
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,940
Your Grace, who did you dream about?

393
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,410
Get up and get changed.

394
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,260
Nobody.

395
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,420
Qianqian,

396
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,980
last night,

397
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,950
how did I come back to my room?

398
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,980
Your Grace, I was also drunk last night.

399
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,420
When I woke up, you were asleep in the room.

400
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,660
Besides,

401
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,980
you can drink more than I do.

402
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,100
But...

403
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,820
Did I come back by myself?

404
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,940
Wen Yu,

405
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,100
it's so nice of you.

406
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,620
I flirted with Wen Yu.

407
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,500
No wonder I had that kind of dream.

408
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,740
Your Grace, did you have a nightmare?

409
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,340
Never mind. A dream is always opposite.

410
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,860
Indeed, a dream is always opposite.

411
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,900
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

412
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,580
Your Highness, Her Highness has moved in.

413
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,960
Will you still visit the House of Pretties?

414
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,260
Isn't it inappropriate?

415
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,420
Now, Yueling lives here.

416
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,100
It may be dangerous to keep those ladies.

417
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,100
I should go meet them.

418
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,300
You're right.

419
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,580
I think Her Highness will understand.

420
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,220
There you go.

421
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,380
Yes.

422
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,540
Your Grace, you...

423
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,500
I'm moving back.

424
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,790
(Gao Luoyi, Commandery Princess of Beishuo)
I'm going to greet my cousin.

425
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,860
Welcome back, Your Grace.

426
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,260
But you had a long trip.

427
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,740
How about you get back for some rest?

428
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,020
Where is my cousin?

429
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,860
His Highness is in the middle of something.

430
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,300
Is he in the House of Pretties?

431
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,740
I'm here with an imperial decree.

432
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,580
I must see him now.

433
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,220
- But...
- Do you want him to disobey the decree?

434
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,940
But...

435
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,860
Hey, Your Grace.

436
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,700
Shiyu.

437
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,260
- Your Highness.
- Shiyu.

438
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,660
You cheap woman.

439
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,420
How dare you sit on my cousin's laps?

440
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,060
Get out of here.

441
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,340
Luoyi, what are you doing?

442
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,940
When I was away from this house,

443
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,180
women like you

444
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,580
became cubbish, huh?

445
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,220
Your Highness, that's not true.

446
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,600
- We aren't.
- Your Highness, we aren't cubbish.

447
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,540
- Your Highness.
- Yeah.

448
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,260
Shiyu, I hate it when they seduce you.

449
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,420
You... Get out of here!

450
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,700
All right. Leave us.

451
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,180
Humph.

452
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,340
Aren't you supposed to accompany
the Great Consort in the palace?

453
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,300
What are you doing here?

454
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,100
Knowing you're going to marry someone,

455
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,960
I'm here to greet her.

456
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,820
And...

457
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,340
You won't be living here again, will you?

458
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,260
I will, of course.

459
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,060
I'm here under the command
of the Great Consort.

460
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,380
You must not kick me out.

461
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
I hear

462
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,940
Her Highness and her servants
got drunk last night.

463
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,740
The scandal even made its way to the palace.

464
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,780
I'm here to give her a present.

465
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,340
Present?

466
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,300
Where is Xingyi?

467
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,740
His Highness has gone to the House of Romance

468
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,050
for the assassin, I think.

469
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,460
Your Highness,

470
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,620
this is the western yard.

471
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,180
It's where His Highness lives.

472
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,820
You can't get in without permission.

473
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,340
Why?

474
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,580
Our princess

475
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,700
will be the North Princess Consort.

476
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,740
Why can't she walk around?

477
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,020
You must not break in.

478
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,220
Who are you?

479
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,420
Her Highness is the North Princess Consort.

480
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,620
Just because of this,

481
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,900
I have to stop you.

482
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,340
Your Highness, this is
Madam Dong from the palace.

483
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,060
She was assigned by the Great Consort

484
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,780
to teach you Beishuo etiquette.

485
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,300
What? Teach me etiquette?

486
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,060
What etiquette?

487
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,060
(The House of Romance)

488
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,500
See you.

489
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,980
Gentleman, come in, please.

490
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,900
Who do you...?

491
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,220
Have Miss Su Nian come out and see me.

492
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,700
I'm sorry.

493
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,780
Miss Su Nian has a day off.

494
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,540
How about some other girls?

495
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,100
Su Nian is having a day off.

496
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,740
But if you insist on seeing her,

497
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,740
you can see her.

498
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,940
Su Nian.

499
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,220
You must give this guest

500
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,300
a great time today.

501
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,260
Get it?

502
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,420
Yes.

503
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,100
Still laughing?

504
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,420
It's not when

505
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,220
you dumped me off the horse, huh?

506
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,540
You're so good at acting.

507
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

508
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,340
You'll know soon.

509
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,780
Gentleman, what would you like for today,

510
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,540
a song or a dance?

511
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,700
Martial contest.

512
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,660
Assassin, we're here alone.

513
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,300
Stop acting. Bring it on!

514
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,460
It's so humorous of you.

515
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,300
But I can only dance

516
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,900
instead of doing martial arts.

517
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,420
What?

518
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,500
Gentleman, what do you think of this dance?

519
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,500
No...

520
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,780
Not that good.

521
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,340
(Do I really get the wrong girl?)

522
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,020
(Looks like she isn't)

523
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,500
(the assassin.)

524
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,700
Stop.

525
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,140
One more time.

526
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,420
Stop.

527
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,100
Stand properly.

528
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,900
You should behave elegantly.

529
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,460
Put your hands before you.

530
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,460
Relax your shoulders and stay straight-backed.

531
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,420
Head up.

532
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,380
This is the way
I've been standing for a dozen years.

533
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,580
I don't think anything is wrong with it.

534
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,260
Because you Dongyu people are impolite.

535
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,860
You have no manners.

536
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,340
Can politeness be food

537
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,660
or be clothes?

538
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,260
I think I'll just stop learning this.

539
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,100
You...

540
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,820
You're being ridiculous.

541
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,820
I used to teach the imperial consorts only.

542
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,820
No one dared to reject my instruction.

543
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,980
Your Highness, stand straight up.

544
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,220
Because you didn't meet me before.

545
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,380
I'm not an obedient Beishuo girl.

546
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,100
- That's right.
- You...

547
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,340
So, this is the rumored
Eldest Princess of Dongyu?

548
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,900
I hear my cousin-in-law
is the most virtuous lady in Dongyu

549
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,380
and she is really elegant.

550
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,780
What? You can't even walk properly?

551
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,180
Who are you?

552
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,380
Princess Luoyi is the sister
of Lord of the South

553
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,780
and the cousin of the North Prince
he favors most.

554
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,900
Did Her Highness even talk to you?

555
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,180
Why did you interrupt?

556
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,260
Qianqian, fall back.

557
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,780
They have no manners,

558
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,180
but we need some.

559
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,260
Princess Luoyi, you sound so sarcastic.

560
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,220
You seem to impolite, too.

561
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,140
- I...
- Well, I'm generous enough.

562
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,660
How about Madam Dong gives you some lessons?

563
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,860
You... You're impolite

564
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,140
and you have no manners.

565
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,300
You disgraced my cousin that much

566
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,860
and even the imperial family heard about it.

567
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,260
However poorly I behave,

568
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,940
I am your cousin-in-law.

569
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,700
You're in no position to judge me.

570
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,620
I should show

571
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,620
your caring cousin

572
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,540
how sarcastic you are

573
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,660
and see what he'll comment.

574
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,540
- You...
- Good point, Your Highness.

575
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,140
- Good.
- I dare you!

576
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,780
Let's wait and see.

577
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,180
See if I dare.

578
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,100
- Qianqian.
- Here.

579
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,020
See them out.

580
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,860
Yes.

581
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,820
(Huilan Pavilion)
To be the North Princess Consort,

582
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,220
I have to learn so many things.

583
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,580
Why are there so many rules in Beishuo?

584
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:13,180
(Huilan Pavilion)

585
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,940
How I miss my hometown.

586
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,740
(Huilan Pavilion)

587
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,180
What's on your mind?

588
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,820
You freaked me out.

589
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,540
What are you doing here?

590
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,660
I heard you were learning etiquette lately.

591
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,860
How do you feel?

592
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,620
I don't think I'm fit for this state.

593
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,100
Why?

594
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,460
Madam Dong used to serve the Empress.

595
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,420
You can learn a lot from her.

596
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,980
It's really hard to learn your local manners.

597
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,380
I love my state.

598
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,820
We live a free and equal life there.

599
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,180
You're homesick?

600
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,060
The ladies we dispatched
to the North Prince's mansion

601
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,420
have been expelled.

602
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,620
Another calligraphy is ruined.

603
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,860
What a loser!

604
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,520
The North Prince's mansion
is more heavily guarded.

605
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,660
Our men

606
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,100
can no longer sneak in.

607
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,540
You can't even sneak

608
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,860
into a mere prince's mansion.

609
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,340
Don't be angry, Prime Minister.

610
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,380
I've arranged everything.

611
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,980
It's all under deployment.

612
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,860
Looks like

613
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,220
Zhou Shiyu won't hide anymore.

614
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,540
Who's there?

615
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,100
Lingxi?

616
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,500
(Lingxi, the assassin of the Roufeng Sect)
Su Nian, you still remember me.

617
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,380
It's been years.

618
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,540
You look more gorgeous, Su Nian.

619
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,460
No wonder rich young guys in the Capital City

620
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,220
spent money like water just to see you.

621
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,500
How have you been these years?

622
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,220
I've been doing dirty missions.

623
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,860
I naturally don't live a great life

624
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,140
as you do in the House of Romance.

625
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,860
I have to flatter people here.

626
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,980
My life isn't that great.

627
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,940
Master sent me here

628
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,940
to assist you in your new mission.

629
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,220
Assist me?

630
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,500
Master is angry because you failed last time.

631
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,740
But he's giving you a second chance.

632
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,260
(It's her.)

633
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,460
She came here before

634
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,980
and stole the account book Master wanted.

635
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,700
Our mission

636
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,500
is to find her and get the book back.

637
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,240
I'm grateful for Master's not discarding me.

638
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,900
I'll complete this mission.

639
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,820
Rushuang, let me help you.

640
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,700
Your Grace, it's weird.

641
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,700
Madam Dong used to come very early.

642
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,740
But now, it's late in the morning.

643
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,860
She still hasn't come.

644
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,980
I wish she would never come again.

645
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,380
Her manners

646
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,820
are nearly crushing me.

647
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,820
Your Grace, why is Mr. Lin here?

648
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

649
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,180
Why is it you?

650
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,260
Why can't it be me?

651
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,700
Your Highness,

652
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,580
His Highness sent me here for a message.

653
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,300
Since you've learned a lot,

654
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,180
Madam Dong has returned to the palace.

655
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,580
Does it mean

656
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,140
I no longer need to learn anything?

657
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,520
That's right, Your Highness.

658
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,540
Why?

659
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,060
His Highness gave the order.

660
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,140
I guess he cares for you, Your Highness.

661
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,140
I can't ask too much about the other stuff.

662
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,740
All right. I get it.

663
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,260
I'll take my leave, then.

664
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,580
I no longer need to learn anything!
