=Episode 19=

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,050
Your Majesty,

20
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,800
this woman isn't Ashina Zhu,

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,010
the Eldest Princess of Dongyu.

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,730
Instead, she's Ashina Yueling,

23
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,640
a baseborn princess.

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
- Baseborn?
- Baseborn princess?

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,730
This is ridiculous.

26
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,920
Uncle,

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,330
you accuse her of being a pretender.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Do you have evidence?

29
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,450
What did you say?

30
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,850
I said,

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,680
you accuse her of being a pretender.

32
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,290
Do you have evidence?

33
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,410
Recently, I've known

34
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,730
an imperial painter of Dongyu.

35
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,200
He gave me a painting
named The Imperial Banquet.

36
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,580
(Princess Ashina Yueling)

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,890
On the painting are

38
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,050
the Emperor of Dongyu and his daughters.

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,130
The one on the left

40
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,240
(Ashina Wu'er)
is Ashina Zhu, the Eldest Princess.

41
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,290
The one on the right

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,080
is this baseborn princess,

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,450
Ashina Yueling.

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,320
Yeah.

45
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,450
This is an imperial painting.

46
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,850
It has a date

47
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,340
and the labels of figures.

48
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,300
(Princess Ashina Yueling)

49
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,330
Many old ministers of ours
met the Emperor of Dongyu.

50
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,920
This painting is authentic, I'm sure.

51
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,890
Your Majesty,

52
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
I was in Dongyu as an envoy.

53
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,450
The old man in the painting

54
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,680
is indeed the Emperor of Dongyu.

55
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,610
The seal on it

56
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,330
also proves it's an imperial painting.

57
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,570
Your Majesty,

58
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,120
looks like Dongyu fooled us!

59
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,800
They agreed

60
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,290
to marry you the Eldest Lineal Princess.

61
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,650
What? Use a baseborn princess
to muddle their way through?

62
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,610
They're going too far.

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,240
- Yeah.
- That's right.

64
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,650
- This is aggressive.
- Ridiculous.

65
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,610
This is absurd.

66
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,920
- Yeah.
- That's right.

67
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
They're real princesses.

68
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,210
What's the difference?

69
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,050
Princess Ashina Yueling is good, I think.

70
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,610
Different princess

71
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,240
carry different meanings, too.

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,290
It shows poor sincerity

73
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,170
of Dongyu people.

74
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,920
He has a point.

75
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,800
Dongyu is a small state.

76
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
But it pushed us too far.

77
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,240
The lineal princess was replaced

78
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,000
and a baseborn princess was sent here.

79
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,090
I think we should give them some punishment.

80
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,480
I will take troops to destroy Dongyu.

81
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,090
Prime Minister, you're wrong.

82
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,610
Indeed,

83
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,410
Dongyu gave us a baseborn princess.

84
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,800
But I heard Princess Yueling

85
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
was also favored by the Emperor of Dongyu.

86
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,610
I believe she can

87
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,880
bear the responsibility of the marriage.

88
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,770
The marriage is for the peace
between the two states.

89
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,680
Why would we start a war

90
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,240
for the identity problem?

91
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,050
We'll definitely lose more.

92
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,410
Your Majesty, His Highness has a point.

93
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,850
She is a princess, after all.

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,440
If we start a war for this,

95
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,920
we may lose too much.

96
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,000
You each have a point.

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,250
- Why don't we just...?
- Your Majesty.

98
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,240
The lineal identity

99
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,560
is an ancestral rule of ours.

100
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,800
You must not break the rule.

101
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,320
I guess Shiyu knew it a long time ago.

102
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,000
So, he defended her this hard.

103
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Shiyu,

104
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,610
if you knew the truth

105
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,440
on your way to get her back,

106
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,210
you would be

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,610
deceiving His Majesty.

108
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,050
- Yeah.
- That's right.

109
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,400
Your Majesty,

110
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,610
- I knew...
- He didn't know.

111
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,000
I did this all alone.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,770
It has nothing to do with His Highness.

113
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,320
My state isn't involved, either.

114
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,120
Your Majesty, don't involve anyone innocent.

115
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,440
You're a mere girl.

116
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,920
Without a helper,

117
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,410
how could you deceive
the escort or the North Prince?

118
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,560
In Dongyu,

119
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,240
there's no difference between princesses.

120
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,090
We're Father's beloved daughters.

121
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,910
After careful consideration,

122
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,560
Father decided
to marry my eldest sister to you.

123
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,640
But Beishuo has been appealing to me.

124
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,240
Father didn't allow me to come.

125
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,170
So, I begged my sister to cover for me

126
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,870
and I replaced her.

127
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,480
Later, I was married to the North Prince.

128
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,210
After getting along with him,

129
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,770
I fell in love with him.

130
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,880
I had meant to let it be.

131
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,800
But under such circumstances,

132
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,970
I know I'm wrong.

133
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,090
I shouldn't have made such a big mistake

134
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,120
for my selfish desires.

135
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,210
Your Majesty, please get no one else involved.

136
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,770
Punish me alone.

137
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,240
Brother, punish me instead of her.

138
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,410
Quite plausible.

139
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Plausible!

140
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,120
Who knows if you're telling the truth?

141
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,410
Anyway, Dongyu is in the wrong.

142
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,240
They must learn their lesson from a war!

143
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,880
Your Majesty, Prime Minister is wrong.

144
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,800
The treasury is empty.

145
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,800
Recruiting soldiers will cost money.

146
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,120
Not to mention the weapons and army provisions.

147
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,610
Who will pay for all these?

148
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,640
Indeed.

149
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,090
We'll talk about the war later.

150
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,090
Shiyu wasn't aware.

151
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,120
He didn't deceive me.

152
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,050
Princess Yueling did something wrong.

153
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,000
But she's quite straightforward.

154
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,770
- I think...
- Your Majesty.

155
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,360
Dongyu deceived our state.

156
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,920
If we don't give them a lesson,

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,530
the other neighboring states

158
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,560
will see us as a joke, won't they?

159
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,920
I will go to Dongyu personally

160
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,210
for the marriage renegotiation.

161
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,360
By then, I'll give you a satisfactory result.

162
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,650
Are you sure you can?

163
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,920
The round trip takes a long time.

164
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,650
How much time do you need, six months,

165
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,560
a year or three years?

166
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,050
Shiyu,

167
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,730
don't waste our time.

168
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,170
I need only one month.

169
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,210
Uncle, you can wait such a short time,

170
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,210
can't you?

171
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,920
Even if you want a war,

172
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,960
you can't get everything ready
within a month, can you?

173
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,320
Uncle, in terms of the national relationship,

174
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,560
we prefer peace to war.

175
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,130
When His Highness is away,

176
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,960
how will this princess be dealt with?

177
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,320
Your Majesty, I suggest

178
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,890
she should be put in prison.

179
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,250
Yueling made a mistake.

180
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,530
But a severe punishment
will hurt diplomatic relations.

181
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,250
Whatever kind of princess she is,

182
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,720
she's important to Dongyu.

183
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,170
Before everything is clear,

184
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,080
you want to put her in prison.

185
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,650
Uncle, do you insist on starting a war?

186
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,720
Brother, I think

187
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,170
we should put her

188
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,960
in the North Prince's Mansion for reflection.

189
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,250
When everything is clear,

190
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
we'll decide what to do.

191
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Shiyu,

192
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,130
we haven't decided

193
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,770
if we'll start a war.

194
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,410
But you defend her so anxiously.

195
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,050
Isn't it inappropriate

196
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,290
to keep her at your mansion?

197
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,010
A conclusion hasn't been reached.

198
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,920
Punishing her casually

199
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,320
will be bad for peace talks.

200
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,920
But Uncle, you have a point.

201
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,530
It's inappropriate
to keep her at Shiyu's Mansion.

202
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,560
In this case,

203
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,050
why don't we ground her
at the Princess's Mansion?

204
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,290
What do you say?

205
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,200
- It's wise of you.
Good idea, Your Majesty.

206
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,770
This room will be sealed.

207
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,320
You can't go out without permission.

208
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,620
(Lucky Pastry)

209
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,840
Are you going to see Her Grace?

210
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,890
I'm going to see her. I must stay with her.

211
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,250
You can't go, Your Highness!

212
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,650
According to Linmu,

213
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,050
her mansion is heavily guarded.

214
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,080
No one can get in.

215
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,250
I can't stay and do nothing!

216
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,920
I wonder if Her Grace can eat regularly

217
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,890
and sleep very well.

218
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,010
I hear only the guards are there.

219
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,530
No servant is available.

220
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,600
- That won't do.
- No way.

221
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,440
- No way.
- No way.

222
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,490
Can we make some food

223
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,490
and deliver it to her?

224
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,680
Yeah. Shall we make some warm quilts?

225
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,770
Her cold was just gone.

226
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,680
She can't have it again.

227
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,920
- Let's do it.
- We're on it.

228
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Calm down!

229
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,560
I know you're worried about Her Grace.

230
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,320
But no one can get in there now.

231
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,840
I'll beg His Highness.

232
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,800
He can try to have the food and quilts

233
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,960
delivered to my sister.

234
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,080
Princess, you can't go in.

235
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,920
Out of my way!

236
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,610
Your Highness,

237
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,800
I failed to stop Prince Xingyi.

238
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,640
It doesn't matter.

239
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,200
How can you still sit here?

240
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,080
My sister is grounded at her mansion!

241
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,290
I was about to see you.

242
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,490
See me?

243
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,080
I'm going to Dongyu.

244
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,440
Will you go with me?

245
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,840
I've sent my men to her mansion.

246
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,010
Your sister will be safe.

247
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,800
My top priority

248
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,890
is to get your father's letter of marriage.

249
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,170
For my sister, I will go.

250
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,090
It's me.

251
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,320
I'm working on the guards out there.

252
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,530
My men will join them in a couple of days.

253
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,130
Then you'll live a better life.

254
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,290
What are you doing here?

255
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,290
Why have you brought so many things?

256
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
You're suddenly grounded.

257
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,410
We don't know how you're doing.

258
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,290
Everyone is worried about you.

259
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,770
Xingyi and Qianqian

260
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,800
asked me to bring all this.

261
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,520
Come on.

262
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,650
Look.

263
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,540
(Lucky Pastry)

264
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,290
Put away the food.

265
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,010
I got this fur when I was hunting
the year before last.

266
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,050
It's very warm. Use it when you sleep.

267
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Beef jerky?

268
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,960
What's the noise?

269
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:39,970
Let's go.

270
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,250
They didn't see you, huh?

271
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,800
I'm sorry.

272
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,530
You have to suffer this.

273
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,250
It's a better place than the prison.

274
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,170
It happened so unexpectedly.

275
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,250
Keeping you here is just a stopgap.

276
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,800
I'll do something and get you out soon.

277
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,370
Are you really going to Dongyu?

278
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,320
Even if you weren't exposed,

279
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,920
I would also go there.

280
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,280
With you.

281
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,920
Before marrying a girl,

282
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,490
I should meet her family officially.

283
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,890
It's a very long trip.

284
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,370
Take care of yourself

285
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,560
and come back early.

286
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,770
I'll be back as soon as I can.

287
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,320
I'll have my men

288
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,130
take care of your life here.

289
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,200
You must personally test

290
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,770
whatever you eat here.

291
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,200
Be very careful.

292
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,040
I will.

293
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,920
Wait until I'm back.

294
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,140
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

295
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,370
Your Highness, our men have been placed

296
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,680
in the guards against Her Highness.

297
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,010
Good.

298
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,370
I'm going to Dongyu for the letter of marriage.

299
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,960
You must keep Yueling safe.

300
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,210
Your Highness,

301
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,960
how about you take me with you?

302
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,250
You stay and take care of Yueling.

303
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,320
If anything goes wrong,

304
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,560
you'll lose your life.

305
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,680
Yes.

306
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,210
Your Highness,

307
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,360
everything is ready.

308
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,840
All the post houses are informed.

309
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,970
Horses will always be available.

310
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,530
Good. Get me the horse.

311
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,730
We're leaving immediately.

312
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,680
Yes.

313
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,840
The North Prince has left the city,

314
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,010
heading for Dongyu.

315
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,530
Shall we...?

316
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,600
Don't move rashly.

317
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,160
Before Zhou Shiyu reaches Dongyu,

318
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,530
we won't do anything.

319
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,930
I get it.

320
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,530
You're saying

321
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,010
the North Prince will be killed in Dongyu.

322
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,360
Then a war will be necessary.

323
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,530
Inform all the generals and seigniors

324
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,880
to meet His Majesty in the Capital City

325
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,450
and discuss the war against Dongyu.

326
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,610
Yes.

327
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,810
Wait.

328
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,160
I'll personally write the letter

329
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,210
to the Lord of the South.

330
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,250
Your Highness, you have a poor appetite.

331
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,050
Do you not like the new dishes?

332
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,840
It's not about the dishes.

333
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,050
It's my own problem.

334
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,530
What do you mean, Your Highness?

335
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,120
Tell me. What's so good about Zhou Shiyu?

336
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,530
Why is Princess Yueling

337
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,290
dead gone on him?

338
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,530
When her own life was in danger,

339
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,770
she tried to protect Zhou Shiyu.

340
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,930
When they weren't afraid of death in the court,

341
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,360
they looked rather sweet.

342
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,090
Think about it.

343
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,840
If only someday a girl would also

344
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,610
love me like that!

345
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,010
Your Highness,

346
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,600
however sweet they are,

347
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,290
it's no use unless they're together.

348
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,840
Now, Zhou Shiyu is in trouble.

349
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,970
Why don't we do something at this moment

350
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,640
to take him down?

351
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,690
Why did I not know

352
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,210
you would take advantage
of someone else's trouble?

353
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,130
Umm?

354
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,120
What kind of gentleman
gives somebody a hard time

355
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,400
when he's in trouble?

356
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,730
Your Highness,

357
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,160
I'm just thinking of you.

358
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,320
Come on, Your Highness.

359
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,930
I won't kick him when he's down.

360
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,880
Neither will you.

361
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,320
I won't. It's my fault.

362
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,800
Forgive me, Your Highness.

363
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,010
Su Nian, stop drinking.

364
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,080
Master ordered you to kill Xingyi.

365
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,490
Why do you not go?

366
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,730
It's my own business.

367
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,200
You stay out of it.

368
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,640
You like him.

369
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,320
So, you don't want to kill him, huh?

370
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,930
But have you thought about it?

371
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,290
If he lives,

372
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,210
you will have to die.

373
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,930
My life is cheap, anyway.

374
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,250
Take it.

375
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,360
Even if you don't kill him,

376
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,730
I don't think

377
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,800
he can stay alive.

378
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,210
He and the North Prince went to Dongyu.

379
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,080
Master sent some assassins.

380
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
This time,

381
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,290
I don't think they can be as lucky as before.

382
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,090
What did you say?

383
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,640
Xingyi went there, too?

384
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,640
I'm finally back here.

385
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,250
But this isn't the capital.

386
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,050
At this time of year,

387
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,880
Father must be camping here

388
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,010
to patrol the grassland.

389
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,120
Let's go, Your Highness.

390
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,290
All right.

391
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,610
Who are you guys?

392
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,810
What?

393
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,080
Can't you recognize me?

394
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,250
Greetings, Your Highness.

395
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,930
Go. Prince Xingyi is back.

396
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,800
Let them in.

397
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,250
You wait here.

398
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,840
I'll go inform Father.

399
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,320
Yueling and I sneaked out.

400
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,320
Let me go and apologize first.

401
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,480
Father.

402
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,010
You still come back home, huh?

403
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Father, what are you talking about?

404
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,970
If I didn't come back,

405
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,450
who would give you a massage?

406
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,610
Come on.

407
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,050
Father.

408
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,370
Be seated.

409
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,690
Oh, son.

410
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,250
Did you make some trouble

411
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,160
in Beishuo?

412
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,400
No. How would I?

413
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,800
Then, Yueling must have made trouble.

414
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,620
(To Father)

415
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,010
Check it yourself.

416
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,060
(To Father)

417
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,210
So, Father, you knew it?

418
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,160
Yueling imitated Zhu's handwriting.

419
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,450
(To Father)
However perfect it looks,

420
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,770
I can recognize it.

421
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,600
If I hadn't found the problem in time

422
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,880
and brought back Zhu
who was leading a vagrant life,

423
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,160
she might still be suffering

424
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,160
with the silly Du Er

425
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,840
while she was pregnant.

426
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,890
Father,

427
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,360
you got back my eldest sister?

428
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,160
And she is even carrying Du Er's baby?

429
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,640
Everything is all right with her now.

430
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,930
Confess.

431
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,560
What trouble did Yueling make?

432
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,490
Nothing, actually.

433
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,970
She was just uncovered
for pretending to be our eldest sister.

434
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,640
But she has feelings for the North Prince.

435
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,880
They love each other.

436
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,010
He is right out there.

437
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,050
Father, will you see him?

438
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,440
What's the hurry?

439
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,930
Have him wait.

440
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,130
But...

441
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,400
He's here, anyway.

442
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,600
Isn't it inappropriate to keep him out?

443
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,930
Yueling shouldn't have replaced her sister.

444
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,120
But the young man out there

445
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,770
seems to be brave and righteous.

446
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,050
That's right, Father.

447
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,560
I've told you the truth.

448
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,600
In Beishuo, he protected Yueling very well.

449
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,840
I think they make a perfect couple.

450
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,800
He did really a lot, I think.

451
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,360
In less than half a month,

452
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,010
you arrived in Dongyu.

453
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,250
Some horses must
have been dead on the way, huh?

454
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,930
He had horses prepared in every post house.

455
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,050
We didn't even drink water on our way.

456
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,490
We changed horses and rode on.

457
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,400
Father, it's dark out there.

458
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,970
Shall we get him in?

459
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,800
He lived in the wilderness on his way.

460
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,160
Since he arrived, he's been standing all day

461
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,560
He hasn't eaten anything.

462
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,320
If Yueling knows about it,

463
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,970
she'll be mad at you.

464
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,530
Mad at me?

465
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,290
I'm mad at her!

466
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,600
Behind my back,

467
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,770
you switched identities

468
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,010
and Yueling went to Beishuo.

469
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,560
I understand she did that for you and Du Er.

470
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,880
But as the princesses,

471
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,360
you switch places for marriage.

472
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,600
Isn't it ridiculous?

473
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,640
Have you thought about the consequences?

474
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,930
Quite absurd!

475
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,640
Father,

476
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,210
we know we're wrong.

477
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,250
But unexpectedly, when Yueling reached Beishuo,

478
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,450
the Emperor of Beishuo

479
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,290
married her to the North Prince.

480
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,970
Luckily, they're in love now.

481
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,320
Or it would be the fault of Beishuo.

482
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,120
It's indeed the fault
of the Emperor of Beishuo.

483
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,930
I love my daughter Yueling,

484
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,450
so I let him go.

485
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,970
If anyone dares to hurt Yueling,

486
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,050
I'll fight all the way to Beishuo!

487
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:01,850
Father.

488
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,250
Father, calm down.

489
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,080
What's done is done.

490
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,290
You should give Yueling a rightful marriage

491
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,120
so that she can have a powerful backing

492
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,250
there in Beishuo.

493
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,800
Yeah, Father.

494
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,490
The North Prince has come personally.

495
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,930
Shouldn't you talk to him in person?

496
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,770
Be patient.

497
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,970
He's here, anyway.

498
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,080
We'll handle the engagement thing.

499
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:31,850
However,

500
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,160
I can't let him get what he wants that easily.

501
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,290
Have him wait.

502
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,160
It's not that easy

503
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,120
to be my son-in-law.

504
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,840
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

505
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,370
Let's drink.

506
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,610
Cheers.

507
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,560
(Hope the wind on the grassland)

508
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,530
(won't hurt the North Prince.)

509
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,080
(Or when we're back,)

510
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,560
(Yueling will not let me go.)

511
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,770
(Oh, Your Highness.)

512
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,400
(It's not that I don't help you.)

513
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,490
(Don't stay angry at me.)

514
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,970
You're the North Prince?

515
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,130
I am.

516
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,210
Are you here to break off the engagement?

517
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,370
No.

518
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,770
I'm here to beg you
to marry Princess Yueling to me.

519
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,730
Do you really love her?

520
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,290
I do.

521
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,600
So, I'm formally proposing.

522
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,160
You stood all day and night

523
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,360
without eating or drinking.

524
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,640
Have some hot soup to get warm.

525
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,320
Father will talk to you.

526
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,320
Yesterday, I had my say.

527
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,800
But Father just didn't see you.

528
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,010
He didn't even allow us to tip you off.

529
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,530
Sorry for this.

530
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,160
It's all right.

531
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,880
Take me to your father.

532
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,320
I know about your feelings for Yueling.

533
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,770
So, do you approve

534
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,930
my marriage with her?

535
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,880
If you want to marry my daughter,

536
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,010
what will you offer?

537
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,120
Peace of our states.

538
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,490
What do you mean?

539
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,160
Unless I'm dead,

540
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,400
there won't be a war between our states.

541
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,560
Relations between the two states always change.

542
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,080
How can I trust your guarantee alone?

543
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,450
You're right, Your Majesty.

544
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,690
So, please give me a written decree.

545
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,160
It'll not only get Yueling and me together

546
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,120
but also relieve the tensions

547
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,360
between our states.

548
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,450
Yueling.

549
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,490
I miss you so much.

550
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,010
Shiyu,

551
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,050
you're finally back.

552
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,640
Why do you look so haggard?

553
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,400
I'm fine.

554
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,050
Some time ago, your brother released me.

555
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,880
Sorry to have you suffered.

556
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,050
Is everything all right?

557
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,210
Everything is all right here.

558
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,640
What about you?

00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,930
Was your trip to Dongyu smooth?

560

Did my father give you a hard time?

561
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,970
Your father approved my proposal.

562
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,880
You and I won't be parted again.

Come on. Let's go to the palace

564
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,560
and ask Brother to hold our wedding early.

Don't panic. So indecent.

574
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,560

Your Grace, I'm indebted to His Highness.

I haven't paid him back yet.
