=Episode 23=

19
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,530
Xingyi has been back
with Su Nian for some days.

20
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,890
Aren't you going to talk with her?

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,890
I haven't decided yet.

22
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,450
In recent days,

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,560
I've reviewed a case of a dozen years ago.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,120
Turns out to be an unjust case.

25
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,680
The Liu Family's case

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,450
is really miserable.

27
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,200
The whole family was executed.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,130
The whole family?

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,130
Only a six-year-old girl was taken away

30
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,640
and ended up as a musician.

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,240
How did that happen?

32
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,330
This girl

33
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,130
tried hard to overturn her family case.

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,290
So, she joined the Roufeng Sect

35
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,240
and became an assassin.

36
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,760
She's Su Nian?

37
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,290
Her original name is Liu Nian.

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,240
She's such a pitiful girl.

39
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,250
Are you sure?

40
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,450
You'll lose, then.

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,850
It doesn't count. One more round.

42
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,920
That just didn't count.

43
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,940
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

44
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,200
Here.

45
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,890
Su Nian, this is the Rib Soup with Cabbage.

46
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,410
It's said to replenish blood.

47
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,920
Have some more.

48
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,850
Yeah, Su Nian.

49
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,960
Taste it.

50
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,650
Yueling had it made for you.

51
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,880
Am I right, Yueling?

52
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,850
Whatever you want to eat,

53
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,120
tell Xingyi.

54
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,400
He'll get that for you.

55
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,770
Thank you, Your Grace.

56
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,480
We're a family.

57
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,700
No need to say thank you.

58
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,400
Let's eat.

59
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,170
Let's eat.

60
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,240
Su Nian, eat more.

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,050
Have some more food.

62
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,320
(So, it's how a family feels.)

63
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,210
(I will cherish everything I have now.)

64
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,920
Here. Eat more, Su Nian.

65
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,560
Get her some pork.

66
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,860
(The two of us are getting married.)

67
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,940
(We used to love each other.)

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,530
Yueling, since when were you so studious?

69
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm not done writing yet.

70
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,090
So, you're secretly writing the marriage vow.

71
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,000
You must not read it.

72
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,530
No.

73
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,960
Give it back to me.

74
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,690
Don't read it.

75
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,210
Why? It's for me, after all.

76
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,000
We used

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,650
to love each other.

78
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,610
It's not good.

79
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,850
Why?

80
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,120
I found it after looking it up for a long time.

81
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,770
This poem

82
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,410
was written before parting.

83
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,800
Are you going to leave me?

84
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,160
It's not good, then.

85
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,240
I'll look up something else.

86
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,020
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

87
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,500
(Marriage Vows)

88
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,610
On high, we'd be two love birds
flying wing to wing.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,880
On earth, two trees with branches
twined from spring to spring.

90
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,850
Sounds good.

91
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,560
But it won't be as good as our own poem.

92
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,650
Our own poem?

93
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,380
(Shi)

94
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,740
(Yue)

95
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,650
(The flashy jade has brought us together,)

96
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,650
(getting us through adventures.)

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,050
(On the day we get married,)

98
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,440
(even the stars will congratulate us.)

99
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,650
Hurry. Go over there.

100
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,490
All right.

101
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,090
Hurry. It's a big day.

102
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,650
Hang them symmetrically.

103
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,560
Don't make them cockeyed.

104
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,650
For good luck, you know.

105
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,880
Come on. Put it here.

106
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,170
Be gentle,

107
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,800
in case you break it.

108
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,650
What's going on out there?

109
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,850
Your Grace,

110
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,850
the betrothal presents are sent, I think.

111
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,800
Check them for me.

112
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,920
Which one looks better?

113
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,130
This one.

114
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,490
Come on. Be careful.

115
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,960
Almost. Put them inside.

116
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,080
- So many things?
- Slowly.

117
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,320
- Yeah.
- Put them here.

118
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,160
Some more are coming.

119
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,650
They're all for Her Highness. Be careful.

120
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,410
Careful. Very careful.

121
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,410
Greetings, Your Highness.

122
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,920
- You may rise.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

123
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,520
Shiyu.

124
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,490
Is everything here for me?

125
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,490
Of course.

126
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,330
There's more coming.

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,600
Too many presents.

128
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,890
Not enough, I think.

129
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,680
Linmu.

130
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,560
Yes, Your Highness.

131
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,490
Butler Wen.

132
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,010
Be careful.

133
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
I may have a sprain.

134
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,490
Ten thousand taels of gold,

135
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,290
two gold tea canisters,

136
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,010
two silver canisters,

137
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,650
four hundred bolts of silk fabrics,

138
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,200
twenty luggage packs,

139
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,920
twenty jade objects,

140
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,410
four S-shaped jade pieces,

141
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,530
ten boxes of candy
and four-colored cake each.

142
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,720
Shiyu is really generous.

143
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,560
So many presents.

144
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,170
Well done, Shiyu.

145
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,130
I know you're rich.

146
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,490
But I didn't know you could be so rich.

147
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,370

to Princess Yueling.

153

154
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,530

The whole street of presents.

156
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,010
Rather spectacular.

157
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,370
Why does he not

158
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,890
keep a low profile?

159
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,840
Your Highness, when you have a wedding,

160
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,890
you can cover ten streets.

161
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,920
You can definitely afford that.

162
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,760
By then,

163
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,560
a lot of people will be jealous of you.

164
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,600
What I want isn't jealousy.

165
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,600
Do you understand?

166
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,530
I do.

167
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,920
No, you don't.

168
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,280
You just don't.

169
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,720
(Nanfeng House)

170
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Actually, I know.

171
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,010
The two of my brothers

172
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,080
think the way you think.

173
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,650
We share the same father.

174
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,680
My mother was from a business family

175
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,840
and she was only a noble lady.

176
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,920
Their mother was the empress.

177
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,960
So, all my life,

178
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,080
I couldn't be as good as them.

179
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,290
Just because I'm a baseborn prince,

180
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,290
throughout my life,

181
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,720
I can never defeat Zhou Shiyu

182
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,250
or be the heir, huh?

183
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,600
His Majesty is in the prime of life.

184
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,200
When he has a son,

185
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,170
Zhou Shiyu will not be the heir.

186
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,530
So, you go against the North Prince

187
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,960
not because you want to be the heir,

188
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,130
but because you want to outdo him,

189
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,280
right?

190
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,680
You still don't understand.

191
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,130
I just want to be the heir.

192
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,800
Or why would I

193
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,080
keep embarrassing Zhou Shiyu?

194
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,200
I just want to be the heir.

195
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,730
I just want that.

196
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,250
I just do.

197
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,080
I think

198
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,770
fairness is what you've been striving for.

199
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,530
You want it for a baseborn prince like you.

200
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,180
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

201
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,560
Why is it so bright tonight?

202
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,800
Your Grace,

203
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,560
His Highness has sent the betrothal presents.

204
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,800
Based on local etiquette,

205
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,170
all the red lanterns

206
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,720
should be lighted.

207
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,600
The yellow candles should also
be replaced with red candles.

208
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,960
As if the wedding was being held now.

209
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,050
Her Grace and His Highness

210
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,410
will live a wonderful life.

211
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,250
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

212
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,010
What's this?

213
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,370
Open it and check.

214
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,490
Such a beautiful wedding dress.

215
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,080
When did you have it prepared?

216
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,040
A long time ago.

217
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,200
I had the best local embroiderers make it.

218
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,170
Some imperial maids can also do that.

219
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,720
But I want you to have a special one.

220
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,050
It's thoughtful of you, Shiyu.

221
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,890
Xingyi, what's wrong?

222
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,440
Xingyi.

223
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,680
Xing...

224
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,330
Yueling!

225
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,010
Yueling, go.

226
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:00,890
Yueling.

227
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,250
Shiyu.

228
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,290
Yueling.

229
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,160
Yueling.

230
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,080
Everything was carefully prepared for today.

231
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,970
What on earth went wrong?

232
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,320
Linmu, ask everyone to blow out the candles.

233
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,170
- Hurry!
- Yes!

234
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,770
Qianqian, you go with him. Hurry.

235
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,130
Why?

236
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,320
I guess there's something special

237
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,010
behind our last trip to the future.

238
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,840
The candle is indeed poisonous.

239
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,490
The Cold-stone Poison of the Roufeng Sect.

240
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,210
The candle burns and gives out smoke.

241
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,530
When a man takes in, he'll die quickly.

242
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,050
The Roufeng Sect?

243
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,690
How terrible they are!

244
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,800
A poison on the wedding day.

245
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,160
If we hadn't found it,

246
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,800
we would be all dead.

247
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,200
Taoist Master,

248
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,640
anything unusual from the star observation?

249
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,290
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

250
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,320
What do you mean?

251
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,050
I find that the jade pendants you fear

252
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,080
have lost their magic power.

253
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,360
Are you sure?

254
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,880
God blessed me!

255
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,690
God blessed me!

256
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,970
Zhou Shiyu's jade pendant
has lost its superpower.

257
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,160
And I managed to pit Gao Yuan

258
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,930
against the North Prince and the Emperor.

259
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,010
The Lord of the South will support me.

260
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,930
Everything is under my control.

261
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,210
My big plan will succeed!

262
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,930
It just will!

263
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,100
(Detailed Notes of Military Files)

264
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,560
Your Lordship, the North Prince and his wife

265
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,010
suddenly had all the red candles blown out.

266
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,360
What?

267
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,320
How did they know

268
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,210
the candles were the problem?

269
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,840
I have no idea.

270
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,530
Report.

271
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,450
Mr. Lin Su is here to see you.

272
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,080
Get him in.

273
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,920
Yes.

274
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,050
Your Lordship.

275
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,840
Prime Minister has a message for you.

276
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,640
What His Majesty can't give you,

277
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,400
he can give it to you.

278
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,930
The jade pendants can't be split.

279
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,930
I guess their superpower is gone.

280
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
The pendants have helped us enough.

281
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,160
Next, we'll count on ourselves.

282
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,730
I think we just traveled

283
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,450
to our wedding day.

284
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,290
But we must change it.

285
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,320
Why don't we cancel...?

286
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,160
No.

287
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,080
Aren't you scared?

288
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,610
No.

289
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,730
Since we can't change the future,

290
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,320
why don't we face it together?

291
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,890
All right.

292
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,800
I won't let you die.

293
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,080
Tomorrow is the wedding day.

294
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,530
When the wedding is over,

295
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,730
we'll go see Brother in the palace.

296
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,250
Are you scared?

297
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,290
When you're around, I'm not scared of anything.

298
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,050
After it's over, let's go to Dongyu.

299
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,120
Dongyu?

300
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,560
How did you suddenly think of that?

301
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,210
You're used to living a free life.

302
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,840
There are too many rules in Beishuo.

303
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,930
Why if my wife runs away?

304
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,360
How's that possible?

305
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,840
There are indeed many rules here.

306
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,730
But for you,

307
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,960
I can bear them.

308
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,360
We'll go to Dongyu after the wedding.

309
00:23:58,930 --> 00:23:59,770
Sure.

310
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,920
Oh,

311
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,560
I have to think

312
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,400
about what I'll take you to do in Dongyu.

313
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,290
We can ride a horse on the grassland

314
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,770
and watch the moon.

315
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,640
I can also take you
to herd animals in various tribes.

316
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,370
Really fun.

317
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,570
All right.

318
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,400
We'll do anything you want.

319
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,080
Come on.

320
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,160
Congratulations.

321
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,050
Come in, please.

322
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,480
Congratulations.

323
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,210
Congratulations.

324
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,580
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

325
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Your Grace, you're always gorgeous.

326
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,160
With the headwear and makeup,

327
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,050
you look exceedingly beautiful.

328
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,600
Qianqian does great makeup for me.

329
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,050
When you and Xingyi have the wedding,

330
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,360
I'll have her dress you up.

331
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,080
Shiyu is arriving soon.

332
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,120
Are you ready?

333
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,530
Yes.

334
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,730
Her Grace is dressed up. She can go out.

335
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,010
All right. I'll go block the door.

336
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,970
The makeup is done.

337
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,970
Cover face.

338
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,560
Come on. This way.

339
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,730
Out of the way!

Prime Minister.

First bow to Heaven and Earth!

388
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,010
(Wedding)
Brilliant!

389
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,160
Second bow to seniors!

(Cheng's Mansion)
Bow to each other!

393
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,200
(Wedding)
Nice!

394
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,890

398

(Wedding)

399
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,010
Based on ancestral rules,

400
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,930
Your Highnesses should go to the palace

401
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,770
to greet His Majesty and the Great Consort.

402
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,840
Oh, the wedding.

403
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,320
They're finally getting married.

404
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,720
Never mind.

405
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,930
I'll let him be.

406
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,930
Anyway, Princess Yueling

407
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,840
isn't that wonderful.

408
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,290
Your Highness,

409
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,600
you're thinking right.

410
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,880
But something is weird today.

411
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,690
I requested to go to the palace,

412
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,320
but it hasn't been approved yet.

413
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,970
And His Majesty should have summoned me

414
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,530
for the family banquet in the palace.

415
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,400
No way.

416
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,770
I have to go and check.

417
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,330
Your Highness,

418
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,250
something serious will happen in the court.

419
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,880
I advise you not to go there.

420
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,450
I'm just going for something serious.

421
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,570
Eat some of this.

422
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,370
Your Highness.

423
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,500
(Detian Gate)

424
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,090
Don't worry.

425
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,530
Everything is arranged.

426
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,560
Whether alive or dead,

427
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,530
we'll be together.

428
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,130
Your Highness,

429
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,840
here we are.

430
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,730
Yueling,

431
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,930
I'll let nothing happen to you.

432
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,730
Send Yueling to the Great Consort's house.

433
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,970
Stick to our plan.

434
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,440
Yes.

435
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,940
(Royal Decree)

436
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,300
(Abdicate to the Prime Minister...)

437
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,010
Good.

438
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,080
Really good.

439
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,680
Prime Minister, are you being so impatient?

440
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,530
Shiyu, you've finally come.

441
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,050
Today is your wedding day.

442
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,880
I'm being a rude emperor.

443
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,970
Congratulations, Shiyu.

444
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,970
I think I should congratulate you.

445
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,490
Me?

446
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,050
Congratulations, Prime Minister,

447
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,600
for usurping the throne as you always want.

448
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,640
What are you talking about?

449
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,640
The throne should have been mine!

450
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,640
For our state,

451
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,970
I fought everywhere for sovereignty

452
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,330
and made a great deed in battle!

453
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,120
In the end, I had to assist a child emperor.

454
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,560
If you were me,

455
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,600
would you accept that?

456
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,530
What did you do to my brother?

457
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,850
Oh, your brother

458
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,120
has been weak since little.

459
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,370
Today, he suddenly had a stroke

460
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,410
and summoned me hurriedly.

461
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,080
Before he died,

462
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:08,200
he wrote this abdication decree personally.

463
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,200
A load of nonsense!

464
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Brother would never abdicate to you!

465
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,620
(Royal Decree)

466
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,450
Look carefully.

467
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,240
It has the Emperor's seal.

468
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,050
Zhou Shiyu,

469
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,640
you'd better be smart.

470
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,370
Do not rebel, will you?

471
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,280
Usurper!

472
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,450
You're the real usurper!

473
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,280
Somebody! Take his down!

474
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,440
So, Yuan,

475
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,280
this is your final decision.

476
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,330
Shiyu,

477
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,680
you'd better know which way the wind blows.

478
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,490
Now, I'm in charge of the palace guards.

479
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,200
And families of our ministers

480
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,720
have been imprisoned by me.

481
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,080
Everything is under my control.

482
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,640
What actually

483
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,120
can a mere prince like you do?

484
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,050
Gao Yuan, take him down.

485
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,050
Take down the traitor!

486
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,220
(Hall of Politics)

487
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,560
Gao Yuan, you!

488
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,640
Zhou Jingyuan is rebelling!

489
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,850
Take him down!

490
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,890
I dare you!

491
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,490
I have the Emperor's decree.

492
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,810
I'll see who dares to fight me.

493
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,200
It's just a fake decree.

494
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,490
Prime Minister, don't take it seriously.

495
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,280
Your soldiers

496
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,050
are mine now.

497
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,240
Speaking of this,

498
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,200
I should thank you for trusting me.

499
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,250
Gao Yuan,

500
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,200
you sneaky man.

501
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,970
How could you change sides?

502
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,050
Why would I change sides?

503
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,600
I never want to be loyal to anyone.

504
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,530
I want to be my own master.

505
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,120
Somebody.

506
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,200
Somebody...

507
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,120
The spy Ping'er you planted in my house

508
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,760
was hanged by me.

509
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,850
My sister is still in a coma.

510
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,720
I'll pray for her

511
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,720
with your life

512
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,680
