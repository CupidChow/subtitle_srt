=Episode 17=

19
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,890
Zhou Shiyu and the Princess of Dongyu

20
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,480
indeed have something fishy.

21
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,970
Under my nose,

22
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,480
they found the pastry was poisoned.

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,330
Can the two of them foresee something?

24
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,450
They do have a superpower.

25
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,200
Superpower?

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,960
What witchcraft is it?

27
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,480
Not witchcraft.

28
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,800
Their superpower

29
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,290
comes from the jade pendants.

30
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,410
Jade pendants?

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,680
If I see it right,

32
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,200
the North Prince and the Princess

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,050
own the One-love Pendant
made of the Galaxy Divine Jade.

34
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,480
One jade in two pieces.

35
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,480
According to the legend,
those who own the pendant

36
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,170
are destined to be together.

37
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,170
So, they have some adventures.

38
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,680
According to you,

39
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,080
Zhou Shiyu and the Princess of Dongyu

40
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,360
can foresee things

41
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,730
because of the One-love Pendant?

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Exactly.

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,730
If I take it forcibly,

44
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,890
can I make it work for me?

45
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,570
This jade has accepted its masters.

46
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,760
Even if you have it,

47
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,680
you can't use its superpower.

48
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,640
Others can't use the superpower
of the One-love Pendant.

49
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,760
But if we can keep them apart,

50
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,680
they won't be able to use the jade pieces.

51
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,980
(Benign and Benevolent)

52
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,240
Why do you not let me go?

53
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,520
Because you're from Dongyu.

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,960
How could you give such a poor present?

55
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,010
Dongyu people are so shortsighted.

56
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,410
You were aggrieved at the banquet.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,050
I was too ill-considered.

58
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,770
Your Highness,

59
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,650
your family banquet is quite wonderful.

60
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,970
The poison case

61
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,320
can't be handled on site
for the imperial image.

62
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,290
Brother asked me to calm you down.

63
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,880
He'll make it right one day.

64
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,850
If you're angry,

65
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,170
beat me or curse me

66
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,240
the way you want.

67
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,800
As long as you can calm down.

68
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,050
Come on.

69
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,410
I don't ever care

70
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,920
about the poison case.

71
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,680
We've experienced a lot, after all.

72
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,970
But I was mocked by the noble girls,

73
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,000
misunderstood by the Great Consort

74
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,120
and bullied by your naughty cousin,

75
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,170
only because I'm the Princess of Dongyu!

76
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,970
Even a princess like me has to suffer this.

77
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,850
Have you thought about what life

78
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,680
my people are living in Beishuo?

79
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,170
Can you understand?

80
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,490
Yueling,

81
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,050
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,480
You did nothing wrong.

83
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,240
Actually, you Beishuo people

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,210
look down upon my state.

85
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,170
So, you think less of me, too.

86
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,090
But in this case,

87
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,560
neither you nor I can change anything.

88
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,000
So,

89
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,290
our marriage

90
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,170
isn't that necessary.

91
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,260
(Hall of Politics)

92
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,480
Since I took the throne,

93
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,770
wars have been over.

94
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,650
But with continuous famine,
the treasury is empty.

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,120
Now, I want it to be recharged.

96
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,050
Do you have any good ideas?

97
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,000
Your Majesty, in my opinion,

98
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,650
to recharge the treasury,

99
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,290
we can start with the merchant system.

100
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,370
Your Majesty,

101
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,610
I agree with the Minister.

102
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,610
In the past few years, we've been
emphasizing agriculture over commerce.

103
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,210
That's why our treasury is empty.

104
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,530
Ridiculous.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,840
Your Majesty,

106
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,360
forget about the merchant system.

107
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,850
Our border is turbulent now.

108
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,480
To show our great power,

109
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,120
we should lead the troops
to destroy those small states

110
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,680
before we develop business.

111
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,610
This is the core principle.

112
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,440
- Yeah.
- It makes sense.

113
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,480
Prime Minister has a point.

114
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,970
Yeah. He has a point.

115
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,440
The treasury is empty.

116
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,320
If we start a war now,

117
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,650
our state will be in trouble.

118
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,680
His Highness has a point, too.

119
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,880
- Yeah.
- It's not time for war.

120
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,250
Your Majesty,

121
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,610
speaking of recharging the treasury,

122
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,850
(Management Policy for the West Market)
I'll report something.

123
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,780
(Reported by Zhou Shiyu)

124
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,440
Shiyu, you want to make the West Market

125
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,800
a special area for merchants of all states?

126
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,080
No way.

127
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,320
Our state emphasizes agriculture.

128
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,090
We even have a lot of restrictions

129
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,360
to our local merchants.

130
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,440
Why will we give favorable policies
to foreign merchants?

131
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,410
This policy seems to favor the other states.

132
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,970
But for our state,

133
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,200
there will also be a large sum of revenue.

134
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Now, many merchants from foreign states

135
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
have been on the market.

136
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,170
Sadly, they can only do business in the dark.

137
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,250
In this case, we can't tax them.

138
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,600
If we have a new policy

139
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,200
to make foreign merchants do business,

140
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
the management will be easier

141
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,080
and we can charge more taxes.

142
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,320
This will not only recharge our treasury

143
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,080
but also show the generosity of our state.

144
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,560
Isn't it the best of both worlds?

145
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,490
It's a good idea.

146
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,530
- That's right.
- Yeah.

147
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,050
Your Majesty, I think this is a great idea.

148
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,080
His Highness's opinion is rather admirable.

149
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,560
- Yeah.
- That's right.

150
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,730
Your Majesty,

151
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,490
as far as I see,

152
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,680
we're not sure

153
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,770
if the rising taxes will recharge the treasury.

154
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,560
But Shiyu must be proposing this

155
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,770
to flatter the Princess of Dongyu.

156
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,600
It's pretty sure.

157
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,050
He wants to flatter a lady

158
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,720
with national policies.

159
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,920
Isn't it

160
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,170
inappropriate?

161
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,530
Your Majesty, I want to share your burden,

162
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,320
recharge our treasury,

163
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,010
and improve the tax system

164
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,680
for the sake of our stability.

165
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,410
Please kindly understand.

166
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,320
You both have a point.

167
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,250
I'll take some time

168
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,250
to think about it.

169
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,960
In today's court,

170
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,010
Shiyu dared to argue with me.

171
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,370
The young emperor didn't stop him at all.

172
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,370
Since he came back from Liuzhou,

173
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,920
Zhou Shiyu

174
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,290
has been more arrogant.

175
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,530
Because of the One-love Pendant,

176
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,680
we can't kill them.

177
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,800
Because they're engaged,

178
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,250
we can't break them up.

179
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,050
We must not act rashly

180
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,490
in case of alerting them.

181
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,960
I don't want explanations.

182
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,650
I just want

183
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,840
solutions!

184
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,370
Since Su Nian is familiar with them,

185
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,410
how about we make her stay undercover

186
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,290
and take action when possible?

187
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,200
Get going.

188
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,370
My patience is waning.

189
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
Yes.

190
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,720
Yueling,

191
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,920
will you really not see him?

192
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,080
He comes every day

193
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,530
and gives you various presents.

194
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,680
I think

195
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,010
he's nice to you.

196
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,170
Her Grace was startled

197
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,320
at his family banquet.

198
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,050
He's caring for Her Grace

199
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,440
because he's guilty, I think.

200
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,330
Your Grace,

201
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,320
have some maltose.

202
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,960
Is it from him, too?

203
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,650
Yueling, I don't think

204
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,560
the North Prince did anything wrong.

205
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,560
Stop being angry, will you?

206
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,680
It's also bad for your health, right?

207
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,040
Right.

208
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,490
It makes sense.

209
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,320
Someone else bullied me.

210
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
I shouldn't blame it on him.

211
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,010
Qianqian, if he comes again,

212
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,490
don't stop him.

213
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,840
I won't, Your Grace.

214
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,050
These days,

215
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,680
why have you not seen Miss Su Nian?

216
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,410
Nothing. Just...

217
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,050
Well, Yueling,

218
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,960
you've been unwell.

219
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
I want to keep you company.

220
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,490
Tell me the truth.

221
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,200
Su Nian refuses to see me.

222
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,130
I don't know why.

223
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,440
It's so hard to guess
what a Beishuo girl thinks.

224
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,890
I really don't understand.

225
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,130
So, you just don't see her?

226
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,490
That's not true. I visited her for days,

227
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,920
but she shut me out all the time.

228
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,320
Even I'm fed up.

229
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,890
You have so little patience.

230
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,010
If I were Miss Su Nian,

231
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,530
I wouldn't see you, either.

232
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,650
As far as I see,

233
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,890
Miss Su Nian

234
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,890
has feelings for you.

235
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,010
If she doesn't,

236
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,600
she can just ignore you.

237
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,050
Why does she avoid you?

238
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,800
Maybe something's bothering her

239
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,080
that she hasn't got through.

240
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,010
Are you sure, Yueling?

241
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,560
You're too close to it.

242
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,770
Just think about it.

243
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,890
Bothering her?

244
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,650
Bothering.

245
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,900
(Benign and Benevolent)

246
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,530
(I don't think she can be past all this)

247
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,490
(until I solve the problem of her clansmen.)

248
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,640
Your Highness,

249
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,490
why do you not get in when you're here?

250
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,490
Hey, Your Highness.

251
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,720
What have you got today?

252
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,320
Can you have someone else do this mission?

253
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,530
Give me a reason.

254
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,680
I'm not able to go undercover.

255
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,840
This is the simplest mission.

256
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,530
If you can't do it,

257
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,490
I'm afraid no one else can.

258
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,370
I'll pretend you didn't say that.

259
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,840
But do yourself a favor,

260
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,130
do not wish for something you don't deserve.

261
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,130
Su Nian,

262
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,410
are you having

263
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,370
true feelings for that silly prince?

264
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,890
No.

265
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,290
Whether you admit it or not,

266
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,490
you can't reject Master's mission.

267
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,320
Don't you want to overturn
the case of your dead family?

268
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,290
I even dream about doing that.

269
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,650
But I don't want to hurt Xingyi.

270
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,130
Father,

271
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,760
Mother,

272
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,010
I'm not a good daughter.

273
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,490
After all these years,

274
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,560
I still can't overturn your case.

275
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,200
To overturn the case,

276
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,010
I need the support from the Prime Minister.

277
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,890
Over all these years,

278
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I've been doing
whatever mission the Prime Minister gives me.

279
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,800
But if I have to keep using Xingyi,

280
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
I really don't want that.

281
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,530
But if I don't use him,

282
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,720
how can I win the Prime Minister's trust?

283
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,290
Your Grace,

284
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,320
you can't skip meals.

285
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,490
I made you some dishes.

286
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,440
Eat some, Your Grace.

287
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:46,960
Your Grace,

288
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,050
still worried about Dongyu men?

289
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,250
I can't think of a good idea for now.

290
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,890
I'm so useless.

291
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,480
Oh.

292
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,490
Why haven't I seen the North Prince lately?

293
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,290
So, you're missing His Highness.

294
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,290
Who said that?

295
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,690
I was just wondering.

296
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,360
I heard about it from Linmu.

297
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,050
His Highness has been busy with work.

298
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,250
He often visits the palace
and discusses with His Majesty.

299
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,120
I guess after his work is done,

300
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,730
he'll come and see you, Your Grace.

301
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,560
What business

302
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,770
has kept him so busy?

303
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,250
(Is he actually mad at me?)

304
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,050
Brother,

305
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,600
the policy for the West Market

306
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,800
is indeed a good way to recharge the treasury.

307
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,600
I've visited many lords these days.

308
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,490
They support this policy, too.

309
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,400
But for fear of Uncle's power,

310
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
they don't dare to support in the court.

311
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,160
Shiyu,

312
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,640
what you want to do

313
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,050
has been my heartsickness, too.

314
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,880
But now, Uncle still has great power.

315
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,880
I don't think we can push through it.

316
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,210
I understand.

317
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,600
But there's no turning back.

318
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,970
I will have a perfect plan

319
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,360
before I report it.

320
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,010
(I guess she's no longer angry.)

321
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,680
Come in.

322
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,840
I... I thought

323
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,120
you would never see me again.

324
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,080
Friends quarrel sometimes.

325
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,160
But we know each other well.

326
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,010
So, nothing will be a problem forever.

327
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,250
Do you agree, Xingyi?

328
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,570
Yes.

329
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,320
Yes, if you say so.

330
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,690
(Why on earth is this happening?)

331
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,050
(She plays hard to get.)

332
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,580
(The West Market)

333
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,250
What's wrong with the two of you?

334
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,080
You kept sighing in the mansion.

335
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,770
When we're out here for fun, be happy.

336
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,800
Oh, I heard about a new lipstick store in town.

337
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,120
Shall we enter and look around?

338
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,290
Lipstick store? What lipsticks?

339
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,130
Take me there.

340
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,250
Your Highness,

341
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,080
buy something for Miss Su Nian again, huh?

342
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,360
You've given her a lot of things lately.

343
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,050
If you keep giving like this,

344
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,450
we can hardly afford it.

345
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,640
Let's just go.

346
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,690
I'd like to have a look.

347
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,210
Yueling, Qianqian, you pick some, too.

348
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,600
All right. Let's go.

349
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,010
There are a wide range of colors

350
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,930
and they smell great, too.

351
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,770
Miss,

352
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,160
you have good taste.

353
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,600
The vermilion

354
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,640
suits your lady most.

355
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,480
Of course.

356
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,690
My lady is fair-skinned with black hair.

357
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,880
All the colors suit her.

358
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,840
On my lady's lips,

359
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,880
your lipstick

360
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,080
will look better.

361
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,560
You're right, Miss.

362
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,010
Miss, you're straightforward

363
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,160
and pretty.

364
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,210
The crimson matches you best.

365
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,160
Check this. Do you like it?

366
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,490
We'll take it, too.

367
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,970
What's the difference between the two colors?

368
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,800
Why do I think they look the same?

369
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,640
Gentleman,

370
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,120
you have no idea.

371
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,560
Girls in this world

372
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,400
are totally different.

373
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,800
So, different colors

374
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,160
matches them separately.

375
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,120
The girl I buy this for plays hard to get.

376
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,250
- Su Nian.
- Sometimes, she's passionate.

377
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,970
Sometimes, she's cold.

378
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,960
Yeah.

379
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,490
Which one matches her?

380
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,160
Gentleman, based on your description,

381
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,880
this color matches her best.

382
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,360
Rose carmine.

383
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,880
It matches her best, I think.

384
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,250
Rose carmine?

385
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,090
One isn't enough.

386
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,130
This one...

387
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,940
And all these. Pack them for me.

388
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,800
- Really?
- Yes.

389
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,600
Xingyi, you're way too rich, huh?

390
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,450
It's not the way we buy lipsticks.

391
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,390
We'll just pick the best one.

392
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,260
Pick something else.

393
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,120
All right.

394
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,800
Then I'll take this,

395
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,290
rose carmine.

396
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,130
Fine.

397
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,010
Sir, pack these three.

398
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,080
All right.

399
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,640
I'll pack them for you.

400
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,730
I'll go check it.

401
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,050
Yueling, why do you want this much?

402
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,080
I'm your elder sister.

403
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,240
Stay out of my business.

404
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,290
Ping'er,

405
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,730
didn't you say this store

406
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,970
only sold classy lipsticks?

407
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,120
Why do I see

408
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,250
some coarse guys standing in it?

409
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,010
Your Grace.

410
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,170
- Who do you mean?
- I don't know why they are here.

411
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,160
Xingyi,

412
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,570
don't be rude.

413
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,880
This is Princess Luoyi of Beishuo.

414
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,450
She just finished being grounded.

415
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,160
I guess it feels bad to be grounded.

416
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,530
- I...
- Let's try to understand.

417
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,450
You little vixen!

418
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,560
For you,

419
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,490
Shiyu put us all into the abandoned palace.

420
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,350
About this,

421
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,560
I've told my brother, the Lord of the South.

422
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,770
When he's back, he'll do me justice!

423
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,450
(The abandoned palace?)

424
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,530
You must be scared, huh?

425
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Yes, I am.

426
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,800
I'm scared

427
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,290
that you may be grounded again.

428
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,970
I have things to do. Excuse me.

429
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,210
Ashina Zhu!

430
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,490
What are you looking at?

431
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,730
Come over here.

432
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,320
Didn't you hear I was calling you?

433
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,640
You cheap slave.

434
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,250
It hurts. Let go of me.

435
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,770
Let me go!

436
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,290
Your Grace.

437
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,080
Qiyun, what are you doing here?

438
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,290
Your Highness, Mr. Huang sold me to Her Grace.

439
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,360
This is my new slave.

440
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,320
Let me introduce her.

441
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,010
Her name is Ashina Zhu.

442
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,160
What a coincidence!

443
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,900
How dare you humiliate my sister?

444
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,010
How much did you pay for her?

445
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,240
I'll buy her.

446
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
But I won't sell her to you.

447
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,930
If you don't,

448
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,250
I'll tell the North Prince

449
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,400
you deliberately name your slave

450
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,210
with his wife's name.

451
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,010
I don't care, you know.

452
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,970
I just wonder what he will do.

453
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,050
Will he put you into the abandoned palace

454
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,120
or somewhere else?

455
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,880
That's unclear.

456
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,720
You...

457
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,970
A thousand taels. Can you afford it?

458
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,530
If you do, I'll sell her to you.

459
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,450
A thousand taels?

460
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,730
Why don't you just rob us?

461
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,720
Fine.

462
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,970
I'll pay a thousand taels.

463
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,450
Let's meet here in two days.

464
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,600
I give you the money and you give me her.

465
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,560
A thousand taels. Not even a single tael less.

466
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,320
Deal. By then, give me her indenture, too.

467
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
Deal.

468
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,530
I'll wait until you pay

469
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,360
and take Ashina Zhu back.

470
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,770
Ashina Zhu, go with me.

471
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,160
Didn't you hear me?

472
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,250
The jewels and banknotes

473
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,530
aren't enough.

474
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,050
Yueling,

475
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,290
here I am.

476
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,400
Yueling,

477
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,880
I can pawn these.

478
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,970
They're worth some money, I think.

479
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,690
These are your favorite things.

480
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,800
Keep them.

481
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,800
No problem, Yueling.

482
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,730
Saving Qiyun matters more.

483
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,250
But Your Highness,

484
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,160
these things aren't worth too much.

485
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,250
If I had known, I would have bought less.

486
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:33,810
Your Grace.

487
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,640
How about we ask the North Prince for help?

488
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,200
No.

489
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,770
He's been too busy lately.

490
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,530
What do we do, then?

491
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,160
We'll think of a way by ourselves.

492
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,250
These two, then.

493
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,160
Your Highness, the lipstick shopkeeper is here.

494
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,800
How's the business lately?

495
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,450
Your Highness,

496
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,690
the lipstick business is good.

497
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,490
All the noble ladies in the Capital City

498
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,120
want to have a lipstick in our store.

499
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,930
I told you.

500
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,880
I'm always right.

501
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,840
It's wise of you.

502
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,010
Since you took over the business,

503
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,530
money has been coming through.

504
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,920
Enough.

505
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,250
I'm tired of the money-making thing.

506
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,800
Is there any other news?

507
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,530
Other news... Oh, there is.

508
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,050
Yesterday, the North Princess Consort
and Princess Luoyi

509
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,970
visited our store successively.

510
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,770
Unexpectedly,

511
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,880
they quarreled for a Dongyu slave named Qiyun.

512
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,320
Princess Luoyi sold this slave

513
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,360
to Her Highness
at the price of a thousand taels.

514
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,120
Her Highness even accepted it.

515
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,490
A thousand taels?

516
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,330
Yes.

517
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,770
Gao Luoyi even does better business than me.

518
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,080
The Princess of Dongyu must be ripped up.

519
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,240
Umm...

520
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,920
Your Highness,

521
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,050
she may also like our lipsticks.

522
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,400
Why don't you go give her some?

523
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,290
She is rather cunning.

524
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,640
I...

525
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,440
I'm not going.

526
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Then will you just be beaten
by the North Prince?

527
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Will you watch them have a sweet relationship?

528
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,360
Even thinking of that upset me.

529
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,330
Xu.

530
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,840
Get me a carriage. I'm going to see her.

531
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,850
All right.

532
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,160
Yours looks great.

533
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,250
Your Grace,

534
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,730
these are jewels

535
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,400
the Eldest Princess gave you.

536
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,050
Will you really pawn then?

537
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,970
When I have money,

538
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,490
I'll ransom them.

539
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,880
Your Grace, is the money thing bothering you?

540
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,690
Your Highness?

541
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,880
What are you doing here?

542
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,050
You're amazed at my appearance, I think.

543
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,210
- I...
- Be patient.

544
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,730
There's a bigger surprise.

545
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,010
Look, look.

546
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,120
Here are the lipsticks in our store.

547
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,600
A wide variety of colors and kinds.

548
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,840
Throughout the Capital City,

549
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,320
they're the most popular.

550
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,690
Diexuan Store is yours?

551
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,290
Looks like my store is indeed well-known.

552
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,080
Even the famous Princess of Dongyu

553
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,160
knows about it.

554
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,250
Yeah. It's wise of you, Your Highness.

555
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,240
Staring?

556
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,160
Just some small things.

557
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,400
No big deal.

558
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,920
Oh,

559
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,360
you said you were short of money.

560
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,640
Come to me, then.

561
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,210
But you won't give me money.

562
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,240
Give you money...

563
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,770
Well, I won't.

564
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,530
But if you want to borrow some,

565
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,560
I'll think about it.

566
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,970
Lend me a thousand taels, then.

567
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,600
Why do you not borrow it from Zhou Shiyu?

568
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,360
He isn't as rich as you.

569
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
I love to hear this.

570
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,080
Hurry. Give Her Grace the money.

571
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,920
Come on.

572
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,960
Yes, Your Highness.

573
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,450
Write an IOU.

574
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,380
(IOU by Ashina Zhu)

575
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,960
Your Highness,

576
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,120
how could you

577
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,160
lend her a thousand taels so easily?

578
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,320
Well, you don't understand.

579
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,600
Zhou Shiyu loves her so much.

580
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,640
They often flirt in front of me.

581
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,560
If I show this IOU

582
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,730
to Zhou Shiyu,

583
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,210
he'll know his beloved woman

584
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,210
borrowed money from me instead of him.

585
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,530
He'll be upset, won't he?

586
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,160
The money I have lent her

587
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,010
is worth it!

588
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,530
Even thinking of it amuses me.

589
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,120
Check this.

590
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,050
A thousand taels.

591
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,840
Ping'er, release her.

592
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,050
I didn't expect you to have so much money.

593
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,120
Qiyun, let's go.

594
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,010
Wait.

595
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,840
You love to buy slaves, huh?

596
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,400
Won't you buy these?

597
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,600
I bought some more slaves on a whim.

598
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,970
- You...
- They happen to be from Dongyu, too.

599
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,010
How about you buy them back?

600
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,690
You're going too far!

601
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,530
You have ten days to raise money.

602
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,370
What do you say?

603
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,010
Deal.

604
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:38,540
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

605
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,770
What is he doing here?

606
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,320
I don't know.

607
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,050
But according to Butler Wen,

608
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,880
the South Prince has been

609
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,160
waiting here for you for two hours.

610
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,890
Oh, Shiyu.

611
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,130
Come over here.

612
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,600
(Talent)
Are you short of money?

613
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,640
Tell me if you're in trouble.

614
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,400
I have nothing

615
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,160
but a lot of money.

616
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,250
What brings you here?

617
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,400
Still pretending?

618
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,400
(IOU)
The Princess of Dongyu borrowed money from me.

619
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,730
You must be short of money.

620
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,490
Look at you.

621
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,120
(By Ashina Zhu)
If you can't support her,

622
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,290
why do you still keep her?

623
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,770
In my opinion,

624
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,290
why don't you send her to my house?

625
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,600
There are interesting people,

626
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,880
delicious food, and cool things.

627
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,640
And always enough pocket money.

628
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,400
Send her to my house.

629
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,050
I promise I'll make her

630
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,210
as chubby as Piggy.

631
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,730
I can take care of my consort.

632
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,730
Zhixuan, if you really

633
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,010
have too much money,

634
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,840
you can tell His Majesty

635
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,080
that you want to donate some.

636
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,600
The treasury is short of money, you know.

637
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,560
That's not necessary.

638
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,930
I can spend the money.

639
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,250
But if I donate some,

640
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,800
it'll disappear

641
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,400
without leaving a trace.

642
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,010
Since you don't want to donate,

643
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,970
say no more.

644
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,560
I have a business to do.

645
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,730
I'm done talking to you.

646
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,290
Linmu, give him a thousand taels back.

647
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,440
Yes.

648
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:25,010
You can keep the purse, too.

649
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:29,580
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

650
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,450
See?

651
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
I upset Zhou Shiyu again.

652
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,210
It's wise of you, Your Highness.

653
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,600
Xu,

654
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,560
tell our chefs

655
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,400
to make more dishes for dinner.

656
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,450
We'll have a celebration!

657
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,730
Yes, Your Highness.

658
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,210
Let's have one more dish for Piggy, too!

659
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,320
Yeah! Have more dishes for Piggy!

660
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:02,020
(IOU by Ashina Zhu)

661
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,840
Have you settled Qiyun down?

662
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,450
Rest assured, Yueling. She's settled.

663
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,320
Only ten days.

664
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,640
How can we raise so much money?

665
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,690
Yeah, Your Grace.

666
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,210
The South Prince lent some to us

667
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,160
and we don't know how to pay him back yet.

668
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,640
Do we have to borrow some from him again?

669
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,490
Maybe

670
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:02,840
we can make a fortune with his help.

671
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,080
Yueling, do you have an idea?

672
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:06,890
Come over.

673
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,080
I haven't seen you for days.

674
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,850
Are you in the middle of something?

675
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:32,730
Don't mention it.

676
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,890
What happened?

677
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,330
Can you tell me about it?

678
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,890
Maybe I can help.

679
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,330
That is...

680
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,560
Forget it.

681
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,480
Oh,

682
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,930
this is for you.

683
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:57,640
Lipstick from Diexuan Store?

684
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,770
Yeah.

685
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,240
The shopkeeper said

686
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,050
this rose carmine was perfect for you.

687
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,490
Check if you like it.

688
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,850
I do.

689
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,170
That's great.

690
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,410
So, I picked the right present.

691
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,720
My sister and Qianqian also like

692
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,560
lipsticks of this store.

693
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,240
Well, I haven't seen Her Grace for a while.

694
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,720
How's she doing?

695
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,410
She's been busy doing business.

696
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,200
Business?

697
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,560
Yeah. She'll sell lipsticks on the West Market.

698
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,280
Business on the West Market is isolated.

699
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,010
She can hardly sell smoothly.

700
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:32,530
So, she wants you to do her a favor.

701
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:37,690
Siyuan,

702
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,530
(Talent)
we'll count on you.

703
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,600
Why are the two of you...?

704
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,680
This is

705
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,080
my new business partner.

706
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,120
You want me

707
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,050
to paint

708
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:57,970
on the lipstick pots

709
00:35:59,010 --> 00:35:59,850
of different colors?

710
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,720
Now, we have five popular colors,

711
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,530
vermilion, crimson,

712
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,680
rose carmine,

713
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,760
cerise,

714
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,010
and waxberry red.

715
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,410
Mr. Perfect,

716
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,720
you just need to do five small paintings a day.

717
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,640
Only five pots are available
for limited selling.

718
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,010
His Highness and I will go fifty-fifty

719
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,050
on the profits.

720
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,850
Limited selling?

721
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,050
This is a great idea.

722
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,680
But I need some time

723
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,490
to think about the five paintings.

724
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,640
It's not urgent. Take your time.

725
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,600
When you figure it out,

726
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,890
Qianqian and I will have the news spread

727
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:33,830
to generate a lot of buzz.

728
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,280
The price and reputation will be established.

729
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,200
Clever young girl.

730
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,280
Today, I got you here

731
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,560
to discuss the West Market thing.

732
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,160
Shiyu drafted the Management Policy
for the West Market.

733
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,240
It lists the detailed enforcement
of the new policy.

734
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,680
(Management Policy)
You check it

735
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,720
and comment.

736
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,340
(Management Policy for the West Market)

737
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,060
(Reported by Zhou Shiyu)

738
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,850
This is too risky.

739
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,120
What if foreign merchants on the West Market

740
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,410
harm the interests

741
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,490
of native merchants?

742
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,330
Don't worry, Uncle.

743
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,760
Only a prosperous market
with different merchants

744
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,410
can boost economic growth.

745
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,970
No competition, no progress.

746
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,370
We can't hurt the foundation of our state

747
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,720
just to recharge the treasury.

748
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,810
Any ideas, the rest of you?

749
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,760
Your Majesty, I think

750
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,050
the North Prince's management policy

751
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,720
has been well thought out.

752
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,930
It's indeed a good way
to collect commercial tax.

753
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,680
Since the disaster relief in Liuzhou,

754
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,330
the treasury has had financial troubles.

755
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,240
It's really necessary to establish

756
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,160
a reasonable system of tax collection.

757
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,720
I just wonder if it's hard to manage

758
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,930
when foreign merchants
are allowed to do business.

759
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,810
On the West Market,
soldiers and merchants often fight.

760
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,530
If the new policy is enforced,

761
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,240
the security thing may be a problem.

762
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,330
The West Market is a lawless area.

763
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,640
It allows no new policy.

764
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,490
For the management,

765
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,760
I'll assist the Ministry of Revenue

766
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,810
and the Capital Government.

767
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,680
The West Market is chaotic.

768
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,240
For the enforcement of the new policy,

769
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,160
we'll discuss later.

770
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,490
Shiyu, you assist the Ministry of Revenue

771
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,970
and manage the Capital Government

772
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,970
to keep the public security on the West Market.

773
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

774
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,200
This lipstick has such a good shade.

775
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,120
It smells good, too.

776
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:52,930
More than that.

777
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,640
Its color, smell, and shade

778
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
are all the best.

779
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,120
The style also looks special.

780
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,120
The lipstick you recommend is good.

781
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,560
But it's a little bit expensive.

782
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,400
However,

783
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,850
it has Mr. Siyuan's painting on the pot.

784
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,720
It's worth the money.

785
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,240
You're right, Qing'er.

786
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,530
This lipstick is a new product

787
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,760
that gets popular in town.

788
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,760
Fancy dye and balsam

789
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,080
are used in it.

790
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,720
And no girls in other houses

791
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,160
have this kind of lipstick now.

792
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,760
After I tried some,
I recommended it to you immediately.

793
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,010
So,

794
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,370
girls in our house

795
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,200
are the first few girls to use it, huh?

796
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,370
Yes, of course.

797
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,560
When I find something good,

798
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,600
I'd first recommend it to you, my friends.

799
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,450
You're always nice to us, Su Nian.

800
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,450
Every time you get something,

801
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,530
you think of us first.

802
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,890
Shuixian, lend me yours.

803
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,800
No.

804
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,970
If you want it, buy one on the West Market.

805
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,760
Shuixian, you're the best.

806
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,240
- I won't give you.
- Lend it to me.

807
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,810
Your Highness, be careful.

808
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,200
- Greetings.
- Where's Yueling?

809
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,050
Your Highness,

810
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,050
(Benign and Benevolent)
she's been at Mr. Qin's house.

811
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,850
Sometimes, she isn't even back for dinner.

812
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,560
Your Highness, Rushuang and I will do our work.

813
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,010
Summon us if you want anything.

814
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,530
Great. With Mr. Perfect's paintings,

815
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,330
our lipsticks will sell very well.

816
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,930
With so many profits,

817
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,200
we can save more Dongyu girls.

818
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,850
This isn't a long-term solution.

819
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,810
I want to save more Dongyu people.

820
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,330
Then we have to make more money.

821
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,330
It's not time to celebrate yet.

822
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,280
The West Market doesn't have too many visitors.

823
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,890
And vendors don't dare to sell goods

824
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,760
in a big way.

825
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,080
Good wine needs no bush.

826
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,600
On the pot of our lipstick

827
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,890
is Mr. Perfect's painting.

828
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,560
