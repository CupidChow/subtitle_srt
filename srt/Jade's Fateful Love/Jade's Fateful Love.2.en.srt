19
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,130
How could you leave me to die?

20
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,810
I got you out of the water, didn't I?

21
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,060
You should have given me
mouth-to-mouth in the first place.

22
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,900
Just now, I...

23
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,660
I thought you were resourceful enough

24
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,620
to save your own life.

25
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,780
Where are you going?

26
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,130
To get some food.

27
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,250
Hey, wait for me.

28
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,660
I didn't expect you
to be so good at catching fish.

29
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,060
And you roast it perfectly.

30
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
Looks like

31
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,940
it's not that bad to have fallen

32
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,850
into the water with you.

33
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,180
I can enjoy some roast fish.

34
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,780
Are you saying it's bad
to fall into the water with me?

35
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,570
I... I don't mean that.

36
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,410
Then what do you mean?

37
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,900
Never mind.

38
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,460
Think about it.

39
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,220
You and I survived together.

40
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,060
I deserve

41
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,220
some of your roast fish...

42
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,220
Don't I?

43
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,620
Ah?

44
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,530
Take some yourself.

45
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,400
Or do you want me to feed you?

46
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,250
Oh.

47
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,990
Maybe I have a look at your jade pendant?

48
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,220
Your pendant

49
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,850
looks really like mine.

50
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,940
Indeed.

51
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,100
This is a whole piece.

52
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,170
Oh, they belong together.

53
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,100
How did you get this pendant?

54
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,850
My mother gave it to me.

55
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,490
Did she tell you anything about it?

56
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,730
What about yours?

57
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,220
I got my pendant

58
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,850
from a traveling necromancer.

59
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,490
He said

60
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,660
it would get me into some adventures.

61
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,020
Adventures?

62
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,290
So, we survived so many assassinations

63
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,530
because of this pendant?

64
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,140
I guess so.

65
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,100
When the jade pendants are combined,

66
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,140
there will be adventures.

67
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,730
Is it that as long as we stay together,

68
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,660
we won't die?

69
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,140
We don't die now.

70
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,820
But it doesn't mean we won't die.

71
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,020
(The necromancer also said,)

72
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,850
(the combination of the pendants
will bring peace to this world.)

73
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,250
Chief,

74
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,140
the Princess of Dongyu has run away.

75
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,460
We're searching for her separately.

76
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,990
Members of the Dongyu escort
were almost dead or injured.

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,190
(Nan Xun, assassin of the Roufeng Sect)
Some remnant guards escaped.

78
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,460
Within one day,

79
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,460
you must find the Princess of Dongyu,

80
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,930
whether she's alive or dead.

81
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,620
If you fail,

82
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,340
don't come back to me.

83
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,370
Aye.

84
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,930
(Wen Yu and I are safe with the pendants.)

85
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,780
(I wonder how Xingyi is doing.)

86
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,410
(Can his injury get worse?)

87
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,610
Still playing?

88
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,100
Wen Yu,

89
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,100
you must be thirsty, too.

90
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,820
Here. Have some water.

91
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,140
The water from the lake

92
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,220
tastes sweet.

93
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,490
Sweet, indeed.

94
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,970
Then drink some more.

95
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,820
Then we'll continue our journey.

96
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,460
Why did you dump the leave?

97
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,490
You only had one sip?

98
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,700
I don't need this kind of water.

99
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,050
What's so bad about it?

100
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,170
You just said it tasted sweet.

101
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,020
Hey, wait for me.

102
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,700
Dongyu people like you
are supposed to be strong, huh?

103
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,770
Why can't you walk

104
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,730
even as fast as the pet we keep?

105
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,650
Mr. Wen Yu,

106
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,540
I'm trying really hard to walk fast.

107
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,970
Based on your pace,

108
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,300
we won't be able to reach the Capital City

109
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,340
at the time agreed.

110
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,130
But I can't walk anymore.

111
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,540
I'm good at riding a horse

112
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,300
instead of walking.

113
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,220
How about

114
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,970
you carry me on your back?

115
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,130
I've never carried anyone before.

116
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,130
And you're a female.

117
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,130
Actually,

118
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,010
you're a nice guy.

119
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,370
You're my friend now.

120
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,370
There in Beishuo,

121
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,970
I'll be good to you.

122
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,650
You're used to your identity quickly.

123
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,370
You talk like a princess now.

124
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,890
Yes, indeed.

125
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,580
In Beishuo,

126
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,250
if we still can't find the missing princess,

127
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,060
you'll have to be her.

128
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,850
By then,

129
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,180
you'll be the real Eldest Princess of Dongyu.

130
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,900
Hey.

131
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,250
Are you asleep?

132
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,420
Chief,

133
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,700
we searched throughout the forest

134
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,540
but didn't find the missing princess.

135
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,420
Maybe she escaped through another route.

136
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,730
We set so many traps,

137
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,850
but they still managed to run away.

138
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,610
What on earth went wrong?

139
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,540
I failed my job, Chief.

140
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,850
I'm ready for the punishment.

141
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,420
Who's there?

142
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,700
Mercy, sir. Mercy.

143
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,130
I'm just stopping by.

144
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,850
Where is your princess?

145
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,340
What princess?

146
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,820
I'll confess.

147
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,780
Tell us.

148
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,850
Where's the Eldest Princess?

149
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,610
I can take you to her.

150
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,970
But now I'm badly poisoned.

151
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,540
I guess I'm dying.

152
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,460
I may be dead before we arrive.

153
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
How about...?

154
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,020
Say it.

155
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,300
What do you want?

156
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,700
How about you detoxify me first?

157
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,420
Look, I'm so weak now.

158
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,610
I can't make you carry me,

159
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,450
right?

160
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,850
Well, you can carry me.

161
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,690
But...

162
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,890
I may hold you up.

163
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,220
So nagging.

164
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,540
Give him the antidote.

165
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,330
Chief,

166
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,700
this is inappropriate.

167
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,250
How about you be the chief?

168
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,210
I don't dare.

169
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,260
March him

170
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,850
and let him lead the way.

171
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,700
If you dare to fool me,

172
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,340
I'll make your life miserable.

173
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,890
Will you ride a horse

174
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,610
while I run behind you?

175
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,450
No.

176
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,300
So, you aren't that cruel.

177
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,940
I feel so weak now.

178
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,060
I don't think I'm fully detoxified.

179
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,020
Tell us where we should go.

180
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,300
If you play a trick again,

181
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,650
I'll dump you.

182
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,820
You vicious assassin.

183
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,970
Slow down.

184
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,340
Mercy, madam! Mercy!

185
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,540
Where should we go?

186
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,420
To the north. To the south.

187
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,650
To... To the north.

188
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,490
Where exactly?

189
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,610
North.

190
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,610
North.

191
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,180
Gentleman.

192
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,370
Thank you.

193
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,580
Without you,

194
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,730
we wouldn't know

195
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,010
how to get to the Capital City.

196
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,890
We're all from Dongyu.

197
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,010
I should help you.

198
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,540
Gentleman.

199
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,940
You look happy all the way.

200
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,580
What pleases you?

201
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,100
I'm going to the Capital City
to get my daughter back to Dongyu.

202
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,820
I can't help feeling happy.

203
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,660
That's great.

204
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,890
It's indeed something cheerful.

205
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,370
It's so great to go back home.

206
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,650
The Capital City

207
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,180
can't be as good as our state.

208
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,220
Yeah.

209
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,100
Dongyu is better without doubt.

210
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,940
The war will be over.

211
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,850
My son was a soldier on the front line.

212
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,940
Now, he's also back home.

213
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,180
When we raise some cows and sheep,

214
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,540
we'll live a better life.

215
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,730
If I don't pretend to be the Eldest Princess,

216
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,650
what will happen?

217
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,060
The two states will cut ties

218
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,370
or even start a war.

219
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,540
So serious?

220
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,420
The marriage of the Eldest Princess

221
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,650
represents the sincerity
of the states' making peace.

222
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,250
It's about the covenant of the two states.

223
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,220
Once it's broken,

224
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,180
the war will be started again.

225
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,850
By then, civilians will be homeless.

226
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,300
The world

227
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,460
will be plagued by war again.

228
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,580
Let me think about it.

229
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,610
I don't know where my brother is.

230
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,650
I have no idea how to decide.

231
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,100
His Highness's men will
escort Xingyi to the Capital City

232
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,650
and I'll find the antidote for you.

233
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,450
Are you sure?

234
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,100
What do I have to do?

235
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,660
All you have to do

236
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,370
is pretend to be the Eldest Princess.

237
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,980
What are you thinking about?

238
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,820
I think you're right.

239
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,970
I don't think you know where she is.

240
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,580
Be gentle.

241
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,490
How dare you fool us?

242
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,220
I'm going to kill you!

243
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,490
Sir, I... I...

244
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,610
Don't bother to waste time.

245
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,920
- Don't.
- Let's leave.

246
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,900
Here we are.

247
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,540
Why does this man look so familiar?

248
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,730
His Highness sent him to pick us up.

249
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,100
He's good.

250
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,940
His Highness is always good.

251
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,940
- Greetings, Your Grace.
- Greetings, Your Grace.

252
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,140
Xingyi.

253
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,540
- Xingyi.
- Your Highness,

254
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,300
we lost Mr. Xingyi on the way.

255
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,580
Our men are still looking for him.

256
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,330
Xingyi.

257
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,660
Where's my brother?

258
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,940
Don't worry, Your Grace.

259
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,250
Mr. Xingyi is on his way.

260
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,660
Someone will escort him to the Capital City.

261
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,970
He's so weak.

262
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,420
How could you leave him alone?

263
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,650
Your Grace, it's a long story.

264
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,210
I'll visit you and apologize another time.

265
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,490
You had a long trip.

266
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,730
How about you go back and get washed?

267
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,690
- Your Grace.
- But...

268
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,130
The gate is closing soon.

269
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,300
Get in the carriage.

270
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,260
Come, please.

271
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,020
(The Capital City of Beishuo)

272
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,530
Delicious and cheap.

273
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,680
Sugarcoated haws.

274
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,800
This one looks nice.

275
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,040
Toys for sale.

276
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,160
Pendants for sale.

277
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,490
How does it taste?

278
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,340
Delicious.

279
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,790
Pendants.

280
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,450
The Capital City is so gorgeous.

281
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,880
Sugarcoated haws.

282
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,580
Beishuo

283
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,100
is more prosperous than Dongyu, huh?

284
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,930
Dongyu is better.

285
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,280
Sugarcoated haws.

286
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,100
Whose carriage is this?

287
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,260
Quite impressive.

288
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,980
It must be a rich family.

289
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,890
Chief, if we don't take action,
it will be too late.

290
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,140
Let's get back.

291
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,450
The mission failed.

292
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,380
Chief,

293
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,210
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,980
I'm just following the order.

295
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,580
Get started.

296
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,740
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)
The princess has arrived.

297
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,890
- Greetings, Your Grace.
- Greetings, Your Grace.

298
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,100
Now, you're the gentle
Eldest Princess of Dongyu.

299
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,370
Remember this.

300
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,340
Won't you get in with me?

301
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,740
I'm going for my mission report.

302
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,340
Someone will come out and meet you.

303
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,850
(I should be gentle and elegant.)

304
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,650
(Now, I'm the Eldest Princess of Dongyu.)

305
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,170
I'm Eunuch Li.

306
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,850
Greeting, Your Grace.

307
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,980
You're arriving here today

308
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,580
and His Majesty cares about you.

309
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,890
But restrained by the rule,

310
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,370
a couple can't meet before the wedding.

311
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,610
So, His Majesty gave you a banquet

312
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,610
to show our goodwill for your state

313
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,340
and his care for you.

314
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,500
I appreciate it.

315
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,740
Thank you, Eunuch Li.

316
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,540
Oh, Your Grace, you flatter me.

317
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,610
The Great Consort, the South Prince,
and the North Prince

318
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,100
also had some imperial dishes sent.

319
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,930
I won't stand in your way.

320
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,260
I'll take my leave.

321
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,980
Butler, walk him out.

322
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,900
Yes.

323
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,250
This way, please.

324
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,980
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)
Greetings, Your Grace. I'm Qiuju.

325
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,300
The Great Consort

326
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,850
offered shark fin soup,

327
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,930
pork rolls,

328
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,500
and lotus roots

329
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,020
to welcome you, Your Grace.

330
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,170
Greetings, Your Grace. I'm Rubing.

331
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,130
The North Prince

332
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,410
offered fried sparrows,

333
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,410
seafood balls,

334
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,250
and Maojian Tea

335
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,260
to welcome you, Your Grace.

336
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,450
Wish you a happy life in Beishuo.

337
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,130
Greetings, Your Grace. I'm Lizi.

338
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,930
Knowing about your arrival, the South Prince

339
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,740
had me deliver the most precious dishes.

340
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,000
Steamed bear's paws,

341
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,420
diced chicken meat with fleece-flower Root,

342
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,690
and sweet duck tongues.

343
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,930
Wish you good luck, longevity, and health.

344
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,130
Greetings, Brother.

345
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,650
You may rise, Shiyu.

346
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,660
(Zhou Chenyu, the Emperor of Beishuo)

347
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,530
Shiyu,

348
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,340
I heard you had a very dangerous trip.

349
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,450
As your eldest brother,

350
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,410
I should have protected you.

351
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,020
But this time,

352
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,930
you had to risk your life to Dongyu

353
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,850
for the peace negotiation.

354
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,540
I really feel sorry.

355
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,130
Unfortunately, due to my oversight,

356
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,980
the real princess is missing.

357
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,580
I feel so sorry, Brother.

358
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,650
It doesn't matter.

359
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,180
(Letter of Marriage Between Beishuo and Dongyu)

360
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:46,820
As long as this girl

361
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,980
can give us the power of Dongyu

362
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,820
and get us out of Uncle's impedance,

363
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,740
whether she's a princess or a maid

364
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,610
does not really matter.

365
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,130
You need to arrange more guards

366
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,300
to keep the princess safe

367
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,580
in case something goes wrong

368
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,900
before the wedding.

369
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,100
I will.

370
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,980
The marriage

371
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,340
will end the war between Beishuo and Dongyu,

372
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,520
stabilize the political situation,

373
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,850
and secure the border for years.

374
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,780
I'll carefully protect the princess.

375
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,020
But Brother,

376
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,980
before Uncle returns from the suppression,

377
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,980
you should issue the marriage edict soon.

378
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,450
In tomorrow's morning court,

379
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,410
I'll announce the marriage thing.

380
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,170
After the marriage,

381
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,890
hope the two states can always be peaceful.

382
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,780
It's also what I wish for.

383
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,060
She's such a vicious assassin.

384
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,300
What is the point

385
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,340
of having a pretty face?

386
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,300
She kills people, anyway.

387
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,290
Oh, this.

388
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,740
I can use it.

389
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,450
She discarded me mercilessly.

390
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,020
So ruthless.

391
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,820
When I recover...

392
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,540
When I recover...

393
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,740
When I recover,

394
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,260
I'll show her

395
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,850
how strong I can be.

396
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,410
Just you wait,

397
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,820
vicious assassin.

398
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,740
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

399
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,170
Is this the way

400
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,760
the Eldest Princess usually eats?

401
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,210
Wen Yu, you're back.

402
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,850
The food in your state

403
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,060
tastes really nice.

404
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,890
Is that true?

405
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,890
Yes, of course.

406
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,650
A lot of people delivered the dishes.

407
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,500
Each is more exquisite than the last.

408
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,100
And they are said to be

409
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,290
the imperial dishes.

410
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,210
You've never tasted any, huh?

411
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,210
Come on.

412
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,850
You have some, too. Enjoy it.

413
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,620
Thanks.

414
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,420
Tastes great.

415
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,740
Why do I feel I'm sleepy?

416
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,300
You eat alone.

417
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,740
I'll go get some sleep.

418
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,540
Oh, no.

419
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
The pastry is poisonous.

420
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,890
My Lord.

421
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,340
Wake up, My Lord.

422
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,780
Your Grace.

423
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,370
Wake up, Your Grace!

424
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,930
Your Grace.

425
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,410
What happened, Your Grace?

426
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,260
Fire.

427
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,300
Somebody come! Fire!

428
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,140
Hurry.

429
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,580
- Don't move.
- Why are you arresting me?

430
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,580
Your Grace.

431
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,050
You...

432
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,890
Seeing I'm not poisoned,

433
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,780
you must be disappointed, huh?

434
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,850
We're back to life again.

435
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,060
Can the pastry be poisonous?

436
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,340
Obviously.

437
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,260
Didn't they say

438
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,890
they wanted to make nice
to the Princess of Dongyu?

439
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,130
Why did they try to kill me?

440
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,890
Just some claptraps.

441
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,850
But they looked really sincere.

442
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,620
Who exactly poisoned us?

443
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,500
The Emperor?

444
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,020
The Great Consort?

445
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
The South Prince.

446
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,340
The North Prince.

447
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,300
The guards or the chefs?

448
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,180
The eunuch.

449
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,820
Everyone is suspicious.

450
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,580
You people are vicious.

451
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,900
If our princess really came,

452
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,420
she would be dead many times.

453
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,900
Oh, no.

454
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,220
She couldn't even make it to the Capital City.

455
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,700
Mind your tongue.

456
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,100
I can't even complain?

457
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,740
Can I stop

458
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,580
pretending to be the Eldest Princess?

459
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,260
You can't.

460
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,660
It's not time to shrink back.

461
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,620
And don't you want to know

462
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,300
who poisoned you?

463
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,740
Right.

464
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,740
We must catch this bad guy.

465
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,540
The poisoner

466
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,500
must be on the same team

467
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,700
with the assassins on our way back.

468
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,780
I guess they'll ambush us tonight.

469
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,060
They followed us to the Capital City.

470
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,820
This guy must be very powerful.

471
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,060
He poisoned the pastry to kill you

472
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,460
even on the first day you settled down.

473
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,140
The one behind this

474
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,180
doesn't seem to be intelligent.

475
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,860
It's a poor trick, indeed.

476
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,340
Poison in the pastry.

477
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,660
This guy must be still here.

478
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,500
In this case,

479
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,860
we can

480
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,500
draw him out.

481
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,260
Confess.

482
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,140
Who sent you to kill me?

483
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,180
I don't know.

484
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,300
I don't know

485
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,620
why the food is poisonous.

486
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,980
Are you sure?

487
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,380
Why did you slander me

488
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,100
for poisoning you?

489
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,940
So

490
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,740
the Eldest Princess and I
caught the wrong poisoner

491
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,020
and wrongly accused you?

492
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,140
I...

493
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,420
I didn't know about the poison thing.

494
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,620
Leave her to me.

495
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,300
I put some toxins in the ink

496
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,420
that can corrode your skin.

497
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,060
By then,

498
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,820
your face

499
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,380
will be disfigured.

500
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,180
I don't know anything.

501
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,740
I really don't know anything.

502
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,620
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

503
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,380
Oh, no.

504
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,220
Your face is ruined.

505
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,500
You just kill me.

506
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,380
I won't confess anything!

507
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,700
You aren't even scared of disfigurements.

508
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,900
I'll try the second trick, then.

509
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,980
Oh, no. I can't stand it.

510
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,460
I'll confess.

511
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,220
Who's behind all this?

512
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,580
The North Prince.

513
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,180
The North Prince?

514
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,940
Your Grace,

515
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,300
the North Prince sent me.

516
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,540
You can't distinguish the princes, huh?

517
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,900
You work for the South Prince.

518
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,900
No, it's not him.

519
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,580
Mercy, Your Grace. Mercy!

520
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,940
Spare me, Your Grace!

521
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,780
Wait.

522
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,380
Show some mercy, Your Grace.

523
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,220
We should let

524
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,640
the South Prince have his dignity.

525
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,750
I'll have her sent back there.

526
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,220
I don't.

527
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,620
I don't work for the South Prince.

528
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,740
Fine.

529
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,300
After the whole day,

530
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,460
I'm quite tired.

531
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,140
Is the South Prince really as useless

532
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,020
as he's said to be?

533
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,060
Don't humiliate His Highness.

534
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,100
He's the wisest man in this world.

535
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,900
You're loyal.

536
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,780
Have her sent back.

537
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,340
I sent you to take care of the princess.

538
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,100
How come you end up like this?

539
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,780
And you're even sent back.

540
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,100
Aren't you slapping His...?

541
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,220
Oh, sorry.

542
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,020
Can't you see Piggy is sleeping?

543
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,180
(Zhou Zhixuan, the South Prince of Beishuo)
Don't make me punish you.

544
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,630
(Yang Xu, the South Prince's butler)
Aren't you slapping His Highness in the face?

545
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,500
Butler Yang,

546
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,060
I did what His Highness asked me to do.

547
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,660
But they seemed to be alerted.

548
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,420
I nearly poisoned the Princess of Dongyu.

549
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,140
Come on, you...

550
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,420
Poison?

551
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,500
Who did you try to poison?

552
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,660
The...

553
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,460
The Princess of Dongyu.

554
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,900
Are you insane?

555
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,340
You want to screw me, huh?

556
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,580
Or do you think it's so easy for me

557
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,860
to be the South Prince?

558
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,580
But...

559
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,940
You ordered me to do that.

560
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,420
I did?

561
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,780
When did I do that?

562
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,140
Yang Xu.

563
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,980
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Did I order her?

564
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,460
Yes, you did.

565
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,300
- Right?
- Did I order her?

566
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,580
- Yeah. Yes.
- Right?

567
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,420
- You did.
- Yeah, you did.

568
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,940
Did I?

569
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,420
Come over.

570
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,500
Come.

571
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,020
Come over here.

572
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,860
Your Highness.

573
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,060
It's so lovely.

574
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,900
Don't run, Piggy.

575
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,820
This is maid Taozi
who will be sent to the Princess of Dongyu.

576
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,100
Her little brother was badly sick

577
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,900
and couldn't be cured
without your award, Your Highness.

578
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,180
So, she swore

579
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,780
to be your slave.

580
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,940
That's not necessary.

581
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,300
I'm just too kind

582
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,380
to see this misery.

583
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,420
Taozi, huh?

584
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,300
Who gave you this name?

585
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,180
So tacky.

586
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,420
Look at them.

587
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,660
Chunhua.

588
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,540
Qiuyue.

589
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,100
Xiachan.

590
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,620
Dongxue.

591
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,540
Piggy.

592
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,580
Such romantic names.

593
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,580
Awesome.

594
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,620
Your Highness, don't you remember?

595
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,500
You named her Taozi.

596
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,180
You favored fruit at that time.

597
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,780
So maids of that period were named

598
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,180
Taozi, Leezi, Lezi, Lizi...

599
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,020
Go away.

600
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,100
Such terrible names!

601
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,280
You must have come up with them.

602
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,300
Tacky.

603
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,540
Yeah, I came up with them.

604
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,220
It's always wise of you, Your Highness.

605
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,460
Do you know what you're supposed to do there?

606
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,660
According to Butler Yang,

607
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,700
I should take care of the Prince of Dongyu

608
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,620
and get information for you.

609
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,540
These aren't the most important.

610
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,100
The most important thing is

611
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,060
the North Prince got her back.

612
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,220
Then she's on his side, right?

613
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,780
She's the opposite of me, huh?

614
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,580
So, I must give her a hard time!

615
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,100
Yes.

616
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,660
Darn it, the North Prince.

617
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,220
He took all the credit.

618
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,220
I should have gone there.

619
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,300
Your Highness, I heard the North Prince

620
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,580
nearly died on his way back.

621
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,260
So did the Princess of Dongyu.

622
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,100
Stop running.

623
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,220
Nearly died?

624
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,100
If only Zhou Shiyu died!

625
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,780
Then he wouldn't dare to stand against me.

626
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,540
Sadly, he's lucky enough to live.

627
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,020
He's coming to town soon.

628
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,140
Darn it.

629
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,740
The terrible Princess of Dongyu.

630
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,780
I wish they would both die!

631
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,860
I get it, Your Highness.

632
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,460
I won't let you down.

633
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,940
Idiot. You piss me off.

634
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,060
It's all my fault.

635
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,300
I just tried to help you, Your Highness.

636
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,780
Tried to help me?

637
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,740
Help me?

638
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,940
Then why didn't you kill her?

639
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,020
I nearly...

640
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,700
That was close.

641
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,220
She just nearly...

642
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,820
Wait, wait.

643
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,140
If you had killed her,

644
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,420
I would be screwed, too.

645
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,900
Look at you.

646
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,420
Oh, that is infuriating.

647
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,700
Leave us.

648
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,900
Don't stay to annoy His Highness.

649
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,820
I'll... I'll take my leave.

650
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,060
Your Highness,

651
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,340
the North Prince's men sent Taozi back.

652
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,220
He had a letter for you, too.

653
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,220
(The North Prince's Mansion)

654
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,420
I'll let you go this time.

655
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,980
Hope you'll behave yourself.

656
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,100
Zhou Shiyu!

657
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,980
Your Highness.

658
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,900
- Calm down, Your Highness.
- Don't be angry, Your Highness.

659
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,140
I ride faster than you.

660
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,180
Can you catch up?

661
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,340
Your Highness, cool down.

662
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,580
I thought after I survived the assassination

663
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,660
and reached Beishuo,

664
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,020
I could be relieved.

665
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,340
But today, I was nearly poisoned.

666
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,940
I just don't understand.

667
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,820
Are Beishuo people

668
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,180
so eager to kill our Eldest Princess?

669
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,100
The Eldest Princess is powerful

670
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,500
and her marriage represents
the peace of the world.

671
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,820
Those who want peace are supportive.

672
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,580
But still a lot of people want to stir the pot.

673
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,460
We don't know who is behind the assassination.

674
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,580
Now, the South Prince is a trouble, too.

675
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,460
It really gives me a headache.

676
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,140
Don't worry about the South Prince.

677
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,420
He isn't smart enough.

678
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,820
Indeed.

679
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,620
Just as the rumor goes,

680
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,780
there are great talents in your state.

681
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,580
The useless North Prince

682
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,780
and the worthless South Prince.

683
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,220
Rather impressive.

684
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,100
You flatter us, Your Grace.

685
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,660
I don't mean that.

686
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,100
Now, you and I

687
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,900
are both in this together.

688
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,220
And you're a native.

689
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,500
In the future,

690
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,140
you'll have to help me.

691
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,980
We both have the pendants

692
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,820
and we'll risk our lives together.

693
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,060
Besides,

694
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,140
I've been taking you as one of us.

695
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,860
And you are

696
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,660
so righteous, kind, and brave.

697
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,500
Just tell me.

698
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,340
What do you want?

699
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,660
Wen Yu,

700
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,580
it's not that I'm scared.

701
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,540
But I have to pretend
to be the Eldest Princess.

702
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,820
I can't die.

703
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,740
So, you might as well

704
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,020
stay in the room and protect me.

705
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,420
It's good for both you and me.

706
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,900
How... How can I sleep like this?

707
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,140
Umm...

708
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,860
I'll loosen it.

709
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,940
Then you can sleep on the ground.

710
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,940
