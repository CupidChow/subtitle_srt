Stop looking. Out of the way.

How could you even laugh?

26
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:08,970

00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,970
Stop looking.

Haven't seen a black eye before?

How about I give you one?

30
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,850
Gao Luoyi,

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
why are you crying?

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200
Leave me alone.

33
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,360
Why can't you hold your horses?

34
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,130
Look at me.

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm used to that.

36
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,920
To get the Princess,

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,450
you've really taken great pains.

38
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,520
Sadly, you can never defeat Shiyu!

39
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,050
No wonder Shiyu doesn't like you.

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Don't be so harsh.

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,410
What really matters?

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,480
Persistence. See?

43
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,200
You must not give up.

44
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,800
Whether he likes me
has nothing to do with you!

45
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
You're annoying.

46
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,680
Let's stick to our plan.

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,050
- I will.
- Your Grace.

48
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,520
How dare you punch me?

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,360
Oh, this man has a black eye.

50
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,200
Who are you talking about?

51
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,170
Who has a black eye?

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,450
Who do you mean?

53
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,290
So what?

54
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,520
You can't mock His Highness.

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,730
I gave you the most money.

56
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,570
Xu...

57
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,200
You gave me the money, so what?

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,180
(Talent)

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,360
Continue?

60
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,450
You must not mock His Highness.

61
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,290
Hey, you...

62
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,460
(Talent)

63
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,050
Here is the command of His Majesty.

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,170
"The Lord of the South Gao Yuan
has done his duty for national peace.

65
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,800
I should reward him.

66
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,320
He seldom stays with Princess Luoyi

67
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,090
and Princess Luoyi is at the age of marriage.

68
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,210
For the sake that the Gao Family
remain loyal and grateful,

69
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,530
the Lord of the South will stay in town

70
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,610
and won't leave
before Princess Luoyi gets married."

71
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,860
Respect this.

72
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,700
(Royal Decree)

73
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,610
They appear to be satisfying me.

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,880
But actually,

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,210
they're restraining me with Luoyi's marriage.

76
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,240
Interesting.

77
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,500
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

78
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,770
Shiyu, are you sure

79
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,000
the Lord of the South will not

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,210
threaten you to marry his sister?

81
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,560
I gave him something he wanted more.

82
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,410
So, he can't threaten me anymore.

83
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,730
That's good.

84
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,010
Yueling,

85
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,410
the wedding date is fixed.

86
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,050
Don't recruit a husband anymore.

87
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,240
I... I didn't know you had solved this problem.

88
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,730
I just thought,

89
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,210
"If I recruit a husband,

90
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,610
you won't be forced anymore."

91
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,480
His Majesty and you
wouldn't be stuck in a dilemma, either.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,840
But anyway,

93
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,290
I don't want you to marry Princess Luoyi.

94
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,290
In my life, I will marry

95
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
no one but you.

96
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,450
Yueling,

97
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,440
will you only listen to me and trust me?

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,530
Chen Susu indeed helped you.

99
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,290
But she also persuaded you to leave me.

100
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,730
She was a spy for the Lord of the South and me.

101
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,410
But when he and I have a problem,

102
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,530
she'll only take on his side.

103
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,000
I know I'm wrong.

104
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,890
From this day on,

105
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,880
I'll listen to and trust no one but you.

106
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,240
But from now on,

107
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,360
don't keep anything from me.

108
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,320
I won't. I was in the wrong, too.

109
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,920
I should have told you about it.

110
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,530
It won't happen again.

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,480
That's more like it.

112
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,970
I was quite nervous.

113
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,880
After all, my girl

114
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,920
would nearly be stolen.

115
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,210
How would that happen?

116
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,520
Gentleman,

117
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,000
we're closing.

118
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,200
Well, gentleman,

119
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,770
enjoy yourself.

120
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,050
(Su Nian,)

121
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,530
(where have you gone?)

122
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,290
(I realized just now)

123
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,770
(that I didn't know you at all.)

124
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,650
Luoyi, let me explain.

125
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,770
Your Grace, don't do this.

126
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,890
Something must have gone wrong.

127
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,530
Leave! Both of you!

128
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,680
You both lied to me.

129
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,960
You promised that I would marry Shiyu.

130
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,050
In the end,

131
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,680
he would marry the Princess of Dongyu!

132
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,250
Your Grace.

133
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,010
Your Grace.

134
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,400
Luoyi.

135
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,520
Luoyi!

136
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,490
Your Grace.

137
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,760
Your Grace!

138
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,680
Luoyi.

139
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,130
Luoyi,

140
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,720
Zhou Shiyu doesn't love you.

141
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,010
Forcing him will not work.

142
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,170
But you told His Majesty

143
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,200
Shiyu would marry me.

144
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,320
Why does it not count?

145
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,440
Whatever I want,

146
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,600
you always get it for me.

147
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,920
Then why can I not marry Zhou Shiyu?

148
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,760
Luoyi,

149
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,410
I'm not leaving this time.

150
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,200
I'll stay in town with you.

151
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,560
What's the point?

152
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,250
To get me a husband?

153
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
Then you'll leave

154
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,130
without a return date.

155
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,930
Then I wish I would never get married.

156
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,800
Su Nian, what happened to you?

157
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,050
Xingyi? How did you know this place?

158
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,650
Someone told me.

159
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,800
Come on.

160
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,620
(Su Nian is in Liu's abandoned house
on the east side of town.)

161
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,130
So,

162
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,320
Lingxi told you about it.

163
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,490
Su Nian.

164
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,680
Let me get you down.

165
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,210
Have some water.

166
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,010
Su Nian,

167
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,890
I've looked for you
since I was back from Dongyu.

168
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,890
Unexpectedly, you live in such a house

169
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,850
all alone.

170
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,250
Are you sick?

171
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,800
Why are you so weak?

172
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,320
You know what I am, don't you?

173
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,320
I tried to kill you.

174
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,130
How dare you come to me again?

175
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,530
Because you've never hurt me.

176
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,920
Instead, you saved me.

177
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,250
So what?

178
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,290
Don't you fear I'll change my mind,

179
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,130
turn against you,

180
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,250
and kill you now?

181
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:02,970
No.

182
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,680
Because you could have done that.

183
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,320
But you've never hurt me.

184
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,290
So, you're just like me.

185
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,130
What do you mean?

186
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,410
We both care about each other.

187
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,400
I don't.

188
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,130
Don't flatter yourself.

189
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,890
You just leave.

190
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,440
Otherwise,

191
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,960
I'll kill you as Master ordered.

192
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,800
I'm not leaving.

193
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,720
Kill me if you like.

194
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,400
You...

195
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,160
Su Nian.

196
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,650
Su Nian, what is wrong?

197
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,090
The poison.

198
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,560
It's attacking.

199
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,770
Poison? What poison?

200
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,490
What do I do? Is there an antidote?

201
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,330
What can I do?

202
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,840
How can I help you?

203
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,530
I'm so cold.

204
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,530
Su Nian, don't worry.

205
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,920
I'll go get the antidote.

206
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,890
I will save you.

207
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,140
(The North Prince's Mansion)

208
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,660
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

209
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,050
- Zhou Shiyu!
- Wait.

210
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:57,970
Zhou Shiyu!

211
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,130
Don't stop me. Emergency.

212
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,010
Why did you get in?

213
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,530
Without permission, you can't get in.

214
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,680
Why so many rules?

215
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,440
Linmu.

216
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,040
Yes.

217
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,560
Your sister is worried about you.

218
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,170
When you're done, go back to her.

219
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:14,970
I know.

220
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,800
Tell her I'm all right.

221
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,010
I want you to get me
the Roufeng Sect's antidote.

222
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Roufeng Sect?

223
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,130
It's in the Prime Minister's house, I guess.

224
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,440
Prime Minister's house?

225
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,770
The Roufeng Sect consists of assassins.

226
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,130
But the Prime Minister is actually behind them.

227
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,410
His house is always heavily guarded.

228
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,320
But luckily, he has been away lately.

229
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,890
Wait for a few days.

230
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,920
I'll think of a way.

231
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,290
All right. Just be quick.

232
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,740
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

233
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,090
Your Highness,

234
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,770
are these all the betrothal presents?

235
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,170
Are you giving out all you have?

236
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,640
Isn't this a bit too much?

237
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,010
Isn't it excessive?

238
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,730
They're not enough.

239
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,360
- Wait. I'll list more.
- More?

240
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,010
Your Highness, don't list more.

241
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,490
Or you'll have nothing left.

242
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,490
Your Highness, it's...

243
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,690
Isn't it a bit too much?

244
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,880
Let me measure your shoulders.

245
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,370
Madam.

246
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,290
In the books, I saw
many pretty wedding clothes.

247
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,970
What do imperial wedding clothes look like?

248
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,560
Rest assured, Your Highness.

249
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,840
The imperial family pays special attention

250
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,160
to wedding ceremonies and clothes.

251
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,600
They'll be far better

252
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,560
than those in the books.

253
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,050
Your Grace, did you recall
what you read from the storybooks?

254
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,450
"A Beishuo girl usually
makes the wedding clothes

255
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,600
for her beloved man."

256
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,770
So,

257
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,640
do you also want to make them?

258
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,930
That's not true.

259
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,600
Your Grace, when you don't eat or drink,

260
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,250
I feel really sorry.

261
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,450
Ping'er,

262
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,360
will Shiyu really marry her?

263
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,490
I heard

264
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,930
he's preparing the betrothal gifts.

265
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,250
Nannies were also sent for the measurement

266
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,120
of their wedding clothes.

267
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,050
Wedding clothes?

268
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,120
Is there really nothing I can do?

269
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,290
You can do...

270
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,530
Your Grace, maybe you can do something.

271
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,200
What is it?

272
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,450
Somebody!

273
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,120
Her Grace killed herself!

274
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,320
Somebody come!

275
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,970
Somebody!

276
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:51,850
Physician,

277
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,250
how is she?

278
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,770
Your Highness,

279
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,400
Your Grace is seriously poisoned.

280
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,160
It's really hard to save her.

281
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,320
What are you talking about?

282
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,970
I can only feed Her Grace

283
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,120
some detoxifying decoction.

284
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,400
If she can wake up,

285
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,770
she may survive.

286
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,250
But if she can't wake up, I'm afraid...

287
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,160
Physician Liu,

288
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,530
think it over before you reply.

289
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,560
If Luoyi can't wake up,

290
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,840
you'll end up...

291
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,050
Yes.

292
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,840
I will do my best.

293
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,050
I'm on the prescription now.

294
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,450
Your Grace,

295
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,970
why did you do such a silly thing?

296
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,970
You swallowed poison for the North Prince.

297
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,930
You're here in a coma

298
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,490
while he'll have a wedding with someone else.

299
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,560
Ping'er,

300
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,290
did Luoyi

301
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,400
really kill herself with poison

302
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,930
for the North Prince?

303
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,120
That's true, Your Highness.

304
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,840
The North Prince is so merciless.

305
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,400
That's why Her Grace did this.

306
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,250
And the Princess of Dongyu...

307
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,930
She gave Her Grace many hard times.

308
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,440
Your Highness,

309
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,600
please do Her Grace justice.

310
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:30,260
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

311
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Your Grace.

312
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,720
Your Grace.

313
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,640
Your Grace.

314
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,360
What happened? Take it easy.

315
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,690
Your Grace, Princess Luoyi killed herself.

316
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,020
What?

317
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,840
No, no, she didn't kill herself.

318
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,080
She tried to kill herself.

319
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,050
But she was saved.

320
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,730
Do you know why she did that?

321
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,690
I heard His Majesty issued two decrees.

322
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,730
One was for your wedding with His Highness.

323
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,160
The other was for the Lord of the South.

324
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,530
His Lordship was asked to stay in town

325
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,050
and get a husband for Princess Luoyi.

326
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,440
What?

327
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,290
How did that happen?

328
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,730
So, she killed herself

329
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,080
because she couldn't marry Shiyu as she wished?

330
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,330
Your Grace,

331
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,600
according to her servants,

332
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,730
that was true.

333
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,050
Since Princess Luoyi went back from here,

334
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,530
she's been angry.

335
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,290
Shortly after that, she swallowed poison.

336
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,450
Oh, no. Qianqian.

337
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,690
Go get me a carriage.

338
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,880
I'm going to see Shiyu now.

339
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,090
- Hurry.
- All right.

340
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,530
Shiyu.

341
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,050
What happened?

342
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,210
Do you know what happened
to the Lord of the South?

343
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,600
Yueling, which one do you mean?

344
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,930
His Majesty's decree.

345
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,080
And Princess Luoyi nearly killed herself.

346
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,720
I knew.

347
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,490
You did?

348
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,360
In this case,

349
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,770
why did you not stop His Majesty?

350
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,890
In this context,

351
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,450
won't the Lord of the South
take the Prime Minister's side?

352
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,930
So, this is what you think.

353
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,800
Is this not what you think?

354
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,720
Be seated.

355
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,730
It doesn't matter which side

356
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,400
the Lord of the South takes.

357
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,960
What matters

358
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,530
is whether he's truly loyal.

359
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,920
Loyal?

360
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:34,850
Don't worry.

361
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,400
Brother has his plan.

362
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,600
However the political situation changes,

363
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,320
our wedding will be held as scheduled.

364
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,400
Before that,

365
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,360
do you have any other concerns?

366
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,640
No more concerns.

367
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,490
But up till now,

368
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,930
I still don't know where Xingyi is.

369
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,400
When we hold the wedding,

370
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,400
will he be back?

371
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,930
My men have been stalking Xingyi.

372
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,320
He rented a private house

373
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,400
for Su Nian's recovery.

374
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,530
She's poisoned by the Roufeng Sect.

375
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,690
Their best trick

376
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,450
is to control subordinates with poison.

377
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,880
The antidote is given regularly

378
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,250
to keep them alive.

379
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,730
Once someone betrays them,

380
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,120
he'll have no antidote.

381
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,530
And without it,

382
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,450
the poison will torture and kill him.

383
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,120
Xingyi loves Miss Su.

384
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,560
If Miss Su dies,

385
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,640
what will he do?

386
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,440
Shiyu,

387
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,360
can you do something to help her?

388
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,600
I sent my men to investigate secretly.

389
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,010
In a day or two, we'll know.

390
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,050
Where exactly is the antidote?

391
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,570
Who's in there?

392
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,290
Come on.

393
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,160
It's me. Unless you want to be caught,

394
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,120
stay here quietly.

395
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,680
Who's that?

396
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Mr. Lin sent me here to fetch something.

397
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,920
You may leave.

398
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,240
Yes.

399
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,770
Come out.

400
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,210
Lingxi, what are you doing here?

401
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,880
The moment you sneaked in,

402
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,970
I found you.

403
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,730
Without my cover,

404
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,120
you couldn't have made it here.

405
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,640
This is for you.

406
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,770
What's this?

407
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,050
You want the antidote, don't you? This is it.

408
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,640
Lingxi, why do you help me?

409
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Because Su Nian

410
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,360
once saved my life like this.

411
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,120
In Liuzhou,

412
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,250
she gave you the only antidote.

413
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,490
I owe too much to her.

414
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,080
Glad you know that.

415
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,210
Take good care of her.

416
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,250
You leave with me.

417
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,400
Leave your sect.

418
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,840
I have nowhere to go.

419
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,600
No one in this sect

420
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,970
has a home.

421
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,050
But you have Su Nian.

422
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,010
You're saving her life.

423
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,640
We will be your home.

424
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,770
All right.

425
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,530
Let's go together.

426
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,010
Lingxi really went into my study?

427
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,050
That's true, Mr. Lin.

428
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,930
Oh, no. We're detected.

429
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,840
Let's go separately.

430
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,970
Or neither of us can get away.

431
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,450
How will we meet?

432
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,080
Go give Su Nian the antidote.

433
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
After I get away,

434
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
I'll go find you.

435
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:47,770
We'll wait for you.

436
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,160
Lingxi,

437
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,360
you betrayed the Prime Minister.

438
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,320
How will you explain?

439
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,160
I have nothing to say.

440
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,450
Kill me if you like.

441
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,120
You are way out of your league!

442
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,240
Kill her.

443
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,720
Su Nian,

444
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,970
I got the antidote.

445
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,360
Come on. Take it.

446
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:41,890
Hurry.

447
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,840
You'll be all right.

448
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,290
You will be.

449
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,890
You will be fine.

450
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,530
(Su Nian,)

451
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,600
(you have to live a good life)

452
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,120
(on behalf of me.)

453
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,290
Su Nian, you're going to be all right.

454
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,690
You're going to be fine.

455
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,530
Xingyi.

456
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:24,770
Su Nian.

457
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,290
You're awake?

458
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,920
This is great.

459
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,010
You won't be tortured anymore.

460
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,970
This is great.

461
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,600
Great.

462
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,080
How did you get the antidote?

463
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,320
The North Prince told me

464
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,770
it was kept in the Prime Minister's house.

465
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,320
I sneaked in, then.

466
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,730
Lingxi was also there.

467
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,640
She gave it to me.

468
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,010
Lingxi?

469
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:49,850
Yes.

470
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,560
She gave it to you?

471
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,530
Yeah.

472
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,050
She was worried about you.

473
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,080
She lured away the killers,

474
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,690
saying she would come to us.

475
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,290
Glad you're fine.

476
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,880
Why was she so silly?

477
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,000
You...

478
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,640
Why are you crying?

479
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,050
Such a silly girl.

480
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,970
Don't cry.

481
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,800
Su Nian, don't cry.

482
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,800
It's all right, Su Nian.

483
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,880
- Lingxi.
- I'm here. It's all right.

484
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,200
Everything will be fine.

485
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,880
Your Highness?

486
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,320
You're finally back.

487
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,530
Your Grace!

488
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Your Grace, Prince Xingyi is back.

489
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,880
- Yueling, I'm back.
- Xingyi.

490
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,530
Yueling, I brought back Su Nian.

491
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,250
Greetings, Your Grace.

492
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,490
There's no need of that, Miss Su Nian.

493
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,490
Qianqian.

494
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,560
Get a room for Miss Su Nian.

495
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,480
Yes.

496
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,360
Yueling, Su Nian and I...

497
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,970
You had a long trip.

498
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,010
Go take some rest.

499
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,120
Xingyi, you take Miss Su to her room.

500
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,730
Her Grace can't accept me, right?

501
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,640
I think I should leave.

502
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,000
Su Nian.

503
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,250
You think too much.

504
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,450
It's because I was away for too many days.

505
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,290
Let me settle you down, all right?

506
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,050
Let's go.

507
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,800
Yueling, are you resting?

508
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,010
Xingyi?

509
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,090
Come in.

510
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,400
What's up?

511
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,210
Why are you here so late?

512
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,770
Yueling,

513
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,240
do you not like Su Nian?

514
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,080
That's not true.

515
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,080
Then earlier today, why were you

516
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,280
so cold to her?

517
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,680
That is my attitude towards a friend.

518
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,560
I don't think it's inappropriate.

519
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,120
Yueling,

520
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,080
I really love Su Nian.

521
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,530
We'll be a family.

522
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,370
Xingyi,

523
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,330
Miss Su Nian can be

524
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,370
a good friend, I think.

525
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,240
But I can't accept her

526
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,240
as my family.

527
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,850
She used to work for the Roufeng Sect.

528
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,810
She assassinated us many times, too.

529
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,120
So many things are entangled.

530
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,970
It's complicated. Do you get it?

531
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,280
But she has never hurt us.

532
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,890
She even saved Shiyu and me.

533
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,600
Let me think about it.

534
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,410
You go back for some rest.

535
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,530
Your Highness...

536
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,480
Get out of the way.

537
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,490
- You can't get in.
- Let me in.

538
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,730
Don't always stop me.

539
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,760
Show some respect, huh?

540
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,760
- Linmu.
- Out of the way!

541
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,680
Get him in.

542
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,970
Your Highness, I'll leave you alone.

543
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,560
You got the antidote, didn't you?

544
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,240
Sorry, my brother-in-law.

545
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,450
Su Nian couldn't hold on for even a single day.

546
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,970
So, I went there to try my luck.

547
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,160
Luckily enough,

548
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,080
I found the antidote.

549
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,490
What did you call me?

550
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,560
My brother-in-law.

551
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,760
Good. Glad you found the antidote.

552
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,200
If you need any help from me,

553
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,330
let me know.

554
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,450
You're the best to me, Shiyu.

555
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,410
I do have two things to ask you for help.

556
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,600
Sit down and tell me.

557
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,010
The first thing.

558
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,330
Can you help me persuade my sister?

559
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,050
She kind of can't accept Su Nian.

560
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,200
She's cold to Su Nian sometimes.

561
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,930
She can't accept Su Nian?

562
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,410
She said friends were different from families.

563
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,720
She just has too many concerns

564
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,850
to think things over for now.

565
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,450
You should understand her.

566
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,330
You're her only family in Beishuo.

567
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,640
She has to worry a lot.

568
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,160
But rest assured.

569
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,450
I'll help to persuade her.

570
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,450
You should be patient, too.

571
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,530
Thank you, Shiyu.

572
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,240
Tell me about the second thing.

573
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,490
I wonder if you know

574
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,760
about Liu Qingshan's case.

575
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,920
I know a little bit.

576
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,010
Then can you get the file

577
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,010
and overturn this case?

578
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,450
It's been Su Nian's anxiety.

579
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,290
I want to help her.

580
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,370
She's Liu Qingshan's descendant?

581
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,010
All right. I get it.
