They set off toxic smoke at the entrance.

20
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,860
We can't get through.

21
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,100
We have to find another way out.

22
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,740
How do you know?

23
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,580
Mr. Shi,

24
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,020
I have no time to explain.

25
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,260
Let's get out first.

26
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,140
The entrance is unavailable.

27
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,460
Do we have to go by water?

28
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,540
Exactly.

29
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,100
That's how we'll go.

30
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,980
All right.

31
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,980
Come on.

32
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,980
Be careful.

33
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,220
Careful.

34
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,380
Come on. Slowly.

35
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,700
After all the hard work,

36
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,420
you fail to poison us.

37
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,660
Disappointed, huh?

38
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,940
How come you're...?

39
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,420
This is weird.

40
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,620
Once again, we fail to kill you.

41
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,060
Even if I can't kill you,

42
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,180
I won't make myself your prisoner.

43
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,140
Take him away.

44
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,780
Go.

45
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,020
Prime Minister,

46
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,820
word came from Liuzhou

47
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,940
that Nan Xun was caught by Zhou Shiyu.

48
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,580
Such a loser.

49
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,740
Send someone to Liuzhou

50
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,820
and he has to find Nan Xun.

51
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,660
Yes.

52
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,380
What about the princess on the run?

53
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,860
She...

54
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,060
She has joined Zhou Shiyu.

55
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,180
What other plan do you have

56
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,020
to put Zhou Shiyu to death?

57
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,260
Prime Minister,

58
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,500
I think Zhou Shiyu

59
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,860
can do some witchcraft.

60
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,260
He can get away every time.

61
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,460
Well,

62
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,500
go get Taoist Master Chen to me.

63
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,500
I'll consult him

64
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,820
and see what witchcraft Zhou Shiyu can do.

65
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,220
Yes.

66
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,340
But

67
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,740
I have someone else to recommend.

68
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,980
Who?

69
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,380
Su Nian.

70
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,940
(Benign and Benevolent)

71
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,580
Every four hours,

72
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,060
they have a shift change.

73
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,620
Maybe I can try this part.

74
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,500
Su Nian?

75
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,140
What are you doing here?

76
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,100
Xingyi,

77
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,420
I heard the North Prince rebelled

78
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,300
and everyone here was grounded.

79
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,020
I'm worried about you.

80
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,300
So, I bribed the guards

81
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,260
and came to see you,

82
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,140
disguised as a maid.

83
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,140
Thank you.

84
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,740
You're indeed a good friend.

85
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,020
You come in my time of trouble.

86
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,180
I've brought you some food.

87
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,860
I guess you feel bad when locked up here.

88
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,740
Something delicious

89
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,940
may make you feel better.

90
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,780
All right.

91
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,700
Xingyi,

92
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,260
are you going to escape?

93
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,260
To be honest,

94
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,500
that's what I'm going to do.

95
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,500
My sister has gone
to Liuzhou for the North Prince.

96
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,860
Without my protection,

97
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,180
she can't stay safe.

98
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,580
I must do something to run away.

99
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,180
But if you flee hurriedly like this,

100
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,820
you will be wanted.

101
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,060
Maybe I can help you go to Liuzhou.

102
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,380
Do you have any idea?

103
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,380
Xingyi, I have to go.

104
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,860
Let's just stick to our plan.

105
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,820
All right, Su Nian.

106
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,820
You offered to help.

107
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,020
I'll never forget that.

108
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,380
I will pay you back.

109
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,100
Xingyi.

110
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,860
Su Nian.

111
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,340
(The House of Romance)

112
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,540
Thank you for getting me out.

113
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,980
I'll keep it in mind.

114
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,460
From now on, your business is mine.

115
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,340
I'm going to Liuzhou for my sister.

116
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,380
When I'm back here,

117
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,580
I'll come to you.

118
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,740
Mr. Xingyi,

119
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,740
are you going there like this?

120
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,780
Yeah. With my martial arts and wisdom,

121
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,100
I will make it to Liuzhou.

122
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,100
But I hear you've been wanted

123
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,260
since you were found missing.

124
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,460
Before you get out of the city gate,

125
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
you may be recaptured.

126
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,780
Am I really important enough

127
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,860
to be wanted?

128
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,260
I should think of how to get out.

129
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,660
Thank you for reminding me, Su Nian.

130
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,620
We'll take you to Liuzhou.

131
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,860
You're also going there?

132
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,340
Madam Sang, the owner of our house,

133
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,740
is from Liuzhou.

134
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,540
Hearing her hometown is hit by disaster,

135
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,020
she plans to take some money

136
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,740
and girls like us

137
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,500
to Liuzhou for some help.

138
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,980
Yeah, Mr. Xingyi.

139
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,380
You just go with us.

140
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,620
Xingyi, turn around.

141
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,900
Are you sure

142
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,380
this will do?

143
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,740
Yes.

144
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,620
Xingyu, looks like you are exactly

145
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,860
the most gorgeous "woman" in our house.

146
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,380
Yeah, Miss Xingyi.

147
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,980
Let's get going.

148
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,380
(True Virtues)

149
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,220
Your Highness,

150
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,900
we did some investigations.

151
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,260
Xu Wei is a normal guard
of the prefecture office.

152
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,620
We stalked him for a few days,
but found no clues.

153
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
What did Liu Yi say?

154
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,020
Mr. Liu works for you.

155
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,020
I don't think he'd deceive us.

156
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,380
He affirms that Xu Wei was by his side

157
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,860
when the grain was lost

158
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,140
and can't be the bandit.

159
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,620
And the man the portrait of Mr. Shi,

160
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,500
doesn't look like the real Xu Wei.

161
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,780
I don't think

162
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,500
that man works in the prefecture office.

163
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,140
I'll keep investigating.

164
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,180
Wait.

165
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,660
Why did he pretend

166
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,340
to be someone in the prefecture office?

167
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,380
We can easily rule out Xu Wei.

168
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,980
It's not like a framing trick.

169
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,140
I guess he works in the prefecture office.

170
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,380
Since he can get the token,

171
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,220
he can't have a very low rank.

172
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,860
He pretended to be Xu Wei

173
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,860
just to lure us away.

174
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,260
He's in the prefecture office?

175
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,740
Then, Your Highness,

176
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,740
what are we going to do?

177
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,500
Ask Liu Yi to invite

178
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,620
all the officers

179
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,140
to the antechamber.

180
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,980
I'd like to meet the fake Xu Wei.

181
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,780
Yes, Your Highness.

182
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,620
I'm on it.

183
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,980
The robber on the portray...

184
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,140
I think I saw somewhere else.

185
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,740
What are his characteristics?

186
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,900
He was disguised, I think.

187
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,540
That day, he deliberately avoided my eyes.

188
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,260
Think harder.

189
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,220
Did he do anything strange?

190
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,100
Strange?

191
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,460
Speaking of this,

192
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,740
I remember something.

193
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,540
He did have a habit.

194
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,460
What is it?

195
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,540
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

196
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,900
Your Highness,

197
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,220
you asked to see the main officers.

198
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,980
They're all here.

199
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,860
Recorder Yang.

200
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,220
Greetings, Your Highness.

201
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,220
Counselor Liu.

202
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,260
- Your Highness.
- Archivist Li.

203
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,500
Your Highness.

204
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,340
- Inspector Wang.
- Your Highness.

205
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,980
And this one.

206
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,140
Assistant Prefect Wei.

207
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,660
Mr. Shi, come up and recognize them.

208
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,340
Yes.

209
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,740
Your Highness,

210
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,900
the robber isn't here.

211
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,860
Mr. Wei,

212
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,900
have we met somewhere before?

213
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,220
I've never seen you, Your Highness.

214
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,020
Assistant Prefect Wei

215
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,140
has been working for me for three years.

216
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,860
He always works very hard.

217
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,980
For this disaster relief,
he donated all his property.

218
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,220
Indeed a model for officials like us.

219
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,380
Oh, I remember.

220
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,260
When I arrived in Liuzhou,

221
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,340
I saw someone do disaster relief.

222
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,860
They said it was Philanthropist Wei.

223
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,620
I guess it's you, huh?

224
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,980
Yes, it's me.

225
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,460
It's just a small thing

226
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,380
that I should do.

227
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,620
Mr. Wei,

228
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,620
what is wrong with your eyes?

229
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,100
I have an eye disease.

230
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,380
The old trouble.

231
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,780
He blinks more frequently than common people.

232
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,780
Blinks?

233
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,740
Yes.

234
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,380
However greatly one disguises himself

235
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,500
to cover his identity,

236
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,020
he can hardly change his habit.

237
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,860
Wei Da,

238
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,460
you robbed the grain disguised as Xu Wei.

239
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,020
I've confirmed your whereabouts.

240
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,740
But if you confess where the grain is,

241
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,980
I will spare your life.

242
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,980
It's perceptive of your, Your Majesty.

243
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,860
I will confess everything.

244
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,340
Don't move.

245
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,100
Wei Da!

246
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,180
Your Highness!

247
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,460
Sadly, I did the crime

248
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,860
and there's no way back.

249
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,900
When I get out of town,

250
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,500
I'll release Her Highness.

251
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,140
Go! Get me a carriage!

252
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,980
Wei Da.

253
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,620
- Calm down.
- Calm down.

254
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,020
We can negotiate.

255
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,500
Let go of Her Highness first.

256
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,780
Let go of her.

257
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,620
I'll get you out of town.

258
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,620
Her Highness is my amulet.

259
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,900
I can't let her go now.

260
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,100
Shiyu, don't listen to him.

261
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,140
Get him a carriage.

262
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,020
Sorry, Your Highness.

263
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,220
What...

264
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,100
Calm down.

265
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,180
Mr. Wei,

266
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,140
I'm curious about you.

267
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,620
Since you're the Assistant Prefect of Liuzhou

268
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,140
and known as Philanthropist Wei,

269
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,260
why did you rob the grain

270
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,660
and watch people die?

271
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,100
Mr. Wei,

272
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,460
if my consort is safe,

273
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,540
I will let you live.

274
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,500
A powerful prince like you

275
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,660
has his vulnerability now.

276
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,020
Your Highness, do we just let him go?

277
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,580
Keep tracking Wei Da.

278
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,100
Do not alert him.

279
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,660
Yes.

280
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,660
Let's go.

281
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,180
Yueling.

282
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,140
- Yueling.
- You're injured.

283
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,030
It's all right.

284
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,900
Miss Qianqian?

285
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,500
Linmu, you...

286
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,340
Shh.

287
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,860
You...

288
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,940
You're trying to flee?

289
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,820
Do you know?

290
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,740
Leaving without permission will get you killed.

291
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,980
I'm really worried about Her Grace

292
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,220
and His Highness.

293
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,220
You're a mere lady.

294
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,420
Even if you manage to get out of here,

295
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,500
can you travel alone to Liuzhou

296
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,820
that is thousands of miles away?

297
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,140
No.

298
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
But I know Her Grace and His Highness

299
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,940
are in Liuzhou whose survival is uncertain.

300
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,900
I'm really, really worried.

301
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,660
You can never know how I feel.

302
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,380
I know.

303
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,980
I know all the feelings you have now.

304
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,660
In Beishuo, there's a saying,

305
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,020
"One dies for his soulmate."

306
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,500
I worry about my prince as you do.

307
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,660
So, I can totally understand

308
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,260
how you feel now.

309
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,820
Let's escape together.

310
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,860
All right.

311
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,780
Let's go together.

312
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,740
Come on.

313
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,660
- Miss Qianqian.
- Let go of me!

314
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,660
Come on.

315
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,100
There you go.

316
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,580
Behave yourselves.

317
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,860
Let go of us!

318
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,540
Let us out!

319
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,660
Miss Qianqian, are you all right?

320
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,220
Anybody there?

321
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,060
Let go of us!

322
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,780
Let us out!

323
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,780
(County Government)

324
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,260
Where is your lord?

325
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,100
Where is he?

326
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,820
Get in and search!

327
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,660
- Yes!
- Yes!

328
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,940
(County Government)

329
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,100
Freeze!

330
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,060
(County Government)

331
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,780
Sir, the grain is really here.

332
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,260
Move it quickly.

333
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,580
Let's deliver the grain to Liuzhou overnight.

334
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,420
Yes.

335
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,140
(County Government)

336
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,260
Let me help you.

337
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,700
Hang in there. I'll be gentle.

338
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,780
I have to clean it

339
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,780
before applying ointment.

340
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,940
You can't let it fester like this.

341
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,060
I...

342
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,260
I knew you suffered injustice in the palace.

343
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,300
No. I was doing great.

344
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,460
I failed to protect you.

345
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,660
I'll punish those who framed you.

346
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,060
Yueling,

347
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,980
when you're back to Dongyu in three months,

348
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,500
I won't be there.

349
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,540
You have to take good care of yourself.

350
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,260
The decree of annulment...

351
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,540
I didn't take it.

352
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,420
He asked to break off the engagement with me?

353
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,340
Yes.

354
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,540
He asked for this decree before he left.

355
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,260
Now, I'm giving it to you.

356
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,740
Then, you don't need
to worry you'll get involved

357
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,660
in his crime.

358
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,260
I can get you another husband.

359
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,260
Please take it back, Your Majesty.

360
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,500
Shiyu,

361
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,100
I don't want to go.

362
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,740
I have a lot more things to do.

363
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,980
I need more time.

364
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Our engagement...

365
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,020
I didn't take the decree.

366
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,180
You shouldn't ask for another one.

367
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,300
In this case,

368
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,740
shall we just play it by ear?

369
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,740
All right.

370
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,460
-Give us grain!
- Grain!

371
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,700
(Liuzhou)

372
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,460
Don't be impulsive.

373
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,440
- Don't be impulsive.
- Grain!

374
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,740
The court gave us a lot of grain.

375
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,180
Why isn't distributed yet?

376
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,180
We've heard about it.

377
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,340
The North Prince gave us grain,

378
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,260
or we would have died!

379
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
Yeah. You must explain this today.

380
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,540
Or we wouldn't let you go!

381
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,780
- That's right.
- Calm down, everyone!

382
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,740
Why are you deceiving us?

383
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,260
I've heard about it.

384
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,460
He is slandered for rebellion.

385
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,660
No one will give us grain.

386
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,100
Don't talk nonsense!

387
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,940
The disaster relief grain will not arrive!

388
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,260
We'll die, anyway.

389
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,060
Why don't we kill some officials first?

390
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,980
- That's right!
- Don't be impulsive!

391
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,020
Let's just talk.

392
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,060
Let's talk.

393
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,100
Don't be impulsive.

394
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
Just don't.

395
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,420
(Care for the People)

396
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,660
Be patient!

397
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,780
The North Prince is here!

398
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,540
The North Prince is here.

399
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,450
Grain!

400
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,220
Some grain is there.

401
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,820
- Your Highness.
- Mr. Liu.

402
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,900
Your Highness.

403
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,220
You're finally back.

404
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,260
If you came back later,

405
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,980
I'm afraid I would be dead.

406
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,900
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

407
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,340
We've found all the grain

408
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,740
that was lost.

409
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,260
The remaining grain is on the way, too.

410
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,940
Mr. Liu, handle the distribution soon.

411
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
I will.

412
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,500
Everybody,

413
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,020
the grain from the court

414
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,100
was stolen by bandits the other day!

415
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,780
The North Prince took them down!

416
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,020
- Umm...
- Now,

417
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,540
I promise you this.

418
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,180
When the remaining grain arrives,

419
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,940
the twenty thousand dan of grain

420
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,540
will be distributed to you immediately

421
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:35,740
to show how His Majesty
and the court want to help you!

422
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,820
- Great!
- Wonderful!

423
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,500
Long live the North Prince!

424
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,450
Great!

425
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,430
This is great.

426
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,660
(Hall of Politics)

427
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,060
In his report, Magistrate Liu Yi of Liuzhou

428
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,820
explained the robbery
of the disaster relief grain.

429
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,060
The North Prince got the grain back.

430
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,540
I think

431
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,900
his mansion should be released now

432
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,260
to vindicate him.

433
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,100
Your Majesty,

434
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,740
I don't think Magistrate Liu

435
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,260
can be trusted.

436
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,580
What if he colludes with the North Prince

437
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,100
and deceive you?

438
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,460
Your Majesty,

439
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,900
as far as I see,

440
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,460
he can't be meritorious enough.

441
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,740
Besides,

442
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,660
the North Prince hasn't explained

443
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,780
about the grain thing.

444
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,300
Isn't it too early

445
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,260
to conclude now?

446
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,820
Prime Minister has a point.

447
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,500
Before the whole story is clear,

448
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
we should have doubts.

449
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,180
Because it concerns
the North Prince's reputation.

450
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,260
No more discussion!

451
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,220
I've made up my mind.

452
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,900
Shiyu is meritorious for finding the grain.

453
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,180
His mansion should be released.

454
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,460
He's still working hard on disaster relief.

455
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,260
I won't want to disappoint him.

456
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,460
I wonder how Her Grace is doing

457
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,500
and if she has found His Highness.

458
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
Yeah.

459
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,020
We're grounded here

460
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,060
and don't know anything.

461
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,780
I'm so anxious.

462
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,940
What?

463
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,740
The guards are ordered to leave.

464
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,060
Now, you can go anywhere you want.

465
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,500
Really?

466
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,020
His Highness is innocent, huh?

467
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,740
Yes. His Highness is not only innocent

468
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,580
but also meritorious.

469
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,100
He'll come back with Her Highness.

470
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,220
Qianqian.

471
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,540
Yeah! Her Grace is safe!

472
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,300
(True Virtues)

473
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,540
Colluding with Magistrate Li Zhong
of Wan County

474
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,780
Wei Da hid the grain there.

475
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,180
No wonder I searched throughout Liuzhou

476
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,260
but didn't find the grain.

477
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,260
But before we came,

478
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,300
Li Zhong had escaped.

479
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,260
I have my men tracking him down.

480
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,260
How can Wei Da and Li Zhong

481
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,460
be daring enough to embezzle

482
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,500
the disaster relief grain?

483
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,020
You have to arrest Li Zhong.

484
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,300
Have Wei Da escorted to the Capital City

485
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,700
for the Ministry of Punishments.

486
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,820
Yes, Your Highness.

487
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,540
How's it going with the iron mines?

488
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,900
I bought back the sold iron ore

489
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,020
and had it delivered to Liuzhou.

490
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,020
Everything's going fine at the moment.

491
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,500
Good. Well down.

492
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,580
Our top priority

493
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,580
is to rebuild Liuzhou.

494
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,820
Heighten security everywhere in the city

495
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,020
in case of more accidents.

496
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,900
Rest assured.

497
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,260
I'm on it now.

498
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,780
Shiyu.

499
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,300
Are you going out?

500
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,540
I'm going to the relief center.

501
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,900
What about you, Yueling?

502
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,260
Here.

503
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,420
I brought some money and jewels.

504
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
Why?

505
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,180
The grain is back.

506
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,540
But Liuzhou needs post-disaster reconstruction.

507
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,740
You need money for everything.

508
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,020
I also want to help.

509
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,220
This is all you have?

510
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,460
This is all I have now.

511
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,740
I have some in the Capital City.

512
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,820
But it's too far away.

513
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,700
I don't have enough time to get it.

514
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Is it not enough yet?

515
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,220
I know you want to help.

516
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,740
But this is very little.

517
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,500
It may not help a lot.

518
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,780
What do we do, then?

519
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,340
To rebuild Liuzhou,

520
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,820
we need to rethink for a careful plan.

521
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,700
But thank you, Yueling.

522
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,740
For what?

523
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,340
I didn't help a lot.

524
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,900
I'll think of another way.

525
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,100
OK. I should go.

526
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,300
Yang Xu, someone wants to kill me!

527
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,540
Yang Xu!

528
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,540
Your Highness, here I am!

529
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,660
Take him down!

530
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,300
Your Highness, are you all right?

531
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,580
All right?

532
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,420
I was nearly killed! How could I be all right?

533
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,660
Confess! Who sent you to kill His Highness?

534
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,740
Yeah. Who sent you?

535
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,420
I'm always nice

536
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,580
and I have no enemy.

537
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,260
You get the wrong guy, huh?

538
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,780
My target is the South Prince!

539
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,060
You framed the North Prince.

540
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,660
When he was expelled to Liuzhou,

541
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,340
you wanted to steal his consort.

542
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,980
We'll keep fighting against you

543
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,100
until we die!

544
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,700
Take him out and interrogate him!

545
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,980
We'll keep fighting against you

546
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,180
until we die!

547
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,460
- North Prince?
- Just wait!

548
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,540
North Prince wants to kill you, Your Highness.

549
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,500
Zhou Shiyu?

550
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,340
He wants to kill me?

551
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,420
Exactly.

552
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,940
You have no idea.

553
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,660
News has spread in the Capital City.

554
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,820
The Princess and the North Prince
went to Liuzhou.

555
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,020
They are not only famous for disaster relief

556
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,540
but also stick together really lovingly.

557
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,900
They're going too far!

558
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,100
The princess fooled me.

559
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,340
And Zhou Shiyu...

560
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,740
I'm his second brother.

561
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,700
How can he try to kill me?

562
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,740
Your Highness, under such circumstances,

563
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,220
we can't just wait and do nothing.

564
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,300
Do you have a good idea?

565
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,140
We...

566
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,500
He who strikes first gains the advantage.

567
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,180
He who strikes last may not fail.

568
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,260
How about we go to Liuzhou now

569
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,460
and kill the North Prince

570
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,500
once for all?

571
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,540
Xu,

572
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,260
it's so good to have you.

573
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,540
Your Highness,

574
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,900
I'm always here for you. Don't worry.

575
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,260
(Liuzhou)

576
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,540
- Here.
-In you go.

577
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,300
This outfit suits me.

578
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,180
But my belly...

579
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,780
Get off! All of you!

580
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,020
We interrogate anyone to get in.

581
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,940
Where are you from? Where are you going?

582
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,180
What do you do?

583
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,060
Where will you live?

584
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,500
You have to report everything.

585
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,860
Oh, no.

586
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,940
He must be here to arrest me.

587
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,180
Miss Xingyi, don't panic.

588
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,340
Everyone in the carriage, get off!

589
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,980
Who's skulking back there?

590
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,820
