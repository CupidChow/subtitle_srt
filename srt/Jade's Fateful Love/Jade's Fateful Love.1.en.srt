(Dongyu)

(Ashina Yueling,
the Young Princess of Dongyu)

21
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,180
Milk tea rolls, cheese packets,

22
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,480
and glutinous rice cake with raisins.

23
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,480
All the pastry my eldest sister loves.

24
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,020
(Hope everything will go smoothly)

25
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,840
(after she gets married in Beishuo.)

26
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,040
Oh, Xingyi.

27
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,820
Yueling, you cook so perfectly.

28
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,040
(Ashina Xingyi, the Young Prince of Dongyu)
No other sister can make

29
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,800
better pastry than you.

30
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,620
Confess. You were away for a while.

31
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,640
Did you make trouble again?

32
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,600
Well,

33
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,160
is there any chance that...?

34
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,360
That your pocket money isn't enough?

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,620
Yes.

36
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,380
The farewell dinner will be held tonight.

37
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,340
Don't be late.

38
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,580
You always care the most for me, Yueling.

39
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,420
Don't worry.

40
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,460
Whatever you want me to do,

41
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,720
I'll do it for you.

42
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,780
I should go.

43
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,780
Don't be late.

44
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,620
I won't.

45
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,000
Your Grace,

46
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,940
why are you still making the pastry?

47
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,800
You should go get changed.

48
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,630
(Qianqian, the maid of Dongyu)
If His Majesty sees this,

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,300
he'll complain again.

50
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,580
"You don't look like a princess."

51
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,380
"You either travel around, fighting with people

52
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,840
or cooking in the kitchen."

53
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,800
I've been getting an earful of that.

54
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,140
Under the North Prince's order,

55
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,180
we'll make camp before nightfall
and rest for one night!

56
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,920
Tomorrow, we'll go get the Princess of Dongyu!

57
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,620
(Zhou Shiyu, the North Prince of Beishuo)

58
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,860
Ashina Zhu, the Eldest Princess,

59
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,620
will be married to Beishuo.

60
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,360
Our good days are coming.

61
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,340
Yeah.

62
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,900
Finally, we don't need to fight wars.

63
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,880
Yes.

64
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,620
Beishuo has delivered

65
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,940
the food for us to get through the winter.

66
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,840
That's great.

67
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Yueling,

68
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,700
come and dance.

69
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,120
Your Grace, come and dance.

70
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,880
Watch this.

71
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,140
You guys dance.

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,660
Let's wish Her Grace

73
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,860
- a smooth journey.
- Wish her a smooth journey.

74
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,840
Zhu, let's go dancing.

75
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,040
What's wrong?

76
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,300
Why did you drink so much?

77
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,960
You're getting married tomorrow.

78
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,300
(Ashina Zhu, the Eldest Princess of Dongyu)

79
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,960
Isn't this Du Er's piccolo?

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,880
I thought you dumped it.

81
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,080
You still care for him?

82
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,180
Zhu,

83
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,400
you don't get married, then.

84
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,680
I'll go tell Father.

85
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,500
Yueling,

86
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,720
you don't understand.

87
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,200
The marriage of the two states is important.

88
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,820
Princesses like us

89
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,520
have our responsibilities to bear.

90
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,240
Zhu, if you hate to get married,

91
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,060
just don't.

92
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,680
If you worry about the alliance,

93
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,100
I'll replace you in the worst case.

94
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
I'll go beg Father.

95
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,920
Nothing matters more than your happiness.

96
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,040
Don't go.

97
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,660
I'll get married.

98
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,840
I will.

99
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,080
If you don't want this,

100
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,240
when Beishuo's escort comes tomorrow,

101
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,640
I'll take care of them.

102
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,560
Yueling,

103
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,180
I'm leaving tomorrow.

104
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,800
How about you drink with me?

105
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,860
Come on.

106
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,000
Zhu, if you want to drink,

107
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,880
I'll drink with you.

108
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,080
Yueling, wake up.

109
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,140
Yueling, wake up. Come on.

110
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,180
- Xingyi.
- Yueling.

111
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,520
Don't bother me.

112
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,600
Don't wake me up before the day breaks.

113
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,300
I'll break off our sister's engagement.

114
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,140
Break off?

115
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,480
What are you talking about?

116
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,000
She left a long time ago.

117
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,880
What did you say?

118
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,200
She left?

119
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,760
More than that.

120
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm afraid

121
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,760
she's out of Dongyu now.

122
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,520
Oh, no.

123
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,840
Why was I so drunk?

124
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,180
Hyah!

125
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,020
Hyah!

126
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,180
Hyah!

127
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,340
Hyah!

128
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,220
(Yueling,)

129
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,480
(it's what a princess like me should do.)

130
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,560
(I have to get married.)

131
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,980
Your Highness,

132
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,400
you said this trip
would be extremely dangerous.

133
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,100
But I think we're traveling

134
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,660
(Lin Mu, the North Prince's guard)
quite smoothly.

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,200
I'm afraid

136
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,200
it's the peace before the storm.

137
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,600
Yueling,

138
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,720
are you going to take Sister back by force?

139
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,860
Isn't it inappropriate?

140
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,700
Scared?

141
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,120
How... How would I?

142
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,360
I just think they have too many guards.

143
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,360
Yeah, Your Grace.

144
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,920
What's the sound?

145
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,760
Music of our state.

146
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,760
It's Du Er.

147
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,960
Du Er?

148
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,500
He's quite weak.

149
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,820
What is he here for?

150
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,160
Does he also want to take Zhu back by force?

151
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,460
You know what?

152
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,520
The Dongyu music sounds good.

153
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,540
(Du Er, the diplomat of Dongyu)

154
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,880
Come on. Let's get to Du Er.

155
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,780
(Posthouse)

156
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,760
Tonight, you have to be on your guard

157
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,620
in case someone sneaks in

158
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,060
and hurts the princess.

159
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,900
- Aye!
- Aye!

160
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,740
Stop.

161
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,020
What are you here for?

162
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,640
To deliver some pastry to Her Grace.

163
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,300
Get in there.

164
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,500
Zhu.

165
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,340
Zhu.

166
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,540
Zhu.

167
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,420
Let's switch clothes.

168
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,040
Go out of the yard through the back door.

169
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,700
Qianqian and Du Er
are waiting in the back alley.

170
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,740
Xingyi and I will stay to stall for time.

171
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,180
Yueling, what are you doing?

172
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,000
Helping you elope with Du Er.

173
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,000
This is absurd.

174
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,440
You just get back.

175
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,540
Zhu, Zhu.

176
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,380
I know what you're worried about.

177
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,420
When possible,

178
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,580
I'll steal the letter of marriage

179
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,800
and burn the posthouse down.

180
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,020
By then,

181
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,820
Beishuo guards fail to keep the letter

182
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,920
and we won't be involved.

183
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,140
If they want to start a war again,

184
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,840
they'll be restrained by the other states.

185
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,260
How can I leave you here alone

186
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,440
in such risks?

187
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,200
That's great.

188
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,680
Our plan worked.

189
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,040
Next, everything counts on me.

190
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,200
It's such a great day.

191
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,680
Beishuo buddies,

192
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,360
how about we drink some, too?

193
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,400
I've brought some nice beef.

194
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,540
Let me fill your cups.

195
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,140
Instead of standing guard,

196
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,360
you're here for some wine.

197
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,960
Go away.

198
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,560
- Go.
- Today is a big day for our princess.

199
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,520
Let's drink, buddies.

200
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,100
(I must search quickly.)

201
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,520
(Or the drug will wear off soon.)

202
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,420
(Where is the North Prince)

203
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,280
(keeping the letter of marriage?)

204
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,140
What are you looking for?

205
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,320
The letter of marriage.

206
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,940
I... I guess

207
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,740
I'm in the wrong room.

208
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,200
Sorry. I get the wrong guy.

209
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,660
Who are you?

210
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,490
Why do you want
to steal the letter of marriage?

211
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,640
What letter of marriage?

212
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,520
I'm just a thief.

213
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,420
When I saw you come for the wedding thing,

214
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,280
I tried to steal some money.

215
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,700
I'll confess. I will.

216
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,020
I know you're the North Prince.

217
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,500
So, I think you're the richest.

218
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,340
To steal some money,

219
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,000
I certainly want to pick the richest man.

220
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,600
You think I'm the North Prince?

221
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,800
Well, you get the wrong guy.

222
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,600
Isn't this the North Prince's room?

223
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,240
(Martial Guard)
I'm a mere martial guard.

224
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,080
(No wonder I can't
find the letter of marriage.)

225
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,680
(So, it's not the prince's room.)

226
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,300
Hey, martial guard.

227
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,620
Look, I haven't stolen anything.

228
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,520
How about this?

229
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,440
You let me go.

230
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,840
I won't go.

231
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,900
I just won't.

232
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,420
Not enough?

233
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,320
I'll give you more, then.

234
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,720
Still not enough?

235
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,540
It's pretty much, actually.

236
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,980
It's hard for me to save up money.

237
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,340
And I have a naughty brother to raise.

238
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,280
How about we...?

239
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,600
Let go of each other.

240
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,380
This is all that I have, sir.

241
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,740
As the North Prince's bodyguard,

242
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,700
I'm here to catch a thief

243
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,560
instead of dealing with her.

244
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,020
Got it?

245
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,160
Yes, yes.

246
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,040
It's really greedy of you.

247
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,240
(Maybe he knows
where the letter of marriage is.)

248
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,320
(He can't die.)

249
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,040
They're dead.

250
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,200
(Why am I still here?)

251
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,320
- It's you again?
- It's you again?

252
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,880
Weren't we killed just now?

253
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,680
Why are we still here?

254
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,420
Did I have a nightmare?

255
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,120
You have the same memory as mine?

256
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,260
Will there

257
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,480
really be assassins?

258
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,600
As... assassins?

259
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,040
Who assassinated us?

260
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,840
Why would they?

261
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,640
I don't think we're the only target.

262
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,560
Dongyu?

263
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,740
Somebody!

264
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,840
Assassins will come.

265
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,060
Stand by, everybody!

266
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,920
- Yes!
- Yes!

267
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,440
Xingyi.

268
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,980
You...

269
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,820
Yueling,

270
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,400
I'm all right.

271
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,680
Go check on the princess in the room.

272
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,080
It hurts so much.

273
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,060
Your Grace,

274
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,580
I'm still too late!

275
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,460
Your Grace,

276
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,780
the assassins kidnapped you!

277
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,160
Your Grace!

278
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,360
Oh, Your Grace!

279
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,860
Your Grace, we failed to protect you.

280
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,980
Princess Zhu isn't in the room.

281
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,580
When you're kidnapped,

282
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,920
how can we explain this to His Majesty?

283
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,380
Oh, Your Grace!

284
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,300
You protected Her Grace poorly

285
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,940
so that she was gone.

286
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,460
I saw the assassins take Her Grace away.

287
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,640
They're so vicious.

288
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,800
Her Grace

289
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,800
will die soon.

290
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,200
Oh, Your Grace.

291
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,680
Interesting.

292
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,420
Our Princess Zhu

293
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,480
has died for no reason.

294
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,580
Why isn't your prince coming out

295
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,820
to explain this?

296
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,440
Yeah. Where's he?

297
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,880
Don't think

298
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,240
you can see our prince

299
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,720
just as you wish.

300
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,740
Something so terrible happened.

301
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,480
He's supposed to explain it.

302
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,140
So far,

303
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,520
he hasn't shown up.

304
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,100
Can your prince

305
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,400
be too devious to be seen?

306
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,220
Yeah.

307
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,540
Where's your prince?

308
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,800
Don't talk nonsense.

309
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,080
Who are you, Miss?

310
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,420
Why do you insist

311
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,440
that your princess is dead?

312
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,940
Anyway, I saw the assassins

313
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,840
take her away.

314
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,620
It's very likely

315
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,060
that she's dead now.

316
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,800
You people are to blame.

317
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,860
Right.

318
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,840
You're to blame.

319
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,100
Are you all right?

320
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,360
- Leave us.
- Yes.

321
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,940
Your Highness,

322
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,000
no betrothal presents were stolen.

323
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,060
I just didn't expect

324
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,080
the Roufeng Sect to be so impatient.

325
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,080
What about the Dongyu escort?

326
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,760
They're still asking for trouble.

327
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,050
A dozen of our people were dead or injured.

328
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,400
But they lost nearly

329
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,960
half of their people.

330
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,240
Looks like

331
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,800
Dongyu people didn't

332
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,360
collude with the Roufeng Sect.

333
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,820
But when the Eldest Princess is gone,

334
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,460
instead of searching for her,

335
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,520
they insist that she's dead.

336
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,000
Don't you think it's weird?

337
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,000
Your Highness, are you saying

338
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,480
they actually stole their princess

339
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,880
and have been hiding her?

340
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,640
Keep a close eye on the two of them.

341
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,600
Don't let them run away.

342
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,300
Yes.

343
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,160
Yueling,

344
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,700
we've been on the run for a long time.

345
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,480
Why haven't we reached Dongyu yet?

346
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,340
Xingyi, hang in there.

347
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,400
We're arriving soon.

348
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,520
Yueling,

349
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,840
am I dying?

350
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,060
Back in Dongyu,

351
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,780
I'll have the witch doctor detoxify you.

352
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,700
You won't die.

353
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,400
Where are you going to run?

354
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,540
He's poisoned with the toxin
from the Roufeng Sect,

355
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,000
the No.1 Assassin Group in Beishuo.

356
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,860
Nothing can detoxify him,

357
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,080
except their own antidote.

358
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,600
Don't try to scare us.

359
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,680
I don't need to.

360
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,220
In less than a dozen days,

361
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,920
this young man will be dead.

362
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,360
Yueling.

363
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,000
It's easy for him to kill us now.

364
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,360
He doesn't seem to be lying.

365
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,040
But I'm still so young.

366
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,960
I don't want to die like this.

367
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,300
Well, tell me.

368
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,580
Where is the Roufeng Sect?

369
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,720
How can I get the antidote?

370
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,720
Only when you go to Beishuo with me

371
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,280
can you possibly get it.

372
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,360
Failing the agreement,

373
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,820
you lost the princess of marriage.

374
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,640
Do we have to die there, too?

375
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,620
You and your brother are weird.

376
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,040
You inexplicably popped up in the escort

377
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,480
and sneaked into our prince's room
to steal the letter of marriage.

378
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,000
As for where the real princess is...

379
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,960
I guess you know that better than I do.

380
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,020
I'm Princess Zhu's maid

381
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,000
and this is my younger brother.

382
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,100
Greatly indebted to Her Grace,

383
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,960
we came to say farewell.

384
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,580
What letter?

385
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,580
I don't understand.

386
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

387
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,180
You failed to protect Her Grace as agreed

388
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,300
and finally lost her.

389
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,420
What does it have to us?

390
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,360
Yeah.

391
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,020
All right.

392
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,780
If you don't go to Beishuo with me,

393
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,520
your brother will die.

394
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,520
If we go with you,

395
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,640
can you save him?

396
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,120
I'll look for the antidote for you

397
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,120
and you'll conceal
the disappearance of the princess.

398
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,940
It's a good deal for you.

399
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,180
The princess is really missing.

400
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,420
How can we conceal it?

401
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,000
Or you want me to give you another princess?

402
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,880
It sounds feasible.

403
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,160
Do you mean

404
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,900
you want me to be her?

405
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,780
You must not use my sister!

406
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,620
Xingyi.

407
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,240
How about we approve now?

408
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,660
When we get the antidote,

409
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,680
we can sneak away.

410
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,140
Fine, then.

411
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,600
We'll sneak away together.

412
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,400
We'll take this deal.

413
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,280
We died, indeed.

414
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,400
(But we came back to life.)

415
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,000
(Is it)

416
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,560
(because of the jade pendant
given by the necromancer?)

417
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,300
Your Highness,

418
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,800
you must be tired after the whole day.

419
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,040
Have some refreshments.

420
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,640
What have you got?

421
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,260
I asked around.

422
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,390
They said the girl and the young man

423
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,040
grew up with Princess Zhu.

424
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,820
Yueling is the maid

425
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,880
while Xingyi is the bodyguard.

426
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,520
And you believe that?

427
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,760
Is it not true?

428
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,920
They can't be ordinary people.

429
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,580
But our top priority

430
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,280
is to complete the marriage thing.

431
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,240
Her identity does not matter.

432
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,400
What matters is
that she is the princess of marriage.

433
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,860
Maybe the adventure brought by this girl

434
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,160
can be the key to a smooth trip.

435
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,140
And they must not know

436
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,600
who I really am.

437
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,040
What?

438
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,560
Do I look like the princess?

439
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,180
Yes, really.

440
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,760
It restrains me so much.

441
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,880
Showing your face before the marriage

442
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,720
is against the rules, huh?

443
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,160
Don't bother.

444
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,440
I'm not the real princess of marriage.

445
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,160
Rules aren't for me.

446
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,740
I can guarantee the Dongyu escort

447
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,360
will remain tight-lipped about my identity.

448
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,080
Can you convince

449
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,180
Beishuo guards?

450
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,180
Guards for this escort

451
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,740
are fully trusted by the North Prince.

452
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,020
I'm confident enough to convince His Highness

453
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,360
to silence his guards about this.

454
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,480
Something so terrible happened.

455
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,080
Where's the North Prince?

456
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,880
Isn't he supposed to talk with me?

457
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,980
Due to the assassination,

458
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,520
His Highness has left.

459
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,720
Such a cowardly prince.

460
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,960
In case of trouble, he was the first to escape.

461
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,080
You complain about His Highness
in front of his subordinate.

462
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,160
Isn't it inappropriate?

463
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,480
Never mind.

464
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,120
Let's stick to our plan, then.

465
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,760
We made the deal.

466
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,120
I'll pretend to be the princess for the moment.

467
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,620
When we're in the Capital City,

468
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,640
you must find the antidote for my brother.

469
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,280
Play your roles perfectly

470
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,120
and I'll keep my promise.

471
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,000
Don't worry.

472
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,760
Umm...

473
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,940
My... My money.

474
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,480
You should give it back to me, huh?

475
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,980
When you pretend to be the princess,

476
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,940
you'll take over her dowry, too.

477
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,780
You won't still care

478
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,520
for a little bit of money, will you?

479
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,340
I...

480
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,040
Why did you shut the door?

481
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,060
I don't think you won't come out again.

482
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,240
I'll be waiting here.

483
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,220
Take it back.

484
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,240
So generous?

485
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,840
Why are there coins only?

486
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,780
(Posthouse)

487
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,220
(Posthouse)

488
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,820
Xingyi,

489
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,280
urge our men to keep the secret.

490
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,300
We can't let Beishuo people know

491
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,360
who we really are.

492
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,160
If they can't find our sister,

493
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,040
I fear they'll have me replace her.

494
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,120
Yueling,

495
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,760
rest assured.

496
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,420
Those men

497
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,300
are the loyal guards of our family.

498
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,620
They take orders from me.

499
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,460
From now on,

500
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,740
you're Yueling, the maid,

501
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,160
and I'm Xingyi, the guard.

502
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,980
Your Grace,

503
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,500
there you go.

504
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,400
You may wait,

505
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,560
but your injured brother...

506
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,220
(Posthouse)

507
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,700
Last night, the assassination failed.

508
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,520
Princess Zhu's maid died for her.

509
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,180
Blessed by God, Princess Ashina Zhu

510
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,600
finally survived.

511
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,980
You guys must protect Her Grace more carefully.

512
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,820
- We will!
- We will!

513
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,780
Lin Mu,

514
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,100
arranged more guards

515
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,220
to protect Xingyi.

516
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,060
All right.

517
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,420
We've communicated many times,

518
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,000
but I still don't know your name.

519
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,240
Call me Wen Yu.

520
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,380
Mr. Wen Yu,

521
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,860
you have great martial arts.

522
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,320
Stay beside my carriage at my service.

523
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,520
(You take yourself as a real princess, humph?)

524
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,280
(No one has dared
to order me about like a foot soldier.)

525
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,200
(Why do you stare at me?)

526
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,340
(Do think a fake princess like me)

527
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,640
(can't order you about?)

528
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,620
Let's move.

529
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,690
We sent assassins to the posthouse,

530
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,780
but none of them came back alive.

531
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,060
The marriage escort went on their way.

532
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,980
Well, this time, let's kill them.

533
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,820
All right.

534
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,660
(Wedding)

535
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,720
Yueling.

536
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,700
Xingyi!

537
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,600
Yueling.

538
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,320
Danger!

539
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,080
Xingyi!

540
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,100
Halt!

541
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,180
Halt!

542
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,620
There's an ambush in the forest ahead.

543
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,560
Let's take another route.

544
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,080
How do you know?

545
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,900
You had the same dream again.

546
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,840
So, you know about the ambush in the forest.

547
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,560
Maybe it's not a dream.

548
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,000
Maybe it's what really happened.

549
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,480
What do you mean?

550
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,200
Just now,

551
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,080
we died together, huh?

552
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,680
Perhaps, we're back to life now.

553
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,680
Back to life?

554
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,460
Wen Yu.

555
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,980
No!

556
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,980
Halt!

557
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,720
- Take another route.
- Take another route.

558
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,700
Your Highness,

559
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,160
I have some confusion.

560
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,780
How do you know

561
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,560
there are ambushes on both routes

562
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,480
and insist on taking the third route?

563
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,500
It's a mystery.

564
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,480
I can hardly explain.

565
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,560
Mystery?

566
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,320
(Again?)

567
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,140
Looks like the assassins

568
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,540
have laid an ambush on every route

569
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,700
to Beishuo.

570
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,280
Since you know it, die here.

571
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,000
Halt!

572
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,660
Gentlemen,

573
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,880
is it possible

574
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,300
that you don't need to kill us

575
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,480
and we can kill ourselves?

576
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,760
For example,

577
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,900
use the poison.

578
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,540
Now that you have a death wish,

579
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,760
I can make your dream come true.

580
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,260
This is the Seven-step Poison.

581
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,480
What is she doing?

582
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,040
Thanks. Thanks.

583
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,580
We can come back to life anyway.

584
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,920
Maybe we'll find a solution.

585
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,960
I'll drink it up first.

586
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,380
Hurry.

587
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,240
Stop hesitating.

588
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,100
Here we go.

589
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

590
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,400
Umm...

591
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,240
We're back to life again.

592
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,200
Maybe with this jade pendant,
we can come back to life many times.

593
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,580
But if we can't break out of this,

594
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,280
we'll have to die here sooner or later.

595
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,140
But all the routes to Beishuo

596
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,400
are guarded by the assassins.

597
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,520
How can we break out?

598
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,400
Create a diversion.

599
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,580
Stop that carriage.

600
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

601
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,340
Hold on to me.

602
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,340
Jump.

603
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,260
Go.

604
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,940
Jump off.

605
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,220
But it's way too high.

606
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,020
And I swim very poorly.

607
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,880
Just hold your breath.
