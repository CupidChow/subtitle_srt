Mr. Wang, I'll count on you.

00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,100
No problem.

23
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,980
This girl looks pretty.

24
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,260
But she dances poorly.

25
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,700
Cheers, Mr. Zhang.

26
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,620
Cheers.

27
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,020
Pretty, does it hurt?

28
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,260
I'm fine.

29
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,260
Look.

30
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,260
Even such a terrible dancer

31
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,980
can work in the House of Romance.

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,860
Sorry, officials.

33
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,580
It's the first I've danced here for a living

34
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,180
and seen bigwigs like you.

35
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,660
I can't help feeling nervous.

36
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,620
I'll go get some better girls here.

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,340
- All right.
- Go ahead.

38
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,300
Come on, Mr. Wang.

39
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,100
Mr. Wang, another toast to you.

40
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,510
- Cheers.
- Stop.

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,360
Cheers.

42
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,820
You seductive fox!

43
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,740
How dare you play innocent in front of me?

44
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,580
My husband keeps coming here lately.

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,380
You must have seduced him.

46
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,540
Or why would he come here every day?

47
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,420
Umm... Madam, do you get the wrong girl?

48
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,980
It's my first day here.

49
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,900
I really don't know your husband.

50
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,700
He has a lover here for a long time.

51
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,540
I know that.

52
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,780
Or why would he always not go home?

53
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,540
A seductive girl like you

54
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,180
must be the reason he keeps coming.

55
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,220
Confess. Is it you?

56
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,260
It's really not me.

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,660
Is it you? Confess.

58
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,700
No!

59
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,340
Wen Yu?

60
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,900
Madam, I really don't know your husband.

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,660
This is actually my lover.

62
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,900
What are you doing here?

63
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,300
Why didn't you tell me before you came?

64
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,420
You look handsome

65
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,860
but have a bad taste.

66
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,420
If this seductive girl is yours,

67
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,940
restrain her.

68
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,940
Don't let her out so casually

69
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,220
to seduce someone else's husband.

70
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,860
What are you talking about?

71
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,940
Mind your tongue.
You must be getting the wrong girl.

72
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,420
She and I love each other.

73
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,140
How would she seduce anyone else?

74
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,180
So indecent.

75
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,060
What? No more acting?

76
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,100
Forget it.

77
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,220
Why do you stare at me like this?

78
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,780
Look what you're wearing.

79
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,060
No wonder she got you wrong.

80
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,020
What's wrong with my dress?

81
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,300
And look at you.

82
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,260
When you're dressed like this,

83
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,300
strangers

84
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,780
will think you're a prince.

85
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,940
I am...

86
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,260
Isn't that...?

87
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,100
What are you doing here?

88
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,740
I wanted to ask you.

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,620
You people have pushed too far.

90
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,500
Your emperor made me marry

91
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,100
the useless North Prince.

92
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,460
I'm out for a walk. What's the problem?

93
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,900
The North Prince isn't
as terrible as you think he is.

94
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,220
I don't care.

95
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,660
I may not really

96
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,720
be the North Princess Consort.

97
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,860
Are you going

98
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,620
to run away?

99
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,140
- I...
- Mr. Chen,

100
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,940
what are you doing here?

101
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,820
Baihe.

102
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Baihe, don't go.

103
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,540
Baihe, I really missed you.

104
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,780
So, I came to see you.

105
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,340
Mr. Chen, you lied to me.

106
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,040
How do you have the nerve to see me again?

107
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,850
I'm a businessman.

108
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,660
I shouldn't have lied that I was an official.

109
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,100
- Oh, man.
- Baihe, let me explain.

110
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
He made up an identity to cheat this girl.

111
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,540
- What a dirty trick!
- I don't want to listen.

112
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,500
I just don't.

113
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,180
Baihe.

114
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,700
- He made up an identity.
- I'm really wrong.

115
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,800
- Maybe he has a reason for that.
- I'm sorry.

116
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,980
- Don't ignore me.
- What reason can he have?

117
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,940
You're a musician.

118
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,420
I know you always want to marry an official.

119
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,980
Indeed, I'm a musician.

120
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,540
Marrying an official will change my identity.

121
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,140
But the love between us

122
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,780
can't be as important as such identities?

123
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,220
It's my fault.

124
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,140
I underestimated your feelings for me.

125
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,780
Forgive me this once.

126
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,580
I won't lie to you again.

127
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
Musician?

128
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,960
- What is a musician?
- Really?

129
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,830
Yes.

130
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,420
- Why does a musician want to marry an official?
- If you lie to me again,

131
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,780
- In Beishuo, a musician is humble.
- I won't see you anymore.

132
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,420
- If a musician wants another identity,
- I won't.

133
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,340
she has to marry an official.

134
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,940
This is such a terrible rule.

135
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,580
I'll come and see you in a couple of days.

136
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,700
All right.

137
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,300
But you should

138
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,740
tell your father about our marriage soon.

139
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,740
Rest assured.

140
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,100
I won't betray you.

141
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,660
We

142
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,100
can go out.

143
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,020
I...

144
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,140
I...

145
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,380
I can't feel my legs.

146
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
Thank you.

147
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,900
Wait for me.

148
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,100
What a man!

149
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,140
Some girls can't get married

150
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,260
when they want to

151
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,460
while some have to get married

152
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,540
when they don't want it.

153
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,940
Everyone has his destiny.

154
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,940
Let's say farewell.

155
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,620
See you again.

156
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,660
Ordinary people may choose
who they want to marry.

157
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,180
But if His Majesty knows

158
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,620
the Eldest Princess of Dongyu
will escape against his decree,

159
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,420
the consequences will be terrible, huh?

160
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,940
I guess the troops will be sent to your state.

161
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,540
They'll search throughout Dongyu.

162
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,180
By then, who knows how many

163
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,220
Eldest Princesses will be found?

164
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,620
(So serious?)

165
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,740
Oh, we should do some shopping

166
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,900
for our mansion.

167
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,820
From now on,

168
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,540
we'll live there for a long time.

169
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,100
We need to be well prepared.

170
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,340
You're familiar with this place. Take us there.

171
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,900
Why did you come to the House of Romance?

172
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,380
I came with His Highness.

173
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,620
Your future husband.

174
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,980
The North Prince? He's also here?

175
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,980
Where's he?

176
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,260
I'll go say hello.

177
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,380
A couple can't see each other
before getting married.

178
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,260
It's the rule.

179
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,860
Such a boring rule.

180
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Forget it. I'm going back.

181
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,430
Bravo!

182
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,580
You were away for quite a while.

183
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,500
Did any pretty girl hold you up?

184
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,900
Nothing you need trouble yourself about.

185
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,220
Well, I think.

186
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,980
If you fall in love with any girl,

187
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,220
let me know.

188
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,980
I'll help you get her.

189
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,060
If you don't want me to interfere,

190
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,060
I won't trouble myself, then.

191
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,900
Come on. Let's drink.

192
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,020
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

193
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,980
Miss Su Nian, the unsurpassed lady,

194
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,860
will drink with you.

195
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,900
Thank you, Miss Su Nian.

196
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,020
Madam Sang,

197
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,820
when will Miss Su Nian

198
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,740
dance again?

199
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,820
As long as you visit us frequently,

200
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,100
she'll often dance before you.

201
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,140
Xingyi,

202
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,220
what are you doing?

203
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,980
Why are you glaring at her
as if she was an enemy?

204
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,420
She's an enemy.

205
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,500
Yueling, I've been staring at her for a while.

206
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,780
I'm sure

207
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,500
she's the vicious assassin

208
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,420
who discarded me twice.

209
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,820
Assassin?

210
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,820
Greetings.

211
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,540
I've never seen you before.

212
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,900
Is it your first visit here?

213
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,900
Yes.

214
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,100
Never seen us before?

215
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,660
But you're exactly that assassin.

216
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,420
Assassin?

217
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,460
How could Miss Su be an assassin?

218
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,180
You get the wrong girl, I guess.

219
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,860
I'm a mere dancer in the House of Romance.

220
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,820
That day, you carried me
on the horse for a long time.

221
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,220
I can recognize you, however you change look.

222
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,500
I really don't know what you're talking about.

223
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,460
Yeah, gentleman.

224
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,420
Do you get the wrong girl?

225
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,380
Miss Su Nian has never left here.

226
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,260
Sorry, Miss Su.

227
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,540
My brother

228
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,180
always has face blindness.

229
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,820
I guess he's having the problem again.

230
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,500
If he offends you, please kindly forgive him.

231
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,300
Not at all.

232
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,180
Maybe I just have

233
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,180
a very ordinary face.

234
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,020
It's normal that he can't recognize me.

235
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,420
Hey, you...

236
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,820
Sorry.

237
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,300
A toast to you, dear guests.

238
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,620
Hope you'll often come here.

239
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,260
It's her.

240
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,660
Yueling, it's her.

241
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,660
How can a girl have two faces?

242
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,100
She's so good at concealing her identity.

243
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,180
No wonder she's the unsurpassed lady.

244
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,540
Xingyi, I think Miss Su

245
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,180
looks gentle and behaves elegantly.

246
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,220
She isn't like an assassin at all.

247
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,380
Yueling, you don't trust me?

248
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,580
I do. Let's get back.

249
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,420
I won't.

250
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,020
I'll see

251
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,180
when she'll give herself away.

252
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,980
Sorry to keep you waiting, Your Highnesses.

253
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,780
Knowing the two princes have come,

254
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,220
Miss Su Nian is here to propose a toast.

255
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,140
Greetings, Your Highness.

256
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,740
Greetings, Your Highness.

257
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,020
You may rise.

258
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,340
Miss Su Nian, tonight,

259
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,780
you look gorgeous.

260
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,100
You dance even better than before.

261
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,180
You flatter me, Your Highness.

262
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,060
Let me propose a toast to you.

263
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,180
Indeed.

264
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,140
It's better to watch a pretty girl close.

265
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,300
(Why did I lose my grip at this time?)

266
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,540
(I'm really...)

267
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,780
Shall we rush up or not?

268
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,260
He said he would crack a cup to remind us.

269
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,100
Go.

270
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,140
Su Nian, run!

271
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,940
Go. Hurry.

272
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,060
Look, Yueling.

273
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,460
The assassin will finally give herself away.

274
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,340
Come on, Xingyi.

275
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,580
Let's go help Miss Su.

276
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,420
Don't.

277
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,700
I'm sure she can do martial arts.

278
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,540
You don't still think
she's an assassin, do you?

279
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,740
Yueling, just watch.

280
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
She'll easily kill these guys soon.

281
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,060
Why is she coming over?

282
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,620
Please help me.

283
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,620
Don't worry, Miss Su. We both do martial arts

284
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,700
and we can protect you.

285
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,220
Thank you.

286
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,540
Can't you do martial arts, too?

287
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,780
Why do you need us?

288
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,580
Don't be so rude to a lady.

289
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:05,940
You keep her safe.

290
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,780
I'll be right back.

291
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,580
Don't move.

292
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,300
Isn't he the cowardly man I met in the day?

293
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,860
Why is he here?

294
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,780
Don't... Don't come over.

295
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,980
Don't do silly things.

296
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,060
What?

297
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,860
The South Prince has really good martial arts.

298
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,060
You're that assassin.

299
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,820
Don't go.

300
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,820
Why are you still here?

301
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,230
These assassins after this cowardly man...

302
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,070
You don't come over.

303
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,580
- Who are they?
- What?

304
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,540
Stay away.

305
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,900
He can't be the North Prince, can he?

306
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,740
Stay behind me.

307
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,940
He's the South Prince.

308
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,580
- You know each other?
- Don't come over. Just don't.

309
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,740
Not really.

310
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,020
He tried to save me.

311
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,980
- But his plan failed.
- Don't run.

312
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,580
(You just need to pretend to kill me.)

313
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,860
(But you idiots)

314
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,020
(keep coming after me.)

315
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,620
Come on.

316
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,500
Protect the North Prince.

317
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,220
That's right. Protect the North Prince.

318
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,100
Protect the North Prince.

319
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,940
Run!

320
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,300
Too late.

321
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,420
Again?

322
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,460
You're such an idiot.

323
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,900
Protect the South Prince!

324
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,100
(This isn't)

325
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,500
(what I planned.)

326
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,260
(Wen Yu, I'll save you.)

327
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,500
One.

328
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,460
Two.

329
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,620
Yueling, what are you doing?

330
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,460
Go with me.

331
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,620
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

332
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,420
Your Highness, Your Grace,

333
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,460
you're back.

334
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,660
I packed something else.

335
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,700
When are we leaving?

336
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,060
That vicious woman

337
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,340
has so many tricks.

338
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,220
She's sometimes gentle and sometimes evil.

339
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,700
Oh, no.

340
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,220
Is Wen Yu dead?

341
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,820
What happened?

342
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,540
Why do you look so dazed

343
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,300
after you're back?

344
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,660
Oh, no.

345
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,780
It must be her.

346
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,580
I didn't die with him.

347
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,700
What are you talking about?

348
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,020
Why can I not get it?

349
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,420
So, are we escaping or not?

350
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,900
- No.
- No.

351
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,300
No?

352
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,420
Wen Yu, who escorted me here...

353
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,580
He died.

354
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,540
How did that happen?

355
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,300
He's young. That's too bad.

356
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,460
But what does it have to do

357
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,020
with our escape?

358
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,620
You don't understand.

359
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,780
He needn't have died.

360
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,180
If I had died with him,

361
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,580
we would be back to life.

362
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,740
Your Grace, the dead can't come back to life.

363
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,500
How can he live again?

364
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,340
That's not right.

365
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,700
Nobody else can. But he can.

366
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,140
Not alone.

367
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,900
We can come back to life together.

368
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,740
Forget it.

369
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,460
I'm going to the North Prince's mansion.

370
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,000
Your Grace, it's late at night.

371
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,620
It's really inappropriate
to see a martial guard

372
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,260
in the North Prince's mansion now.

373
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,940
If you really want to see him,

374
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,140
how about you go tomorrow?

375
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,740
You can send an invitation,

376
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,540
offering to visit the North Prince

377
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,460
as his bride-to-be.

378
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,220
But a couple can't see each other

379
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,300
before getting married.

380
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,740
What if the North Prince doesn't approve?

381
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,660
Yueling,

382
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,300
why would Dongyu people like us

383
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,540
obey Beishuo rules?

384
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,180
You're right.

385
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,620
My top priority

386
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,220
is to check on Wen Yu.

387
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,300
I can't bother about anything else.

388
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,220
I'll go prepare the invitation, then.

389
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,620
Hope Wen Yu will be all right.

390
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,820
Your Highness!

391
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,260
Your Highness!

392
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,300
I failed my job to keep you safe.

393
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,900
I should be punished, Your Highness.

394
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,620
Your Highness.

395
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,860
I'm not dead yet.

396
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,420
Forget it. It wasn't your fault.

397
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,540
Oh, Your Highness,

398
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,620
a message was sent from Dongyu.

399
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,580
I haven't told you yet.

400
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,980
Tell me now.

401
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,500
According to our scout,

402
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,860
in Dongyu,

403
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,580
besides the Eldest Princess,

404
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,860
there is another princess.

405
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,540
And her name is Yueling.

406
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,580
Ashina Yueling.

407
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,020
This young princess is said

408
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,660
to be always liberal.

409
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,180
Now, she isn't in the imperial palace.

410
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,020
Oh, Your Highness.

411
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,620
Even more coincidentally,

412
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,780
she has a little brother,

413
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,020
Xingyi.

414
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,940
The young prince of Dongyu.

415
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,420
Yueling for Ashina Yueling.

416
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,220
Xingyi for Ashina Xingyi.

417
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,620
Oh, I see.

418
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,460
Such a dramatic trick.

419
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,140
So, she and her brother fooled us.

420
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,180
No wonder

421
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,100
they helped the Eldest Princess escape.

422
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,220
Have our men watch over Dongyu.

423
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,100
Remember.

424
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,220
Don't let anyone else know about this.

425
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,020
So, you'll marry the young princess

426
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,340
instead of the Eldest Princess

427
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,860
and you'll just let it go?

428
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,580
In the marriage,

429
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,140
the bride doesn't really matter.

430
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,420
I must focus on the big picture.

431
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,100
Your Highness.

432
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,060
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

433
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,580
Your Highness, are you injured?

434
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,340
You can't die, Your Highness.

435
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,260
Injured?

436
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,340
That's what you've been expecting, huh?

437
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,620
If only I was injured!

438
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,060
Then I could frame Zhou Shiyu

439
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,260
for murdering his elder brother.

440
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,660
But what happened?

441
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,900
He was stabbed to protect me.

442
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,340
Even His Majesty has heard about it.

443
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,140
Now, he's meritorious!

444
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,660
What do you actually want,

445
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,900
to be injured or not to be injured?

446
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,860
Of course, I want...

447
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,460
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

448
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,060
What matters is your terrible self-injury trick

449
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,580
didn't work at all!

450
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,300
Such an idiot.

451
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,900
Indeed.

452
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,580
That's right. I'm too incapable.

453
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,460
I can't even be

454
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,900
as smart as Piggy.

455
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,260
Or it'll be humiliating the pig.

456
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,620
You even want to roast my pig?

457
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,260
No, no, no. That's not what I mean.

458
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,460
I don't mean that, Your Highness.

459
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,740
Hurry.

460
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,420
Punish him now!

461
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,260
- Yes.
- No, Your Highness.

462
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,500
I really don't mean that.

463
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,340
Piggy.

464
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,700
Your Highness, you get me wrong.

465
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,620
I hate those who love to eat roast pork.

466
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,060
- Your Highness.
- Don't be scared.

467
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,300
Tickle him as hard as you can.

468
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,780
- All right.
- Your Highness.

469
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,140
Don't be scared, Piggy.

470
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,780
You did a good job.

471
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,380
The aggravated contradictions
between the two princes

472
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,420
will drive a feud between them

473
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,220
and impede the young emperor.

474
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,140
It's my duty to help you, Prime Minister.

475
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,980
(The North Prince's Mansion)

476
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,620
It's my honor to be married
to the North Prince by His Majesty.

477
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,940
I hear the North Prince is handsome

478
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,340
and righteous.

479
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,780
Everybody likes him.

480
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,420
I want to see him

481
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,500
for my affection and admiration.

482
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,860
So, I'd like to visit His Highness.

483
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,980
Sorry for the inconvenience.

484
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,740
Her writing skills are really...

485
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,740
Naughty.

486
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,860
Are you sure she's Ashina Yueling,

487
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,180
the young princess of Dongyu?

488
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,030
Yes.

489
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,460
I double-checked it.

490
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,860
Your Highness,

491
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,100
will you meet

492
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,380
this princess?

493
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,860
According to the rule,

494
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,180
a couple can't see each other
before getting married.

495
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,460
She won't give up before seeing me.

496
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,940
Then I can see her

497
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,260
while she can't see me.

498
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,300
I get it. I'm on it.

499
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,420
This way, please.

500
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,780
Is there a Mr. Wen Yu

501
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,140
working for His Highness?

502
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,020
Is he here today?

503
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,300
Wen Yu?

504
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,420
It's me, exactly.

505
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,540
It sounds similar to His Highness's name.

506
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,900
But His Highness said it was all right.

507
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,420
You're Wen Yu?

508
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,220
But the man I know

509
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,180
is a young martial guard.

510
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,700
Someone has the same name?

511
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,140
Well, a lot of talents

512
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,660
work for His Highness.

513
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,980
I can't recognize them all.

514
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,060
The yards here

515
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,620
look really pretty.

516
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,180
Yes, of course.

517
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,500
His Highness is the lineal son
of the late emperor

518
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,260
and the youngest brother of His Majesty.

519
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,660
He can own all the best things in the world.

520
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,660
Come this way, please.

521
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,140
Be careful.

522
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,100
Here.

523
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,300
I'm here.

524
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,100
Over here.

525
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,180
Come.

526
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,140
You can't catch me.

527
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,860
Be careful.

528
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
Where are you?

529
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,740
House of Pretties?

530
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,100
Who is this house for?

531
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,420
You have sharp eyes, Miss.

532
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,820
Ladies in this house

533
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,540
(House of Pretties)
are all gorgeous.

534
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,820
They are sent from different places.

535
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,140
According to His Highness,

536
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,380
he won't marry these ladies

537
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,060
until he has a consort.

538
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,940
Respect to his future wife, you know.

539
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,700
(This prince)

540
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,660
(has built a house of ladies a long time ago)

541
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,140
(and thinks he's respecting his future wife.)

542
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,100
(How shameless!)

543
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,780
This way, please.

544
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,620
(House of Pretties)

545
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,780
(Stay Modest)

546
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,540
Your Highness, the Eldest Princess
of Dongyu is here.

547
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,580
I hear you adore me.

548
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,820
A couple in Beishuo can't see each other
before getting married.

549
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,820
Did no one tell you about it?

550
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,380
Is that why you see me
from behind the curtain?

551
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,900
When you break the rule,

552
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,780
I'll be the one people laugh at.

553
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,140
Your Grace,

554
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,420
I'm sure you can understand,

555
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,380
can't you?

556
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,700
You have your rules

557
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,140
while we have ours.

558
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,060
A couple can't see each other here.

559
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,220
But that's not the case in our state.

560
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,100
If it's inappropriate, please understand.

561
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,380
Unlike what you're said to be like,

562
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,500
you have such a quick tongue.

563
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,580
I'm too busy with work

564
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,020
to care about you, Your Grace.

565
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,100
If you need anything,

566
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,060
have someone inform my butler.

567
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,620
I want someone from you, Your Highness.

568
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,180
You'll approve, huh?

569
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,700
Who do you want?

570
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,740
Wen Yu.

571
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,940
Not the butler,

572
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,300
but the martial guard.

573
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,740
Why do you want him?

574
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,260
My maid Yueling

575
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,380
received a lot of help
from Wen Yu on her way here.

576
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,540
So, she adores him.

577
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,780
Yesterday, she accidentally heard

578
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,700
Wen Yu was assassinated
in the House of Romance

579
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,980
and she was really worried.

580
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,860
So, she begged me to come and ask about him.

581
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,180
Your Highness, do you know how Wen Yu is now?

582
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,900
You sound so anxious.

583
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,420
I think you actually adore him

584
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,820
instead of Miss Yueling.

585
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,940
Yueling adores him.

586
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,260
I'm just anxious for her.

587
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,060
Tell Miss Yueling

588
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,940
to forget Wen Yu.

589
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,940
Why?

590
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,980
Because he's dead.

591
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,900
Be careful, Your Grace.

592
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,140
Qianqian,

593
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,580
Wen Yu is dead.

594
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,580
Your Grace, the dead can't come back to life.

595
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,740
Don't hurt yourself.

596
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,900
I got him killed.

597
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,460
That's not true.

598
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,540
Go buy me a brazier.

599
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,540
I'm on it.

600
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,900
What maid?

601
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,380
It's just you.

602
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,740
Your Highness,

603
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,860
what did you just say to Her Grace?

604
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,940
She looked absent-minded

605
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,990
and couldn't even walk steadily.

606
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,820
I feared she would bump into a pillar.

607
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,420
Nothing.

608
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,420
I don't know what I should burn for you.

609
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,380
Here's some paper money.

610
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,180
Enjoy it.

611
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,620
And these pretty women of all kinds.

612
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,740
Pick one as your wife.

613
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,660
You didn't

614
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,420
leave your jade pendant to me.

615
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,140
I'll then burn

616
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,140
my pendant for you.

617
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,420
If you get into trouble in heaven,

618
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,340
it may help you.

619
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,660
Do you not want to lose the pendant

620
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,740
or do you not want to lose me?

621
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,380
Wen Yu,

622
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,980
if... if you hate this,

623
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,220
go find those men who killed you.

624
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,060
Whatever you want,

625
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,020
I'll burn it for you.

626
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,540
I'll burn... I'll burn some paper money.

627
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,700
Or anything. Anything you want.

628
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,460
And these pretty women...

629
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,460
Pick one.

630
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,020
I'll burn anyone you want.

631
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,420
These women are boring.

632
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,780
I want you!
