Come on.

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,610
Be careful.

The Red Rhizoma!

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,480
Be careful.

24
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,410
Do you feel better?

25
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,850
Much better.

26
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,360
It works. The antidote finally works!

27
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,450
Yueling!

28
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,130
Yueling.

29
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,610
Yueling. Come up.

30
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,560
It tastes too bitter.

31
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,290
You've been tired these days

32
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,730
and you went up the cold mountains.

33
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,440
You have to drink some decoction for a cold.

34
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,290
Have a candy and you won't feel bitter.

35
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,650
Not until you drink it.

36
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,930
Here.

37
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,650
The last sip.

38
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,090
When did you buy the candy?

39
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,360
The other day, you rejected the decoction

40
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,370
and I bought some.

41
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,440
Thank you.

42
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,360
Without you,

43
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,120
people in Liuzhou wouldn't
have survived this.

44
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,480
Take a good rest.

45
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,290
When you totally recover,

46
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,810
we'll go home.

47
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,850
Come in.

48
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,160
Yueling.

49
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,650
You guys talk.

50
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,530
What happened?

51
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,970
I think something's bothering you.

52
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,410
Yueling, umm...

53
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,210
A friend of mine

54
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,770
has fallen in love with a girl.

55
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,000
But that girl plays hard to get.

56
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,770
He doesn't know what to do.

57
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,290
If your friend is from Dongyu,

58
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,090
he should take the initiative bravely

59
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,210
and let the girl know about his deep love.

60
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,650
Even if he's rejected, he shouldn't be scared.

61
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,410
He'll have at least confessed his love.

62
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,170
Do you agree?

63
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,200
I get it.

64
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,370
I'll see her now.

65
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,440
Take a good rest.

66
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,210
Isn't it supposed to be his friend?

67
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,530
Oh, a grown man can't be kept at home.

68
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,320
I said too much when I was sick.

69
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,410
I don't know how to take it back.

70
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,850
I must succeed this time.

71
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,680
I can't act rashly again.

72
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,800
I can't disgrace Dongyu men.

73
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,800
Su Nian, what is this silly prince doing?

74
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,960
He's nearly ruining our tree.

75
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,850
I don't know.

76
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,530
Su Nian, is he

77
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,080
displaying his great strength?

78
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,960
Su Nian, that silly prince seems to be tired.

79
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,170
Su Nian, won't you see him?

80
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,010
No need.

81
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,960
You just go back.

82
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
Su Nian,

83
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,080
I failed to buy the pairs you wanted yesterday.

84
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,800
Do you still want some today?

85
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,770
Lingxi, what are you doing?

86
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,610
Shh.

87
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,720
Pears?

88
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,370
I'll go buy some.

89
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,560
Su Nian, that silly prince is gone.

90
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,850
Miss Su Nian,

91
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,370
I saw someone selling pairs

92
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,320
and I bought some for you.

93
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,200
Have a taste.

94
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,160
Here.

95
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,530
Thank you, Mr. Xingyi.

96
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,170
Su Nian just wants it.

97
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,290
You're welcome.

98
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,960
Su Nian...

99
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,250
Lingxi, don't tease him.

100
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,130
Fine, Su Nian.

101
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,380
(True Virtues)

102
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,370
Your Highness,

103
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,410
Magistrate Li Zhong has been caught.

104
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,920
When his plan was revealed,

105
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,050
he fled to the Prefect of Pingzhou overnight.

106
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,800
In case you'd accuse him to His Majesty,

107
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,890
he bribed a servant to poison the well.

108
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,200
He wanted people in Liuzhou to die

109
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,440
for his ambition.

110
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,560
He's rather cruel.

111
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,170
I think it goes a little further than that.

112
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,250
Your Highness, do you think

113
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,770
Li Zhong isn't the poisoner?

114
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,080
I just think

115
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,530
the poisoner was caught so easily

116
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,960
as if he was deliberately sent to us.

117
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,410
I'll have a further investigation, then.

118
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,560
No need.

119
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,560
We can't find out who's behind it.

120
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,490
Have Li Zhong escorted back soon.

121
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,650
Yes, Your Highness.

122
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,440
Also, grain was bought from Chen's Rice Shop

123
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,680
at the command of yours.

124
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,440
Are we leaving?

125
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,840
You really don't stand on ceremony.

126
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,890
My consort made the tea. Why would I?

127
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,050
Who's your consort?

128
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,080
Do you have something to say?

129
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,600
I want you to help me with something.

130
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,890
It's for you. Taste it during the trip.

131
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,410
When did you buy it?

132
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,960
When you were asleep.

133
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,370
Are you bribing me?

134
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,770
Yes, if you think so.

135
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,010
But anyway,

136
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,200
how shall we tell him?

137
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,170
When we arrive in the Capital City,

138
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,440
I'm afraid we'll have no chance.

139
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,050
There's still time.

140
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,770
I know Zhou Zhixuan.

141
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,370
He can't sit still.

142
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,050
If you don't believe me, let's wait and see.

143
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,960
Why are we falling farther behind?

144
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,010
Are they doing something evil in it?

145
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,680
I can't just sit and do nothing.

146
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,490
Your Highness, what do you want?

147
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,800
What do I want?

148
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,080
Catch up with the carriage ahead of us!

149
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
Catch up with them.

150
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
- All right.
- Faster!

151
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,600
I will catch up.

152
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,530
Yang Xu, have him slow down.

153
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,840
What if I die of a fall?

154
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,320
Back in the Capital City,
you two will sleep in the barn!

155
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,490
Oh, Yang Xu. My bottom!

156
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,770
Idiots!

157
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,010
Zhou Shiyu, stop.

158
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,010
You guessed it right.

159
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,890
Looks like he can't sit still.

160
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,080
What's up, Zhixuan?

161
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,530
You aren't married yet.

162
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,920
Sharing one carriage is indecent.

163
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,410
I don't think it's indecent.

164
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,370
What do you say, Yueling?

165
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,920
I also don't think it's indecent.

166
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,720
It's indecent. It is.

167
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,010
I...

168
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,800
Stop their carriage!

169
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,530
Your Highness, why?

170
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,560
I'll take their carriage.

171
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,250
Your Highness, their carriage is much smaller.

172
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,250
If you take it, you'll have to suffer.

173
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,320
Why don't you just stay?

174
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,200
In what universe

175
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,930
do you see our carriage is bigger?

176
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,800
But...

177
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Shut up and catch up with them!

178
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,400
Yes.

179
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,130
Catch up. Hurry.

180
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,170
- Zhou Shiyu.
- Hurry.

181
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,610
Get out of the way.

182
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,920
Out of the way.

183
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,770
Why do you take our carriage

184
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,170
instead of your big one?

185
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,370
I thought about it.

186
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,050
I should stick together with you.

187
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,490
After all, that carriage is way too luxurious.

188
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,320
That's right.

189
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,010
Your trip to Liuzhou

190
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,050
is really impressive.

191
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,960
How is it impressive?

192
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,200
Liuzhou was hit hard by the disaster.

193
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,960
You offered 1,000 taels without hesitation

194
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,130
for its reconstruction.

195
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,440
Then, in the case of poison,

196
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,410
you went through it with us

197
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,960
and nearly lost your life.

198
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,130
You're right.

199
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,050
His Majesty didn't order you to come,

200
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,200
but you came without hesitation.

201
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Such a spirit of justice for people

202
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,920
is really admirable.

203
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,490
You're right.

204
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,840
Definitely right.

205
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,320
You know me, Your Grace.

206
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,370
During my trip to Liuzhou,

207
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,010
I offered my money and myself.

208
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,560
Never mind.

209
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,600
I'm always a kind guy.

210
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,770
Kind?

211
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,080
I donated five hundred dan of grain.

212
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,680
Why do you not praise me, Yueling?

213
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,680
Why do I have to praise you?

214
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,770
Your Highness,

215
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,560
you donated five hundred dan of grain.

216
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,440
But I heard you bought it

217
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,800
from the South Prince's maternal family.

218
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,010
I spent my own money, anyway.

219
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:22,890
I...

220
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,490
Oh, it hurts.

221
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,290
Come on, Zhou Shiyu.

222
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,890
When Brother rewards you,

223
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,370
I should take half the credit.

224
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,440
You can't take it alone.

225
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,680
If my maternal family hadn't stored some,

226
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,530
how could you get the grain?

227
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,920
Don't have it completely backward.

228
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,010
Why?

229
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,250
Why?

230
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,130
Because I'm your second brother.

231
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,530
I'll think it over.

232
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Why would you?

233
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,770
The five hundred dan of grain
is from my family.

234
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,800
Don't try to embezzle it.

235
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,560
Why hasn't His Highness come back?

236
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,490
Why aren't they back?

237
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,690
They're supposed to be back today.

238
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,680
- They're back.
- Look.

239
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,050
Your Grace, you're finally back.

240
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,910
Yeah. At last.

241
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,250
I missed you so much.

242
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,160
You went to Liuzhou without me.

243
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,050
You don't know how worried I was.

244
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,690
Don't cry.

245
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,730
Look. I'm all right.

246
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,730
Your Highness, glad you're back safe.

247
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,080
Is everybody all right?

248
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,930
Everything is fine.

249
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,930
Qianqian and I

250
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,450
had planned to go out for you.

251
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,080
Unexpectedly, we were caught.

252
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,930
And we were kept alone in a room

253
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,770
all day and night.

254
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,690
Linmu, don't talk nonsense.

255
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,560
You must not say this.

256
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,730
Why can't I?

257
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,050
Come on. I didn't talk nonsense.

258
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,770
We were kept alone in a room.

259
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,690
After this long trip,

260
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,160
you must be hungry, Your Highnesses.

261
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,210
How about we have dinner?

262
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
I agree.

263
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,530
You've been away for long.

264
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,320
We don't know what to cook for you.

265
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,690
So, we've prepared

266
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,450
soy-braised pork, steamed fish,
and sweet-sour ribs.

267
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,290
A lot of good dishes.

268
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,640
Sounds great.

269
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,880
Yeah, Your Grace.

270
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,120
We've done the best dishes.

271
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,290
I made the soy-braised fish.

272
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,880
- I made that.
- I did.

273
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,770
- I did, actually.
- Stop arguing.

274
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,250
Your Highnesses, shall we go now?

275
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,160
- All right.
- Let's go.

276
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,210
- I made that.
- Fine.

277
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,360
Smells great.

278
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,770
They look delicious.

279
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,120
I made all of them.

280
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,050
And the shrimp...

281
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,120
Honey, you had a hard trip.

282
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,370
Eat more.

283
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,250
- Honey?
- Honey?

284
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,250
Honey?

285
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,250
Let's start to eat.

286
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,400
Well, how about we

287
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,250
make a toast to His and Her Highnesses?

288
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,970
- All right.
- Sure.

289
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,810
A toast to them.

290
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,250

I don't like flowers.

316

Xingyi, after we're back in the Capital City,

319
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,320
don't come to see me again.

320
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,120
Why?

321
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,160
Did I do something wrong

322
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,560
and upset you?

323
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,000
No.

324
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,930
I have just

325
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,690
realized we shouldn't have connections.

326
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,120
We won't end up well, anyway.

327
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,250
What are you talking about?

328
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,120
Why do I not understand?

329
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,560
We've been doing great, aren't we?

330
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,490
You're a prince.

331
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,330
But I...

332
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,880
Because you're a musician

333
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,250
and the unsurpassed lady, huh?

334
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,490
It doesn't matter. I'm serious.

335
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,330
I don't care.

336
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,450
In Dongyu,

337
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,250
there isn't a hierarchy thing.

338
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,530
It's none of my business.

339
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,450
Anyway, don't come to me again.

340
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,090
Stop the carriage.

341
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,690
Mr. Xingyi, please get off.

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,250
What are you thinking?

345
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,050
Is it about

346
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,250
Su...?

347
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,800
No. It's not Su Nian.

348
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,450
Fine. You're not thinking of Miss Su Nian.

349
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,530
Su Nian.

350
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,400
Su Nian.

351
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,730
What are you doing here?

352
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,080
Why are you so drunk?

353
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,930
I want to speak to Su Nian.

354
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,050
You should go.

355
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,450
- Su Nian.
- She's asleep.

356
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,330
Su Nian!

357
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,600
Su Nian.

358
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,050
Lingxi, leave us.

359
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,320
Su Nian.

360
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,770
Su Nian.

361
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,690
What on earth do you think of me?

362
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,160
Why do you play hard to get?

363
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,840
I told you.

364
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,320
I have no feelings for you.

365
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,120
That's impossible.

366
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,560
When I was dying,

367
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,770
you cared so much about me.

368
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,640
We agreed to go back to Dongyu together

369
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,450
and ride a horse.

370
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,560
Do you remember?

371
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,880
You're my friend now.

372
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,730
Your business will be mine.

373
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,600
When possible, I'll take you back to Dongyu

374
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,290
and ride a horse on the grassland.

375
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,970
That kind of life will be really great.

376
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,560
I just joked to make you happy.

377
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,530
You took it seriously?

378
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,610
I don't believe this.

379
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,050
You must be lying.

380
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,250
You must be.

381
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,400
Su Nian,

382
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,290
don't lie to me.

383
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,080
What do I have to do

384
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,970
to make you give up?

385
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,080
It's the first time I've realized

386
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,450
that stars in your state

387
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,210
also look great.

388
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,800
Yeah. Gorgeous.

389
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,610
Yueling.

390
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,880

(Hall of Politics)
Shiyu owes great merit in the relief work.

418
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,800
If he hadn't taken the lead

419
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,970
and risked his own life,

420
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,210
the problem in Liuzhou

421
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,840
wouldn't have been solved so soon.

422
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,770
Your Majesty, His Highness is a young hero.

423
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,080
It's the luck for our state to have him.

424
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,450
I propose you reward His Highness for solace.

425
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,730
Wait, Your Majesty.

426
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,490
It's too early to reward anyone now.

427
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,970
His Highness resolved the crisis in Liuzhou.

428
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,160
But I'm afraid there's more to the story

429
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,010
of his illegal grain storage.

430
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,250
- That's right.
- That's right.

431
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,840
He has a point.

432
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,560
It's His Highness's duty
to handle the relief work.

433
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,930
But he had stored grain in Liuzhou
even before the disaster.

434
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,250
I'm afraid he wanted to rebel.

435
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,880
Rebel?

436
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,450
- He would rebel?
- How's that possible?

437
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,250
That is treason.

438
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,970
Mr. Liu, watch your language.

439
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,970
Do Ministers of Punishments like you
judge without evidence?

440
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,250
Rebellion is a capital offense.

441
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,050
Framing a prince is also a felony offense.

442
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,400
Shiyu, since you know
rebellion is a capital offense,

443
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,360
how about you tell us

444
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,450
how you got the five hundred dan of grain?

445
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,210
Your Majesty, speaking of the grain,

446
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,770
I'm indeed guilty.

447
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,010
The grain was from the South Prince.

448
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,560
He should take the credit, too.

449
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,970
I didn't tell you about it in time.

450
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,560
Please punish me, Brother.

451
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,450
Why was it from the South Prince?

452
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,720
- Yeah. How's that possible?
- How come it's his?

453
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,530
Why is the South Prince involved?

454
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,640
The South Prince never
gets along with the North.

455
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,210
How would he offer some grain?

456
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,440
Yeah.

457
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,840
Why would Zhixuan offer some grain for relief?

458
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,970
Shiyu, are you making this up

459
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,640
to clear yourself?

460
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,840
Uncle, you're wrong.

461
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,120
I'm the South Prince of Beishuo.

462
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,160
When our people were in trouble, I should help.

463
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,530
Why is that impossible?

464
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,360
But you, Uncle...

465
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,450
Why didn't you do anything
for the disaster relief?

466
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,010
Oh, my poor memory.

467
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,730
I nearly forgot.

468
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,360
Your mother is from the Chen Family,

469
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,160
the famous business family in Beishuo.

470
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,560
All their assets are left to you, Zhixuan.

471
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,210
You only donated five hundred dan of grain.

472
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,400
That was too little.

473
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,450
Zhixuan, you also contributed.

474
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,120
You'll be rewarded, too.

475
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

476
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,930
Your Majesty, when I was in Liuzhou,

477
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,250
I got something else.

478
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,690
Two key figures were caught.

479
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,160
One is Wei Da

480
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,600
who is behind the gain robbery.

481
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,600
The other is Nan Xun

482
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,120
who caught Shi Xuan and ambushed me.

483
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,560
They are secretly supported by some officials.

484
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,800
What?

485
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,120
Is that true?

486
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,080
This is treason.

487
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,010
Since you bring it up right here,

488
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,800
you must have good evidence.

489
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,640
Exactly.

490
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,690
They're being watched here
by the imperial guards.

491
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,530
All right. Get them here.

492
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,320
The officials and I will interrogate them.

493
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,100
(Hall of Politics)

494
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,370
Report!

495
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,250
They killed themselves.

496
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,530
Oh, the timing.

497
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,490
What? How did you do your job?

498
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,690
We're guilty.

499
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,400
Forget it. Leave us.

500
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Your Majesty,

501
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,210
this is their testimony of crimes
from my interrogation.

502
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,560
Please review it.

503
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,780
(Testimony of Crimes)

504
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,250
(Testimony)
Liu Hong had Wei Da

505
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,080
rob the relief grain

506
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,360
and then had Li Zhong
poison the well in Liuzhou.

507
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,080
A lot of local people ended up dead or injured.

508
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
He should be executed.

509
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,600
Liu Hong, do you plead guilty?

510
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,730
Your Majesty, I'm innocent.

511
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,840
Save me, Prime Minister.

512
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,050
Why do you beg me?

513
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,730
How dare you do such treason?

514
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,290
Somebody!

515
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,050
Put Liu Hong in prison!

516
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,360
Your Majesty, I'm innocent.

517
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,200
Your Majesty!

518
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,800
I'm innocent, Your Majesty!

519
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,960
Your Majesty!

520
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,850
Your Majesty!

521
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,560
Shiyu and Zhixuan,

522
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,320
you contributed a lot.

523
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,640
In three days,

524
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,120
I'll hold a victory banquet for you.

525
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,200
- Thank you, Brother.
- Thank you, Brother.

526
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,240
The trip to Liuzhou was extremely dangerous.

527
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,010
Shiyu, you had a hard time.

528
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,240
It was dangerous,

529
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
but anyway, the disaster relief
was done smoothly

530
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,600
and our uncle was weakened.

531
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,560
Now, Liuzhou has truly become

532
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,720
the rear for our great cause.

533
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,970
The assassin

534
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,720
who can identify Uncle was killed.

535
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,930
Or we could have done more.

536
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,410
Uncle always does cruel tricks

537
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,560
we can't guard against.

538
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,930
To take him down, we need to plan carefully.

539
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,890
Oh, is there anything suspicious with him?

540
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,120
Don't worry, Brother.
To solve the problem in Liuzhou,

541
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,560
some grain was taken from our private granary

542
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,080
and it has been filled.

543
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,370
The secret weapons entrusted to Magistrate Liu

544
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,640
are being forged, too.

545
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,760
This time, Uncle only focused

546
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,560
on the grain robbery and Shi Xuan.

547
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,850
He isn't aware of anything else.

548
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,480
That's good.

549
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,760
Shiyu, you did a lot of things.

550
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:21,930
You worked really hard.

551
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,080
At the victory banquet,

552
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,930
I want the Princess of Dongyu

553
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,010
to come as your consort.

554
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,250
What do you say?

555
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,810
As you wish, Brother.

556
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,770
Shiyu,

557
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,640
after she knew you were in trouble,

558
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,970
she rushed to you regardless of anything else.

559
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,600
She even rejected my decree
of the broken engagement.

560
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,760
Her love for you is crystal clear.

561
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,760
Looks like I'll pick a wedding day for you.

562
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,080
Thank you, Brother.

563
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,160
But I want to marry Ashina Yueling

564
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,640
instead of Ashina Zhu.
