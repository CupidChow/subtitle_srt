You take care of him.

21
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,610
Zhou Shiyu took down Mr. Liu.

22
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,170
Sorry I failed my job.

23
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,690
I should have handled this in Liuzhou.

24
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,920
Get Su Nian and Lingxi to me.

25
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,170
I have to know what happened in Liuzhou.

26
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,810
Yes.

(Auspicious and Fortunate)

28
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,080
Why am I back in the mansion?

29

I remember I went to see Su Nian yesterday.

30
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,570
Weird.

31
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,520
Why is the wine of Beishuo
even stronger than that of Dongyu?

32
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,050
His Majesty

33
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,850
(Royal Decree)
hereby announces this.

34
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,570
The North Princess Consort Ashina Zhu

35
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,410
is meritorious for disaster relief in Liuzhou.

36
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,520
She's rewarded with a pair of jade Ruyi

37
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,290
nineteen bolts of fancy yarn,

38
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,450
and nineteen bolts of silk fabrics.

39
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,130
Respect this.

40
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,680
I appreciate the kindness of His Majesty.

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,480
Your Highness, you may rise.

42
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,800
His Majesty invited you

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,410
to the family banquet with His Highness.

44
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,130
You have to prepare properly.

45
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,570
Family banquet?

46
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,410
Yeah.

47
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,610
I'll take my leave, then.

48
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,800
See you, Eunuch Li.

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,330
Qianqian.

50
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,760
Come this way, Eunuch Li.

51
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,200
Put this away.

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,040
Yes, Your Highness.

53
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,850
Leave me.

54
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,360
So many rewards.

55
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,570
Yueling,

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,010
can I have these silk fabrics?

57
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,080
Why does a man like you

58
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,610
need silk fabrics?

59
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,010
For something important.

60
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,920
Do I have to prepare

61
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,730
your betrothal gifts here in Beishuo?

62
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
I've heard quite enough

63
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,610
of your failures.

64
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,680
Aren't you tired of them?

65
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,360
Master, sorry.

66
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,730
It's incompetent of me.

67
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,360
The paper with poor handwriting

68
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,850
can be ripped up.

69
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,530
But if someone fails his mission...

70
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,120
I'll take them out for punishment.

71
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,880
Master, we failed our mission.

72
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,680
But we got some important information.

73
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,530
The Princess of Dongyu and the North Prince

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,880
can do witchcraft.

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,320
That's why we can't kill them.

76
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,530
What is unusual? Confess!

77
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,440
I can't tell very specifically.

78
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,170
But they seem to predict

79
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,030
what we're going to do.

80
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,970
When we poisoned the water,

81
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,360
they even found the antidote.

82
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
That makes no sense.

83
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,130
Prime Minister,

84
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,650
Taoist Master once said

85
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,880
a mysterious force

86
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,120
could fold the time.

87
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,690
Looks like

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
it has something to do with them.

89
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,050
Can it be witchcraft?

90
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,280
Taoist Master,

91
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,800
we found some clues
about the fluctuation you mentioned.

92
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,890
However,

93
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,360
you need to confirm it personally.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,610
What do you want me to do?

95
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,290
Just tell me.

96
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,920
A banquet will held in the palace tomorrow.

97
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,170
Then, the North Prince

98
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,360
will take the Princess of Dongyu there.

99
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,440
You can take this opportunity

100
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,680
and figure out what secret

101
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,410
the two of them have.

102
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,770
I get it.

103
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,410
This time, I'll do something personally.

104
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,530
Zhou Shiyu, I'd like to see

105
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,920
what witchcraft you can do

106
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
to get out of this trouble.

107
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,220
(The West Market)

108
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,770
Your Grace, you want something from Dongyu?

109
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,800
Yeah.

110
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,320
Something went wrong
when I was in the palace last time

111
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,290
and the Great Consort was upset.

112
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,410
So this time,

113
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,360
I'm going to buy her a present.

114
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,120
I should have good manners, you know.

115
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,410
A Dongyu present will be perfect, then.

116
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,730
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

117
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,730
So, today,

118
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,800
I invited Mr. Perfect

119
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,170
to pick a good present for us.

120
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,170
Your Grace, if we're lucky enough,

121
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,410
we may meet some vendors

122
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,440
sell goods from Dongyu.

123
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,610
That's great. Let's look for them.

124
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,560
Your Grace, look.

125
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,120
Baked pancake. Shish kebab.

126
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,970
Three pennies for each.

127
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,440
It smells so great, Your Grace.

128
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,410
I want some.

129
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,240
All right. Sir, ten pieces of shish kebab

130
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,880
and three baked pancake.

131
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,720
All right.

132
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,920
Here, sir.

133
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,320
I haven't had this for a long time.

134
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,680
Here come the soldiers!

135
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,480
Catch them!

136
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,970
Don't run!

137
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,240
- San, let's go.
- Stop.

138
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,370
Hurry.

139
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,810
Stop running!

140
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,290
My... My shish kebab.

141
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,310
My...

142
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,970
There's no more time. Come on.

143
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,730
Why are you running?

144
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,920
How dare you run away?

145
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,320
- No, My Lord. - Found it.

146
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,410
Don't move! Behave yourself!

147
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,850
Our shish kebab...

148
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,420
(The West Market)

149
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,410
For the food from our hometown,

150
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,680
we ran such a long way.

151
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,210
It tastes great, though.

152
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,800
Think about it.

153
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,090
The vendors were doing business.

154
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,050
Why did the soldiers try to catch them?

155
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,050
According to Beishuo laws,

156
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,240
Dongyu people can't do business in town.

157
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,440
So, every time the patrol soldiers come,

158
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,730
the vendors will have to run about

159
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,050
in case of being putting to jail.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,210
What?

161
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,880
How many more ridiculous laws

162
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,290
are there in Beishuo?

163
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,560
Your Grace, don't be angry.

164
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,770
Have you decided

165
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,250
what present to buy?

166
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,200
Oh,

167
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,960
I nearly forgot that.

168
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,820
(The North Prince's Mansion)

169
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,760
How do I look?

170
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,650
You look great in anything.

171
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,250
Let's go.

172
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,340
(Benign and Benevolent)

173
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,840
You keep it secret all the way.

174
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,490
What present is it?

175
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,530
Something special from Dongyu.

176
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,440
I want to give it to the Great Consort myself

177
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,770
for our first meeting.

178
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,320
Something happened last time

179
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,650
and I didn't greet her.

180
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,920
I'd like to apologize.

181
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,960
The Great Consort is very kind.

182
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,040
It's thoughtful of you.

183
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,920
She'll love it, I believe.

184
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,530
This time, I'm here with you.

185
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,010
Nothing will go wrong again.

186
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,010
Don't worry.

187
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,010
I'm still a little bit nervous.

188
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,010
It's your family banquet, after all.

189
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,320
Our family banquet, actually.

190
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,770
Shiyu,

191
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,050
I spent quite a long time

192
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,840
picking out this outfit.

193
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,050
I look very energetic, don't I?

194
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,530
Your Highness, the Great Consort wanted a talk.

195
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,250
What about my consort? She...

196
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,770
You're invited alone, Your Highness.

197
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,250
Her Highness have to wait here.

198
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,960
You just go.

199
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,200
I'll wait here for you.

200
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,130
All right. Wait a minute.

201
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,490
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

202
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,250
Su Nian,

203
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,680
we aren't punished this time.

204
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,770
Luckily, because of Xingyi,

205
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,080
we approached our targets.

206
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,600
We escaped punishment this time.

207
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,440
What about next time?

208
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,040
What's wrong?

209
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,840
Su Nian, are you not happy?

210
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,130
Because of Xingyi, right?

211
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,720
I lied to him.

212
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,200
All this time.

213
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,650
What else can we do?

214
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,200
He's our enemy, after all.

215
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,890
I don't want to be like this anymore.

216
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,560
Maybe

217
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,890
it's time to make a decision.

218
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,440
Greeting, Your Grace.

219
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,440
You may rise.

220
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,320
When you were in Liuzhou,

221
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,530
you became so skinny.

222
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,920
Later,

223
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,800
I'll ask the chefs to make you nutritious food.

224
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,250
It's my fault

225
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,650
to have kept you worried.

226
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,850
Shiyu,

227
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,920
you've always been sensible.

228
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,490
But your consort...

229
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,010
She's trouble.

230
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,370
Who said that?

231
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I hear she's the Princess is impolite

232
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,290
and plays well with her servants.

233
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,170
Quite disrespectful.

234
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,050
They get your mansion in chaos.

235
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,490
Is that true?

236
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,490
Absolutely not.

237
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,650
She has a pleasant disposition

238
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,680
and she's very kind.

239
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,770
She gets along very well with my men.

240
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,280
Are you sure?

241
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,650
Then why do people say

242
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,490
she's very arrogant?

243
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,960
Making you marry a princess

244
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,440
has already aggrieved you.

245
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,800
Since you really like her,

246
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,530
make her your concubine.

247
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,960
Someone else will be your wife.

248
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,050
Your Grace, don't stay this again.

249
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,010
I've made up my mind

250
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,290
that she'll be my wife.

251
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,530
I'll marry no one but her.

252
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,560
How dare you come here again?

253
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,920
Looks like you didn't
have a good lesson last time.

254
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,960
His Majesty invited me.

255
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,600
Why can't I come?

256
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,080
His Majesty invited you for the sake of Shiyu.

257
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,960
You don't actually deserve

258
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,490
to show up at the banquet.

259
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,960
Yeah.

260
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,440
You're a rough girl from a savage state.

261
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,490
Such an eyesore.

262
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,440
(Oh, no. I have to bear it.)

263
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,890
(I'm here, disguised as my eldest sister.)

264
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,840
(I can't give myself away by losing temper.)

265
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,770
If I were you, I would perish with the shame.

266
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,610
Yeah.

267
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,410
Dongyu people are shortsighted and coarse.

268
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,370
They shouldn't come out
to humiliate themselves.

269
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,760
Yeah.

270
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,490
We Dongyu people are shortsighted and coarse.

271
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,010
Ladies,

272
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,290
don't talk to a coarse girl like me

273
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,290
in case I bother your eyes.

274
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,490
You're such a brash girl.

275
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,320
How would Shiyu adore someone like you?

276
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,160
I do adore her.

277
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,960
And I adore no one but her.

278
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,920
Shiyu, how can you be enchanted by her?

279
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,760
Gao Luoyi,

280
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,170
you had my consort kept
in the abandoned palace

281
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,370
and slandered her
in front of the Great Consort.

282
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,290
I explained them to Her Grace.

283
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,290
You'll be grounded for three months

284
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,490
and copy ten Buddhist scriptures.

285
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,010
Go get punished.

286
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,200
Shiyu, let me explain.

287
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,410
If you don't go get punished

288
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,530
and Brother also knows about it,

289
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,200
I guess you'll have to suffer more.

290
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,530
- Shiyu...
- Forget it, Your Grace.

291
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,720
How does this princess

292
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,440
fascinate the North Prince?

293
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,800
I think you're quite idle.

294
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,600
Since you have nothing to do,

295
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,920
go copy the scriptures for the Great Consort.

296
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,530
I've told His Majesty.

297
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,960
After the banquet is over,

298
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,010
you each have to copy ten scriptures

299
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,250
before you can leave the palace.

300
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,800
Yueling,

301
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,730
are you all right?

302
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,490
I'm fine.

303
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,020
(The House of Romance)

304
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,960
Bravo!

305
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,490
- So beautiful.
- Yeah.

306
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,290
She's just like a fairy.

307
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,410
That's right.

308
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,440
- She dances so beautifully.
- Yeah.

309
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,320
What dance is Miss Su Nian doing?

310
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
She's like dancing into my heart.

311
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,610
Gorgeous.

312
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,530
Miss Su Nian has marvelous eyes.

313
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,440
Her eyes take my soul.

314
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,280
Su...

315
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,490
Gentlemen,

316
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,770
what do you think of my dance?

317
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,680
It's wonderful.

318
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,920
Extraordinary.

319
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,770
Great. You're the best dancer in Beishuo.

320
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,960
You make me shy, gentleman.

321
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,440
A toast to you, gentlemen.

322
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,130
I can't bear it anymore.

323
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
Come on. Drink.

324
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,490
Come on, gentleman. Let's drink.

325
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,040
Here, gentleman.

326
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,600
(When I'm doing this,)

327
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,010
(Su Nian will notice, won't she?)

328
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,920
Did... Did she give me a cold stare?

329
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,960
What did you say?

330
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,650
Gentleman, you're leaving?

331
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,770
Where are you going?

332
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,170
- No more food. Bye.
- I haven't danced.

333
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,680
Gentleman, you haven't enjoyed enough.

334
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,410
Su Nian, it's me.

335
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,560
Open the door.

336
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,600
Su Nian isn't here.

337
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,970
Looks like Su Nian still cares about me.

338
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,080
I'll let her rest, then.

339
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,400
I'll come tomorrow.

340
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,640
Didn't you say

341
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,880
you would present a present?

342
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,320
If you don't give it to her,

343
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,530
I'll have it.

344
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,840
I'll give it to her.

345
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,160
Or she would think I have no manners.

346
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,840
Your Grace,

347
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,250
I failed to talk to you when I last came.

348
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,210
I feel really regretful.

349
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,160
So, this time,

350
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,160
I picked a present for you.

351
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,930
What is it? Let me have a look.

352
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,880
I've never seen

353
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,530
such a hat before.

354
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,120
It's a hat of Dongyu style.

355
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,400
Its biggest feature is

356
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,730
its two ear muffs.

357
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,050
It feels comfortable in winter.

358
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,880
Her Grace has everything.

359
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,530
This hat looks bad and weird.

360
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,690
Who would wear that?

361
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,120
Funny.

362
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,210
How could she give such a present?

363
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,290
Dongyu people are so shortsighted.

364
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,600
As far as I see,

365
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,930
this hat is very useful.

366
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,160
I'm sure you have a lot of hats

367
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,160
and many of them are valuable.

368
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,800
But you need a hat

369
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,770
that can keep you warm

370
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,250
from the storms.

371
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,690
I'm ashamed to say this,

372
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,010
but I'm not even as thoughtful as her.

373
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,050
I get your point, Shiyu.

374
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,120
You don't need to speak for her.

375
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,080
This hat...

376
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,970
I'll accept it.

377
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,560
I think this hat looks good.

378
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,490
Where did you buy it?

379
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,970
Buy one for me, too.

380
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,640
Zhixuan,

381
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,640
when I'm talking to Shiyu,

382
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,970
you should not cut in.

383
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,160
You're not a lineal prince.

384
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,080
("You're not a lineal prince.")

385
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,770
(I knew you would say this.)

386
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,130
(So old-fashioned.)

387
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,840
I hear the Eldest Princess of Dongyu
is good at dancing.

388
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,450
Her original Bowl Lamp Dance

389
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,530
is famous throughout the grassland.

390
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,210
Today, the Great Consort is also here.

391
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,970
How about you dance

392
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,880
to entertain everybody here?

393
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,380
She is a guest.

394
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,060
How could you make her dance for fun?

395
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,020
Just to make Her Grace happy.

396
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,500
Don't be mean, Shiyu.

397
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,380
Can she not dance

398
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,020
and everything is just an exaggeration?

399
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,420
I don't think she can't dance.

400
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,980
She just doesn't want to dance.

401
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,220
Maybe the Princess of Dongyu

402
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,940
actually looks down on our state.

403
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,660
This isn't a very good time.

404
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,980
Your Majesty,

405
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,060
Your Grace,

406
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,460
I don't dance very well.

407
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,740
But I'm willing to dance for you.

408
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,300
Hope the Bowl Lamp Dance

409
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
can bring good luck to Your Majesty

410
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,580
and Your Grace.

411
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,580
Good.

412
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,740
It's thoughtful of you.

413
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,860
She's showing bare feet in public.

414
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,980
So indecent.

415
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,140

This is an amazing dance.

432
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,500
You can make a request today.

433
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,780
Unless I'm not able to do it,

434
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,820
I'll give you the best.

435
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,860
Really?

436
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,300
Anything?

437
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,220
Yes.

438
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,860
Anything I'm able to do now.

439
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,100
There's only one thing

440
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,260
I want Your Majesty to approve.

441
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,140
Your Majesty, can you abolish

442
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,300
the pariah system of Dongyu people in Beishuo

443
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,060
so that local people won't despise them?

444
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,700
I didn't know she cared so much for her people.

445
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,700
Such a great princess.

446
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,900
Brother, it's also what I wish for.

447
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,460
I'd like to request with her.

448
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,340
Your Majesty,

449
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,620
in the Capital City, Dongyu people

450
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,300
have to be slaves
unless they have estate properties.

451
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,980
It makes them pariahs.

452
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,460
As pariahs,

453
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,260
they can't have proper freedom,
marriage, or life.

454
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,060
This system ruins their lives.

455
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,940
I just promised to give you something.

456
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,780
Your request

457
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,700
is really out of bounds.

458
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,660
I know what I request now

459
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,380
may not be met.

460
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,180
I'm here in Beishuo for marriage.

461
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,380
And it means to get peace
between the two states.

462
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,260
If I end up married

463
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,500
but my people still suffer injustice

464
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,900
in the Capital City,

465
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,940
what will be the point of my marriage?

466
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,500
You're a wise and brave princess.

467
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,500
But a national affair

468
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,140
can't be as easily solved

469
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,020
as a palace affair.

470
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,060
I'll keep in mind your request.

471
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,380
Maybe

472
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,660
it'll take a few days

473
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
before it's realized.

474
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,460
I'd like you to thank you, Your Majesty,
on behalf of my people.

475
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,180
Hope this day will come soon.

476
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
I hear you love pastry.

477
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,420
Since I can't meet your request today,

478
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,660
I will give you

479
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,980
some special pastry of the palace.

480
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

481
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,540
Taste it.

482
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,980
A little gift from His Majesty.

483
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,820
All right.

484
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,500
It tastes great.

485
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,620
Yueling, what's wrong?

486
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,100
Yueling.

487
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,220
Yueling, what's wrong?

488
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,740
Yueling!

489
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,180
Your Grace!

490
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Your Grace!

491
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,060
Yueling!

492
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,740
Yueling!

493
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,620
Your Grace, what happened?

494
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,540
Yueling!

495
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,620
Yueling!

496
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,220
Yueling!

497
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,860
How dare someone poison her in front of me?

498
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,900
Somebody!

499
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,020
- Here!
- Here.

500
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,700
Seal the palace and investigate immediately!

501
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,820
- Yes!
- Yes!

502
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,060
Shiyu!

503
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,900
- Your Highness!
- Your Grace.

504
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,420
Aren't I supposed to be at the banquet?

505
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,300
Why am I here?

506
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,860
Your Grace,

507
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,700
how do you feel of being bullied?

508
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,540
At today's banquet,

509
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,620
your consort was embarrassed.

510
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,460
I'm terribly sorry.

511
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,660
But we should not

512
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,620
spread this tale

513
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,300
in case the royal image is stained.

514
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,420
I'll investigate secretly

515
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,140
and find the poisoner.

516
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,220
Shiyu, when you're back home,

517
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,260
do console her.

518
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,460
Brother, the banquet is over?

519
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,740
Yeah.

520
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,980
It's just over.

521
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,860
Shiyu, what's wrong?

522
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,500
Confess. Who asked you to poison the pastry?

523
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,500
It's not me.

524
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,460
It's really not me.

525
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,900
It's poisonous?

526
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,620
No way? How's that possible?

527
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,420
You must be insane.

528
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,420
What is poisonous?

529
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,820
Your Grace,

530
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,420
what are you talking about?

531
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,620
Would I give you something poisonous?

532
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,580
Brother,

533
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,660
the pastry is...

534
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,500
Shiyu,

535
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,780
there must be a misunderstanding.

536
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,300
Eunuch Li.

537
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,140
Here.

538
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,060
Take this maid away.

539
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,060
Yes.

540
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,740
Take her away.

541
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,060
- Your Majesty.
- Not me.

542
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,500
- Go.
- You must be drunk.

543
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,460
You're not making sense.

544
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,020
Your Majesty, I'm sober.

545
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,860
It's poisonous and should be tested now.

546
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,140
Lady Chen,

547
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,460
take her away to sober up.

548
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,060
- Yes.
- But Your Majesty...

549
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,620
Come, Your Grace.

550
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,420
What is wrong with the Princess of Dongyu?

551
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,860
How dare she be so ridiculous?

552
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,620
Yeah. She's going too far.

553
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,620
Shiyu,

554
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,460
Lady Chen will take care of her.

555
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,020
You just stay without worry.

556
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,460
Your Grace, do you also think

557
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,140
I talk nonsense because I'm drunk?

558
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,700
I don't understand

559
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,750
why you insist the pastry is poisonous.

560
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,660
I don't know the rules of your state.

561
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,700
Why does nobody trust me?

562
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,420
Why didn't they test the pastry

563
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,420
and catch the poisoner?

564
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,620
Do you really think he can be caught?

565
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,260
If he could be caught,

566
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,740
he wouldn't dare to use this trick

567
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,780
in front of everyone.

568
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,690
It must be perfectly schemed.

569
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,260
The political things are complicated.

570
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,620
I don't understand.

571
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,260
But I know

572
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,460
if you make a big scene,

573
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,760
it won't be easily over.

574
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,380
I believe His Majesty will
figure out the truth.

575
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,540
Now, sorry for the grievance.

576
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,020
I indeed feel aggrieved.

577
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,420
I want to go out for some fresh air.

578
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,770
Thank you for enlightening me.

579
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,740
The terrible Princess of Dongyu.

580
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,620
She instigated Shiyu to ground me.

581
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,620
Gao Luoyi, I'm here to see you.

582
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,460
Zhou Zhixuan, what are you doing here?

583
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,020
To laugh at you.

584
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,260
Hearing you're grounded,

585
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,260
I'm here to see you.

586
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,940
It's so much fun

587
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,460
and I can't miss it.

588
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,150
You...

589
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,060
Your Grace, don't be angry.

590
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,380
How about we go out by using him?

591
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,700
Zhixuan,

592
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,460
help me, please.

593
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,420
Am I hearing it right?

594
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,420
Look, we're not enemies, right?

595
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,660
The enemy of the enemy is your friend, huh?

596
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,500
Think about it.

597
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,660
If the Princess of Dongyu
really married Shiyu...

598
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,620
Oh, no.

599
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,300
You'll totally lose to him,

600
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,420
won't you?

601
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,740
You have a point.

602
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,500
Zhixuan, help me out, please.

603
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,900
Zhixuan.

604
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,900
I'm on your side,

605
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,740
Zhixuan.

606
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,540
Your Grace.

607
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,380
Don't ask. I'm fine.

608
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,980
I haven't said anything.

609
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,980
At today's banquet,

610
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,780
your consort was embarrassed.

611
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,140
I'm terribly sorry.

612
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,700
But we should not

613
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,300
spread this tale

614
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,700
in case the royal image is stained.

615
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,140
I'll investigate secretly

616
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,620
to find the poisoner.

617
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,300
Shiyu, when you're back home,

618
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,220
do console her.

619
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,740
I get it.

620
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,260
I'll take my leave.

621
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,540
I guess Yueling is in danger.

622
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,140
What will make you
break the engagement with my cousin?

623
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,460
Gao Luoyi, let go of me.

624
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,380
- I won't.
- Explain.

625
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,220
Let me go.

626
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,860
Oh, I wondered who this was.

627
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,300
Aren't you the shameless

628
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,260
Princess of Dongyu?

629
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,700
(Seriously?)

630
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,260
(I can't avoid this?)

631
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,700
Who do you mean shameless?

632
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,420
You!

633
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,980
Before you got married, you went to Liuzhou

634
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,980
for my cousin.

635
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,700
Aren't you just shameless?

636
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,250
Princess Luoyi, aren't you grounded?

637
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,060
How dare you come out?

638
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,460
I was grounded because of you!

639
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,940
I didn't even attend the banquet.

640
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,060
And you're one to talk.

641
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,080
I won't bother to argue.

642
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,060
Tell me.

643
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,100
What will make you break the engagement?

644
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,380
Gao Luoyi, let go of me.

645
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,500
I won't.

646
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,780
- Let me go!
- I just won't!

647
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,660
Your Grace.

648
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,740
Your Grace.

649
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,020
Are you all right?

650
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,860
Yueling.

651
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,620
Are you all right?

652
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,620
(Why did the same thing happen?)

653
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,380
(Is it)

654
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,260
(that even if we predict something)

655
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,100
(and change the process,)

656
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,460
(the outcome will remain the same?)

657
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,860
I'm fine.

658
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,420
Let go of me.

659
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,020
Before you calm down,

660
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,900
you'd better not walk.

661
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,860
Shiyu, I fell, too.

662
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,500

I hear the abandoned palace is a good place.

672
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,900
So, I requested Brother
