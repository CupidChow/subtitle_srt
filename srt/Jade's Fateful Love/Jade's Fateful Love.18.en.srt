=Episode 18=

19
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,010
Yueling,

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,530
I've been assisting the Ministry of Revenue

21
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,250
and taking charge of the Capital Government.

22
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,400
The West Market is within my jurisdiction.

23
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,090
Wait a little longer.

24
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,810
I will give Dongyu people a good life.

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,960
So, this is what you've been busy with lately?

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,610
Things are complicated.

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,290
So, I didn't spare any time to see you.

28
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,050
- Don't think I...
- Oh.

29
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,010
The ladies in the abandoned palace...

30
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,920
You know that?

31
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,360
I felt bad for what you suffered

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,850
and punished them regardless of anything.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,890
That's cool, actually.

34
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,520
What's this?

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,890
When you're here,

36
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,890
you need money for your own business.

37
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,080
I neglected that before.

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,010
Take the banknotes.

39
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,920
If you need more, let me know.

40
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,850
Don't bother.

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,410
I've got a solution.

42
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,450
You took Zhou Zhixuan's money instead of mine?

43
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,970
I...

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,410
I borrowed that from him.

45
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,730
I'm done talking to you.

46
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,200
Let go of me.

47
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,800
Not until you take the money.

48
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,600
Fine, I'll take it.

49
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,010
Look what I've got here.

50
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,850
This is the lipstick from the West Market

51
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,730
with Mr. Perfect's painting on it.

52
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,610
Let me have a look.

53
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,130
You have good taste.

54
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,080
I had someone buy it for me

55
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,850
at a very high price.

56
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,360
I also hear this lipstick is made

57
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,050
of the material as good
as that in Diexuan Store.

58
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,080
It has

59
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,410
Mr. Perfect's painting.

60
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,000
And only five pieces are sold a day.

61
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,210
I also heard

62
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,440
the dancers in town used this lipstick

63
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,320
to have fascinated

64
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,650
those young playboys.

65
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,610
I want one, too.

66
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,880
Will you sell it to me?

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,440
I got one after big trouble.

68
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,280
Why would I sell it?

69
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,410
I'll pay more, all right?

70
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,400
I always have a lot of money.

71
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,290
I just won't sell it.

72
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,610
What kind of lipstick can be so attractive?

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
How shortsighted!

74
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,120
You can't get one, anyway.

75
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,560
I want it, too.

76
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,680
- Sell it to me.
- I want it.

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,800
Hey, give it back to me. Come on.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,410
- Let me see.
- Give it back.

79
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,320
It's mine.

80
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,000
Her Highness is making a lot of money a day.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,170
One lipstick costs a hundred taels.

82
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,290
Only five pieces are sold a day.

83
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,610
Limited selling is such a great idea.

84
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,320
I heard Her Highness saved many Dongyu slaves

85
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,770
with the money she made.

86
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,290
Yueling is such a good girl.

87
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,520
One more thing.

88
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,650
Mr. Qin Siyuan has painted

89
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,770
on the pots of their lipsticks.

90
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,290
They're popular with the ladies.

91
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,240
I hear the South Prince is involved, too.

92
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,980
He often visits them.

93
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,480
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

94
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Qin Siyuan?

95
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,850
It's fun.

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,410
Where are you going?

97
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,250
To the West Market.

98
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,530
(The West Market)

99
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,370
Come have a look.

100
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,050
Thank you.

101
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,410
You've taken your friends here,

102
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,050
so my lipsticks sell so well.

103
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,210
Not at all, Your Grace.

104
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,680
Even if I didn't come,

105
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,850
your goods would also sell very well.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,410
Thanks to you, anyway.

107
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,050
Look, the lipsticks

108
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,410
are selling so well.

109
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,120
It's you who sell lipsticks

110
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,730
with Mr. Perfect's paintings, huh?

111
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,610
We are.

112
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,050
You know, our products are expensive.

113
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,210
- So...
- I understand.

114
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,320
I have money. Here.

115
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,400
Wait.

116
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,800
Only five pieces are available a day.

117
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
Let's see who offers the highest price.

118
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,770
Fine, then.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,290
Pack the vermilion for me.

120
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,170
I'll pay a hundred taels.

121
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,410
A hundred taels? You can only get a small one.

122
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,120
I'll offer 150 taels, then.

123
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,970
- I want one, too.
- I came first.

124
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,410
- I also want one.
- Don't grab.

125
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,250
Give me one.

126
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,730
- Be patient.
- Give me one. I want it.

127
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,800
First come, first served.

128
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,480
Be patient. There's enough for you.

129
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,800
You have to pay first.

130
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,880
What's the noise, Xu?

131
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,770
Go restrain them!

132
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,560
They woke me up.

133
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,210
Your Highness, bad news.

134
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,050
The noble girls are fighting for the lipsticks.

135
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,360
What's so bad about it?

136
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,560
Let them be.

137
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Don't make a fuss. My sleep was disturbed.

138
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,920
- Whose money shall I take?
- Mine.

139
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,210
I'll offer two hundred taels.

140
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,650
- Nice and orderly.
- Don't grab!

141
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Ashina Zhu? What are you doing here?

142
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,240
- Princess Luoyi?
- Luoyi?

143
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,610
There you are.

144
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,240
- Gao Luoyi?
- Yeah.

145
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,920
You don't like these lipsticks, do you?

146
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,970
- Why do you fight?
- Yeah.

147
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,920
Why do you want one
when you don't even like it?

148
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,480
I offered first and it's mine.

149
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,090
- First come, first served.
- I came first.

150
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,560
- I came first.
- I did.

151
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,730
- I came first.
- Give it to me.

152
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,120
It's yours now. Take it.

153
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,000
It's mine.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
First come, first served.

155
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,440
Don't you know the rule?

156
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,210
Give it to me. It's mine.

157
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,850
We asked for it first.

158
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,480
- Don't be in a mess.
- Why can you grab?

159
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,610
- Wait.
- The soldiers!

160
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,040
Here come the soldiers!

161
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,480
I was here first.

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,840
Give it to me.

163
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,810
Your Grace!

164
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,000
- Your Grace!
- Honey!

165
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,370
- Your Grace.
- Honey.

166
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
Honey.

167
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,000
Catch anyone who is involved!

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
- Yes!
- Yes!

169
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,100
(The Capital Government)

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,920
Somebody!

171
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,240
- Let us out!
- Anybody?

172
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,320
Let us out!

173
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,480
Let us out!

174
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,170
- I want to go home.
- Anybody there?

175
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,410
You're daring!

176
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,800
How dare you imprison me?

177
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,850
My father will not let you go!

178
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,090
- Yeah. You can't get away.
- Come on.

179
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,530
Somebody come!

180
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,050
The Princess of Dongyu will be all right, huh?

181
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,000
She just collapsed, I think.

182
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,360
I didn't hit her.

183
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,120
She hit the table herself

184
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,650
as if she lost her mind.

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,290
Noble ladies,

186
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,290
stop shouting.

187
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,480
Save your breath.

188
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,560
Unless the North Prince approves,

189
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,680
we won't dare to release you.

190
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,880
Ask...

191
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,850
Ask Shiyu to come and save me.

192
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,240
Hey, don't go. Don't.

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,610
Don't go.

194
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,970
- Your Majesty.
- Mercy, Your Majesty.

195
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,240
(Deqing Hall)
Your Majesty, do justice to my daughter!

196
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
My daughter has been gentle.

197
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,880
She wouldn't do
anything like that, Your Majesty.

198
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,800
She must be innocent.

199
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,320
Yeah, Your Majesty.

200
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,370
Your Majesty.

201
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,920
Be perceptive, Your Majesty.

202
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Your Majesty, please be perceptive.

203
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,170
My daughter has been timid.

204
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,170
She would never fight anyone.

205
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,010
Your Majesty.

206
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,890
Marquis Qixuan, Minister Liu, Prince Gao Shan,

207
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,080
and Commandant Ma

208
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,010
have been waiting out there for a long time.

209
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,490
Will you see them?

210
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,940
No, I won't!

211
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,130
On the West Market, their daughters
fought the North Princess Consort

212
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,600
for some lipsticks

213
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,170
and were caught in prison.

214
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,370
Now, they're here, asking me

215
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,600
for their daughters.

216
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
Ask them to talk to Shiyu!

217
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,560
Yes.

218
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,920
I told them several times.

219
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,490
But they just don't leave.

220
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,200
They are

221
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,370
important ministers of our court.

222
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,650
Isn't it inappropriate to have them

223
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,840
make a scene like this?

224
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,920
Let them kneel, then!

225
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,890
Your Majesty.

226
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,600
How's the North Princess Consort?

227
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,560
Your Majesty,

228
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,130
Her Highness woke up.

229
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,530
Glad to hear that.

230
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,410
Get Shiyu to me.

231
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,250
Time to put an end.

232
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,560
Yes.

233
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,970
Your Majesty,

234
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,440
I didn't have this daughter until I was old.

235
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,650
In her life, she has never been

236
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,560
in prison before.

237
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,650
Your Majesty,

238
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,440
my daughter has been timid.

239
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,920
She would never fight anyone

240
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,960
on the street.

241
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,840
Please be perceptive, Your Majesty.

242
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,050
My daughter has always been disciplined.

243
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,250
There must be some misunderstanding.

244
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,290
- Yes.
- That's right.

245
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,680
- There must be some misunderstanding.
- Yeah.

246
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,720
Gentlemen, you love your daughters

247
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,560
and beg His Majesty to release them.

248
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,920
But my consort is still in a coma.

249
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,920
Do you think your daughters

250
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,770
have not even a single responsibility?

251
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,520
Umm...

252
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,960
There are many ladies in the palace

253
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,840
and sometimes they don't get along.

254
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,050
Your Highness,

255
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,600
you'd better not be too serious.

256
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,800
Oh, are you saying

257
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,720
your daughter has done nothing wrong

258
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,370
and I'm being fussy?

259
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,490
In this case,

260
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,010
can I ask my maid

261
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,800
to knock your daughter out

262
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,800
and will you let go of her?

263
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,170
- What? You...
- Your Majesty.

264
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,720
Your Highness,

265
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,720
you're being too aggressive.

266
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,530
How can you be so rude to your seniors?

267
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,370
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

268
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,410
How can you be so rude?

269
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,890
I'm just being reasonable

270
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,170
instead of begging for mercy with seniority.

271
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,600
And I won't threaten His Majesty with my merit.

272
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,890
Before your daughters

273
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,600
apologize to my consort

274
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,840
and get her forgiveness,

275
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,170
I'll hold them accountable.

276
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,250
But...

277
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,080
Her Highness is in a coma.

278
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,890
How can our daughters apologize to her?

279
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,010
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

280
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,050
If my consort can't wake up,

281
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,770
I'm afraid your daughters
will have to pay with their lives.

282
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,290
Zhou Shiyu!

283
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,170
- Don't scare me.
- Your Majesty.

284
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,650
Please don't, Your Majesty.

285
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,010
Be perceptive, Your Majesty.

286
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,080
- Be perceptive.
- Please.

287
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,890
The physician I sent just came and told me.

288
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,770
The North Princess Consort woke up.

289
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,680
She's a bit unconscious, though.

290
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,960
Unconscious?

291
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,800
Brother,

292
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,890
She'll have the lingering effects, I think.

293
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,050
Please punish those ladies

294
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,170
of unlawful wounding.

295
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,920
- What? What do we do?
- What do we do?

296
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,370
Your Majesty, please don't.

297
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,560
Your Majesty.

298
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,080
We really didn't mean to...

299
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,130
Your Majesty.

300
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,170
Your Highness.

301
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,080
This is real trouble.

302
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,130
Yeah. It's...

303
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,200
You've made me afraid.

304
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,610
Well...

305
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,370
Since Her Highness is awake,

306
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,320
why don't you just let them go?

307
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,080
If you want something,

308
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,290
let me know.

309
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,720
Please don't punish my daughter.

310
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,890
Since you offer this,

311
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,770
for the sake that you're a good father,

312
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,010
how about we do this?

313
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,440
You have your daughter apologize to my consort

314
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,920
and beg for her forgiveness.

315
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,600
It's... It's acceptable.

316
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,170
That's all?

317
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,250
Since I let her go so easily,

318
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,530
Prince Gao Shan,

319
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,840
you certainly owe this to me.

320
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,290
Now, the policy of the West Market

321
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,010
has been greatly hindered.

322
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,530
You have high prestige in the court.

323
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,920
I guess you can help, huh?

324
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
- Yes.
-We can help.

325
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,840
Yes. We can help.

326
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,960
The four of us will work together

327
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,650
to make you get what you want.

328
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,400
That's right.

329
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,250
I'll count on you, then.

330
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,290
All right.

331
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,800
We're going to see the Prime Minister now.

332
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,840
- Yes.
- That's right.

333
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,200
We're going now.

334
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,490
Jingyuan will do me the favor.

335
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,770
That's right.

336
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,200
Thank you, everybody.

337
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,280
Prime Minister.

338
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,530
Have those old ministers left?

339
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,370
Yes.

340
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,890
They brought up the old stories
with great familiarity.

341
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,490
Zhou Shiyu has quite a lot of helpers.

342
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,080
Will we just satisfy them?

343
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,800
I have to respect these old ministers.

344
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,410
Otherwise, they would

345
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,960
all blame me

346
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,080
for their imprisoned daughters.

347
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,720
It's not time to offend them yet.

348
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,820
(The West Market)

349
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,290
- Look.
- There he is.

350
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,920
At His Majesty's command,

351
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,080
Dongyu people can do business
on the West Market

352
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,160
as legal merchants in Beishuo.

353
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,320
They need to pay as many taxes

354
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,410
as the native merchants do.

355
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,720
No officials have the right to detain

356
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:56,960
the vendors or the goods.

357
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,160
From this day on,

358
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,010
Dongyu people no longer need to hide.

359
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,490
- Great!
- Nice!

360
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,560
- This is great!
- Nice!

361
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,400
Wonderful!

362
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,960
Your Grace, you hurt your own body.

363
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,130
I really feel sorry.

364
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,050
To help Dongyu people,

365
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,800
this injury is nothing.

366
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,560
Yueling.

367
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,130
Don't worry, Yueling. It's me.

368
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,920
You freaked me out.

369
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,130
I thought it was someone from the palace.

370
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,440
Rest assured, Yueling.

371
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,320
They won't come again.

372
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,920
A royal decree has been issued.

373
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,560
Dongyu people can do business

374
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,530
on the West Market.

375
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,650
- Really?
- This day has finally come!

376
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,490
What I suffered is worth it.

377
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,530
The North Prince is good.

378
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,320
For you,

379
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,200
he made a big scene in the court.

380
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,410
I also didn't expect him

381
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,960
to do this much for me.

382
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,560
Oh, Yueling.

383
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,960
Vendors on the West Market
are worried about you.

384
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,130
I kept telling them that you were fine.

385
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,440
(Invitation)
They didn't believe.

386
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,680
They said

387
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,650
they couldn't stop worrying
before they saw you.

388
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,800
So,

389
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,050
I accepted their invitation for you.

390
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,720
But Your Highness,

391
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,200
Her Grace is still injured.

392
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,320
How about we turn them down?

393
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,960
I should go.

394
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,250
I'm all right now.

395
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,130
I can't waste

396
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,290
what they've prepared for me.

397
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,170
If I don't go,

398
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,800
they'll worry about me.

399
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,920
That's great, Yueling.

400
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,010
Let's go together.

401
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,890
Sure.

402
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,290
Umm, can I invite Su Nian?

403
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,080
She helped, too.

404
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,120
You can, of course.

405
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,970
Miss Su Nian must come.

406
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,730
And Mr. Perfect.

407
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,560
Oh, and the South Prince.

408
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,490
We should thank him for his lipsticks.

409
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,530
Go invite them.

410
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,690
All right. I'm on it.

411
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,640
This is so great.

412
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,640
Your Grace,

413
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,290
what about the North Prince?

414
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,770
Oh, him.

415
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,490
I'll invite him myself.

416
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,050
What is this?

417
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,010
Tea cake.

418
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Tea cake?

419
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,050
How much money will you charge this time?

420
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,450
How would I charge you?

421
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,490
I made it for you.

422
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,160
Oh, that's weird.

423
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,080
I didn't do anything.

424
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,490
Why did you make it for me?

425
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,800
No grief talking, please.

426
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,450
You made great contributions.

427
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,290
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of all Dongyu people

428
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,320
on the West Market.

429
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,490
You flatter me.

430
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,320
You made more contributions.

431
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,450
You set a trap with yourself.

432
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,840
You even trapped me, too.

433
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,210
Sorry.

434
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,840
I shouldn't have trapped you.

435
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,640
Don't be angry.

436
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,730
Tonight, vendors of the West Market
will hold a banquet to thank us.

437
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,640
Shall we go together?

438
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,690
I have a business to handle.

439
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:42,890
Maybe next time.

440
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,160
Sorry.

441
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,690
I was forced.

442
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,770
I didn't have a choice.

443
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,290
I'm not angry because you trapped me,

444
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,490
but because you risked your own life.

445
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,120
What if I hadn't arrived in time?

446
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,880
What if I hadn't solved this smoothly?

447
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,930
How would you end up?

448
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,360
When you're in trouble, I want you

449
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,120
to think of me in the first place.

450
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,490
You can tell me about anything.

451
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,690
We'll think of a way together.

452
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,050
Does it still hurt?

453
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,810
No.

454
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,360
Not at all.

455
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,000
Come on.

456
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,930
I'll go with you.

457
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,730
Here we go.

458
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,690
Run. Quickly.

459
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,010
- Slowly.
- Be careful.

460
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,160
You're going the opposite way.

461
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,450
Come over here.

462
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,080
Slowly. Slowly.

463
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,880
Take it easy.

464
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,250
They're coming soon.

465
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,250
Make the food smell good, please.

466
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,920
Su Nian.

467
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,400
Here.

468
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
The special glutinous rice wine from Dongyu.

469
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,720
Taste some.

470
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,640
Come on.

471
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,080
It does taste good.

472
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,080
Come on.

473
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,920
Come here.

474
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,930
The South Prince is here.

475
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,160
Come on. Make way.

476
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,160
He bumped into me.

477
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
Didn't you see His Highness?

478
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,210
What is wrong with you?

479
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,160
Hey, you.

480
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,690
- There he is.
- Yang Xu.

481
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,530
Didn't you see?

482
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,640
Come on. Make away, please.

483
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,730
Aren't you ashamed enough?

484
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,330
But Your Highness...

485
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,600
Let's go.

486
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,160
The North Prince and the Princess are here.

487
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,560
They are here.

488
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,400
Come over.

489
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,640
The North Prince and the Princess are here.

490
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,080
Come over here. There they are.

491
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,930
Your Highness.

492
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,010
Your Grace.

493
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,770
Thank you for how you helped us.

494
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,320
We're finally legal.

495
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,080
Do not kneel.

496
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,920
- Get up.
- You may rise.

497
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,010
Get up, everybody.

498
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,850
Get up, please.

499
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,120
Wait a minute.

500
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,960
Wait.

501
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,210
Why do you not thank me?

502
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,840
I did most to help you.

503
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,210
Why did you thank Zhou Shiyu?

504
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,400
It's unfair.

505
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

506
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,490
Your Grace, Your Highness.

507
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,120
Come in here, please.

508
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,970
Thanks, Your Highness.

509
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

510
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,320
Thank you, Your Grace.

511
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,730
Thank you, Your Highness.

512
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,250
Thank you, Your Highness.

513
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,370
Thank you.

514
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,880
Thanks to you.

515
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,450
Thank you, Your Highness.

516
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,730
Enough, enough.

517
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,210
Princess Yueling.

518
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,930
Do you remember me?

519
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,770
When you were little,

520
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,120
your father took you to our tribe.

521
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,370
At that time,

522
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,840
you were only this tall.

523
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,530
Too soon,

524
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,970
you can take on great responsibilities.

525
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,050
Old man, you get the wrong woman.

526
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,970
This is my consort, Ashina Zhu.

527
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,120
Yeah. I'm Ashina Zhu, the Eldest Princess.

528
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,290
The Eldest Princess?

529
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,800
But I remember you're Princess Yueling.

530
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,320
You remember it wrong.

531
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,690
Sorry, I have old eyes.

532
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,010
Forgive me, Your Grace.

533
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,050
- Forgive me.
- Never mind.

534
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,160
Thanks.

535
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,250
Here, Your Grace.

536
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,330
Let's drink.

537
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,450
Come on. Cheers.

538
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,640
(Yueling? Princess?)

539
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,250
(Princess Yueling?)

540
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,290
We Dongyu people can
sing and dance in the Capital City.

541
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,130
This is so great.

542
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,930
There in Dongyu,

543
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,320
did you live such a life every day?

544
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,840
Yes, of course.

545
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,010
In Dongyu,

546
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,490
we can ride a horse every day

547
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,730
and enjoy a big feast.

548
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,290
Life was great there.

549
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,080
What about now? Is life still great?

550
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,010
It's not as wonderful as that in Dongyu.

551
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,840
But I have Xingyi, Qianqian,

552
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,930
and some new friends.

553
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
And...

554
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,320
I can do something for my people.

555
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,730
Life is good, too.

556
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,610
Is that all?

557
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,770
I have you, too. It's good.

558
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,400
Xingyi,

559
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,840
drink more with me.

560
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,530
No, Su Nian.

561
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,160
You can't drink anymore.

562
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,290
You can't.

563
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,250
When I'm drunk,

564
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,160
many things will be readily solved.

565
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,770
What are you talking about?

566
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,530
Xingyi,

567
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,640
I'm sorry.

568
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,600
Really sorry.

569
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,200
Su Nian,

570
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,490
you're drunk.

571
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,690
Let me walk you home.

572
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,010
- Let me get you up.
- I'm sorry.

573
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
- Sorry.
- Slowly. Come on.

574
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,090
Be careful.

575
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,490
(Su Nian?)

576
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,730
(Can it be...?)

577
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,090
Siyuan,

578
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,880
the pilaf tastes good.

579
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,840
Come on. Taste it.

580
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,690
I don't want any.

581
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,770
Thanks, anyway.

582
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,120
Your Highness, don't eat too much.

583
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,640
In case you get a stomach ache.

584
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,840
It doesn't matter.

585
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,840
Come on, Your Highness.

586
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,690
Zhou Shiyu and the Princess of Dongyu

587
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,840
are having a romantic moment.

588
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,880
Why are you still eating here?

589
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,370
What?

590
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Dating behind my back again?

591
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,080
Let's go, Your Highness.

592
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,160
Siyuan,

593
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,600
I thought a handsome and talented man like you

594
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,640
would make Her Grace fall in love with you

595
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,250
and break up with Zhou Shiyu.

596
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,080
I had the wrong plan.

597
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,050
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

598
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,690
It doesn't matter.

599
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,400
Her Grace is just too cunning.

600
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,080
I have to do something myself.

601
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,440
Let's go.

602
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,080
How could you come here,

603
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,160
dating privately?

604
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,600
Why can't a couple like us

605
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,360
date privately?

606
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,290
But you...

607
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,010
Why do you pester my consort?

608
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,770
What couple? What consort?

609
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,050
She isn't titled yet.

610
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,120
Before that, everyone has a chance.

611
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,330
Besides,

612
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,120
Ashina Zhu,

613
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,080
you promised to marry me.

614
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,090
Your Highness,

615
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,290
what part of mine do you like?

616
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,930
I'll change, all right?

617
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,010
There are many other noble girls.

618
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,690
Look at them, will you?

619
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,360
No part of yours is good.

620
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,360
But you're Zhou Shiyu's woman.

621
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,450
So, I must fight with him for you.

622
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,450
You guys fight, then.

623
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,600
Up... Upset again, huh?

624
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,730
Xu,

625
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,490
I had to do something myself, right?

626
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,930
You're the best, Your Highness.

627
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,290
Let's go.

628
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,600
Did you figure out the weaknesses of Zhou Shiyu

629
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,690
and the Princess of Dongyu?

630
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,770
I haven't figured out

631
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,800
their weaknesses or flaws.

632
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,050
You keep staying undercover.

633
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,530
When possible,

634
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,250
steal the jade pendants.

635
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,450
When the two of them aren't together,

636
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,840
assassinate them

637
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,290
and kill them.

638
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,840
I know I failed many times.

639
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,120
I can't hold you up anymore, Master.

640
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,890
Never mind.

641
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,560
You leave us.

642
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,480
Yes.

643
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,490
I think Su Nian

644
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,840
has become disloyal.

645
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,120
She's still covering for them.

646
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,210
Stop giving her the antidote.

647
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,770
She's of no use, after all.

648
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,480
Yes, Master.

649
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,340
(The North Prince's Mansion)

650
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,370
Yueling.

651
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,010
The beef jerky made in Beishuo

652
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,210
tastes as good as that made in Dongyu.

653
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,840
What do you actually think highly of,

654
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,970
some beef jerky or someone here?

655
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,320
If you say so,

656
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,770
I should take some to Su Nian.

657
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,250
Qianqian, look.

658
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,970
Prince Xingyi

659
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,530
wants to give Miss Su Nian

660
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,770
whatever he has.

661
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:21,050
Maybe it's just like what you always say.

662
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,800
- A grown man can't be kept home.
- A grown man can't be kept home.

663
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,050
Don't tease me.

664
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,640
The North Prince is the same.

665
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,250
What's going on?

666
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,680
Your Highness.

667
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,880
What's all this?

668
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,210
His Majesty gave His Highness the rewards.

669
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,360
But His Highness said,

670
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,530
Your Highness made great contributions

671
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,160
to the business on the West Market

672
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,930
where both people could benefit.

673
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,160
So, His Highness asked me

674
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,840
to bring you all these rewards.

675
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,720
Yueling,

676
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,970
I'm right about him, huh?

677
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,160
Yes, yes.

678
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,050
His Highness is totally right.

679
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,730
Every time the North Prince

680
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,930
gets something good,

681
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,080
he has it sent to Her Grace.

682
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,880
He cares about you, Your Grace.

683
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,800
He cares about you only.

684
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,690
You're always honey-tongued.

685
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,530
Go put them away.

686
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,370
All right.

687
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,010
Come this way, please.

688
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,930
The West Market is flourishing.

689
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,210
Dongyu vendors will settle down here.

690
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,530
You don't need to worry anymore.

691
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,120
When they can live

692
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,320
a good, happy life,

693
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,530
it doesn't matter where they stay.

694
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,440
Your Grace.

695
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,050
I thought you were a fake princess.

696
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,400
But you turned out to be real.

697
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,210
I thought you were a young princess,

698
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,930
innocent and ignorant.

699
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,770
I didn't expect...

700
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,600
Expect what?

701
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,930
I didn't expect you to be

702
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,360
a righteous and caring princess.

703
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,400
Your Highness,

704
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,210
why do I think

705
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,770
you want something from me?

706
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,160
Oh, you can see that.

707
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,570
Tell me about it.

708
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,600
Tomorrow night, may I have some of your time?

709
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,840
I have something to say.

710
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:33,770
All right.

711
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,250
It looks gorgeous.

712
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,770
Look, a million lights

713
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,360
are echoing the stars in the sky.

714
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,160
Such a beautiful and peaceful scene

715
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,840
can really cheer me up.

716
00:31:58,970 --> 00:31:59,810
You're right.

717
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,770
When the sun sets, a million lights shine.

718
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,840
When it rises, a million lives begin.

719
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,160
Such a day look ordinary,

720
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,320
but it's actually stable.

721
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,440
Indeed.

722
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,800
To live together every day

723
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,560
can be a really happy life.

724
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,160
Why did you suddenly take me here?

725
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,690
In Beishuo,

726
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,290
there aren't similar warm bonfires.

727
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,450
But here, we have brilliant fireworks.

728
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,450
I want to show them to you.

729
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,880
You can pray, too.

730
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,250
Fireworks?

731
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,450
So beautiful.

732
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,450
Why do you not pray?

733
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,320
Do you think my wish

734
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,120
will come true?

735
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,090
Of course.

736
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,560
Wish hard and you'll get what you want.

737
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
All right.

738
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,210
I wish

739
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,250
Princess Ashina Yueling of Dongyu

740
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,050
can be my wife.

741
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,690
I wish I could stay with her

742
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,690

New mission.

You have to kill this man.

Xingyi?

757
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:38,730
Your Majesty,

758
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,280
since trades were approved on the West Market,

759
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,890
vendors have done business legally.

760
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,600
It's been only half a month.

761
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,200
Dongyu people alone

762
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,330
have paid much more for the stalls

763
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,240
on the West Market

764
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,010
than the previous tax revenue of a long time.

765
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,120
The North Prince's proposal is really good.

766
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,720
That's right.

767
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,530
For so much revenue in merely half a month,

768
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,160
Shiyu should take credit.

769
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,120
I should reward him accordingly.

770
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,560
Your Majesty, it's my duty

771
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,160
to share your burden and do what's best

772
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,720

773

I do not dare to take credit.

774
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,970
Shiyu, I'm quite delighted

775
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,200
when you never claim credit.

776
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,160
But you should get what you deserve.

777
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,330

778
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,050
I have something

779
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,280
to tell you right here.

780
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,280
What is it?

781
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,160
From a very reliable source,

782
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,720
the Princess of Dongyu

783
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,970
is an impostor.

784
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,010
This is ridiculous.

785
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,850
Yeah.

786
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,930
What? Is that true?

787
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,450
Did that small state

788
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,240
deceive us

789
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,080
with a casual woman?

790
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,080
Yeah.

791
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,640
How daring! So impertinent.

792
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,050
Yeah.

793
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,530
They don't respect us at all.

Your Grace,

797
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,240
why do you only read the wedding parts?

798
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,490
Oh, I know.

799
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,810

800

to marry the North Prince.

801
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,050
Who said that?

802
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,120
Nonsense.

803
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,010
I just think Your Grace

804
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,120
has been very close to the North Prince.

805
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,200
I thought

806
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
I could call him "Prince Consort" soon.

807
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,530
For this,

808
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,330
I've prepared a lot of wedding dresses

809

810

Well, it's all right for me

812
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,450
to check them in advance.

813
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,240
You said you weren't impatient.

814
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,010
You're just denying it, I think.

815
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,850

816
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,680
I'll get married one day.

817
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,410
Checking the customs in advance

818
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,120
isn't a problem, huh?

819
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,560
It isn't.

- You can't get in.
- Don't break in.

831
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,850
You're being ridiculous.

832
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,810
What's up, Your Grace?

833

- Don't get in.
- You can't get in.
