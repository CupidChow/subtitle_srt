00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,460
[Episode 12]

3
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,740
You and Ye Shuwei no longer needs

4
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,130
to shoot for the couple scenes.

5
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,270
Your work is cut short. Sorry.

6
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,650
So, tomorrow, you don't need
to come for the show.

7
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,620
We didn't expect this, either.

8
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,820
Please kindly understand.

9
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,050
What do we need to do

10
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,690
or how can we cooperate with your work?

11
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,660
Here's the thing.

12
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,990
We will speak and act with one voice

13
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,210
of Strawberry.com

14
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,110
when explaining to the audience.

15
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,640
We'll keep you informed.

16
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,120
If we need you to explain,

17
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,470
just explain what you're informed of.

18
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,850
Nothing else is needed.

19
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,080
Your work is done from today.

20
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,990
You can then lead a normal life.

21
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,940
By the way, due to the changes on our side,

22
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,500
the pay for the show

23
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,130
will be transferred to your accounts

24
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,760
as agreed.

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,120
The amount isn't affected. Don't worry.

26
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,090
Any other questions?

27
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,760
No.

28
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,590
It's okay.

29
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,660
Contact us if you think
of any other questions.

30
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:29,710
Okay?

31
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,260
Fine. Bye.

32
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,460
Is it true?

33
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,870
Would you like to call Mr. Yu

34
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,260
and confirm it?

35
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,290
Hello.

36
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,810
Hello, Uncle.

37
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,220
There's something wrong with the show.

38
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,270
You and Erduo don't need to come tomorrow.

39
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,390
Sorry for that.

40
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,220
Mm, I get it.

41
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,130
I'll tell her about it.

42
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,320
Okay.

43
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,140
It's confirmed.

44
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,750
According to Yu Sheng,

45
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,500
our show was over.

46
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,670
Do we still have to know more
about each other?

47
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,430
No.

48
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,680
I'll take my leave, then.

49
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,330
Let me walk you out.

50
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,170
By the way,

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,550
then we don't need this.

52
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,170
Take it back.

53
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,900
[Personal Data of Ye Shuwei]

54
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,490
Don't bother to walk me out.

55
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,850
Li.

56
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,650
There you are.

57
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,730
Today, I have brought

58
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,820
my home-made pickles

59
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,920
for you.

60
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,090
Here's some fruit, too.

61
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,590
It's your favorite.

62
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:03,940
Humph.

63
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,370
Erduo,

64
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,650
I knew what happened.

65
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,380
It's okay.

66
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,120
I had to be on the show

67
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,140
just to help you out.

68
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,440
What...

69
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,280
What on earth happened?

70
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,140
It's quite unexpected.

71
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,790
Did I make trouble for the show?

72
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,410
No, no, no. It's not your fault.

73
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,740
You did a very good job, seriously.

74
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,100
Maybe

75
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,150
someone was jealous of our show

76
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,550
and played a trick.

77
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,550
No way?

78
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,150
Did you offend someone?

79
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,480
What about work?

80
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,980
Did you have the car accident because of it?

81
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,460
It was indeed an accident.

82
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,850
It had nothing to do with the show.

83
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,810
Erduo, I'm sorry.

84
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,910
You were on the show

85
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,250
just to help me out.

86
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,680
I didn't expect to get you into trouble

87
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,900
and make people gossip about you.

88
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,160
You worked so carefully,

89
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,310
but they asked you to quit in advance.

90
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:18,910
I'm so...

91
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,790
Li, don't apologize.

92
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,120
I also wanted to make money from the show,

93
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,800
instead of simply helping you out.

94
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,630
You helped me a lot, too, didn't you?

95
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,900
Erduo, you're so nice to me.

96
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,810
When I first got to know

97
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,440
that Ye Shuwei and I had to quit,

98
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,570
I was a little bit disappointed.

99
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,700
But later I felt relaxed,

100
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,430
because I no longer had to pretend

101
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,830
to be in love with him.

102
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,340
That's right.

103
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,420
You no longer need to live with him.

104
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,800
- Mm.
- You're free.

105
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,140
- Mm.
- Congratulations.

106
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,320
Today,

107
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,550
when the show called me,

108
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,870
I was still in Ye Shuwei's studio.

109
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,950
Why were you there?

110
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,260
I was learning...

111
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,230
I was learning how to make a violin.

112
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,620
You're indeed a good girlfriend.

113
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,560
Hold... Hold back your laughter.

114
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,400
Fine. Fine.

115
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,120
Done.

116
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,140
Youyou, your dubbing for the mother

117
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,820
was fantastic.

118
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,730
Exactly like a real mother, you know?

119
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,090
Come on.

120
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,310
I've been living with my mother all day long.

121
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,070
I can certainly talk like a real mother.

122
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:52,990
Erduo, Youyou,

123
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,060
come over.

124
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,760
Yes. Let's go.

125
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,130
Mr. Xu.

126
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,260
Mr. Xu.

127
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,050
In a couple of days, there'll be a dubbing

128
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,000
for minor roles in this drama.

129
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,680
I've reserved

130
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,080
two important roles for you.

131
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,990
Don't let me down.

132
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,520
Not too many lines, but they're all important.

133
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,850
I like the group dubbing.

134
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,730
I can hide behind gurus.

135
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,080
It's okay to make a mistake
or keep a low voice.

136
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,870
I'm even given free rein.

137
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,000
You're indeed a drama queen.

138
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,230
Some days ago,

139
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,010
I saw our seniors had the group dubbing

140
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,210
without stop.

141
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,560
I'm a little bit nervous now.

142
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,030
You're much better than me.

143
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,720
You're at least experienced.

144
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,460
Just because you're nervous,

145
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,180
go back home and practice more.

146
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,290
You and I mustn't display our ignorance.

147
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,120
I'll take my leave. Bye-bye.

148
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,300
Come on.

149
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:52,870
Come on.

150
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,230
Duofen,

151
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,550
I have to leave.

152
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,590
Be a good cat.

153
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,030
Good cat.

154
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,950
Go.

155
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,690
Where are you going?

156
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:37,810
Erduo,

157
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,640
you could have asked me for help.

158
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,940
I had meant to say goodbye to you

159
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,020
when I was leaving.

160
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,300
Please take care of Bei Duofen.

161
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,090
I've written the tips about cats

162
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,470
on a sticky note

163
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,720
and pasted it on the cat food.

164
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,250
If you have any confusion,

165
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,260
call me.

166
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,010
It's okay to have Bei Duofen live here.

167
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,670
But I'm too busy to take care of it.

168
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,470
So, you still need to

169
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,420
look after it.

170
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,210
Or you must take it away now.

171
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,510
I'll often come back to take care of it,

172
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,680
if you don't mind.

173
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,640
What's this?

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,940
Get in to see the boss.

345
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,710
Okay. Thank you.

346
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,200
Hello, boss.

347
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,540
I saw your recruitment.

348
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,160
I want to ask about the details.

349
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,270
What should a part-time worker do?

350
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,670
Come and help

351
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,800
at mealtimes.

352
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,730
Just like you,

353
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,300
the house is lack of human touch.

354
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,940
Isn't it great?

355
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,650
Don't worry.

356
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,220
When I move out,

357
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,990
I'll restore it to its former look.

358
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,350
Not even the succulent plants?

359
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,780
I'll keep them in my room.

360
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,520
They don't take up much space.

361
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,330
So rich of you.

362
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,060
Don't flaunt wealth like this.

363
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,090
Let's call it a day.

364
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,000
By the way, Ms. Bei,

365
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,820
why didn't I see you

366
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,080
in the last episode of that show?

367
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,830
Something unexpected happened

368
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,020
and I quit in advance.

369
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,430
I had planned to cheer for you.

370
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,610
It's okay.

371
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,360
I've never thought about
my love life, anyway.

372
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,200
Think about it, then.

373
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,130
In the best years of your life,

374
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,730
what a waste if you don't enjoy the romance!

375
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,770
It'll be a real waste

376
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,700
if I don't pursue my dream
in the best years of my life.

377
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,600
Why...

378
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,050
Why are your ears so red?

379
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,640
Is anyone cursing you?

380
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,140
Watch your language.

381
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,910
We don't know why,

382
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,640
but his show was canceled.

383
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,890
Don't make an improper remark.

384
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,140
Hello.

385
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,740
Hello, Uncle.

386
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Tang Li is leaving hospital today.

387
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,850
I plan to invite her and Erduo

388
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,040
to dinner for celebration.

389
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,940
Would you like to join us?

390
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,010
Are you available?

391
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,410
Let me check my schedule.

392
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,020
I'm available. When?

393
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,900
Today. Where would you like to go?

394
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,610
A restaurant we once visited

395
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,470
or a new restaurant?

396
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,080
Food in restaurants isn't healthy.

397
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,220
It's greasy, too.

398
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,210
When Tang Li is just out of the hospital,

399
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,570
she should have a light diet.

400
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,090
It's thoughtful of you.

401
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,560
Where shall we have dinner, then?

402
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,170
At home.

403
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,780
Home? Who will cook?

404
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,400
I can't even

405
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,760
boil the water very well.

406
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,000
Tang Li is out of the hospital,
but she can't cook.

407
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,070
Erduo...

408
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,190
I'm not sure if she can cook.

409
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,410
You have me.

410
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,570
You?

411
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,930
But Uncle, I've never seen you
cook Chinese dishes.

412
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,440
Will you make us order takeout food?

413
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,310
Rest assured.

414
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,770
I'll cook.

415
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,660
All you need to do is invite them.

416
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,530
Okay.

417
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,000
Let's have dinner at my home.

418
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,180
I count on you.

419
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,560
I can finally leave hospital.

420
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,890
I'm so bored.

421
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,900
Congratulations on your leaving hospital.

422
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,660
Let me check how you have recovered.

423
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,500
I've fully recovered.

424
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,430
Look, look.

425
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,810
When I lay in bed, I got fatter.

426
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,150
I could have left hospital a long time ago.

427
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,990
You still need more rest.

428
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:06,870
Got it.

429
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,140
The discharge procedures are done.

430
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Come on.

431
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,080
Why are you not careful
even when you're in hospital?

432
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,740
Who do you think you are, Wonder Woman?

433
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,700
What do I do, then?

434
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,900
Boss Yu, will you give me more days off

435
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,710
so that I can travel around the world?

436
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,600
No. No.

437
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,240
Miss Tang.

438
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,880
Director Tang.

439
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,880
Why are you still angry?

440
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,900
What can I be angry at?

441
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,070
You're the boss, anyway.

442
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,080
I'll go get the car.

443
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,130
Check if anything is left behind.

444
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,180
Let's meet at the gate
of the In-patient Department.

445
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,150
Wait, Mr. Yu.

446
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:05,920
Thank you.

447
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,500
You're welcome.

448
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,350
I'll get packed.

449
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:26,060
[In-patient Department]

450
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,300
[No. 1 People's Hospital]

451
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,770
Come on. Get in the car.

452
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,230
Shall we go have dinner

453
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,030
in celebration of Li's leaving hospital?

454
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:19,800
Good idea.

455
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,920
It's good news.

456
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,130
We must celebrate it.

457
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,130
Yeah.

458
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,090
I've got everything arranged.

459
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,800
When she's just out of the hospital,

460
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,940
she must have a light diet.

461
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,820
Let's have dinner at my home.

462
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,270
Mr. Yu, you can cook?

463
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,010
No. I can't cook.

464
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,840
But I've got a strong helper.

465
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,460
Helper?

466
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,210
Yeah. My uncle, I mean.

467
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,320
He cooks perfectly.

468
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,650
You asked your uncle to cook for us?

469
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,870
Is it appropriate?

470
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,790
Actually, my uncle is

471
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,600
Ye Shuwei.

472
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,560
It's no big deal.

473
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,420
I'm two years older than him.

474
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,430
When I grew up, I kept following him

475
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,040
and calling him Uncle.

476
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,160
It's quite shameful.

477
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,000
So, in front of strangers,

478
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,150
I usually call him Guru Ye.

479
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,990
But you're not strangers.

480
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,020
It's okay to let you know.

481
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
I knew it.

482
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,760
I wondered why Ye Shuwei

483
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,190
participated in such a show for you.

484
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,660
Ma'am, how much is this?

485
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,810
Young man,

486
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,860
it's been a long time
since you came last time.

487
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,490
Oh, it's you?

488
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,310
Hasn't your girlfriend come with you?

489
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,910
She...

490
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,530
She's too busy.

491
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,410
Oh, I see.

492
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,360
So, you do the grocery shopping and cook?

493
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,910
A man isn't charming unless he can cook.

494
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,590
Roses or chocolate

495
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,680
can't be as good

496
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,340
as a delicious meal for your girl.

497
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,410
That's right.

498
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,440
Here. The mushrooms are good.

499
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,140
Very fresh. Come on.

500
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,710
Almost enough.

501
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,850
Pack them, please.

502
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,610
Okay. Okay.

503
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,150
Thank you.

504
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,860
Okay. 14.5 yuan.

505
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,030
Here.

506
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:49,710
Thank you.

507
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,770
Li is tired after all this. Let her sleep.

508
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,900
You go take a rest, too.

509
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,270
Ye Shuwei has arrived.

510
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,670
When he's around,

511
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,520
all we need to do is sit and wait.

512
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,630
Sit and wait?

513
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,150
Is it appropriate?

514
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,470
I'd like to go and see

515
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,450
if I can help him with anything.

516
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,410
How can I help you?

517
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,550
Wash the vegetables.

518
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,090
This?

519
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,740
Why will you throw them away?

520
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,290
They'll taste great after they're pickled.

521
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,480
Li just left hospital.

522
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,720
Pickles with porridge will be great for her.

523
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,000
What?

524
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,990
Where did you get this?

525
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,100
It's a secret.

526
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,760
Come over. Let me do it.

527
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,180
Could you lower your head?
I can't reach your hair.

528
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,490
Done.

529
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,460
Cool.

530
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,160
Thank you.

531
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,670
You're welcome.

532
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,470
Awesome.

533
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,340
I didn't expect you to make western meals

534
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,810
as well as Chinese meals.

535
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,810
Am I awesome?

536
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,260
Yes.

537
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,920
Most of the men can only boil

538
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,020
frozen dumplings or instant noodles.

539
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,120
For example,

540
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,400
Mr. Yu.

541
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,460
Everyone can cook unless he's disabled.

542
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,120
When he doesn't cook, he's just lazy.

543
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,640
Don't bet on it, you know.

544
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,820
Some people love cooking,

545
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,270
but they can't cook very well.

546
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,080
My mother, for example.

547
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,230
Come on. Taste it.

548
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,970
You don't like Chinese dishes, do you?

549
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,770
It doesn't mean I can't make them.

550
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,330
Wipe it.

551
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,060
The stain is on your sweatshirt.

552
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:04,840
Are you all right?

553
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,530
I'm all right.

554
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,740
It's okay.

555
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,410
Why is your face

556
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,410
burning like mad?

557
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,320
I guess I'm hot

558
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,940
because of the poor ventilation.

559
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,230
I feel so hot.

560
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:26,980
You may leave the kitchen.

561
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,370
I can handle it alone.

562
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,400
You don't need my help?

563
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:32,480
No.

564
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,360
When you're here, you only distract me.

565
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,830
I'll get the dish to the table.

566
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,100
Mr. Yu, be seated.

567
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,750
I called Li. She'll be out soon.

568
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,530
Come on, Li.

569
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,960
What a big dinner!

570
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,370
But why are they all your favorite dishes?

571
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,560
Thank you for your hard work.

572
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,840
Ye Shuwei made the dishes.

573
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,690
I just helped a little bit.

574
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,360
Too late. I took a photo of that.

575
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,110
Sorry, I...

576
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,770
Enjoy the dinner. Ignore them.

577
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,950
Look at this photo.

578
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,060
Such a good photo should be sent to Grand...

579
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,560
To your mother.

580
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,000
Erduo,

581
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,810
I'll send the photo to you.

582
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:44,960
Remember to save it.

583
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,510
Look, he...

584
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,130
How are you lately?

585
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,360
Not bad.

586
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,320
You seem to be thinner.

587
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,600
Really?

588
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,520
Maybe because I do the dubbing work
and have a part-time job together.

589
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,230
Busy?

590
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,830
I'm quite busy.

591
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,640
But doing something I'm interested

592
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,930
really makes me happy.

593
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,340
Don't you feel anything fishy between them?

594
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,540
Would you like to have some days off
before going back to work?

595
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,600
No. I've lived in hospital long enough.

596
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,260
Well,

597
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,660
as for the show...

598
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,260
It's okay. I understand.

599
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,450
I just feel resentful.

600
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,960
Anyway, I'm only an employee.

601
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,160
Being resentful doesn't help with anything.

602
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,540
Don't worry.

603
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,580
When we develop our brand,

604
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,360
things will get better.

605
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,880
We'll no longer need to be restrained.

606
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,100
By then, I'll give you a particular project.

607
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,950
You like originality, right?

608
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,400
I won't boast too much,

609
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,970
but I'll at least give you

610
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,540
any resources and talents you ask for.

611
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,420
Okay. I'll be waiting.

612
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,560
Mr. Yu is quite sweet to his subordinate.

613
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,880
It's just petty favor.

614
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,210
What does it mean?

615
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,810
He's good at winning support.

616
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,300
When he wants something,

617
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,170
he'll give something first.

618
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,930
I don't think Mr. Yu is that kind of man.

619
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,690
He's good at that.

620
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,920
He has socializing skills

621
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:53,920
as well as great leadership.

622
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,480
But he can't be a good boyfriend.

623
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,540
Why?

624
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,000
Look at him.

625
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,160
He's handsome

626
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,580
with a strong capacity for work.

627
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,270
He's careful and modest.

628
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,900
He's very considerate, too.

629
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,090
A man like him

630
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,090
can be popular with most girls.

631
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,120
He's so busy working

632
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,120
that he sleeps as soon as he returns home

633
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,590
and never does any housework.

634
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,020
Even his laundry is done by the hourly maid.

635
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,820
His girlfriend has to

636
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,980
do heavy housework.

637
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,830
Is that so?

638
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,460
Considering his job,

639
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,980
he'll meet a lot of girls.

640
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,830
Over time,

641
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,130
his girlfriend will feel insecure.

642
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,210
That's right.

643
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,260
No wonder Li has been anxious lately.

644
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,540
Anything else?

645
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,770
Most importantly,

646
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:00,990
he can't cook.

647
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,650
He even makes instant noodles poorly.

648
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,100
What's wrong?

649
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,280
Why do I suddenly feel a rush of cold air?
