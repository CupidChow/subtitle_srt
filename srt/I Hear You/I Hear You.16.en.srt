[I Hear You]

2
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,460
[Episode 16]

3
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,770
Miss Bei, here you are.

4
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
Boss has been waiting for you
for a long time.

5
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,140
How did he know I was coming?

6
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,580
Come on in.

7
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,220
This is indeed a good timber.

8
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,070
But I don't want it.

9
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:39,890
Excuse me.

10
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,890
Not at all.

11
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:41,830
Just take it away.

12
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,600
Why?

13
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,180
Shuwei.

14
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,940
What's up?

15
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,770
I was scared, Shuwei.

16
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,850
Here you are.

17
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,820
You left the document in the room.

18
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,040
I was just going to find Li,

19
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,360
so I brought it to you by the way.

20
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,790
We met again.

21
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
Why are you everywhere?

22
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,220
Shouldn't that be what I say?

23
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,720
Don't get me wrong.

24
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,900
I just wanted to push her away.

25
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,900
Shuwei.

26
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,000
Didn't you just say that this spruce
is good?

27
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,670
But I also said I didn't want it.

28
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,570
Let's talk in the studio.

29
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,800
Shuwei, the spruce…

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,680
He Yang, send her away.

31
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,090
Listen to me.

32
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,090
I know.

33
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,740
I have known you for so long.

34
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,740
I know who you are.

35
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,300
Besides,

36
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,940
you have professional integrity.

37
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,750
I will definitely not misunderstand you.

38
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,970
So you think I'm doing this
out of professional integrity?

39
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,330
Yes.

40
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,280
And you also know

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,750
what kind of person Zhang Yilu is.

42
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,750
I won't get you wrong.

43
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,580
Don't worry.

44
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:14,790
Bei Erduo.

45
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,530
I'm not worried that you will get me wrong

46
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,190
but that you will woolgather.

47
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,220
I understand.

48
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,960
I won't.

49
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,880
You're so self-disciplined,

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,920
and I'm not worried at all.

51
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,690
All right.

52
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,290
I'm going to look for Li.

53
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,240
See you at home.

54
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,940
I will pick you up.

55
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,940
No need.

56
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,400
I'll go back by myself.

57
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,020
I am leaving.

58
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,340
Li, stop drinking on an empty stomach.

59
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,580
It's okay.

60
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,970
I can only make it clear after drinking.

61
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,190
Okay, you drank a lot.

62
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,300
Just tell me.

63
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,100
Erduo, if I

64
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,490
quit the show,

65
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,930
will you blame me?

66
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,010
Quit the show?

67
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,180
Why?

68
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,610
The successful investment promotion
of the second season

69
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,340
mainly depends on Xing Zhen.

70
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,410
Xing Zhen and I have

71
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,670
wide disagreement about

72
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,560
the way of doing things,

73
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,870
the concept of the show,
and the principles and bottom line.

74
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,700
As the boss,

75
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,050
Yu Sheng often has no choice.

76
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,570
If I quit,

77
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,120
it will save everyone from trouble.

78
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,280
If you quit,

79
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,680
I will be left alone.

80
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,350
I will also quit then.

81
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,820
You have to stay on the show.

82
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,450
And I think

83
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,940
Ye Shuwei is treating you
better and better.

84
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,610
I think you will possibly be together.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,580
You have to work hard to save money

86
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,240
and realize your dream in Japan as soon as possible.

87
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,240
Stop talking about me.

88
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,720
And you?

89
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,100
Aren't you going to discuss it
with Mr. Yu again?

90
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,450
Haven't you been doing well before?

91
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,250
You know what?

92
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,300
I had fantasies about him

93
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,180
until today.

94
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,370
I think at least

95
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,480
we're in step at work.

96
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,960
But after what happened today,

97
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,310
I feel like I don't know him anymore.

98
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,510
[Tokyo]

99
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,300
Erduo, why is he so capricious?

100
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,750
How could he abandon

101
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,300
the previous ideals and beliefs?

102
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,210
You know what?

103
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,280
We were full of enthusiasm and confidence

104
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,710
when we first started our business.

105
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,990
We said to make the most popular

106
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,420
original shows of our own.

107
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,760
But why did he choose something

108
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,930
that could make money

109
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,970
but had no limit so soon?

110
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,540
Erduo, tell me.

111
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,700
Why is he so capricious?

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
I am so sad.

113
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,180
Hello.

114
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,900
Hello, sir.

115
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,240
Charge the Tokyo box's bill to my account.

116
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,800
Okay, hold on.

117
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,620
And call them a chauffeur.

118
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,470
Okay.

119
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,230
Li.

120
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,770
After what you said, I'm really hesitant

121
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,660
about whether to participate or not.

122
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,630
Don't hesitate.

123
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,700
You have to go

124
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,360
and win the bonus.

125
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,900
This is the only thing

126
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,610
I can do for you right now.

127
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,920
And a great event in your life
would also be settled.

128
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,200
Why are you talking about me again?

129
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,620
I came today just to

130
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,970
hear you complain.

131
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,130
Erduo, remember.

132
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,870
If you like someone,

133
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,510
you should seriously

134
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,830
confirm your own and his heart.

135
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,960
Don't be ambiguous.

136
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,850
Don't hesitate.

137
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,980
Just take a step forward.

138
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,060
If he likes you,

139
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,100
he will definitely take the remaining
ninety-nine steps.

140
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,510
So you're not going to take a step?

141
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600
Even if I take ninety-nine steps now,

142
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,280
it may be pointless.

143
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,710
We are already on different paths.

144
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,470
If you encounter difficulties
on the show in the future,

145
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,650
let me know right away.

146
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,040
I will fight for you.

147
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,500
What are you going to do?

148
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,400
To spit out all my agony.

149
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,150
Then it's time to start over.

150
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,580
Good morning.

151
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,130
Good morning.

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,920
I'm going to the recording room.

153
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,070
I'm going to the studio.

154
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,860
See you in the afternoon.

155
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,380
You?

156
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,050
I'm going to resign.

157
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,200
You are not a child anymore.

158
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,170
Don't act on impulse.

159
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,450
You have known me for so long.

160
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,780
When did I act on impulse?

161
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,940
Now you are.

162
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,420
If you don't want to

163
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,720
work with Xing Zhen,

164
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,160
I can arrange other projects for you.

165
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,260
No need.

166
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,320
I've already made up my mind.

167
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,890
I am here just to inform you.

168
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,670
I am leaving.

169
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,740
You'd better not drink alcohol

170
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,680
when socializing in the future.

171
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,180
Otherwise no one will care
about your headache the next day.

172
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,810
You are always like this.

173
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,040
We are tired of it.

174
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,860
Right, so double-faced.

175
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,280
Are you still my best friends?

176
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,520
No.

177
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,460
You…

178
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,530
Erduo, go back to rest today.

179
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,380
Youyou, take her out.

180
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,790
Okay.

181
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,320
Moyu, you have one more monologue.

182
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,050
Finish it.

183
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,930
Take some hot water.

184
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,650
Thank you.

185
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,160
You should ask for leave.

186
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,230
Why holding on?

187
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,840
How could I ask for leave again?

188
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,090
I wasted so much of your time last time.

189
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,400
How are you, Erduo?

190
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,180
Are you feeling better?

191
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,220
Moyu, I am much better.

192
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,020
I just feel sore and weak.

193
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,750
Sorry.

194
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,470
It's okay.

195
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,850
I am the same as you.

196
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,300
A woman

197
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,610
has to suffer a lot in her life.

198
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,190
Who is going to suffer?

199
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,740
You brought so much food.

200
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,600
Why are you here?

201
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,350
I'm just passing by,
by the way to console you.

202
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,290
Maybe just to console one person.

203
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,920
Le Tian, thank you.

204
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,070
I am just passing by.

205
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,100
Eat together. I bought a lot.

206
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,260
Le Tian, thank you.

207
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,590
I haven't had cake for a long time.

208
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,590
This cake tastes good.

209
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,280
Is there any ulterior purpose

210
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,810
for all of this?

211
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,460
Of course not.

212
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,200
Someone rejected me some time ago.

213
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,420
Le Tian, eat more cakes.

214
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,590
My bad.

215
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,920
You don't look well.

216
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,450
Let me take you back.

217
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,020
It's okay.

218
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,250
I can go back alone.

219
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,820
Erduo, let Le Tian take you back.

220
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,610
It's not convenient for you
to go back alone.

221
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,320
What's wrong with you?

222
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,600
Shall I take you to the hospital?

223
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,880
It's no use going to the hospital
in her condition.

224
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,880
You'd better take her home

225
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,490
and prepare brown sugar water for her.

226
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,540
Let me take you home.

227
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,140
I'm going back.

228
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,770
Sure.

229
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,120
Take care.

230
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,640
Okay.

231
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,860
I can walk by myself.
You don't have to hold me.

232
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,810
Why not?

233
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,040
You almost missed your step.

234
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,520
It's dark inside so I didn't see clearly.

235
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,980
You don't have to hold me.

236
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,310
No, I'm doing this for your safety.

237
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,100
Le Tian, if you keep doing this,

238
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,090
we can't be friends anymore.

239
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,880
Miss Bei,

240
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,670
don't think too much.

241
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,040
This is how I treat my friends.

242
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,540
Treat me as your friend now.

243
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,200
Let me send my friend,

244
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,600
Miss Bei Erduo, home.

245
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,750
Let her go.

246
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,420
Why are you here?

247
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,020
I'm just passing by.

248
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,420
What happened to you?

249
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,110
Don't you feel well?

250
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,580
I just need some rest.

251
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,900
Thank you.

252
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,370
Leave her to me.

253
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,720
I will take her home.

254
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,720
You are welcome. I am glad to do so.

255
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,410
But it seems that

256
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,490
you are not that busy with work.

257
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,170
No matter how busy I am,
I have time to pick her up.

258
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,050
Let's go.

259
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,820
Le Tian, we are going back first.

260
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,790
Thank you.

261
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:32,710
Let's go.

262
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,470
Are you finished?

263
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,660
Are you feeling better?

264
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,090
I am fine.

265
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,090
Don't force yourself if you don't feel well.

266
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,060
Who did your makeup?

267
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,600
Any problem?

268
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,240
No, it's just way too heavy.

269
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,320
Remove her makeup.

270
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,140
When shooting,

271
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,800
the light will make the makeup effect
less obvious.

272
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,310
I couldn't possibly give her everyday makeup.

273
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,410
Does stage makeup have to be heavy?

274
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,070
It's too much.

275
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,870
It depends on each person's own conditions.

276
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,840
I know her better.

277
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,670
Lighten her base makeup.

278
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,670
Remove blush and lipstick.

279
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:32,810
Thank you.

280
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,610
Please make some adjustment for her.

281
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,060
Let's go.

282
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,280
Okay.

283
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,450
We are now shooting a clip

284
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,360
of your daily life.

285
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,020
You two can brush your teeth

286
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,050
and sit there eating breakfast.

287
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,470
Let's try it.

288
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,260
Ready.

289
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,890
Action.

290
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,360
The boys can squeeze toothpaste

291
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,400
for the girl.

292
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,050
It will make you closer.

293
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,740
Eat the breakfast.

294
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,560
Right.

295
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,030
Feed each other.

296
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,430
Serve some milk.

297
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:46,900
Want more?

298
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,870
Okay, cut.

299
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,590
Let's get ready for live shot.

300
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,410
All departments, get ready.

301
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,170
Get ready for live shot.

302
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,430
Mr. Yu, you also came?

303
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,650
I ask you to make the promotional video.

304
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,870
So I have to be here.

305
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,410
Otherwise, I'm not sure

306
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,220
if anything would go wrong
with that guy.

307
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,270
It makes sense.

308
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,150
If anything happens,

309
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,370
only you can convince him.

310
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,240
Mr. Yu, do you think Li

311
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,100
has any problem at work recently?

312
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,470
This season, she…

313
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,830
I heard you've known each other
since you were kids, right?

314
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,220
We are close.

315
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,670
And both of our parents know each other

316
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,720
and are very familiar with each other.

317
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,540
In fact, Li

318
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,130
looks careless on the surface,

319
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,800
but she is thoughtful when doing things,

320
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,700
and sometimes she would be over-anxious.

321
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,700
But she never haggles over every ounce.

322
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,220
It's very comfortable

323
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,080
to get along with her.

324
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,160
On the contrary, I think that
she is way too cautious,

325
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,280
resulting in conservative thinking,

326
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,250
and dare not go for many things.

327
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,880
She is cautious

328
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,390
because she is serious about work.

329
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,800
Well,

330
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,070
it makes sense.

331
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,250
What about things other than work?

332
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,120
Mr. Yu, what do you want to know
about her

333
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,110
besides work?

334
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,610
You can ask her directly.

335
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,010
She should be willing to tell you.

336
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,560
Just go to the makeup artist.

337
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,690
Your false eyelashes are falling out.

338
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,170
This video

339
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,090
will capture your daily behavior.

340
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,170
And you don't have to synchronize.

341
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,400
So just interact with each other

342
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,730
and relax.

343
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,610
Follow my lead.

344
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,740
Just look at each other

345
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,330
or hold hands,

00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,310
as Erduo's boyfriend?

520
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,760
Just make it simple.

521
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,810
I am reminding you as your elder.

522
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,620
What happened to him?

523
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,640
It's better than I thought.

524
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,570
Film editors can

525
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,820
make use of discarded things.

526
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:34,750
Really?

527
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,610
Didn't you find

528
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,030
a lot of details unnatural?

529
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,170
Like what?

530
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,170
For example, the way you look at me

531
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,970
and the way you talk to me
are very unfamiliar.

532
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,610
You should be more involved.

533
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,300
Really?

534
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,230
I don't think so.

535
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,140
Yu Sheng said that

536
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,770
there would be another promotional video

537
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,790
in the next recording to boost popularity.

538
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,100
In order to make the next video more natural,

539
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,480
we should practice in advance.

540
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,930
Sure. No problem.

541
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,870
How?

542
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,770
The first thing is our titles of each other.

543
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,830
You can't call me by my full name again.

544
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,960
How could I call you then?

545
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,930
As you like.

546
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,930
Just don't call me by my full name.

547
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,000
Then I will call you Shuwei?

548
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,360
When you call me,

549
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,820
add more feelings.

550
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,050
Now I feel that we are not familiar,

551
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,720
and you are calling a stranger.

552
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,990
Shuwei.

553
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,370
Better.

554
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,170
But it could be warmer.

555
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,980
Now there is no temperature in your voice.

556
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,330
Shuwei.

557
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,440
I got it.

558
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,240
The problem is in the last word.

559
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,030
Don't call me so decisive.

560
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,440
Decisive?

561
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,500
I mean to make it more colloquial.

562
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,070
It doesn't need fullness of articulation.

563
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,840
You are not an announcer.

564
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,440
Shuwei.

565
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,250
Erduo.

566
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,830
You call me Erduo?

567
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,210
Isn't it your name?

568
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,210
But it sounds different.

569
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:15,760
What?

570
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,990
Nothing.

571
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,560
What to practice next?

572
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,210
We have to exchange a secret.

573
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,880
Exchange a secret?

574
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,720
Just a secret.

575
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,230
When someone asks us,

576
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,380
we should understand each other in advance.

577
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,080
But I don't seem

578
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,960
to have a secret.

579
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,880
It's not so difficult.

580
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,320
Anything will do.

581
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,060
For example, who have you liked before?

582
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,460
If so,

583
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,810
could it be someone I liked
in primary school?

584
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,270
Who else?

585
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,530
In high school? In university?

586
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,450
How come?

587
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:17,920
Yes.

588
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,270
There is one.

589
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,080
Who?

590
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,550
Allen.

591
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,970
It should be power outage.

592
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,970
It's okay, Ye Shuwei. Don't be afraid.

593
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,230
I am going to find a candle now.

594
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,260
Just wait here.

595
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,230
I got it!

596
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,440
Are you feeling better?

597
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,160
I am fine.

598
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,870
Let's continue.

599
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,820
You won't be afraid after a talk.

600
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,320
Okay.

601
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,840
Who's that Allen

602
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,250
you just mentioned?

603
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,680
Is he your friend?

604
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,480
He is a composer.

605
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,920
He worked for

606
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,980
many big-budget cartoons.

607
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,430
Do you want to listen to his song?

608
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,260
No.

609
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,240
You must be exaggerating

610
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,920
about his excellence.

611
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,610
Allen

612
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,020
is the best composer in the world.

613
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,300
Countless people

614
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,870
asked him to compose.

615
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,500
Maybe he's an otaku.

616
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,170
Even so,

617
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,940
he's the coolest otaku.

618
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,030
You think he's cool?

619
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,840
Have you ever met him?

620
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,670
No.

621
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,640
Allen is low-key.

622
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,720
I am looking for his information

623
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,210
almost like FBI.

624
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,880
Is he that perfect?

625
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,280
Maybe you wouldn't say so when you see him.

626
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,540
No way,

627
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,500
he's always

628
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,500
perfect for me.

629
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,170
All right, the light is on.

630
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,100
I'm going to sleep.

631
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,100
How dare you doubt Allen?

632
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,800
Good night.

633
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,350
Ms. Tang, why are you here?

634
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:44,830
You…

635
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,100
Don't get me wrong.

636
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,430
I just went to socialize with Mr. Yu.

637
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,810
He's drunk, so I took him home.

638
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,090
I have something to tell him.

639
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,240
Please come in, I will wake him up.

640
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,290
Ms. Tang, I prepared a cup of honey water.

641
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,730
When Mr. Yu is getting better,

642
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,070
let him drink it.

643
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,900
I will leave him to you then.

644
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,740
Li.

645
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,990
Where is Xing Zhen?

646
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,460
Wasn't she who took me home?

647
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,710
She's left.

648
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,490
You didn't pick up my phones.

649
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,330
So I came to take a look.

650
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,670
Thank you, you know me the best.

651
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,810
You should thank Xing Zhen.

652
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,620
You…

653
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,360
I came for Erduo.

654
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,280
I hope you to take care of Erduo
in the show

655
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,560
for the sake of us

656
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,120
knowing each other for so many years.

657
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,710
Erduo is both my guest and my friend.

658
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,420
Of course I will.

659
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,460
Good.

660
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,340
Well, Li.

661
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,310
Don't have a prejudice to Xing Zhen.

662
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,700
She did everything for the company.

663
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,300
If it wasn't for the sponsor she got,

664
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,820
the second season still remains unknown.

665
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,820
So you two are the best partners now?

666
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,520
Please make a clear distinction
between public and private interests.

667
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,580
I do make a clear distinction.

668
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,460
We have nothing to do
with the public interests.

669
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,020
Let's talk about the private ones.

670
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,570
You said that you two have no relationships.

671
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,570
What about us?

672
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,880
Except work,

673
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,960
do we have anything to do with each other?

674
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,670
For so many years,

675
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,750
I always thought that

676
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,250
we had tacit understanding.

677
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,370
If I think too much,

678
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,400
I am sorry for that.

679
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,560
Let me make it clear.

680
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,160
I like you.

681
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,740
