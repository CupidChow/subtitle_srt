00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,050
Where is this?

178
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,010
What happened to me?

179
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,240
Li, don't talk for now.

180
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,410
I'm going to call a doctor.

181
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,460
Don't talk.

182
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,700
I'll go.

183
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,560
Li, don't move.

184
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,930
Listen to me.

185
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,660
You just had surgery
on the joint in your left arm.

186
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,430
The doctor said that the operation
was successful,

187
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,490
so there would be no sequelae,

188
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,680
no further impact,

189
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,470
and it would recover well.

190
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,790
Besides,

191
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,410
you have a slight concussion.

192
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,930
Do you have a headache

193
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,690
or discomfort right now?

194
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,880
No.

195
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,340
As expected, after Ye Shuwei, it's my turn.

196
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,570
Nuts!

197
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,570
Why do you keep saying this?

198
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,190
The doctor will check your situation.

199
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,020
Don't say that.

200
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,920
Why are you and Ye Shuwei here?

201
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,450
Mr. Yu called us.

202
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,730
Is he also here?

203
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,620
Of course.

204
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,450
He was right by your side.

205
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,100
Now that we are with you,

206
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,210
he went downstairs

207
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,290
to buy you food.

208
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,350
We are not sure if you are allowed to eat,

209
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,610
but he said just in case.

210
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,350
What's more,

211
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,340
when it's needed to sign
before the operation,

212
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,160
Mr. Yu said he's your boyfriend.

213
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,770
So your boyfriend's identity is made public.

214
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,980
Boyfriend?

215
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,660
He's not up to my standards at all.

216
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,790
I still have to consider about it.

217
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,110
Li, this is called a blessing in disguise.

218
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,860
A friend in need is your boyfriend indeed.

219
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,290
You want some water?

220
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,920
I have a headache.

221
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,310
Headache.

222
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,080
Stop making fun of me.

223
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,750
You want some water?

224
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,060
All right.

225
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,940
It's all good.

226
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,640
Just let her take a good rest.

227
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,310
The matters need attention are

228
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,690
in the list I just gave you.

229
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:25,730
Okay.

230
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,270
Thank you, doctor.

231
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,900
Okay.

232
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,180
You should go home.

233
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,250
I will check the rest.

234
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,760
We are leaving.

235
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,930
Keep in touch.

236
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,380
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

237
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,330
Tomorrow I will bring

238
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,030
Li's clothes.

239
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,520
Okay.

240
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,540
Take care.

241
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,040
We are leaving.

242
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,410
What's wrong?

243
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,590
Easy.

244
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,450
No one knows you.

245
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,470
Do you think that Mr. Yu and Li

246
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,620
are a perfect match?

247
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,290
Seat belt.

248
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,040
Okay.

249
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,160
I think Mr. Yu cares much about Li.

250
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,420
He did all this out of
responsibility and guilt.

251
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,630
Just to win the support.

252
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,960
You've never been in love.
You don't understand.

253
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,270
You do?

254
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,030
Girl in pajamas.

255
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,370
Have you been in love?

256
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,720
I will count on you in the show.

257
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,250
I'm just worried about you.

258
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,920
You've never gotten along well with girls.

259
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,210
If it were Mr. Yu to be my teammate…

260
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,150
Ye Shuwei, you are so narrow-minded!

261
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,690
This is called retaliation, you know?

262
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,460
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

263
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,290
I'd like to eat a moon cake.

264
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,280
Hello.

265
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,510
Do you have moon cakes?

266
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,610
Yes, over there.

267
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,250
Thank you.

268
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,290
Which one do you want?

269
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,300
With yolk.

270
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:19,990
Let's go.

271
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,620
That's it?

272
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,200
Here you are.

273
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,180
8.5 yuan in total.

274
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,000
Let's finish it before going back.

275
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,770
Today is one-day tour of the hospital.

276
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,200
Fortunately, there is no danger.

277
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,240
But such a Mid-Autumn Festival is special.

278
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,610
Hello, Le Tian.

279
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,280
What's up?

280
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,590
Ms. Bei, where are you?

281
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,530
I am home.

282
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,590
I had a translation issue

283
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,700
to ask you last night.

284
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,300
But I made several calls
and you didn't answer.

285
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,030
Sorry.

286
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,370
I was in a hurry to the hospital last night,

287
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,920
so I forgot to bring my mobile phone.

288
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,160
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

289
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,010
Is it serious?

290
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,360
Not me, my best friend had a car accident.

291
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,630
But now she's okay.

292
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,500
If you have any question,

293
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,400
send it to me on WeChat,

294
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,930
and I will reply you when I have time.

295
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,020
It's okay. No worries.

296
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,450
I will go for you after you come to class.

297
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,480
Okay then.

298
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,000
I have to go to the hospital today.

299
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,420
And I will go to school in the afternoon.

300
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,640
Ms. Bei, remember to eat on time.

301
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,300
Don't just take care of others.

302
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,650
- Take care of yourself.
- Okay.

303
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,730
All right. Enough.

304
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,680
I have to go.

305
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,640
Li.

306
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:07,880
Come here.

307
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,390
Erduo, take a seat.

308
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,810
Well.

309
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,280
Since Erduo is here,

310
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,710
let her keep you company.

311
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,870
Just forget about everything

312
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,810
and take a good rest.

313
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,060
Everything you need for hospitalization

314
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,880
is in this box.

315
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,710
Ask Erduo to settle it for you later.

316
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,540
The doctor said that you can eat.

317
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,490
Food is in the refrigerator.

318
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,770
If you are hungry, ask Erduo to
heat something for you.

319
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,070
I also prepared you soup.

320
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,300
Someone will send it here later.

321
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,440
Remember to take it while it's hot.

322
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,060
I have a meeting soon.

323
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,010
I have to go.

324
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,590
Okay, got it.

325
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,440
Just get to work.

326
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,740
Mr. Yu, don't worry.

327
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,960
I will take care of her.

328
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,460
Surely I will.

329
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
She's yours.

330
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,970
Ms. Tang.

331
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,810
I brought you some snacks.

332
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,170
Want some?

333
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,000
I am not hungry now. I will eat it later.

334
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,110
All right.

335
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,520
I also brought you

336
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,860
clothes to change.

337
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,010
If you need it,

338
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,600
just take it.

339
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,990
Okay.

340
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,850
By the way, I brought this.

341
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,440
What's this?

342
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,710
Why taking it?

343
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,380
Your arm is injured,

344
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,050
so you have to wrap the arm with it

345
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,400
to take a shower.

346
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,970
Cool.

347
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,590
I will put it here.

348
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,690
Okay.

349
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,020
Well.

350
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,610
Mr. Yu really did a lot.

351
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,960
Of course he has to.

352
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,640
This is occupational injury.

353
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,930
Li.

354
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,030
Now you are living

355
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,180
in a luxury single ward.

356
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,410
So what?

357
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,420
I got cerebral concussion

358
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,840
and I need to have a rest-cure.

359
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,660
Yes.

360
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,900
Think about it.

361
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,330
He handled with everything,

362
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,050
served you with water

363
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,660
and was even responsible for your meals.

364
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,270
Good for him.

365
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,070
My arm is broken

366
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,900
and I'm now disabled.

367
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,030
It's reasonable that he serves me with water.

368
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,660
Besides, if I recover quickly,

369
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,850
I can go back to work for him earlier.

370
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,250
After all, he's my boss,

371
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,600
a capitalist who

372
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,860
presses my labor remaining value.

373
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,850
That's it.

374
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,260
Li.

375
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,050
Do you know that you are

376
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:11,010
full of joy in your eyes now?

377
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,480
Am I?

378
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,450
No.

379
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,040
I am just surprised.

380
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,550
He washed my clothes

381
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,760
that were dirty by blood.

382
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:28,860
You know?

383
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,230
He even barely

384
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,740
washed his clothes.

385
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,160
So are you complaining with me

386
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,960
or displaying affection?

387
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,610
But it's good.

388
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,310
With the moisture of love,

389
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,390
you will get better soon.

390
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,800
You sweet talker.

391
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,380
I want some water.

392
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,630
The water is right beside you.

393
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,410
Take it yourself.

394
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,740
You are my best friend.

395
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,160
All right.

396
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,970
Mr. Yu treats me better.

397
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,490
Then ask him to come back.

398
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,710
No, this program is lack of creativity.

399
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,180
[SUGARENT ENTERTAINMENT]
The last two episodes are totally unqualified.

400
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,160
You have to edit them again.

401
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,790
Give me a program before get off work, okay?

402
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,400
Hello.

403
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,790
Sorry, where were we?

404
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,130
Okay, no problem.

405
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,280
Totally fine.

406
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,410
Okay.

407
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,540
Bye.

408
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,900
Come in.

409
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,340
Boss Yu.

410
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:26,910
Hello.

411
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,950
The proposal is done?

412
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,050
Okay, send it to me.

413
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,520
Sure.

414
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,680
Hard work for you.

415
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,280
What's the matter?

416
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,910
You have been busy recently.

417
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,380
Is there anything I can help?

418
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,770
Ms. Tang is hospitalized.

419
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,850
So I need to work for two.

420
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,390
If you have nothing to do,

421
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,130
I really need your help.

422
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,790
My work is almost done.

423
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,680
Really?

424
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,230
Great.

425
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,970
I'd like you to work for
Ms. Tang's department.

426
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,740
That's great.

427
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,410
I finally have the opportunity
to learn with you.

428
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,040
Okay.

429
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:14,900
Hello.

430
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,140
Why didn't you knock on the door?

431
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,020
The door is open. I was about
to knock on the door.

432
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,380
What's up?

433
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,160
The program group informed me that

434
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,820
the theme of the next program

435
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,310
is first love.

436
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,310
They would film some pictures
of our interaction.

437
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,760
Li is hospitalized.

438
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,630
I have to be alright

439
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,790
and well-prepared.

440
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,830
So I think we should

441
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,680
know more about each other,

442
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,430
practice and rehearse more,

443
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,000
so as not to give the game away.

444
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,000
What's your plan?

445
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,830
I'd like to

446
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,420
know more about your life now and your past,

447
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,940
as well as your current work
and future development.

448
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:28,800
For example,

449
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,120
let me follow you in these days.

450
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,520
Hear, watch and feel.

451
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,890
Hear, watch and feel?

452
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,400
It will be the last episode.

453
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,810
I don't want to make trouble

454
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,230
for Li and Mr. Yu again.

455
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,420
Just write down what I need to know.

456
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,240
No need.

457
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,720
You could search me on Baidu Baike.

458
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,810
Thoe information on the Internet
is well-known to all,

459
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,410
not in-depth understanding.

460
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,840
In-depth understanding?

461
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,780
Then recite these three books first.

462
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,620
Anything else?

463
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,850
Recite them all.

464
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,170
I am leaving.

465
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,340
Ber Erduo is pretending to be innocent
all the way.

466
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,060
Could you fast forward the video?

467
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,330
How could such a program be sponsored

468
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,330
and invested?

469
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,350
Hello.

470
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,480
Dad.

471
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,800
Why did you sponsor this program?

472
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,260
It's almost there.

473
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,920
Why so slow?

474
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,960
Are these all your materials?

475
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
You have to recite fluently from memory

476
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,380
all of them before the program.

477
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,230
So many!

478
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,050
The production process of the violin?

479
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,450
Why should I remember this?

480
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,620
It's way too much.

481
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,570
You want an in-depth understanding.

482
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,070
No need.

483
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,980
I can't recite them all.

484
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,670
I have to watch what you do

485
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,700
to be left a deep impression.

486
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,650
Okay, I will show you some other day.

487
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,500
Hold on.

488
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,530
What else?

489
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,290
We haven't post photos on Weibo
for a long time.

490
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,030
You want to take photos now?

491
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,030
No, I didn't mean that.

492
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,500
Are you free tomorrow?

493
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,140
Let's be on location.

494
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,890
It depends on where to go.

495
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:41,600
Seaside?

496
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:42,470
Too far.

497
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,180
Ocean Park?

498
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,040
Too noisy.

499
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,390
Agritainment?

500
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,410
Boring.

501
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,130
Well, tell me

502
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,760
what's on your mind.

503
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,530
Amusement park.

504
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,660
Okay, deal.

505
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,860
Let's start at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

506
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,700
You dress so casually on a date?

507
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,250
Is it a date?

508
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,620
Are you going to take photos like this?

509
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,070
I am the one matters, not clothes.

510
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:41,750
Let's go.

511
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,720
What a philosopher.

512
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,560
Let's play this.

513
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,990
I think the scene is romantic.

514
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:14,860
Childish.

515
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,050
Flat movement is not exciting at all.

516
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,290
Flat movement?

517
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,680
Let's go over there.

518
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,580
Bei Erduo.

519
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,510
Don't you take a break at home

520
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,600
on weekend?

521
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,900
No way.

522
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,930
Ms. Tang

523
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,480
is hospitalized for occupational injury.

524
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,300
I should visit you.

525
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,010
I am going to wash two apples.

526
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,640
Okay.

527
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,660
Mr. Yu, I have arrived in the company.

528
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,900
When are you coming?

529
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:44,210
Even if you don't want a flat movement,

530
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,510
this one goes too far.

531
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,790
Only 60 meters high,

532
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,810
similar to the flat movement

533
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,850
I didn't expect you to be so cowardly.

534
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,140
Let's go.

535
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,560
I am not afraid at all.

536
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,310
Let's get it.

537
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,540
Mom, I'd like to play that.

538
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,760
That's Turbo Drop,

539
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,560
which is very dangerous.

540
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,910
There used to be a little girl

541
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,910
with the same beautiful braid as yours.

542
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,560
When she got on it,

543
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,420
her braid hung in the machine.

544
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,420
And her scalp was pulled down.

545
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,240
Her neck was full of blood.

546
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,390
Mom, let's play Carousel.

547
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:35,910
Sure.

548
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,430
Tell me if you are afraid now.

549
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,820
Don't force yourself.

550
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,540
How could parents scare children like that?

551
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,700
So exaggerated

552
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,760
and scary.

553
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,830
It's safe, right?
