[Episode 13]

3
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,560
After hearing your words,

4
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,880
I feel like Mr. Yu has no life skills.

5
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,380
I'm worried about Li.

6
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,690
When they get married,

7
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,940
they might have to order takeout every day.

8
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,460
Don't worry about them.

9
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,560
Then I'm going home.

10
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,150
Good night.

11
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,240
Good night.

12
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,700
It's 10 p.m. She's still not home?

13
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,770
Is everything alright lately?

14
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,200
Sorry, the number you dialed is not answered.

15
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,400
Leave me alone.

16
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,100
It has nothing to do with me.

17
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,680
Who else should we go to?

18
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,570
Who?

19
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,570
Who should we go to?

20
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,050
I don't know.

21
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,250
Uncles, aunts,

22
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,280
why are you all here at my home tonight?

23
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,720
What's the matter?

24
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,780
Your mother cheated us out of our money.

25
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,520
Yes, she swindled us.

26
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,460
I didn't!

27
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,340
Stop. Hold on.

28
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,320
Uh, please calm down.

29
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,750
You're talking at the same time. I

30
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,500
can't get a clear picture of what happened.

31
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,210
But...

32
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,510
But, look at my mom.

33
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,250
You've known her for many years.

34
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,840
She's by no means a swindler.

35
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,590
You know that from your hearts.

36
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,330
Then why didn't you give our money back?

37
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:31,890
Alright.

38
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,480
Alright.

39
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,030
Alright.

40
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,920
- Alright.
- That's our pension money.

41
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,670
Mom.

42
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,630
Mom, what's going on?

43
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,340
I didn't swindle them out of their money.

44
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,620
Tell me, what's going on?

45
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,670
It's...

46
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,840
It's an investment portfolio

47
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,700
manager of a fund.

48
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,820
He told me about a lucrative program.

49
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,680
So I invested all our savings in it.

50
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,670
It was indeed profitable.

51
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,910
When they found out I made a fortune,

52
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,840
they asked me to invest for them.

53
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,150
I thought it was a win-win.

54
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,160
We all could make some money.

55
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,330
But on the day

56
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,520
to pay the dividends this month,

57
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,030
they didn't pay.

58
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,740
Three days later,

59
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,340
I couldn't wait any longer.

60
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,000
I was so anxious that I went

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
to their company.

62
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,040
But the door of their company

63
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,690
was sealed off by the authority.

64
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,290
No one was there.

65
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,780
I... I... I...

66
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,420
Do you remember the name of the company?

67
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,200
Do you? We'll find them.

68
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,070
Don't bother.

69
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,030
They rent the cars and office.

70
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,730
They're swindlers.

71
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,860
Our money is gone.

72
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,050
Those swindlers nowadays

73
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,990
would resort to every conceivable means.

74
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,440
I...

75
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,270
Mom.

76
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,040
Mom, don't worry.

77
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,380
It's OK.

78
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,800
Xu is also a victim.

79
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,230
She meant to be good for us.

80
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,180
Listen, let's break it up,

81
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,010
and go to the police tomorrow.

82
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,130
Yes, let's all go to the police tomorrow.

83
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,700
Yes, let's go tomorrow.

84
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,770
The police will get our money back.

85
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,280
How did it come this?

86
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,510
Alright.

87
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,400
Alright. Let's go.

88
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,250
Aunts, uncles, good night.

89
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,230
Take care of your mother.

90
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,940
OK.

91
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,070
Come on, Mom.

92
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,180
Mom, sit down.

93
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,020
Our money is gone.

94
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,090
Mom.

95
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,050
I think you might be

96
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,650
involved in a Ponzi scheme.

97
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,410
What is a Ponzi scheme?

98
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,780
It's a financial scam

99
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,340
based on hollow promises.

100
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,360
They pay profits to earlier investors

101
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,570
with funds from more recent investors

102
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,160
like a pyramid.

103
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,840
When they run out of money,

104
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,280
they take flight.

105
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,660
So our money...

106
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,650
Our money is gone forever.

107
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,810
It's OK, mom.

108
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,720
We can make money.

109
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,440
I'll get you a glass of water.

110
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,050
My money.

111
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,330
Mom, it's past 12.

112
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,270
Have something to eat.

113
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,430
I made noodles. Eat some.

114
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,870
No, thanks.

115
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,280
I have to check how much I lost.

116
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,000
You have to eat.

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,570
Nothing is as important as your health.

118
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,540
Have some.

119
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,680
I don't have the appetite.

120
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,800
Let's see what the amount here is.

121
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,440
We lost 338,000.

122
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,070
How much?

123
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,360
338,000.

124
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,600
333,000, all gone.

125
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,040
Wait.

126
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,160
Hey, mom.

127
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,570
When did you get so much money?

128
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,250
My housing provident fund, my personal money,

129
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,140
profits from stocks

130
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,990
and funds,

131
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,480
fixed deposits,

132
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,890
savings,

133
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,010
inheritances from your grandmother,

134
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,450
and also the money you...

135
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,630
And the money you gave me.

136
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,480
Did you also invest the money I gave you

137
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,560
to treat your eye disease in it?

138
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,430
So you don't have any eye disease, right?

139
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,880
Erduo, I was actually

140
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,610
brainwashed by those people.

141
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,820
I just wanted to make more money.

142
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,320
So I invested all my money in it.

143
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,410
Don't you want to study abroad?

144
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,460
I wanted to make as much as possible.

145
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,520
It's good for you if I'm rich, right?

146
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,860
Imagine you have a tight budget abroad,

147
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,450
life would be very hard for you.

148
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,940
What can you do when they mistreat you?

149
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,740
I never thought it could be a fraud.

150
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,830
They cheated on me.

151
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,910
Mom, I'm just glad you're OK.

152
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,660
Look,

153
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,140
tell me everything you know

154
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,070
about this company.

155
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,050
Gather all the documents such as

156
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,940
bills, contracts, and invoices for me.

157
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,830
We'll report this to the police

158
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,280
with all the victims

159
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,210
no matter how much we can recover.

160
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

161
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,920
Yes, we have to go to the police tomorrow.

162
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,120
We have to help the police

163
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
arrest the rotten scammers.

164
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,260
It's getting late.

165
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,800
You should get some rest.

166
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,990
I'll go upstairs.

167
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,230
Good night.

168
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,560
Remember to eat the noodles.

169
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,570
You're back, Ms. Tang.

170
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,010
How is the injury?

171
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,700
Much better.

172
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,740
Hi, Ms. Tang.

173
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,490
Hi, guys.

174
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,100
Ms. Tang.

175
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,900
Welcome back, Ms. Tang.

176
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,640
It's been a long time.

177
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,300
Yes, it is.

178
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,820
Li.

179
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,640
Liu.

180
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,700
You're back!

181
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,610
If you did not come back,

182
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,100
I'd want to break my arm for a long leave.

183
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,330
Alright, I'm back, aren't I?

184
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,250
Go back to work now.

185
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,330
I'll check with Boss Yu

186
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,050
for the following work.

187
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,160
Don't.

188
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,130
What's up?

189
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,420
It's your first day back.

190
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,040
I need you here more.

191
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,590
What's wrong?

192
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,960
I was a few days away,
and you can't finish your work alone.

193
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,560
Go to work.

194
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,840
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

195
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,180
Thank you, Boss Yu.

196
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,360
Xing Zhen, as long as you do a good job,

197
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,340
Boss Yu will give you a better one.

198
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,410
Don't mind me. I came to say hi.

199
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,240
You guys continue.

200
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,060
Boss Yu, I should go modify it.

201
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,770
What's wrong?

202
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,270
I'm fine.

203
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:16,960
Are you sure?

204
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,560
Yes, I'll be OK.

205
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,620
Leave it to me.

206
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,620
Tang Li is back.

207
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,690
So are Boss Yu and Xing Zhen gonna break up?

208
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,560
I think it's time for Tang Li to step aside.

209
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,850
Boss Yu and Xing Zhen

210
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,600
are getting closer fast lately.

211
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,410
I heard that a few days ago,

212
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,360
Boss Yu took Xing Zhen
to project negotiations.

213
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,960
It seems he's serious with Xing Zhen.

214
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,600
I feel sorry for Tang Li.

215
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,130
She's done so much for Boss Yu

216
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,670
in the past years.

217
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,570
Well, everyman is a Romeo.

218
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,450
Let's go.

219
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,930
I'm so sorry.

220
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,720
It's OK. The director
hasn't called it to start.

221
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,610
Take a breath.

222
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,250
We're recording.

223
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,360
Let's go.

224
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,620
Hurry up!

225
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,480
Erduo, hurry up!

226
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,850
You were never late.

227
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,640
What's wrong today?

228
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,700
Come on.

229
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,740
Concentrate, everybody.

230
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,410
This is a very important scene.

231
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,910
OK, go.

232
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,570
Really?

233
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,920
Are we really in the finals?

234
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,450
Mm-hmm.

235
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,410
Qianling, your dream is about to come true.

236
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,580
Friends, I love you.

237
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,700
Thank you for staying with me all the way.

238
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,370
Bye.

239
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,120
I thought I'd be emotional.

240
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,900
Jiang Jiang, are you nervous?

241
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,380
Of... Of course.

242
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,250
I've never imagined that

243
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,440
we could make it to the finals.

244
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,130
I couldn't sleep last night.

245
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,060
Memories of the whole journey

246
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,470
kept flashing back in my head.

247
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,130
Stop.

248
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,740
Bei Erduo, there's a pause in the last line,

249
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,200
after the word, "kept".

250
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,520
Let's do it again.

251
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,180
I couldn't sleep last night.

252
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,720
Memories of the whole journey...

253
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,210
I couldn't sleep last night.

254
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,210
Memories of the whole journey kept

255
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,210
flashing back in my head.

256
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,530
You're really nervous.

257
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,280
What are you doing

258
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,920
sneaking around

259
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,050
in our locker room?

260
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,590
No... Nothing.

261
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,380
Wrong room.

262
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,800
Wrong room?

263
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,800
What's in your hand?

264
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,480
What's up?

265
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,310
Why don't you come in?

266
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,120
Qianling, she's weird.

267
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,850
Qianling, she's fishy.

268
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,500
Erduo.

269
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,820
Keep your voice lower.

270
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,330
Redo it.

271
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,770
What a pity! She got nothing
for all these years.

272
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,290
Boss Yu and Xing Zhen are really close.

273
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,380
Yes, I'm sorry for her.

274
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,040
You...

275
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,900
I need a leave.

276
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,900
But you're just discharged from the hospital.

277
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,090
I'm not recovered yet.

278
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,140
Are you OK?

279
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,410
Shall we go to the hospital?

280
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,990
No, I'll go myself.

281
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:29,840
OK.

282
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,210
I've been busy with projects lately.

283
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,250
Take a few more days off.

284
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,810
When I close the deal, you'll be busy.

285
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,220
Take the time to have a good rest.

286
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:49,100
[General Manager]

287
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,150
We haven't worked hard enough
that makes us cry.

288
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,150
We can't quit like that.

289
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,350
Next time we will definitely stand there.

290
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,360
Wait a minute.

291
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,220
The director just said that we can

292
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,240
keep the club.

293
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,680
Really?

294
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,100
That's great!

295
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,880
All our hard work pays off.

296
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,390
Erduo.

297
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,090
You're not in the right mood.

298
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,370
Get more excited.

299
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,380
Really?

300
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,850
That's great.

301
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,010
All our hard work pays...

302
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,290
Stop.

303
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,470
Why are you getting more depressed?

304
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:25,930
Do it again.

305
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,520
Really?

306
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,960
That's great.

307
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,800
All our hard work pays...

308
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,890
Are you riding a roller coaster?

309
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,220
You're getting lower and lower.

310
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,660
Sorry, Mr. Xu, sorry.

311
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,330
I'll do it again.

312
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,140
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,060
That's it for today.

314
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,080
What's wrong with you today?

315
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,760
Do you still want to be a voice actress
or not?

316
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,100
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

317
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,780
I don't care what happened to you.

318
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,470
When you're in the recording studio,

319
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,080
you have to get rid of the other things

320
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,660
on your mind.

321
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,820
You're working here, you know?

322
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,690
Don't bring other emotions into the work.

323
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,700
This is also against the work ethics

324
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,650
of a professional voice actress.

325
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,070
I got it, Mr. Xu.

326
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,440
I will pay attention next time.

327
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:19,360
OK.

328
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,310
You can go back.

329
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,850
Organize your emotions.

330
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,590
Erduo, have some water.

331
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,010
Mr. Xu is always a strict person.

332
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,010
Don't take it personally.

333
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,290
She should.

334
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,290
Or she could not make progress.

335
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,220
Stop it.

336
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,070
Something is bothering her.

337
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,770
Don't you want to be a professional?

338
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,100
Would a professional

339
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,770
ever make such a silly mistake?

340
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,770
You were wasting your time

341
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,420
and ours, too.

342
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,420
Shouldn't she get a reprimand?

343
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,260
I'm sorry.

344
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,740
I wasted your precious time today.

345
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,310
