00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,470
Hello, Le Tian.

4
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,770
Ms. Bei, are you free the day after tomorrow?

5
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,040
Go to buy some reference books with me.

6
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,800
I'm afraid no.

7
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm going to attend
an Internet Celebrity Festival.

8
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,290
Make it another day.

9
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,290
Internet Celebrity Festival?

10
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,700
Is that the one to be held on Tianjie Street?

11
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,280
I guess.

12
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,330
It's said that many online celebrities
will be there.

13
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,790
Ms. Bei, are you one of their working staff?

14
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,020
No, I recorded some audio books before

15
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,780
and then got their invitation.

16
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,130
Could you take me there with you?

17
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,830
I'll be quiet and well-behaved. I promise.

18
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,960
Why do you want to go?

19
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,760
You'll get bored when sitting there.

20
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,740
It's okay. I'll cheer you up.

21
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,740
It's settled then.

22
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,710
Good night.

23

What's wrong?

24
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,310
I was just trying whether it…

25
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,370

26

Ye Shuwei, do you think it's funny?

27
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,900
I want some water.

28

I'll get it for you.

29

33

You're welcome. It's not a big deal.

34
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,960
But I think you'd better

35
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,940
take another temperature. It will be safer.

36
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,780
Wait here. I'll get the thermometer for you.

37

Good then.

41

Take good care of yourself.

42

Um.

43
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,120
I still feel a little unwell.

44
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,000
Unwell how?

45
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't want to eat anything.

46

I have no appetite.

47
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,890
But you had a good appetite last night.

48
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,720
That was dinner for last night.

49
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,140
I was barely able to eat some.

50

How about this?

51

Let's go shopping. I'll drive.

52

What materials do you need for cooking?

56

and…

58
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,370
What I want can't be found here.

Salt and gourmet powder.

67

Do you want tomatoes?

68

Look, there are also needle mushroom.

The things in the supermarket
are expensive and bad.

73

Mostly expensive.

And we're in the same play.

174
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,960
We can't play those characters.

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,470
Ms. Bei, which dressing room you are in?

Hello, Erduo.

185
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,880
I am Moyu, leader of team Sound of Silence.

186
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,830
I heard that you could do dubbing.

187
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,080
Here's the thing.

188
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,910
We have a performance today.

189
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,420
But a member couldn't come

190
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,780
because of an emergency at home.

191
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,060
So we hope that you could do us this favor.

192
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,460
Just a few lines.

193
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,770
Are you also here for the festival?

194
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,920
Do you have any performance to play?

195
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,060
Will this performance clash with yours?

196
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,840
I was invited here. I have no performance.

197
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,410
That would be great.

198
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,380
This is the script.

199
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,380
You only have three lines.

200
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,370
Respectively for loli, shota and an old lady.

201
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,550
In fact, they are all passers-by.

202
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,760
So no need to be nervous.

203

Shall I give it a try?

Uncle, is moral integrity edible?

206
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,040
Young man, you ate your moral integrity.

207
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,750
Erduo, I'm impressed.

208

Your voice is very good.

209

And the conversion is quite natural.

You did it much better than I had imagined.

And it's serious.

But she hasn't broken up with Sato yet.

Beware of bad guys.

343
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,500
Are you saying I'm a dangerous bad guy?

344
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,540
He's not talking about you. It's a joke.

345
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,290
I'm not joking.

346
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,950
I'm serious.

347
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,760
Ms. Bei.

348
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,850
Bye-bye.

349
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,230
Didn't I already clean it this morning?

350
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,170
What is this?

351
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,360
It's not safe to go home too late.

352
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,820
It's okay.

353
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,750
The transport here is convenient.

354
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,210
And this area is pretty safe.

355
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,540
Thank you for today.

356
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,410
Go to sleep.

357
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,870
Le Tian.

358
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,890
I didn't come with you to read comics.

359
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,650
I could also learn from comics.

360
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,770
Then please read original Japanese version.

361
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,860
Ms. Bei, did you read the update
of GINTAMA yesterday?

362
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,250
I was too tired yesterday.

363
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,400
I fell asleep the minute I got on the bed.

364
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,920
Let me tell you, Sadaharu is…

365
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,290
No spoiler.

366
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
Hello, Li.

367
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,810
What's up?

368
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,490
Have you read the hot topics?

369
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,960
What's hot topic?

370
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,960
What happened again?

371
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,030
Yeah, again.

372
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,340
Check your Weibo quickly.

Why is Bei Erduo in the center position?

375
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,170
This kind of news is boring.

376
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,260
Li.

377
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,480
I really didn't stand there on purpose.

378
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,940
Someone dragged me across.

379
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,880
I mean it…

380
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,760
All right, all right.

381
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,820
I know what kind of person you are.

382
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,130
I just contacted the organizers
of the activity.

383
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,840
They also didn't

384
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,490
expect this to happen.

385
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,300
They're looking for videos
from other cameras now.

386
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,390
A video will help a lot.

387
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,040
I'm afraid I won't have any future

388
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,560
if I keep being smeared like this.

389
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,170
Thank you.

390
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,270
It's all right.

391
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,110
Bye-bye.

392
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,020
How's it going, Ms. Bei.

393
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,020
It's okay. Let's continue book shopping.

394
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,660
I could contact my friend

395
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,680
and ask them to make a statement.

396
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,620
No need to contact your friend.

397
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,680
As long as they can find the video,
it will be solved.

398
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,950
Go to have a look over there.

399
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,060
All right.

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,760

Thank you so much.

I'll treat you to a grand meal.

403
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,530
Okay, I know you're busy.

404
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:19,890
Good bye.

405
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,520
Here.

406
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,580
Ah, thank you.

407
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,100
How's it going? Have they found any?

408
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,580
Yeah.

409
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,640
Luckily they found the video.

410
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,930
Otherwise, Erduo would be made the scapegoat.

411
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,520
I've informed the publicity group.

412
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,090
Once the program issues any clarification,

413
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,530
we'll follow its move.

414
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,730
Don't be too nervous.

415
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,690
Great.

416
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,500
Erduo is having bad luck recently.

417
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,720
So many things have happened to her.

418
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,210
Now this one is solved.

419
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,000
But I'm still worried.

420
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,800
I feel that something bad will happen again.

421
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,450
Come on.

422
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,250
Don't say that, or it may really happen.

423
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,900
Relax.

424
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,550
I'll buy you dinner

425
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,920
and send you home after work.

426
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,770
Okay.

428
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,500
I need you to finalize a plan of mine.

429
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,640
Okay, this way.

430
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,900
I told you not to order spicy food.

431
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,200
Now it hurts?

432
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,630
I think a wisdom tooth is growing.

433
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,160
I felt some inflammation the other day.

434
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,360
You may feel better with some icy food.

435
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,470
The growing of wisdom teeth is painful.

436
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,680
But just a short period.

437
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,350
Ms. Bei, do you also have wisdom teeth?

438
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,220
How many?

439
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,770
One up there and one down there.

440
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,210
Let me have a look.

441
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,560
Come on.

442
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,110
Look at yours in the mirror
after you get home.

443
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,230
Did they ache?

444
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,070
Of course.

445
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,990
You can't imagine it.
When my wisdom teeth was growing

446
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,300
and was also inflamed,

447
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,360
I really wanted to pull them out myself.

448
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,800
But it got better gradually.

449
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,110
Ms. Bei, are you afraid of pulling teeth?

450
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,600
I'm not…

451
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,880
Eat your food and shut up.

452
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,060
Where are you?

453
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,170
Xingmei Mall.

454
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,870
Got it.

455
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,140
Xing Zhen.

456
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,850
Your car is broken?

457
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,600
I can't get it started.

458
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,900
It's a little late to get a repairman.

459
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,870
How about this?

460
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,250
You leave your car here today

461
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,120
and get a guy to fix it tomorrow.

462
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,030
I'll send you home tonight.

463
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,660
Is that okay?

464
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,310
Thank you.

465
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,140
It's all right. Let's go.

466
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:40,660
Ms. Tang.

467
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,640
Sorry to bother you.

468
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,640
It's okay.

469
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,720
Why are you also so late?

470
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,580
Have you had dinner?

471
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,560
Yes.

472
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:48,840
Get in the car.

473
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,780
Xing Zhen lives in your opposite direction.

474
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,380
Li, I'll send you home first

475
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,290
so that you can have a good rest.

476
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,120
But your home is also far away.

477
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,140
So…

478
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,000
Send Ms. Tang home first.

479
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,490
My home is far away.

480
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,790
It would be too late for Ms. Tang
if you send me home first.

481
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,580
Okay.

482
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,330
Let's do a small quiz.

483
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,480
What's the Japanese for wisdom teeth?

484
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,560
I know this one.

485
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,530
Oyasirazu.

486
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,200
Oyasirazu.

487
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,110
Do you know where they come from?

488
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,140
I've no idea.

489
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,500
Actually, wisdom teeth are different
from other teeth.

490
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,090
They usually come out

491
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,180
after one has come of age.

492
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,680
Your parents don't know about their growth.

493
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,240
So it's Japanese expression
means "parents don't know about it."

494
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,780
Looks like my wisdom teeth are coming out

495
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,290
because I'm leaving my parents.

496
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,440
I told you its deep meaning

497
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,410
in order to introduce you

498
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,650
an important way to memorize words.

499
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,480
I get it, Ms. Bei Erduo.

500
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,000
Mommy.

501
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,710
Can't that big brother find his mom?

502
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,100
Which big brother?

503
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,790
[Can't find your mom? Wait here.]
[She'll be back soon.]

504
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,730

505
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,390
Coco, when you can't find mommy,

506
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,360
you should wait there for me

507
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,900
just like that brother.

508
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,620
Okay?

509
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,880
Yes.

510
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,580
Ms. Bei, do you know the Korean
for wisdom teeth?

511
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,900
I once watched a Korean movie,

512
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,100
in which wisdom teeth was called love teeth.

513
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,540
To grow them means you're in love.

514
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,600
It is romantic?

515
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,780
It is.

516
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,620
Now wonder Korean drama
can always attract young girls.

517
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,310
No girl can resist those romantic plots.

518
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,050
By the way, boys also watch Korean drama?

519
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,430
You girls are always attracted

520
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,380
by heroes in those dramas.

521
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,850
So you should learn from those heroes.

522
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,580
In the future, you will also attract

523
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,610
a large group of young girls.

524
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,330
Hello.

525
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,650
Hello, sir.

526
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,870
How can I help you?

527
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,000
My cell phone is dead.

528
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,960
And I can't find my friend.

529
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,600
Okay.

530
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,270
May I have your friend's name and gender?

531
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,120
Bei Erduo, female.

532
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,690
What is your relationship?

533
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,410
She's my girlfriend.

534
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,870
Okay, please wait for a while here.

535
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,220
Thank you.

536
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,680
I think it's almost time to go.

537
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,080
Get them packed.

538
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,520
Waiter, please pack them.

539
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,720
Could drinks be packed?

540
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,280
Good evening, dear customers.

541
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,680
Here is a missing person notice.

542
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,390
Miss Bei Erduo.

543
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,200
Please come to the service desk
on the first floor as soon as you hear it.

544
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,300
Your boyfriend Mr. Ye Shuwei

545
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
is waiting for you here.

546
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,330
Miss Bei Erduo,
please hurry to the service desk.

547
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,100
Well…

548
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,920
I've got to go.

549
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,580
Goodbye.

550
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,400
Good evening, dear customers.

551
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,200
Li.

552
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:49,940
Li.

553
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,670
Why are you so silent?

554
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,740
Are you worn out?

555
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,840
No, what's the matter?

556
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,370
Ye Shuwei, why did you come?

557
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,790
I was passing through
so I came to pick you up.

558
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,630
Pick me up?

559
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,880
You have a special way to look for people.

560
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,630
Ms. Tang, where do you suggest
for our next team building?

561
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,640
Our projects this year

562
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,890
are all well completed.

563
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,340
Spain is of course a good choice.

564
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,440
But Boss Yu said

565
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
that you were the hero, so it's up to you.

566
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,660
Both work for me. You decide.

567
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,290
Boss Yu, Ms. Tang is fine with it.

568
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,110
Then let's go to Spain.

569
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,940
Spain?

570
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,530
But you can't decide alone.

571
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,610
Everyone's opinion matters.

572
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,570
Then how about Paris?

573
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,660
Paris is fun.

574
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,910
Actually, I also want to go to Paris.

575
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,740
Paris, Paris. Paris it is.

576
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,670
Okay, then Paris.

577
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,480
But it still should be agreed by other staff.

578
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,610
Boss Yu.

579
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,340
Don't worry. We'll definitely travel abroad.

580
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,330
Hello, Sister Moyu.

581
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,990
I'm sorry to bother you.

582
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,460
Erduo? Come on.

583
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,250
I was just about to call you.

584
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,480
I saw the clarification for me

585
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,720
you posted on Weibo.

586
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,960
Thank you.

587
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,760
Well, it's not a big deal.

588
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,040
It also started because of me.

589
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,180
I want to tell you something.

590
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,180
If you're free,

591
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,410
would you like to
come to our studio and have a try?

592
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,870
Your voice is very, very good.

593
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,540
You should get more chances to tap it.

594
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,060
Really?

595
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,610
Could I come tomorrow?

596
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,690
No problem.

597
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,350
We happen to have the mission
of dubbing an anime.

598
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,170
I've left a character in this video

599
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:01,940
for you.

600
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,090
Come and have a try.

601
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,910
Don't be nervous.

602
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,070
I don't even know what to say.

603
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,070
Thank you so much, Sister Moyu.

604
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,110
Don't mention it. My pleasure.

605
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,680
In the future, you can come

606
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,690
whenever you want to.

607
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,130
You're welcome to study here at any time.

608
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:20,820
Okay.

609
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,180
It's settle then.

610
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,220
Have a good rest.

611
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,060
Okay. Sleep well.

612
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,990
Good night.

613
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,220
Okay, good night.

614
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,020
I could drive in.

615
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,890
There's still a long distance.

616
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,460
I'm good. Send Xing Zhen home.

617
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,320
I can walk home.

618
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:02,790
Bye, Ms. Tang.

619
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:04,920
Well,

620
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,850
be careful.

621
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,730
Okay, bye-bye.

622
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,730
Hello, Erduo.

623
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,640
Hello, Li.

624
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,090
Where have you been just now?

625
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,490
Why didn't you answer my phone?

626
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,470
I just got home, downstairs.

627
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,310
Are you okay?

628
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,390
I saw the clarification
posted by the program group.

629
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,120
They did it pretty fast.

630
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,020
I called them this afternoon.

631
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,010
Thank you.

632
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,100
Come on. You're my friend.

633
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,810
But, Erduo.

634
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,970
The matter may not quiet down so soon.

635
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,490
If you read malicious comments online,

636
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,160
just ignore them, okay?

637
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,450
I will.

638
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,300
I've noticed some are still insulting me

639
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,860
under the clarification post.

640
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,370
But I've encountered so many tempests.

641
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,600
This little storm

642
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,490
can't harm me at all.

643
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,790
Do you enjoy pain?

644
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,240
Actually, I feel

645
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,040
I'm really a little masochistic.

646
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,220
The more bad comments I read,

647
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,150
the more fun I feel.

648
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,880
Listen to this one.

649
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,430
Someone says,

650
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,090
"You're a grown woman. Be smart.

651
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,180
Don't you know your weight in this circle?"

652
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,270
I'm a fat girl. Of course I know my weight.

653
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,400
Isn't that funny?

654
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,510
I can't get what's so funny about it.

655
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,100
But after this incident,

656
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,530
the topic of our program has also gone viral.

657
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,140
Really?

658
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:32,270
So am I gaining popularity
because I'm disliked?

659
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,170
What happened?

660
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,610
What's wrong?

661
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,990
Nothing. I dropped my phone on my chin.

662
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,560
Ms. Bei, why are you in such a hurry?

663
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,570
I have an appointment with Sister Moyu.

664
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,560
A dubbing job.

665
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,690
But I didn't expect a class delay.

666
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,160
I'm gonna be late.

667
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,680
I'll send you there.

668
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,170
Go.

669
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,670
Thank you.

670
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,610
Miss Bei.

671
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,840
Miss Bei, why are you also here?

672
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,560
To meet our boss?

673
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,300
I have a dubbing job upstairs.

674
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,240
I've got to go.

675
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,940
I'll go first.

676
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,900
Let's go home tonight.
