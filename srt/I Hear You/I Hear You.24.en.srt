00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,460
[Episode 24]

3
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,490
Hello.

4
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,120
Erduo.

5
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,230
Long time no see.

6
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:15,960
Li.

7
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,110
Long time no see.

8
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,040
I miss you so much.

9
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,650
Your honeymoon must have been very sweet.

10
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,450
You look much better now.

11
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,640
It was indeed sweet.
Would you like to experience it?

12
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,040
What?

13
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,510
Mars, leave them alone for a talk.

14
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,240
Let's get in.

15
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,860
Okay.

16
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,220
Erduo, shall we go take a walk?

17
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,890
All right.

18
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,420
Go.

19
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,150
Be seated, there.

20
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,190
But why?

21
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,720
Sit.

22
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,300
Just sit down.

23
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,580
What are you asking for?

24
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,900
Present.

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,130
What present?

26
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,660
Come on.

27
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,220
I knew what you expected.

28
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,160
Looks like you had a smooth visit
to his parents.

29
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,780
What are his parents like?

30
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,550
- His father...
- Did you visit the churches in Italy?

31
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,550
Spaghetti in Italy is said to be delicious.

32
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,380
And chocolate in Italy...

33
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,250
Stop, stop.

34
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,000
How can I answer so many questions at a time?

35
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,040
Look at you.

36
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,260
You're all smiles.

37
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,910
I'm afraid you're too happy to remember me.

38
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,570
To be honest,

39
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,860
if I hadn't seen this present,

40
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,720
I would have forgotten you.

41
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,340
I knew it.

42
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,390
I knew it.

43
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,960
When you met Mars,

44
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,280
I predicted how we would end up.

45
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,320
Come on.

46
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,260
Tell me the truth.

47
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,730
Are you going to settle in Italy?

48
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,510
We talked about this.

49
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,040
His parents indeed want us
to settle in Italy.

50
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,970
I realize that Italians have

51
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,010
similar traditional Chinese concepts.

52
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,780
They want to live with their family.

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,980
If I want to see you,

54
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,820
do I have to go to Italy?

55
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,730
I won't leave so soon.

56
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,220
I need to do the handover work for a while.

57
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,020
Don't worry.

58
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,960
Is it just like the saying
in How the Steel Was Tempered

59
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,190
that we get nothing unless we sacrifice?

60
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,570
Why are you so pessimistic?

61
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,140
It's not like you, Erduo.

62
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,300
You know what?

63
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,030
I passed the interview
of the Japanese school.

64
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,080
It's good news.

65
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
You've been expecting it, haven't you?

66
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,710
Congratulations.

67
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,710
What's wrong?

68
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,360
Is it about money?

69
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,650
If it is...

70
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,200
No.

71
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,640
Money isn't a big problem.

72
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,030
I have the scholarship.

73
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,260
I can also work in Japan for living expenses.

74
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,420
It's about Ye Shuwei.

75
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,700
What's wrong with Ye Shuwei?

76
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,580
When I entered the studio,
I saw your shiny ring.

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,730
Congratulations.

78
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,300
But look what you've done.

79
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,170
You didn't tell me

80
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,720
such an important thing in advance.

81
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,310
Right?

82
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,550
What's wrong?

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,550
Is there any problem with you?

84
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,580
It's my problem.

85
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,010
He's a good man. Very good.

86
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,380
He's so nice to me...

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,860
He's so nice to me

88
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,560
that sometimes I don't know what to do.

89
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,940
But it's the first love for him and me.

90
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,310
He always accommodates himself to me.

91
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,880
Sometimes, I can't help wondering

92
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,270
if I'm so selfish

93
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,150
that I ignore him.

94
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,870
For me,

95
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,530
he didn't even consider working in Italy.

96
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,610
He offered to go to Japan with me.

97
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,270
But...

98
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,210
But I really don't want him

99
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,780
to give up his hard-earn dream

100
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,240
just for me.

101
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,710
Does he know what you're thinking?

102
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,560
I don't know how to tell him about that.

103
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,270
Talk with him.

104
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,650
Don't try to sidestep.

105
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,220
It's a problem between you two, anyway.

106
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,370
Don't worry. You still have me.

107
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,780
I want to

108
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,390
share a song with you.

109
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,420
What song is it?

110
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,760
Its name is

111
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,800
I Hear You.

112
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,530
I Hear You.

113
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,890
It's a beautiful song.

114
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,790

Shuwei,

141
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,040
I've been trying

142
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,420
to have a talk with you.

143
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,580
What do you want to talk about?

144
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,440
What a serious question!

145
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,940
I've been thinking a lot lately.

146
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,330
Since I met you,

147
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,930
I've been grateful to fate

148
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,920
for letting you come into my life

149
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,130
and giving me countless memories.

150
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,630
These are also the most glorious days for me.

151
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,550
I've been feeling happy after making efforts.

152
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,150
I've also enjoyed the love between us.

153
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,440
So,

154
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,550
when I'm alone,

155
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,600
I often wonder

156
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,710
if it's just a dream.

157
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,390
Because it's too beautiful to be true.

158
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,870
Don't be silly.

159
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,540
Believe it or not,

160
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,000
everything is true.

161
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,390
And it's beautiful.

162
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,930
You know my mother.

163
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,980
I told you

164
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,230
about bits and pieces

165
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,210
of my life.

166
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,320
I used to think

167
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,680
that my mother had a hard time

168
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,230
bringing me up alone.

169
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,370
Her relationship with my father

170
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,150
always made her depressed.

171
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,580
So, most of the time, I wanted

172
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,340
to behave as she asked me

173
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,350
so that she would be happy.

174
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,250
Then, as she wanted,

175
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,690
I went to a high school near my home.

176
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,980
As she wanted,

177
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,940
I majored in Preschool Education
which is suitable for girls.

178
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,290
As she wanted,

179
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,730
I worked as a kindergarten teacher
in a first-class downtown.

180
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,300
As she wanted,

181
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,040
I had blind dates with men she picked for me.

182
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,260
Everything looked like

183
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,500
deceitful prosperity.

184
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,550
In such a life,

185
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,800
I began to lose myself.

186
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,450
So,

187
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,960
I made the most important decision
in my life.

188
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,180
I quit my job in the kindergarten.

189
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,080
I learned Japanese and practiced dubbing.

190
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,570
I'm working everywhere to collect money

191
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,940
so that I can study
in a Japanese dubbing school.

192
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,280
Every time someone discourages me

193
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,350
or questions me

194
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,580
and every time my mother
doesn't understand me,

195
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,260
I tell myself,

196
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,000
“Bei Erduo,

197
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,060
you will be the best voice actress.”

198
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,950
I know

199
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,140
I may not succeed even if I work hard.

200
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,130
But if I don't work hard,
I won't ever succeed.

201
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,530
It's an opportunity

202
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,160
I got from my efforts over the past 22 years.

203
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,380
So, I must keep working hard and struggling

204
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,120
for the life I want.

205
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Gradually,

206
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,300
life has been changing

207
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,410
in the way I want.

208
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,180
But you...

209
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,890
You're an unexpected gift for me.

210
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,860
I don't know whether it's a blessing

211
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,700
or a test.

212
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,160
But when I'm in love with you,

213
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,500
I'm indeed happy.

214
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,720
I tell myself to cherish the love between us.

215
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,260
But as the school day is drawing nearer,

216
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,030
I begin to worry more.

217
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,100
I want to realize my dream and do what I want

218
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,450
through my own efforts.

219
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,300
So, I can't give up studying in Japan.

220
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,900
But I don't want you

221
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,190
to give up your dream,

222
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,100
keep compromising

223
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,040
or behave unlike yourself

224
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,960
just for my dream.

225
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,890
Otherwise, you would be like the old me.

226
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,100
Shuwei,

227
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,980
do you remember what Lin Qingzhuo said?

228
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,190
She said, we don't belong to the same world.

229
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,620
Back then, I found it offensive.

230
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,010
Now, I think she's right.

231
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,780
We indeed don't belong to the same world.

232
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,340
We're curious about each other's world.

233
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,570
But real life is filled with daily necessities.

234
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,310
We can't only live upon curiosity.

235
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,320
Shuwei,

236
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,180
I can't give up my hard-worn dream

237
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,660
for such a relationship.

238
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,360
I also don't want you

239
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,950
to give up your dream

240
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,040
for the defense of our love.

241
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,440
I know.

242
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,600
If you keep the ring,

243
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,720
you will make stupid conjectures.

244
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,380
Did I stress you out?

245
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,040
I'll keep it for you now.

246
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,420
Go to school without concern.

247
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,600
Shuwei has always been free.

248
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,850
I never restrict what he wants to do.

249
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,480
For you, he even wants
to move his studio to Japan.

250
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,720
How can you still say he's free?

251
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,790
Is this what he told you?

252
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,830
It's indeed what he told me

253
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,020
when he turned me down.

254
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,240
Meteor showers belong to everyone.

255
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,220
But the firework belongs only
to both of us.

256
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,390
Also, this one

257
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,930
belongs to you.

258
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:00,820
Hello.

259
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,200
Bei Erduo,

260
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,540
how can you be so selfish?

261
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,340
Just because of you,

262
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,450
everyone in the studio is suffering.

263
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,420
Who's that speaking?

264
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,420
This is Huo Xiaotong,
Gao Xianyin's girlfriend.

265
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,160
Don't tell me you don't know me.

266
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,620
I know you.

267
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,200
But I don't know what you're talking about.

268
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,380
Knock it off.

269
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,870
Didn't you ask to go to Japan?

270
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,380
Didn't you ask Mr. Ye

271
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,630
to go with you?

272
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,630
Xianyin and his colleagues

273
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,570
even rejected such a big order of violins

274
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,420
from Wiener Philharmoniker.

275
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,660
They rejected it, you know?

276
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,140
It's an order that other studios
aren't able to get.

277
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,090
Do you have any idea

278
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,150
what a big influence it has
on Xianyin and Mr. Ye's studio?

279
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,210
Have you thought about

280
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,220
how many people are disturbed?

281
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,620
Now, Mr. Ye yearns to go to Japan with you

282
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,040
and he even abandoned

283
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,900
such a big order.

284
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,980
He's ignoring the studio without hesitation.

285
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,080
Do you have a dream alone?

286
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,050
Do others have to be sacrificed for you?

287
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,070
Hello.

288
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,610
Say something.

289
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,710
Why are you silent?

290
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,730
Huo Xiaotong, you know what?

291
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,390
What you just said will not happen.

292
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,870
I'll hang up.

293
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,710
Two bottles of chili sauce.

294
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,440
Mustard tuber, one, two, three, four, five,

295
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,110
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

296
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,350
Five bags of hotpot condiment.

297
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,240
Are they enough?

298
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,260
Mom,

299
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,050
what are you packing for me?

300
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,010
I'm going for education, not for refuge.

301
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,080
When you pack so many things,

302
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,600
my luggage will be overweight.

303
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,860
It'll be overweight.

304
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,430
It won't be! Put them down.

305
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,680
You have no idea.

306
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,620
Look at the spicy food.

307
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,230
It'll work up an appetite.

308
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,480
Then you will eat more.

309
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,680
When you're aboard, you'll be homesick.

310
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,480
You have to eat enough food
to stop being homesick.

311
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,240
Come on, you're so ignorant.

312
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,720
How can I not worry about you?

313
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,180
Don't put it here.

314
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,120
Here are ham sausages.

315
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,020
There are supposed to be
a lot of ham sausages.

316
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,300
Why are there only a few left?

317
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,850
What?

318
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,680
Mom,

319
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,450
when I'm away,

320
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,720
take good care of yourself.

321
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,620
Be healthy.

322
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,620
I'll often have a video chat with you.

323
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,130
Remember to answer the call.

324
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,500
Got it.

325
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,160
When you arrive,

326
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,560
call me as soon as you get off the plane.

327
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,280
Don't skimp on money when you're abroad.

328
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,310
Buy anything you want to eat.

329
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,760
If you're aggrieved,

330
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,510
feel free to call me.

331
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,680
My phone will be on around the clock.

332
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,650
If you're too homesick,

333
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,620
come back.

334
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,970
I'll make delicious dishes for you.

335
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,680
Leave them there.

336
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,480
All right. Get packed quickly.

337
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,390
Then go to bed early.

338
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,490
Okay.

339
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,690
By the way, Ye Shuwei will
pick you up tomorrow, right?

340
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,410
Yes. We'll go together.

341
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,740

on the successful conclusion
of your concert tour.

511
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,420
You had a long tour.

512
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,840
No.

513
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,160
I was just doing something I like.

514
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,790
This time, I'm back in China
to complete my concert tour

515
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,900
and to check on your studio.

516
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,240
In a couple of weeks, I'm going to Vienna.

517
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,710
With my father.

518
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,940
By the way,

519
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,300
here's the violin.

520
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,930
I'm giving it back to you.

521
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,560
It's a very good violin.

522
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:09,880
However,

523
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,850
it doesn't fit me.

524
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,680
Perilla beef.

525
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,700
Pickled eggplant.

526
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,930
Sweet radish.

527
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,880
Enjoy your meal, please.

528
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,590
Thank you.

529
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,830
What time will you get off work?

530
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,530
Our restaurant closes at ten p.m.

531
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:46,940
I see. Thank you.

532
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,480
Enjoy your meal, please.

533
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:12,970
Excuse me.

534
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,790
Hello, sir.

535
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,380
May I take a rest here?

536
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,100
Yes, of course.

537
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,800
Thank you.

538
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,340
Be seated, please.

539
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,080
Enjoy yourself.

540
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,540
Have something to drink.

541
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,450
You get it wrong.

542
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,580
I haven't ordered anything to drink.

543
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,110
You're the 100th customer

544
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,060
who has come to our restaurant today.

545
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,800
This is for free.

546
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,590
Oh, I see. Thank you.

547
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

548
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,250
Why are you still here?

549
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,300
I'm waiting for you.

550
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,290
For me?

551
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,340
This Saturday night and Sunday night,

552
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,500
I have two shows in the pub.

553
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,490
I want to invite you there.

554
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,340
Sorry, but I have classes on Saturday.

555
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,230
It's okay. Maybe some other time.

556
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,120
I'll take my leave, then.

557
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,080
Erduo,

558
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,300
no offense,

559
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,230
but may I ask

560
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,170
if you stay in Japan alone?

561
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,200
I have a boyfriend.

562
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,760
Is he a violinist?

563
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,980
He's a violin maker.

564
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,240
Didn't he

565
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,380
come to Japan with you?

566
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,170
What happened between you?

567
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:36,170
We've been in love.

568
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,510
I just don't want him

569
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,680
to give up his dream

570
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:43,800
just for my dream.

571
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,580
That's it.

572
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,000
You're my dream.

573
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,020
What are you doing here?

574
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:13,440
We have

575
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,100
