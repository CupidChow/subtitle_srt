00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:07,860
[I Hear You]

2
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,460
[Episode 17]

3
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,500
What is your answer?

4
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,700
I… I don't know.

5
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,800
Thank you for your answer.

6
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,520
I get it.

7
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,450
Movements, including tone and looks.

8
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,600
What else do you think needs to be added?

9
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,800
His expressions can be emphasized, too.

10
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,230
But I think…

11
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,480
The later part, with others…

12
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,880
Right?

13
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,250
And a series of reactions followed.

14
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,490
Erduo,

15
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,370
we're gonna record for the next scene later.

16
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:15,960
Is there any problem?

17
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,920
Mr. Xu,

18
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,060
I think there's something wrong
with the script

19
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,800
and I thought I'd better discuss it with you.

20
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,540
Let me see.

21
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,720
Have a seat.

22
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,460
Is there any misprint?

23
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,450
No.

24
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,000
It's about the parting in the last paragraph.

25
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,510
I just think the lines are a bit abrupt.

26
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,670
Let me show you. It's here.

27
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,470
The lover is leaving

28
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,330
and I should speak in a choked voice.

29
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,240
But this is the case of

30
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,340
violent mood swings.

31
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,750
It obviously doesn't make sense

32
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,320
to frequently speak

33
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,400
so many sentimental lines.

34
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,440
And it's foreshadowed a lot.

35
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,510
The audiences also know

36
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,010
that they have deep feelings for each other.

37
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,170
Mr. Xu, I have an idea.

38
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,820
We can make a little change here.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,850
We can simplify this part of lines

40
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,400
and then lay emphasis on "don't go",

41
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,130
which shows the restrained but sad mood.

42
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,370
What do you think?

43
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,690
Erduo, what you said makes sense.

44
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,550
But script creation is a scriptwriter's job.

45
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,730
We can't change it at will.

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,070
Besides,

47
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,320
it may involve lip-syncing.

48
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,450
Mr. Xu, what about this?

49
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,290
I can give it a try.

50
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,170
If you are not satisfied with the result,

51
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,730
we could still use the original script.

52
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,730
You can't practice during working hours.

53
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,870
If everyone

54
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,000
raised a question of this or that kind,

55
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,370
how could we move forward?

56
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,520
But Mr. Xu…

57
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,290
No more "buts".

58
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,530
That's it.

59
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,760
What's going on?

60
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,410
Wearing a woebegone look,

61
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,380
like you're punishing yourself.

62
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,890
Nothing.

63
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,620
Something is surely going on.

64
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,050
You make me more curious about it.

65
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,150
Come on, what is it?

66
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,200
Nothing special.

67
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,870
Today,

68
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,650
I raised some questions

69
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,090
to the recording director.

70
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,440
He agreed with what I said

71
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,430
but didn't take it.

72
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,860
So, did you argue with him?

73
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,600
Of course no.

74
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,870
But I had to use the original script.

75
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,480
That's not so bad.

76
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,440
How was the result?

77
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,350
Well,

78
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,470
I don't know how to say.

79
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,160
I just feel a little sad.

80
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,130
Actually,

81
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,270
I can understand the recording director.

82
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,890
You know it.

83
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,820
There is a cost to record in a studio,

84
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,010
in both time and money.

85
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,010
If others' time is delayed

86
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,580
for just one person,

87
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,160
he must take the responsibility.

88
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,160
In other words,

89
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,130
everyone has a different position.

90
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,580
You take it so seriously

91
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,190
because you see dubbing as your dream.

92
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,180
So, you want to do it perfectly.

93
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,430
But for the recording director,

94
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,830
it's only a job.

95
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,040
He only needs to finish the job.

96
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,040
He really doesn't have to waste his time

97
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,980
or take risks for you.

98
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,640
In life, there are many people like him.

99
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,160
Then is that a good thing?

100
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,580
People like you are so valuable

101
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,320
just because there are few like you.

102
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,040
Do you understand?

103
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,480
Are you complimenting me?

104
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,220
In short,

105
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,220
staying enthusiastic for your dream

106
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,010
is a worthwhile thing.

107
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,010
It's really good.

108
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,920
But you need to get the balance right.

109
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,080
Do you know that?

110
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,840
Hum.

111
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:09,950
I get it.

112
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,080
China and Japan will co-produce
an anime film called

113
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,390
New Journey to The West.

114
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,540
In a few days,

115
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,840
there'll be an interview opportunity
for Chinese dubbers.

116
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,430
This is a high-budget anime film.

117
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,110
The interview is targeting

118
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,110
all dubbers nationwide.

119
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,960
Anyone interested

120
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,110
may give me your personal profile.

121
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,740
Don't give up the chance for the thought that

122
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,410
you won't be selected for a main character.

123
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,940
This kind of multi-party cooperation

124
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,610
is a good learning opportunity.

125
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,510
Anyone interested

126
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,130
give me your profile tomorrow.

127
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,710
That's all.

128
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,960
New Journey to the West.

129
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,480
One more work without new contents.

130
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,900
China's great classical novels known in Japan

131
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,910
are Romance of the Three Kingdoms
and Journey to the West.

132
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,910
About Romance of the Three Kingdoms,

133
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,630
we know lots of anime and games.

134
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,920
Japanese manga artist Akira Toriyama

135
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,220
created his milestone manga Dragon Ball

136
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,270
based on Journey to the West.

137
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,430
But I think it's better to choose

138
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,140
Journey to the West just in case.

139
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,670
After all, there are eighty-one difficulties

140
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,710
and each can be written into a book.

141
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,370
I'm kind of looking forward to this version.

142
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,210
Moyu,

143
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,820
I remember

144
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,610
you cooperated with some Japanese before.

145
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,660
- Maybe
- Yeah.

146
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,950
you could tell us about your experience.

147
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,730
Yeah, yeah. I want to hear it, too.

148
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,400
Okay then, let me tell you about it.

149
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,380
Your son and daughter-in-law

150
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,100
come here every day.

151
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,650
They took care of you and never complained.

152
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,010
You'll be living in ease and comfort.

153
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,420
You just take a good care of yourself.

154
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,960
It won't be long

155
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,520
before you could have grandchildren.

156
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,980
Thank you for your blessings.

157
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,820
Thank you. Thank you for your blessings.

158
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,450
You, too. You, too.

159
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,050
Thank you. Come in.

160
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,120
Aunt.

161
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,640
Yeah.

162
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,570
I just completed the discharge formalities.

163
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,280
We can go now.

164
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,140
Okay, okay.

165
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,990
Then I'm leaving.

166
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,320
Wish you an early recovery.

167
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,630
Your son-in-law is so filial and capable.

168
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,750
Oh, no.

169
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,030
He is not my son-in-law.

170
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,260
He is my daughter's friend,

171
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,200
just a friend.

172
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:17,960
Okay.

173
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,120
It's okay. I can do this.

174
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,030
I can do this. Okay.

175
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,510
Just check if we've taken all my belongings.

176
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:27,910
Okay.

177
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,920
Then I'm leaving.

178
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,140
Bye-bye.

179
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,810
Take care. Take care.

180
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,060
Well, Ye.

181
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,860
Thank you.

182
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,920
I'm a bit in a rush to get discharged.

183
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,300
Erduo supposed to pick me up.

184
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,740
But she has something urgent to do.

185
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,080
I have to trouble you again.

186
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,950
I'm sorry for this.

187
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,440
Aunt, never mind.

188
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,400
It's inconvenient for you to live alone
with your ankle injured.

189
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,400
You shouldn't be in such a hurry
to get discharged.

190
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,710
I'm actually all right now.

191
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,490
You also know my daughter is filial.

192
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,590
But you know what?

193
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,330
I saw the hospitalization bill.

194
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,900
My God. It's too much.

195
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,020
I can't spend my daughter's money anymore.

196
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,950
Besides, I had a full checkup.

197
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,120
And my ankle injury is not a big deal.

198
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,520
I can recover at home.

199
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,110
I can play mahjong and drink tea

200
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,390
with my friends at home.

201
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,580
I'll recovery soon.

202
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,400
But thank you anyway.

203
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,600
Thank you for sending me home.

204
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,690
It's okay. I can do this.

205
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,930
Aunt, having a good health is most important.

206
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,600
I'm okay. Thank you.

207
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,190
Be careful.

208
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,640
Okay. Put this in first.

209
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,570
Okay.

210
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,910
Okay, thank you.

211
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,900
I can do this. Thank you.

212
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,720
Oh, Aunt,

213
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,110
I forgot to tell you.

214
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,280
Erduo thought that your ankle is injured

215
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,860
so it's inconvenient for you to live alone.

216
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,440
When you get home,

217
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,200
there must be many neighbors to visit you.

218
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,870
That may bother your rest.

219
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,800
It's better to stay at my place now.

220
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,940
Stay at your place?

221
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Staying at my place

222
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,450
is easy for her to go to class and work.

223
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,130
We'll send you home when you get better.

224
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,340
Is this Erduo's decision?

225
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,770
Yes.

226
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,590
Why didn't she tell me that?

227
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,110
Besides, Carpenter…

228
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,730
Oh, no. Ye,

229
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,290
is you place big enough?

230
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,090
Yes.

231
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,600
You can rest assured.

232
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,690
We will send you back home

233
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,970
anytime you want to.

234
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,450
Ah.

235
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,190
Hi, hi.

236
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,540
Come on.

237
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,090
Aunt, be careful.

238
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,620
My God.

239
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,730
It's inconvenient

240
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,650
to live with your parents.

241
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,620
I'd better go home.

242
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,000
Aunt, don't worry.

243
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,700
My parents are not living here.

244
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,220
Your parents are not living here?

245
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,290
Are you living here alone?

246
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:16,840
Let's go inside.

247
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,600
Ah!

248
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,080
My God! This…

249
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,440
You house is so big.

250
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,530
My God. This…

251
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,320
Wow!

252
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,850
The floor-to-ceiling windows are so big.

253
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,800
Oh, my!

254
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,540
There is even a swimming pool outside.

255
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,760
This…

256
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,090
My God!

257
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:36,620
This…

258
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,410
Oh.

259
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,930
Take some photos.

260
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,590
Yeah.

261
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,060
It's Erduo.

262
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:01,930
Hello.

263
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,310
Hello, mom.

264
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,000
Has Shuwei sent you home?

265
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,620
You know what?

266
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,400
I'm now in the carpenter's house.

267
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,120
Ah?

268
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,500
In his house? But…

269
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,630
Wait for me there. I'll be right back.

270
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,310
Hey, the kid hung up on me.

271
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,590
I haven't finished yet.

272
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,940
What's this?

273
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,450
My God! There is such a big beer.

274
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,600
He must be a heavy drinker.

275
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,910
Mom?

276
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,970
Mom, where are you?

277
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,790
Ah?

278
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,660
Mom?

279
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,600
I'm here. I'm here.

280
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,170
I'm in the living room.

281
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,090
Where is Ye Shuwei?

282
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,570
Sit down.

283
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,530
What's wrong with you?

284
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,530
What's wrong with you?

285
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,580
Why are you beating me?

286
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,580
The carpenter…

287
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,600
Ye

288
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,380
is so rich.

289
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,940
Why didn't you tell me that?

290
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,640
Mom, where is Ye Shuwei?

291
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,340
Ye Shuwei?

292
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,810
After bringing me here,

293
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,240
he showed me around

294
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,000
and showed me here and there.

295
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,190
You know what?

296
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,840
The decoration here is really luxurious.

297
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,310
There is even a swimming pool outside.

298
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,380
It's really wasteful

299
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,990
for only you two living here.

300
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,340
If transformed into an inn,

301
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,450
it will be surely profitable than our place.

302
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,120
Mom,

303
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,960
did you see Ye Shuwei?

304
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,970
Ye Shuwei.

305
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:27,780
Oh.

306
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,750
He said he's going to work.

307
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,760
Going to work?

308
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,100
Okay then. I…

309
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,820
Erduo, the place…

310
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,800
Is the place where he makes violins
big, too?

311
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,250
I'm gonna call him first.

312
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:38,770
I'll make a call.

313
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,600
Okay, okay. Go ahead.

314
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,660
You kept this a secret form me.

315
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,660
Therefore, it's important that

316
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,910
before installing the cardboard,

317
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,740
we need to make the hole…

318
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,310
Excuse me.

319
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,380
Hello.

320
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,240
Hello.

321
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,310
Ye Shuwei. This is Erduo.

322
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,200
Thank you for picking my mom
from the hospital early this morning.

323
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,180
But why did you bring her to your place?

324
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,650
It's convenient for you to take care of her.

325
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,650
It's also good for her recovery.

326
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,740
Aren't you afraid of troubles?

327
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,230
No.

328
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,420
Only one more person in my house

329
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,120
is no trouble. You take care of her anyway.

330
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,050
Then, thank you!

331
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:31,920
Go on.

332
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:33,400
Ah?

333
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,390
Me?

334
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,370
It's you. You were the one talking.

335
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,730
Oh.

336
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,240
Yeah. Well,

337
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,290
where did I say?

338
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,720
[Erduo]
I cooked with my mom.

339
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,100
Come back for dinner.

340
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,950
Okay, I'll be back in half an hour.

341
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,890
Okay, okay.

342
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,870
Okay, come on. Dinner is ready.

343
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,770
Your favorite soup.

344
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,770
Oh, put it near you.

345
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,070
Be careful.

346
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,360
This is the spoon. Put it here.

347
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,180
Would you like the soup now?

348
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,520
Well.

349
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,420
No. You have it first.

350
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,260
Please have a seat.

351
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,270
You sit. Come on.

352
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,250
This is your house.

353
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:24,990
Sit down. Sit down.

354
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,390
All right, let's eat.

355
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,820
Come on. Try this one.

356
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,330
Thank you.

357
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,190
And this.

358
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,320
Mom, you just take care of yourself.

359
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,760
Don't pick up food for others.

360
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,740
We can do it ourselves.

361
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,380
You are too picky.

362
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,090
Well, it's hard to make money now.

363
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,810
It's even so tired to be a carpenter.

364
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,010
You have to work overtime, too.

365
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,530
It's really hard to make money now.

366
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,060
You are so thin.

367
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,310
Come on. Have some fish.

368
00:17:59,610 --> 00:17:59,950
Eat.

369
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,460
I told you not to pick up food for others.

370
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,080
How can you be so thoughtless?

371
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,300
During my stay at the hospital,

372
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,110
Ye took a good care of me.

373
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,850
Now he's taken me to his house for recovery.

374
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,660
I should do something for him.

375
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,170
Aunt.

376
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,480
Sure.

377
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,050
Have some. The food will get cold.

378
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,820
Okay, okay.

379
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,270
Oh, come on.

380
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,250
Thank you. Thank you.

381
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,160
Come on.

382
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,970
Bei Duofen,

383
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,960
why are you so clingy now?

384
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,100
Mom.

385
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,570
Mom. It's time for breakfast.

386
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,240
Ye Shuwei, come over.

387
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,950
Let's have breakfast.

388
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,950
Did you see my mom?

389
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,970
She went out after making the breakfast.

390
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,680
She said she would look around
and see if there is any inn around.

391
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,850
I don't know what that means.

392
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,510
Okay.

393
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,710
Don't you like these?

394
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,160
Let me get you some bread.

395
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,150
No. These are good.

396
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,150
But there is no tableware.

397
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,840
Wait a second.

398
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,320
Thanks.

399
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:08,970
Let's eat.

400
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,420
Are you free this evening?

401
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,320
This evening? I'm free this evening.

402
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,380
There's no need to go to
the recording studio.

403
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,690
And I don't need to work

404
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,860
or give a lesson.

405
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,370
I can have a good rest tonight.

406
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,740
Then I'll send you an address.

407
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,440
You meet me there at seven o'clock.

408
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,690
It's about the next episode of the show.

409
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,060
Has Mr. Yu told you the schedule
for the next episode?

410
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,580
He said we need to wear couples' dress.

411
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,570
We go buy some that are comfortable
and look not stupid.

412
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,290
Ah.

413
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,120
Ye Shuwei,

414
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,630
it's unnecessary to buy couples' dress

415
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,130
in this kind of place.

416
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,860
Couples' dress is quite simple.

417
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,230
Are you looking for

418
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,560
something like T-shirts

419
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,680
with hearts in the front?

420
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:17,980
Let's take a look.

421
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,600
What can I do for you?

422
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:28,770
Hello,

423
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,590
please find some clothes that will suit her.

424
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,060
Lovely and cute styles

425
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,380
will look good on this young lady.

426
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,270
Do you like dress or pants?

427
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,950
Both are okay.

428
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:39,620
Okay then.

429
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,840
Do I have to try all these?

430
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,580
Yeah.

431
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,700
Otherwise, how you'll know which one is good.

432
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:58,530
Go ahead.

433
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,070
Are you sure?

434
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,690
Do you want to try more?

435
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,670
No, no.

436
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,160
This is good.

437
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,740
You said you don't like blue.

438
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,350
What?

439
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,710
I said you have a good taste. It's great.

440
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,340
I appreciate it.

441
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,350
So it's time to choose for you, right?

442
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,350
What do you think?

443
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,050
Finally, it's my turn to choose.

444
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,270
You'd better prepare for it.

445
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:16,880
Let's go.

446
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,430
This is unfair.

447
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,330
Everything fits him so well.

448
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:10,950
That's it.

449
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,170
This is also good.

450
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,460
You look young in it.

451
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,540
Green?

452
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,630
It's good. Look at the green hood…

453
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,670
Well, this one…

454
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,720
Green color makes you look too young.

455
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,570
No. But yours is blue.

456
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
You should also

457
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,160
choose something blue for me.

458
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,590
You once said that

459
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,940
I looked especially like

460
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,700
an overturned paint bucket in blue.

461
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,180
If you choose blue,

462
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,460
there would be two paint buckets.

463
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,480
Well,

464
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,730
what do you think of red?

465
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,860
Red?

466
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,770
Why?

467
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,900
Haven't you heard that saying?

468
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,890
"Red and blue are a perfect couple".

469
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,770
Okay.

470
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,680
That's it.

471
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,220
I'm exhausted.

472
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,050
What was that?

473
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,280
I thought it would be something sweet

474
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,160
since we were asked to wear couples' dress.

475
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,890
It turned out to be "escape room" game.

476
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:35,910
I was freaked out.

477
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,050
But why other couples

478
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,150
didn't wear couples' dress?

479
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,560
Only we wore this way?

480
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,700
Because Yu Sheng is a liar.

481
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,540
Yeah?

482
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,960
Maybe Bei Duofen is hungry.

483
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,960
Don't you go take a look at it?

484
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,560
Bei Duofen. Are you hungry?

485
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,400
Bei Duofen.

486
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,210
Bei Duofen.

487
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,180
Erduo, I'm going home.

488
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,300
It's good here.

489
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,660
But I'm not used to living here.

490
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,770
I feel happier

491
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,020
to play mahjong and chat with my friends.

492
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,070
You are all busy

493
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,900
and unable to take a call while filming.

494
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,300
So, I didn't call you.

495
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,350
Come back home when you have time.

496
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,580
Erduo, I was against you two being together

497
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,850
because I was afraid that you'd be cheated.

498
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,510
But it seems

499
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,100
Ye is a good guy.

500
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,890
You must cherish him.

501
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,970
I hope you two get alone well

502
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,420
and live a happy life.

503
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,210
You can take him home when you're free.

504
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,900
And I'll cook for you.

505
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,120
I'll make your favorite vegetables.

506
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,190
Wait a second.

507
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,610
Wait a second.

508
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,930
Naughty kid, you scared me.

509
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:48,580
Naughty.

510
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,120
Because we haven't seen each other for long.

511
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,280
I missed you.

512
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,680
Okay, okay. I get it.

513
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,210
Li, you are so heartless.

514
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,360
You didn't even contact me.

515
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,350
Are you planning something bad?

516
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,420
Come on. Sit down.

517
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,960
Let's chat while having snacks and drinks.

518
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,790
These are all your favorites.

519
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,460
Confess.

520
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,320
I've found a new job.

521
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,850
You're so good.

522
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,930
It's nothing new for you to find a new job.

523
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,410
Tell me about it.

524
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,960
To put it simply,

525
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,540
it's also a cultural production company.

526
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,880
But in terms of the production content,

527
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,240
it's more like
people and cultural documentaries.

528
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,340
It sounds pretty good.

529
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,580
Wait a second.

530
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,000
- Ye.
- Hello, Aunt.

531
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,040
I'm here alone. I'm passing by.

532
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,490
You're alone.

533
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,540
Erduo is busy today.

534
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,140
So, we're not together.

535
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,460
Come on in.

536
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,080
Thank you.

537
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,240
Excuse me, it's a bit messy now.

538
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,960
I'm just cleaning.

539
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,490
It's okay.

540
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,970
Come on, sit down.

541
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,320
Sorry for being so messy. Sit down.

542
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,180
Sit down, please.

543
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,160
Thank you, Aunt.

544
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,180
Aunt,

545
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,010
Erduo cares much about your health.

546
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,800
She knows you won't buy these yourself.

547
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,420
And if she brings you these herself,

548
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,950
you would blame her for wasting money.

549
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,670
So, I just bring these to you.

550
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,720
I know my own daughter.

551
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,670
Actually,

552
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,010
she is very sensible and very thoughtful,

553
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,910
although sometimes a little hard-mouthed.

554
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,800
Speaking of this,

555
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,050
I think we're destined to have ties.

556
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,190
I'm now filming a documentary

557
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,710
called "a genius with violin".

558
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,780
It's the documentary about

559
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,370
an Italian violin maker.

560
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,640
He is here to attend

561
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,320
an international violin making competition.

562
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,100
By the way,

563
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,590
will Ye Shuwei

564
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,040
attend this competition?

565
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,960
If he attends it,

566
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,430
they will be competitors.

567
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,680
I never heard him talk about

568
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,230
an international violin making competition.

569
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,420
But,

570
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,720
I actually know little about his job.

571
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,260
Then Bei Erduo,

572
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,980
tell me

573
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,520
what happened

574
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,190
when I didn't keep an eye on you?

575
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,350
What could happen?

576
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,880
I have to work after recording.

577
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,790
And I have to attend the show.

578
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,090
I have a lot of things to do. I'm very busy.

579
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,820
- What could happen?
- Yeah?

580
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,360
Bei Erduo,

581
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,230
I can see the slightest change in you,

582
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,280
if have.

583
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,160
Don't lie to me.

584
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,160
I actually feel relieved that

585
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,550
you two are dating right now.

586
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,620
I think

587
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,090
you know how to take care of people

588
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,470
and will not let her suffer.

589
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,690
Also, I think

590
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,600
you are very capable.

591
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,110
You will surely

592
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,840
support her to do what she likes to do.

593
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:08,930
Aunt,

594
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,820
I get it.

595
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,070
I will never let her suffer

596
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,610
and I will respect her choice.

597
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,300
I just knew you're such a person.

598
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,330
I like to talk with you.

599
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:23,110
It's called "barrier-free communication".

600
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,210
You just get it so easily.

601
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,360
Talking with you,

602
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,820
I forgot to get you some fruits.

603
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,700
Aunt, don't bother.

604
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,400
No bother.

605
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,390
- Right away.
- Never mind.

606
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,060
Just one minute.

607
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,850
- Aunt.
- Just one minute.

608
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,430
Come on. Tell me.

609
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,120
You've become so tough.

610
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,280
Okay.

611
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,050
Then I could

612
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,790
ask Ye Shuwei directly about it.

613
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,840
You can't do it.

614
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,480
What?

615
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,320
Come on, Li.

616
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,310
Since when have you become keen to gossip?

617
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,010
Since when?

618
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:53,870
You guess.

619
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,500
Tell me how is your relationship going?

620
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,030
Aunt,

621
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,800
you don't need to prepare the fruits.

622
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,720
I still have something to do. I have to go.

623
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,590
You can't go.

624
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,260
I also want you to call Erduo

625
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,700
and ask her back for dinner.

626
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,510
Really, don't bother.

627
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,910
Never mind.

628
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,340
This orange is very sweet.

629
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:21,930
Just one minute.

630
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,450
I'll also cut one pear for you.

631
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:33,740
Aunt,

632
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,950
this chopping board…

633
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,260
About the chopping board,

634
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,300
I bought it many years ago.

635
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,170
I don't remember where I bought it.

636
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,360
Look, it's cracked on this side.

637
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,990
Can I talk a look at it?

638
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,170
You want to look at the chopping board?

639
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,250
Okay.

640
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,500
Wait a second. Let me clean it first.

641
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,490
Thank you.

642
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,390
What's so special about a chopping board?

643
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,280
Aunt,

644
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,750
this is a piece of first-class wood.

645
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,930
It's a bit pity to use it
as a chopping board.

646
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,450
First-class wood?

647
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,880
Let me take a look.

648
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,750
Is it an antique?

649
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,440
Ye, you check it for me.

650
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,280
If it's an antique,

651
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,640
I would sell it.

652
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,970
We just need money now.

653
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,520
Aunt, it's not an antique.

654
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,680
But it's indeed a good piece of wood.

655
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,120
I've been collecting wood lately.

656
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,890
I want to make a special violin.

657
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,410
This is not big

658
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,180
and there are scratches all over it,

659
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,780
but it's still useful.

660
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,620
Then, how much is it worth?

661
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:50,970
Aunt,

662
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,100
can you sell it to me?

663
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,630
Sell it to you?

664
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,420
Okay, okay, okay.

665
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,780
Let me wash it for you.

666
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,840
Okay, thank you, Aunt.

667
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,690
Sit down.

668
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,530
Let me wrap it up.

669
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,790
Okay. Let me hold it.

670
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,470
Where are my newspapers?

671
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,400
Let me find some newspapers.

672
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,530
Come on.

673
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,110
This is easy for you to carry.

674
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,910
Here you are.

675
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,320
This is easy to carry.

676
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,290
Yes, this is easy to carry.

677
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,420
Aunt, can you give me your card number?

678
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,330
I'll transfer the money to you later.

679
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,060
Okay, okay.

680
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:35,650
Here you are.

681
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:36,840
This is my card.

682
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,300
Let me take a picture of it.

683
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,120
Take a picture.

684
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,490
Okay.

685
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:42,610
Aunt,

686
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,490
I got to go.

687
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,110
I'll transfer the money to you later.

688
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,640

703

I passed by your house today

and went over to visit Aunt.

705
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,520
She said you're used to this chopping board.

706
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,990
So, I brought it here.

707

You're not used to mine anyway.

in the WeChat group,

725

the script for our canvassing promo is set.

727
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,450
Do you know what it is?

728
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,880
It's the ancient costume theme

729
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,160
I've never worn an ancient costume.

730

Me neither.

731
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,240
I still remember when I was little,

732
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,360
I used to put a sheet on my head

733
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,520
as an ancient costume.

734
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,060
So,

735

every girl

has a dream about ancient costume.

737
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,390
You must be looking good in ancient costume.

738
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,310
It must be

739
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,090
the feeling of a high-spirited young man.

740
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,500
Yu Sheng told me

741
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,930
the canvassing this time

742
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,350
is crucial for improving the popularity.

743
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,580
So, we must be well-prepared for it.

744

Thank me?

Then,

748
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,710
you should express your thanks, right?

749
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,410
I think the best way to express it

750
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,340
is to do a good job in filming for the promo

751

752
