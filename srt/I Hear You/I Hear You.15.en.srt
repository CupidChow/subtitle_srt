That's all

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,300
for today's meeting.

The successful investment
in the second season

relies on you

10
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,590
to have found a partner more reliable
than Mr. Zhang.

11
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,590
My friend said

12
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,940
he wants to recommend a new project.

13
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,270
So I just tried.

14
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,690
I didn't expect it to work.

15
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,770
The bonus setting is the biggest highlight.

16
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,410
Since network voting accounts for 30%,

17
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,100
it would be popular on the Internet.

18

21
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,530
I have been thinking about plans
these days.

22
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,710
I hope that

23
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,860
it can be amazing.

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,760
Work hard.

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,600
Thank you.

26
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,080
By the way,

27
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,020
do I need to invite

28
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,970
the popular couple Ye and Bei to rejoin us?

29
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,340
Li used to be responsible for this

30
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,330
so she must be more familiar with it.

31
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,370
But she seems to be on leave these days.

32
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,540
Well…

33
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,540
I will call her later.

34
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,620
Leave it to me.

35
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,010
Okay.

36
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,590
Come on.

37
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,350
Wait for me.

38

You can't chase me.

39
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,810
What a beautiful sea.

The sea is so beautiful.

No end in sight.

43
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,710
Nice and unforgettable.

44
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,080
Why did you ask me to cycle today?

45
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,110
Do you have anything on your mind?

46

A big one.

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,910

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,150
And I hope that spring blossoms.

Some time ago

50
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,060
I went to Tokyo Sensoji Temple

51
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,500
to pray and draw divination sticks.

52
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,500
And it turned out to be highly
auspicious the first time.

53
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,050
The reader told me that

54
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,790
there should not be
fear of failure or results

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,150
but look up for the goal to advance.

57
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,850
That way, I can get truth.

58
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,470
If I keep the way with sincerity,

59
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,150
I will achieve happiness.

60
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,260
Now I want to give the good luck to you.

Bei Erduo, I like you.

62
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,720
After getting along,
I was gradually attracted to you.

63
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,460
Now that

You are good.

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,760
It's just I have always regarded you

as a good friend.

76
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,460
Did I receive a nice guy card?

77
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,550
No.

78
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,120
I really regard you

Since you officially confessed to me,

I officially respond to you.

Then can we still be friends?

84
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,130
Don't you mind?

85
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,260
Nothing to mind.

Should I tell you ruthlessly that

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,210
you will regret it,

89
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,680
and then break with you?

90
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,120
Maybe I would really regret it.

91
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Bear it in mind.

92
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,470
In order to comfort me,

93
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,230
you have to cycle with me one more round.

Li.

102
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,340
We attracted investment
for the second season.

I need your help.

104

Call me back.

107
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,400
Hello, Li.

108
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,610
Where have you been?

109
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,320
Why is your phone off?

110
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,930
Are you okay?

111
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,660
I don't want to use my mobile phone
during annual leave.

112
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,060
What did you just say in WeChat

113
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,410
about the second season?

114
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,740
Could Erduo continue to participate?

115
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,950
Yes, we found a new sponsor,

116
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,190
and there will be a bonus.

117
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,400
So we can keep working on
our own program?

118
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,740
But you need to talk to Erduo.

119
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,870
After all, she left the show in last season
without an explanation.

120
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,880
I am embarrassed to talk about it
with her.

121
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,390
So…

122
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,050
OK, I will go directly to her tomorrow.

123
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,290
Leave her to me.

124
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,220
What about Ye Shuwei?

125
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,370
I called him a few days ago.

126
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,770
And then?

127
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,650
He said we could talk about it later.

128
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,480
What does he mean?

129
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,610
Don't worry.

130
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,730
I will get him by all manner of means.

131
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,920
However, when you talk to Erduo,

132
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,310
remember to tell her that
if she agrees to participate,

133
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,200
she has to continue to stay with Ye Shuwei.

134
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,650
Okay, that's it.

135
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,180

136
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:16,820
What?

137
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,070
In addition to work,

138
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,720
can't we talk about anything else?

139
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,170
All right, let's talk about something else.

140
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,000
Boss Yu, could you check it for me?

141
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,620
Hold on.

142
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,440
I will come to your office later.

143
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,440
Li, what did you say?

144
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,680
Li.

145
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,510
Only six o'clock. Who's that?

146
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,090
Aren't you on vacation?

147
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,830
Why did you come to me
early in the morning?

148
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,190
Every time you smile like that,

149
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,910
it's nothing good.

150
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,910
Well.

151
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,500
How come, Erduo?

152
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,000
Take some water.

153
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,840
I treat you so well.

154
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,940
Why are you like this?

155
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,760
Let me ask you.

156
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,570
Is your home in debt?

157
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,560
I just told you.

158
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,170
Is your fund for overseas study gone?

159
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,290
Do you want to

160
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,720
pay off all debts and save fund
for overseas study?

161
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,390
Of course I do.

162
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,040
Are you now getting used

163
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,560
to attending the show?

164
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,680
And you don't

165
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,550
hate Ye Shuwei that much,

166
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,250
even kind of like him?

167
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,220
Just tell me if you want to make money.

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,340
Do you want to win a prize

169
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,360
with Ye Shuwei on the show?

170
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,150
Win a prize on the show?

171
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:43,970
Bingo.

172
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,730
The second season of LOVING
is officially launched.

173
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,520
Several groups of couples will
compete for the award.

174
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,400
The popular couple Ye and Bei
will be back.

175
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,730
The bonus is said to be 500,000.

176
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,150
With the popularity of you two,

177
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,730
Ye Shuwei's omnipotency,
and your flexibility,

178
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,320
you will be able to go to the final.

179
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,770
500,000?

180
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,660
500,000.

181
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,680
But…

182
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,750
Save it.

183
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,880
Look at your current situation.

184
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,410
You work in breakfast shop and café,

185
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,540
as well as

186
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,130
dubbing work,
and make up lesson for that boy.

187
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,020
Why do you work so hard?

188
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,030
Just for your family

189
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,950
and your dream!

190
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,470
Right?

191
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,580
So

192
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,660
a good chance is right in front of you.

193
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
You are the most likely to win.

194
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,790
Think about it again.

195
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,770
I will consider it.

196
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,740
But I don't think Ye Shuwei would agree.

197
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,160
You'd better ask Mr. Yu to
ask his opinion.

198
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,830
I don't want to force others for myself.

199
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,810
Okay, you are so kind.

200
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,450
We will have a discuss with Guru Ye.

201
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:13,860
All right.

202
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,980
By the way,

203
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,410
if you both decide to participate
in the program,

204
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,800
I am afraid you will have to
continue to live together

205
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,980
to avoid the situation last time.

206
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,590
It's okay for me if Ye Shuwei agrees.

207
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,580
Good girl.

208
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,760
Orange for you.

209
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,210
Ye Shuwei will definitely agree.

210

[A8 Music Mansion]

211
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,320
[Erduo]
I am downstairs.

212
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,770
[Erduo]
I will be right there.

213
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,610
Here you are.

214
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,870
Mr. Xu praised me today.

215
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,640
Good, you made progress.

216
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,030
Mr. Xu said that I am getting

217
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,180
more and more accurate to emotions,

218
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,770
and that my comprehension is strong.

219
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,250
I am so happy.

220
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,100
I think this is better

221
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,880
than any reward.

222
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,060
Of course, I would also like

223
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,250
to thank you for your encouragement
last time.

224
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,120
OK, how would you thank me?

225
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,360
You need honoraria?

226
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,230
Of course.

227
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,970
You are so sincere.

228
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,880
If He Yang and others make it hard for you,

229
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,260
I would stand up for you.

230
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,680
I promise.

231
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,630
You think He Yang dares to
make it hard for me?

232
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,670
Just in case, right?

233
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,610
I will do everything for you.

234
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,840

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,040
Why did you kill yourself?

314
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,510
Exactly.

315
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,280
Sorry.

not very familiar with the rules.

Answer me.

324
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:35,060
Why didn't you check my identity just now?

325
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,590
It doesn't make sense to
check it out so early.

I am going to the toilet.

It's my friend's birthday today.

What a coincidence.

334
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,700
Yes.

335
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
I told you last time

336
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,060
that my friend's birthday is today.

337
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,290
We are having fun here.

338
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,190
When would you leave?

339
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,500
Let me take you back in a while.

340
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,820
No need.

341
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,260
Just have fun with your friends.

342
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,810
I will take Ye Shuwei's car back.

343
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,900
Ye Shuwei?

344
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,880
Yes, it's his colleague's birthday today.

345
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,870
So courtesy of him.

346
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,820
Why do you come to his colleague's birthday?

347
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:26,990
Courtesy?

348
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,470
Family members are allowed to come.

349
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,570
I didn't go far.

350
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,270
Mr. Ye, watch your words.

351
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,850
Don't get too deep into it.

352
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,200
You think you know everything?

353
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,050
Shouldn't you break up

354
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,930
after the show?

355
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,540
Who told you we were going to break up?

356
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,950
We will continue to be in love

357
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,110
in the second season.

358
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:01,990
Yes.

359
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,550
Boss, you are going to attend again?

360
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,190
Why didn't you tell us?

361
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,150
It's nothing special.

362
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,670
But since he's

363
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,830
questioning the two of us breaking up.

364
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,830
So I have to clarify it.

365
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,310
We've finished.

366
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,580
Let me take you home.

367
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:19,960
Let's go.

368
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,350
Le Tian, I am…

369
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,060
I'm getting some fresh air.

370
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,710
And I will walk you home.

371
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,340
Mr. Yu should have told you

372
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,700
about the program and plans
for the next season, right?

373
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,340
So is it true that

374
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,480
you decided to

375
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,320
stay on for the next season?

376
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,880
Don't you want to attend?

377
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,980
Yes, I do.

378
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,130
But I don't think

379
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,680
you would do that.

380
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,780
You know me well?

381
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,120
Tell me

382
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,120
how I am like.

383
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,790
I don't think

384
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,750
you want to be controlled,

385
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,370
to have others interfere in your life,

386
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,050
nor to do things

387
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,010
against your will.

388
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,860
So you definitely

389
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,730
don't want more people

390
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,300
to mistake me for your girlfriend.

391
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,050
I really don't want that.

392
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,860
That's it.

393
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,960
Shows like this

394
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,460
are sure to be stressful.

395
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,590
What do we do then?

396
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,870
Don't you want to make money?

397
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,780
Don't you want to fulfill your dream
of being a voice actress?

398
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,270
There's a bonus in this season.

399
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,650
Of course I want to make money.

400
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,500
But there is something I shouldn't do.

401
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,000
If you are not willing to,

402
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,300
I will quit.

403
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,400
After all, causing trouble to others

404
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,400
is unpleasant.

405
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,600
All roads lead to Rome.

406
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,420
There is always another way.

407
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,670
In fact,

408
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,170
it's not so hard to win the bonus.

409
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,040
You can continue your studies

410
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
and achieve your dream.

411
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,950
What do you mean?

412
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,540
Are you willing to attend or not?

413
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,870
Listen carefully about

414
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,570
what I don't want to do.

415
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't want to be under control,

416
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,200
and I don't want irrelevant people

417
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,230
to disturb my life.

418
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:14,610
But you are right about one thing.

419
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,420
That is, I don't want

420
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,540
anyone else

421
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,040
to mistake you for my girlfriend.

422
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,630
Anyway, you mean

423
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,100
you will attend the second season,

424
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:34,960
right?

425
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,130
Right.

426
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,180
I have one more question.

427
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,010
Do you agree that

428
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,070
you can't fall in love

429
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,250
during this period?

430
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,460
Aren't I going to fall in love with you next?

431
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,090
What if your parents ask?

432
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,010
They won't meddle in my private life.

433
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,600
If they do,

434
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,960
I will tell them the truth.

435
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,860
All right.

436
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,280
I also agree.

437
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,580
If you agree,

438
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,750
you have to remember that

439
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,540
from now on,

440
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,280
you cannot have contact with
any man except me.

441
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,760
Don't cause trouble

442
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,730
like last time.

443
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,430
I know.

444
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,730
I will pay attention to it.

445
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,930
After all, we are going to continue
the cooperative relationship.

446
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,890
I have professional integrity.

447
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,970
Professional integrity?

448
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,580
I'm not just talking about

449
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,180
the partnership between us.

450
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,350
You can't have contact with other man,

451
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,680
not even think about any of them.

452
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,650
I will try my best?

453
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,590
Just try?

454
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,890
I have idol.

455
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,270
Superficial.

456
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,650
Ye Shuwei, don't underestimate
the power of idols.

457
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,460
Bei Erduo.

458
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,240
I will never get distracted by these things.

459
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,830
So you have to guarantee

460
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,290
your spiritual fidelity.

461
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,630
Good night.

462
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,390
Good night.

463
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,740
[LOVING]

464
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,020
That's all for my plan.

465
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,740
Thank you.

466
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,900
[“LOVING” Proposal Season 2]

467
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,380
Okay.

468
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,500
Ms. Tang and Xing Zhen

469
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,470
have already introduced their plans.

470
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,520
If you have any ideas, share with us.

471
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,130
Just say it directly.

472
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,280
I'd like to hear Ms. Tang's opinion.

473
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,230
You are in charge of the first season
after all.

474
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,570
Are you sure you want me to tell the truth?

475
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,290
Okay, I will start from the beginning.

476
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,780
Couples will go on a survival
adventure in the jungle.

477
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,900
Is this a Bell Adventure
or the Law of the Jungle?

478
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,490
Two,

479
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,300
instead of Tear Brand Name,
you created Grab Armband.

480
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,960
Three, instead of opening a restaurant,
you changed it to a hotel.

481
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,300
Four, instead of pretending to quarrel,
you hid the greatness.

482
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,540
You want me to continue?

483
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,120
Enough, Ms. Tang.

484
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,920
I admit that

485
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,610
I took some ideas

486
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,760
from foreign variety shows for reference.

487
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,380
But that doesn't count as plagiarism.

488
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,550
So many variety shows nationwide

489
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,490
have adopted

490
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,890
these plots and ideas.

491
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,690
Is there any original idea?

492
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,690
Even if there is, they don't dare to use it.

493
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,110
Because the premise of

494
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,500
the survival of variety shows

495
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,860
is the guarantee of public ratings.

496
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,540
Which original program

497
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,210
has both the market and the ratings now?

498
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,240
Aren't all those

499
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,190
familiar and popular variety shows

500
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,900
plagiarizing?

501
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,220
What are you talking about?

502
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,720
Originality is competitive.

503
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,970
You can't take a show as example

504
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:26,670
just because it's popular.

505
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,660
Sponsors are not fools.

506
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,000
They sponsor our shows

507
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,530
in the hope of earning
ratings and visibility

508
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,200
through them.

509
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,400
If there is a more successful precedent

510
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,380
in front of them,

511
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,840
I don't think they will take a risk

512
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,190
and choose something unknown.

513
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,860
Listen, audiences are not fools either.

514
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,160
With the developed Internet,

515
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
you think they won't find out
that you are plagiarizing?

516
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,120
By then, our program

517
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,730
would fall into a heap of scolding.

518
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,210
That's good.

519
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,020
That means we win their attention.

520
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,780
Where there is attention, there is following.

521
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,740
It's better than being unknown to public.

522
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,630
What's more,

523
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,850
most viewers don't care about that.

524
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,060
They just want

525
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,060
to kill time.

526
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,970
Even if they knew,

527
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,310
they wouldn't hold us for plagiarism

528
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,900
because they like our show.

529
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,850
Besides,

530
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,850
I just imitated some plots and ideas,

531
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,990
not applied mechanically.

532
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:19,780
So you…

533
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,880
Enough.

534
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,050
That's all for today's meeting.

535
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,300
Adjourn.

536
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,770
Ms. Tang, come to my office.

537
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,220
Erduo. Erduo.

538
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,690
Erduo.

539
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,330
Get up. Get up.

540
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,790
I am calling you.

541
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,020
Get up now.

542
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,890
Mom, let me get more sleep.

543
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,940
Leave me alone.

544
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,430
Come on.

545
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,720
Carpenter is coming.

546
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,580
What?

547
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,400
Hurry up.

548
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,980
Carpenter is coming.

549
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,370
Come on.

550
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,220
Why is he here?

551
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,050
How could I know?

552
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:57,840
Just get up.

553
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:58,990
He's downstairs.

554
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,080
Why are you packing up?

555
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,580
I forgot to tell you.

556
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,170
The show LOVING

557
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,480
is going to have a second season.

558
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,000
I have to move there.

559
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,690
Thank you for all you did

560
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,160
for our family.

561
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,750
Okay, just hurry up.

562
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,730
Hello, aunt.

563
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,170
Hello, take a seat.

564
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,020
Take a seat.

565
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,100
Sit down.

566
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,700
Thank you.

567
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,750
Take some water.

568
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,790
Aunt, it's okay.

569
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,860
When Erduo is finished, we are leaving.

570
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,360
You are a guest.

571
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,730
Just take some water.

572
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,410
Come on.

573
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,030
Thank you, aunt.

574
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,450
Well, car…

575
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,550
Ye.

576
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,390
My name is Ye Shuwei.

577
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,300
I will just call you Ye.

578
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,970
Ye, I've always wanted

579
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,220
to talk to you alone.

580
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,930
First of all, I would like to thank you

581
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,860
for participating in that show with Erduo.

582
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,450
Wait a moment. I will be ready soon.

583
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,090
What are you doing?

584
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,140
Go after breakfast.

585
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,140
Mom, it's okay.

586
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,110
We are leaving soon.

587
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,580
He doesn't like Chinese food.

588
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,090
Erduo.

589
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,490
Let's go after breakfast.

590
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,770
Why do you eat apple in the early morning?

591
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,480
Let's go.

592
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,630
Have breakfast.

593
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,420
Let's go.

594
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,340
Come on.

595
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,350
Just go.

596
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,730
- Here.
- Thank you.

597
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,970
Don't just eat porridge,
eat some other dishes.

598
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,120
It's a bit long.

599
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:47,850
Is it delicious?

600
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,600
Yes.

601
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,450
Come on.

602
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,630
And take a pancake.

603
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,750
I just made it.

604
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,310
Here.

605
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,720
I will take a try.

606
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,380
Go ahead.

607
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:57,790
Thank you.

608
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,470
You are welcome.

609
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,720
Just eat.

610
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,760
It tastes good.

611
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,540
I'm glad you like it.

612
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,500
Mom, I'm almost done.

613
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,570
I am going to pack up.

614
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,130
I will leave you alone.

615
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:10,660
Okay.

616
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,310
Take a seat.

617
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,380
Just get to the point.

618
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,190
Li.

619
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,690
The sponsorship is from Xing Zhen.

620
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,340
So even if her plan is plagiarized,

621
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,210
it's totally fine?

622
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,310
This is not entirely plagiarism.

623
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,820
I think a few of them

624
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,030
are good ideas.

625
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,490
When did you become so bottomless?

626
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,940
You think too much.

627
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,630
During this time, Xing Zhen has been

628
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,000
working very hard on this plan.

629
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,530
She checked much information
and did a lot of research.

630
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,090
You can't deny her efforts, can you?

631
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,950
Besides, we're all for this show.

632
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,390
You first compromise with the sponsor,

633
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,820
and then with fame and fortune.

634
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,580
Hey, Tang Li.

635
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,340
Could you stop talking to me

636
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,130
so sarcastically?

637
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,360
I do it all for the company.

638
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,990
Only by building up the reputation
of the company

639
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,560
will you have the right to speak

640
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,520
and do what you want.

641
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,920
So you're doing this for my good?

642
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,800
Of course.

643
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,030
Okay.

644
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,100
If I give up doing this show,

645
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,210
will you give up her plan?

646
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,380
Could you not

647
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,440
mix everything up?

648
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,440
We are all for the show.

649
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,840
Why can't we

650
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,730
have a good talk

651
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,560
and figure out a way

652
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,140
to solve it together?

653
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,190
I've made up my mind.

654
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,190
You are the one who have to think about it.

655
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,580
[The First Step Towards Voice Actor]

656
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,580
Take a seat.

657
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,850
Thank you, aunt.

658
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,890
You are so polite.

659
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,430
Let's continue.

660
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,160
Erduo just interrupted us.

661
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,220
Aunt, please go ahead.

662
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,510
To be honest,

663
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,870
something happened to our family,

664
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,850
and it's a big deal.

665
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,950
Of course it's all my bad.

666
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,480
But my daughter

667
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,520
never complained about me.

668
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,680
In fact, I hope that she

669
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,390
doesn't have

670
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,300
any wishful thinking,

671
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,700
but lives an ordinary life.

672
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,470
But Erduo

673
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,490
is ambitious.

674
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,720
You must know that

675
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,770
once you have a dream, you have to
work much harder than others.

676
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,160
And you will be more tired than others.

677
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,290
Look at her.

678
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,500
She has to study

679
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,210
and work several jobs.

680
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:20,920
Well.

681
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,080
Do you understand

682
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,890
what I said?

683
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,070
Aunt, don't worry.

684
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,280
I won't get in the way of any
of her choices.

685
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,880
That's good.

686
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,850
I know

687
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,950
some good girls.

688
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,150
I will keep an eye

689
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,600
for you.

690
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,060
Let's go.

691
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,820
You are ready?

692
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,870
What are you talking about behind my back?

693
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,120
Nothing.

694
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,660
All right, just go.

695
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,280
Nothing.

696
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,370
Let's go.

697
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,020
Nothing special.

698
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,180
Come often.

699
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,480
Okay.

700
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:02,420
Let me take it.

701
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,130
Thank you for sending her.

702
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:04,570
Nothing.

703
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,850
It's okay. Just go.

704
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,370
Here.

705
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,460
Mom, I am leaving.

706
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,490
Go to bed early. Don't stay up late.

707
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,430
Bye, aunt.

708
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,370
Bye.

709
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,380
Bei Duofen.

710
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,210
Bei Duofen.

711
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,130
Bei Duofen.

712
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,070
Did you miss me?

713
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,200
Come here.

714
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,450
You know you haven't visited it
for a long time.

715
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,760
I didn't mean to do it, Bei Duofen.

716
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,870
I've been so busy lately.

717
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,970
But now

718
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,860
we can meet every day.

719
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,540
Are you happy?

720
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,600
Yes.

721
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,810
I mean Bei Duofen.

722
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,900
I know.

723
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,420
Bei Duofen, I treat you best, right?

724
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,580
What's wrong?

725
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,080
Why are you standing here?

726
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,440
It's all arranged by you?

727
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,320
My room was renewed some time ago,

728
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,790
so I did the same to your room.

729
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,630
The bed is so comfortable.

730
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,440
It's also new.

731
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,110
If I sleep in this bed,

732
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,940
I definitely don't want to get up.

733
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,230
Then you'd better not get out.

734
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,320
Who told you that

735
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,960
all girls like pink?

736
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,530
You are so straight.

737
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,540
I love blue as much as you do.

738
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,140
I have something to do in my studio.

739
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,750
Take your time.

740
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,820
Have you noticed that

741
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,840
the boss is in a good mood recently?

742
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,930
It's so obvious.

743
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,560
He's almost about to tell the whole world.

744
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,640
It's not just happy

745
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,460
but love blossoms.

746
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,420
You'll go.

747
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:48,710
It's you.

748
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,620
Yes, I am looking for Ye Shuwei.

749
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,490
I have a bunch of spruce of high quality.

750
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,140
Okay, come in.

751
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,660
Boss, there is a lady outside
looking for you,

752
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,080
saying that she has a bunch of spruce
of high quality.

753
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:02,990
Coming.

754
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,170
Shuwei.

755
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,030
Shuwei, I really have some timber
of high quality.

756
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,110
It will definitely meet your needs.

757
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,850
Well, Shuwei.

758
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,080
A friend of mine is a lumber supplier.

759
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,950
Recently he found a bunch of spruce
of high quality.

760
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,160
I brought one of them,

761
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,100
which is a good material that
numerous master violin makers

762
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,130
have been eager for all their lives.

763
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,660
I believe that the violin made from it

764
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,480
with your skill

765
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,800
will leave a good name forever.

766
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,770
Let's go.

767
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,780
No way.

768
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,500
It's the most attracting part.

769
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,140
Why are you so gossipy?

770
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,550
