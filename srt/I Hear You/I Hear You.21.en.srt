[I Hear You]

2
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,460
[Episode 21]

3
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,570
We are very honored to have

4
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,320
the triennial International Violin Making Competition
in China this year.

5
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
In this competition, I'm very happy

6
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
to see the violin-making industry of China

7
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,200
progressing rapidly step by step.

8
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,330
I believe that the violin-making industry

9
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,410
of China will be even better.

10
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,970
The Silver Prize winner of this competition,

11
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,200
Mars from Italy!

12
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,690
Congratulations.

13
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,190
The Golden Prize winner,

14
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,160
from China,

15
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,160
Ye Shuwei!

16
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,520
Let's welcome the Golden Prize winner
to deliver a speech for us.

17
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,770
Thank you.

18
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,460
Thank judges for your recognition.

19
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,060
Mr. Zheng Tongsheng,
the violin-making master of China

20
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,270
once said

21
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,730
that the meaning of life

22
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,930
is to realize one's own value.

23
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,590
I don't want to sound too arrogant,

24
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,830
but I hope I can follow his footsteps

25
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,130
and create more possibilities

26
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,560
for China's violin-making industry.

27
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,930
The winning violin of this competition

28
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,710
will be used by
a world-famous young violinist

29
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,720
on her world concert tour.

30
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,750
Now let's welcome the violinist,

31
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,070
Miss Lin Qingzhuo.

32
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,330
Round of applause!

33
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,880
Congratulations.

34
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,460
I know it has to be you.

35
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,280
Hello, everyone.

36
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,240
I feel very lucky

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,290
to play the violin made by my good friend.

38
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,280
Some of you may not know...

39
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,940
What's the relationship between them?

40
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,750
Are they close?

41
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,240
I don't know either.

42
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,780
He's a good composer, too.

43
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,000
Later, Shuwei and I

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,640
will present a great performance to you.

45
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,880
Let's start.

46
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,820
The award ceremony
of the 5th International Violin Making Competition

47
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,760
has come to a successful conclusion!

48
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,230
Finally, you've found the place
you should be at.

49
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,090
I've liked him since I was little

50
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,790
but I wasn't brave enough
to tell him face to face.

51
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,760
When I met him again as a grown-up,

52
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,150
he said he's your boyfriend.

53
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,490
I couldn't accept that I've lost to you.

54
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,170
But just now,

55
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,200
I let go of all my frustration.

56
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,800
Because I saw the one I love

57
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,050
is together with a better match than me.

58
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,900
I should feel happy for him.

59
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,100
Bei Erduo, I'm going to find my world

60
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,200
and you should go back to your world, too.

61
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,460
Don't mess around in other people's world.

62
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,060
Coming.

63
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,390
I'm so happy now.

64
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,980
Yeah, because I love skewers.

65
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,170
Here you are. Your skewers.

66
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,480
Thank you.

67
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,810
Enjoy.

68
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,320
Thanks.

69
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,640
Madam, two bottles of beer, please.

70
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,350
Iced ones.

71
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,160
Okay.

72
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,120
Thank you.

73
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,810
Come on.

74
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,690
Alicia, can we finish these?

75
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,260
Of course. It's not that much.

76
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,890
Even Erduo and I can finish it.

77
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,790
Come on, have a try.

78
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,430
But you...

79
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,230
You've been eating very little before.

80
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,060
I...

81
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,760
Here you are.

82
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,230
Okay, thank you.

83
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,560
Come on.

84
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,650
Iced beer and skewers.

85
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:08,940
Okay.

86
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,550
Perfect combination.

87
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,640
Okay. I'll have this one first.

88
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:13,980
Have a taste.

89
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,630
Okay.

90
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,400
How's that?

91
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,430
Have a try.

92
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,830
Good.

93
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,080
Is this called Heaven on Earth?

94
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,090
You mean delicacy on Earth, right?

95
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,840
Don't throw that word around.

96
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,740
Try the potato slice.

97
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,450
Okay.

98
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,520
Tastes good, too.

99
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,520
If not for this competition,

100
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,250
I wouldn't have tasted so much great food.

101
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,160
Don't you think it's a pity?

102
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,260
You mean, losing to Allen?

103
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,860
It's fine.

104
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,260
There's a saying in Chinese,

105
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,290
why is there...

106
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,960
Why is there always someone smarter?

107
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,740
Right. Although I want to say this,

108
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,330
I think

109
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,080
this is just an excuse for losers.

110
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,950
I'm still young. It's fine.

111
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,970
Okay. For your future.

112
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,880
Cheers.

113
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,010
I'm really thankful

114
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,140
that I got to know you.

115
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,100
I'm really happy to meet you, too.

116
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,720
Yes.

117
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,710
But your happiness is different

118
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,590
from mine.

119
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,610
Before meeting you every day,
I keep wondering

120
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,680
that when you'll say yes

121
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,340
and when you'll agree to be my girlfriend.

122
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,430
If you say yes,

123
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,730
I'll introduce you to my parents

124
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,830
and siblings right away.

125
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,840
They will like you very much for sure.

126
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,620
Then we can get married

127
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,070
and we'll have three children.

128
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,400
Although I like daughters,

129
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,950
she needs to have two elder brothers.

130
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,430
So, if anything goes wrong,

131
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,070
they can protect her.

132
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,560
Did you give the wrong change again?

133
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,800
Well, it's not a big deal.

134
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,030
As long as the customers are happy,
it's okay.

135
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,770
This is not the first time.

136
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,910
I mean, can you...

137
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,190
Lamb skewer for you.

138
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,640
Look, it's so well grilled.

139
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,480
Don't be angry.

140
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,140
I cook this every day

141
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,400
and you're offering it to me.

142
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,590
As long as you're happy.

143
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,850
If we have an argument,

144
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,970
will you do this to me, too?

145
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,400
Of course.

146
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,810
Because I like skewers too.

147
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,310
But what am I thinking about?

148
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,720
I feel like I'm dreaming.

149
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,840
Although I know you're not prepared,

150
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,970
I'm willing to wait for you,

151
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,200
no matter what.

152
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,010
You try again. Maybe I'll agree with you.

153
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,810
Okay.

154
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,060
Then...

155
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,390
Alicia,

156
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,000
will you marry me?

157
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,450
Yes.

158
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,880
You're kidding, right?

159
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,550
I'm serious.

160
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,640
You're serious?

161
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,140
Of course.

162
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,330
I am.

163
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,590
It's so ugly.

164
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,850
But I like it.

165
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,210
Don't go back on your words.

166
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,410
I won't.

167
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:40,810
Good morning.

168
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,560
Good morning. Coffee?

169
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,070
Yes.

170
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,020
Thanks.

171
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,680
Erduo,

172
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,960
I have something to tell you.

173
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,650
What?

174
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,220
The violinist yesterday

175
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,590
is Lin Qingzhuo.

176
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,820
She's the daughter
of my violin-making instructor

177
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,880
and just came back from Italy.

178
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,570
Yesterday, my instructor called to ask me

179
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,510
to take care of her

180
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,770
during her stay in China.

181
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,690
Recently, she has a theme song performance

182
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,640
in collaboration with me.

183
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,390
It's the project you dubbed.

184
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,050
And she needs to break

185
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,390
in that winning violin, too.

186
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,450
I have to make some adjustments with her.

187
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,560
So she hopes to live

188
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,380
in my place for a while.

189
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,740
I've agreed.

190
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,360
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

191
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,070
I'm telling you this in advance.

192
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,550
That's good.

193
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,030
I've long been preparing to move out

194
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,230
but hasn't done it until now.

195
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,740
Now I can spare a room for her.

196
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,170
That's not what I mean.

197
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,910
There're plenty of rooms here,

198
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,870
why are you moving out?

199
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,090
It's part of my plan to begin with.

200
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,770
Your competition has finished

201
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,610
and your health has almost recovered.

202
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,820
And my mom needs me back...

203
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,350
No, I mean...

204
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,180
But the show has just finished.

205
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,760
If you move out so quickly,

206
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,220
there will be rumors.

207
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,070
No one will notice.

208
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,440
But... It's near

209
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,560
your recording studio here.

210
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,530
Isn't it more convenient for you
to live here?

211
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,640
You must be Erduo.

212
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,750
I'm Lin Qingzhuo.

213
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,150
Hello.

214
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,990
Sorry for bothering you

215
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,850
and thank you for your hospitality.

216
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,110
My pleasure.

217
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,690
Didn't I say I'd pick you up tomorrow?

218
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,770
I'm bored alone in the hotel.

219
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,100
I was thinking
if I could come to work earlier.

220
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,990
I wanted to give you a surprise.

221
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,770
Did I scare you?

222
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,520
I'll leave you two alone

223
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,570
and go downstairs to make breakfast.

224
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,740
Shuwei, help Qingzhuo

225
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,320
carry the luggage upstairs.

226
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,810
Come downstairs for breakfast
when it's all sorted.

227
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,540
Thank you, Erduo.

228
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,810
You're welcome.

229
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,870
My parents heard that you've come back

230
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,650
and invited you to dinner at our home.

231
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,040
Really?

232
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,560
I really want to see them, too.

233
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,370
I have a tight schedule this time

234
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,960
and don't have much time to pay visits.

235
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,700
What are you doing?

236
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,060
Breakfast is ready.
Tell Qingzhuo to come downstairs.

237
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,400
She said she'd come soon.

238
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,290
How will you get

239
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,840
to the internal celebration
of New Journey to the West?

240
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,760
If you're free, meet me at my studio

241
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,010
and we can go together.

242
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,690
No, thanks. I have to record something

243
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,590
and I'll go with my colleagues.

244
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,600
Okay.

245
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,230
Shuwei, I brought you souvenirs from Italy.

246
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,040
Sorry, I have too much luggage
to bring you more.

247
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm sorry, Erduo.

248
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,860
When I left Italy, I didn't know
you're here, too,

249
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,830
so I didn't bring you gifts.

250
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,140
Hope you don't mind.

251
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,580
It's fine. Not a problem at all.

252
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,340
You're so kind.

253
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,100
Erduo, do you know

254
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,590
that Shuwei kept growing taller
when he was in Italy?

255
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,270
After a while,

256
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,700
the clothes he bought before wouldn't fit.

257
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,080
In the end,

258
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,890
he bought clothes more often than I did.

259
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,820
That's not the case now.

260
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,480
I brought coffee beans from Italy, too.

261
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,460
I'll make espresso for you.

262
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,090
You can't.

263
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,670
Why?

264
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,690
You don't have moka pot?

265
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,110
It's easier to make Americano.

266
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,680
Let's have breakfast first.

267
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,370
I made two cups of Americano for you.

268
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,480
I remember that you only drank espresso.

269
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,150
At that time, I practiced violin
for over ten hours each day

270
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,270
and you were learning
to make violins from my dad.

271
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,850
Every morning,

272
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,040
we'd go to a café in Italy

273
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,940
for a cup of espresso.

274
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,700
We weren't used to drinking it standing then,

275
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,220
and people there would hurry us.

276
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,220
Espresso tastes great,

277
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,770
but it's not necessary.

278
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,180
But you never drank

279
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,810
other types of coffee in the past.

280
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,060
Habits change.

281
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,420
I'll go buy a moka pot then,

282
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,920
so you can have espresso

283
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,640
every day.

284
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,270
Thanks, there's no need to.

285
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,020
Do we have to spend the whole morning

286
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,840
discussing coffee?

287
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,890
Well, Qingzhuo, how about this?

288
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
We'll have Americano today

289
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,640
and have other coffee later.

290
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,940
I haven't tried espresso yet

291
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,080
and I want to have a taste.

292
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,820
I'll make espresso for you another day.

293
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,290
Enjoy your breakfast.

294
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,920
I have something to do upstairs.

295
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,640
Qingzhuo,

296
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,010
we'll drive Erduo

297
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,940
to her recording studio first,

298
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,020
then we'll go to my studio
to adjust the violin.

299
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,860
Okay.

300
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,300
You've finished?

301
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,450
Erduo, we'll drive you
to your recording studio first.

302
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,210
Get ready.

303
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,660
Erduo?

304
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,500
This beauty comes

305
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,670
to our studio often recently.

306
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,670
A violinist needs to

307
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,340
break in the new violin.

308
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,690
With the best violin maker
adjusting by the side,

309
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,360
perfect results can be achieved
as soon as possible.

310
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,990
Don't you trust our boss?

311
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,380
Of course I trust him,

312
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,610
but she's in love with him.

313
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,110
Hello, Le Tian,

314
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,290
did you meet the Senior?

315
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,060
How's she?

316
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,200
We met this afternoon.

317
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,280
She's nice.

318
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,080
Forget about that.

319
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,370
Do you still have your level test materials?

320
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,050
Yes.

321
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,640
I need them for consolidation

322
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,210
so of course I still keep them.

323
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,400
Great.

324
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,580
Can I borrow them to get a copy?

325
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,760
I've registered for the next test.

326
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,200
I wonder if I can learn

327
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,620
from your tips for the test.

328
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,320
Sure.

329
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,650
I'll sort them out
and bring them to you tomorrow.

330
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,080
You don't need to.

331
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,900
It's already so kind of you
to lend them to me,

332
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,070
how can I ask you to deliver them yourself?

333
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,940
If it's convenient for you,

334
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,900
I'll come and take them later.

335
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,800
Okay then.

336
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,600
Here you are. A gift for you.

337
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,060
You're too nice.

338
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,220
Of course I need to thank you

339
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,220
for lending me your test tips.

340
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,420
I walked past a cake shop

341
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,670
and bought the cake you like.

342
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,110
Thank you.

343
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,080
But there're a lot of materials

344
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,000
and I haven't sorted them out yet.

345
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,820
So wait a moment, please.

346
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,710
I'll wait outside.

347
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,780
Why wait outside?

348
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,050
Come in.

349
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,090
There're really lots of materials.

350
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,240
I need more time.

351
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,390
It's too late.
I don't want to cause you trouble.

352
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,050
I'm staying outside.

353
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,910
What trouble?

354
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,670
Come on.

355
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,770
Have a seat.

356
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,750
Anything to drink?

357
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,170
No thanks, I'm just here for the materials.

358
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,380
Okay then, wait a moment.

359
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,040
I'll go upstairs and bring them to you.

360
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,930
I think the two measures next
are still imperfect.

361
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,740
We can try more.

362
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,440
Okay. We will...

363
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,910
Excuse me...

364
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,980
Le Tian, I've...

365
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,650
Erduo, is he your friend?

366
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,020
This is my friend Le Tian.

367
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,970
He came here for study materials.

368
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,050
Enjoy yourself.

369
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,420
I'm taking the violin back to my room.

370
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,900
Who is she? You three...

371
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,510
Here are my notes.

372
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,060
Le Tian, want some water?

373
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,910
No, thanks.

374
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,850
I'll return them to you tomorrow
after photocopying them.

375
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,400
Look,

376
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,100
these two are the most important notes

377
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,420
I made in my everyday studies.

378
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,880
Those tagged are all very important.

379
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,540
Have a good read, okay?

380
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,010
Okay.

381
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,210
Bye.

382
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,990
I'm leaving then.

383
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,550
I'll see you off.

384
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,180
No thanks. I'll leave myself.

385
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,090
Take care.

386
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,490
Bye.

387
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,660
What's up?

388
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,070
Are you feeling guilty?

389
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,360
Why should I?

390
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,860
Le Tian was just here for the materials.

391
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,930
Can't he make notes himself?

392
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,490
Why does he have to
read other people's notes?

393
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,240
Ye Shuwei, can you talk nicely?

394
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,440
Which word of mine is not nice?

395
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,960
I mean...

396
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,730
Shuwei,

397
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,900
can you come?

398
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,970
I have something to discuss with you.

399
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,600
Erduo, make a cup of coffee for me.

400
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,460
Shuwei, good morning.

401
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,590
Erduo has left early.

402
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,280
You want coffee?

403
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,770
Just a minute.

404
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:58,780
Thanks.

405
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,920
Erduo, are you home?

406
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,470
[Erduo, are you home?]

407
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,420
Shuwei, it's late.

408
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,580
Let's go home.

409
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,080
[Dear Bei Erduo, you have passed the written test
of Tokyo Academy of Arts.]

410
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,070
[Please come to the designated place
next Tuesday for the interview.]

411
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,440
What happened?

412
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,600
I've passed the written test
of the voice acting school in Japan.

413
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,450
I'll have the interview next week!

414
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,420
You're overreacting.

415
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,120
You're so talented.

416
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,160
I knew you'd pass.

417
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,410
Congratulations, Erduo.

418
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:16,750
Thank you.

419
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,870
I didn't know you'd go to Japan to study,

420
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,890
otherwise maybe I could help.

421
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,860
Thanks, but you don't need to.

422
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,670
I've been preparing for it for so long

423
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,590
so I'm very confident of being admitted.

424
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,040
I'm here to return things.

425
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,580
Ah, my shoes for interview.

426
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,870
I don't know how to pick shoes for girls,

427
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,670
so I picked the ones
with the simplest design.

428
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,370
They're probably right for the interview.

429
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,540
Of course.

430
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,450
This kind of shoes
is very comfortable to wear.

431
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,820
Comfortable to wear and good-looking, too.

432
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,630
Thank you.

433
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,050
How did you know my shoe size?

434
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,450
I checked it visually.

435
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,690
Visual check?

436
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,080
Ten yuan.

437
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,860
You want some change?

438
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,790
No. You need to pay

439
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,750
because I delivered your shoes to you.

440
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:06,030
Mr. Ye, you're returning shoes to me.

441
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,600
It's different.

442
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,510
Okay...

443
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,120
Go back and get some rest.

444
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,200
Bye.

445
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,830
I have to prepare for the interview.

446
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:21,490
Bye-bye!

447
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,520
We're arrived?

448
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,170
There's one stop to go.

449
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,220
Sorry.

450
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,100
I'm so tired these days

451
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,050
and I didn't sleep well.

452
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,340
Who's the woman with Ye Shuwei that day?

453
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,760
That's Lin Qingzhuo, Ye Shuwei's friend.

454
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,420
Her dad is Ye Shuwei's instructor.

455
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,300
He hopes that Ye Shuwei can look after her

456
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,440
these days.

457
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,400
We've arrived.

458
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,970
Let's go.

459
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,610
I can go home by myself.

460
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,520
How will you get back?

461
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,990
I'll take Bus No. 4212. It's coming soon.

462
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,880
You go home first.

463
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,690
I'll wait with you.

464
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,820
No, thank you.

465
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,440
It's late. Go home.

466
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,310
Here are the materials.

467
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,220
Okay then, I'm going home.

468
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,440
See you.

469
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

470
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,240
Take care.

471
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,670
Okay.

472
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,750
How can I...

473
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,220
I'm leaving.

474
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,200
What's up?

475
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,680
What are you doing?

476
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,340
A two-timer living with two women?

477
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,340
Is this your business?

478
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,750
Did you think of Erduo?

479
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,830
What would she think?

480
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,600
In what capacity
are you asking this question?

481
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,430
I'm her...

482
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,280
I'm her friend.

483
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,030
Okay then.

484
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,150
Erduo's friend.

485
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,150
Thank you for your concern.

486
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,160
Listen,

487
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,000
Erduo is my girlfriend.

488
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,160
We'll sort out the things

489
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,140
between us ourselves.

490
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
It's not your business.

491
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,950
If you care about her,

492
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,400
please cherish her.

493
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,960
Don't take advantage of her kindness
to hurt her!

494
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,740
Thank you for your advice.

495
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,200
We'll be good.

496
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,800
Erduo.

497
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,120
Erduo!

498
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,220
Erduo!

499
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,810
Erduo!

500
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,480
What's up?

501
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,200
I have something to tell you.

502
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,520
After knowing you're going to study in Japan,

503
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,260
I contacted my friend there.

504
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,200
He works in the anime industry, too.

505
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,570
If they need voice actresses,

506
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,960
you can go have a try-out.

507
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,190
I've told him about you.

508
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,190
Thanks.

509
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,650
But don't bother, really.

510
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,770
I don't want others to see me
as someone who only gets there using connections.

511
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,600
Never mind.

512
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,350
I did this to thank you

513
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,660
for taking care of Ye Shuwei these days.

514
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,130
And I believe
you're talented enough for that.

515
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,990
We don't know how Erduo's situation
in Japan will be yet.

516
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,990
Forget about this for now.

517
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,320
Qingzhuo, I have something

518
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,970
about work to discuss with you.

519
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,340
Come with me.

520
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:36,900
Okay.

521
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,780
Good night.

522
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,100
Good night.

523
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,560
What are you doing?

524
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,330
Tying my shoelace.

525
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,120
Aren't you wearing slippers?

526
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,180
Ah, yes.

527
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,550
No wonder I was...

528
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,410
My belly aches. I need to go to the bathroom.
