[Episode 14]

3
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,910
Bei Duofen.

4
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,540
Are you hungry?

5
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,220
You only come here when you're hungry.

6
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,510
Well,

7
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,840
how about this?

8
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,090
You've been eating here for free for long.

9
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,130
Would you do me a favor?

10
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:35,870
Come here.

[Bei Erduo]
Bei Duofen is missing.

12
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,380
Bei Duofen, stay here and wait for me.

13
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,760
I'll let you out very soon.

14
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,080
What took you so long to open the door?

15
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,200
I was looking for Bei Duofen upstairs.

16
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,720
Have you found it?

17
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,280
Not yet.

18
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,960
Then why are you still so calm?

19
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,840
Are you sure it's still in this house?

20
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,350
Yeah, all the windows are closed today.

21
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,810
And I've been here all the time.

22
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,260
When did you find it missing?

23
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,220
About in the morning.

24
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,030
I got up and prepared it the cat food

25
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,530
but it didn't show up to eat it.

26
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,130
Usually it's eager to have meals.

27
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,650
Where have you been looking for?

28
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,500
Basically every place upstairs

29
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,700
But I haven't searched the downstairs.

30
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,720
Again?

31
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,000
How could it hide in that kind of place?

32
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,480
I'm better than you,

33
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,110
who's just sitting here to watch.

34
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,330
You're more ridiculous.

35
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,770
How could it be in the trash can?

36
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,320
Well, you're not worried at all.

37
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,320
It can't go missing. It must be at home.

38
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,250
I once read a piece news

39
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,780
that a kitten

40
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,510
fell into a drain

41
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,220
and got saved after a long period.

42
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,260
No one knew how it fell into it.

43
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,560
Bei Duofen can't be that unlucky.

44
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,190
It's not.

45
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,840
I don't think it's downstairs.

46
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,810
I'll go to have a look upstairs.

47
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,320
Bei Duofen.

48
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,050
Bei Duofen.

49
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,780
You could start searching from the room

50
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,470
at the end of the corridor.

51
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,480
What's wrong?

52
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,210
This way.

53
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,560
Bei Duofen.

54
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,670

55
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,040
Bei Duofen.

56
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,960
There you are.

57
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,660
Would you like to see the crime scene?

58
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,180
Except for the two pieces so badly scratched,

59
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,330
the other clothes are good to wear.

60
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,580
I've cleaned the cat hair.

61
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,800
If you still find them unsanitary,

62
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,220
you can have them washed before wearing.

63
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,090
Thank you.

64
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,850
All right.

65
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,460
Now Bei Duofen has been found.

66
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,080
And the clothes are well folded.

67
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,500
I still have things to do. I've got to go.

68
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,500
Wait.

69
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,170
I'm just going to the studio.

70
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,350
Let me give you a ride.

71
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,680
Where are you going?

72
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,430
Cafeteria.

73
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,220
The studio just ran out of coffee beans.

74
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,890
Let's go.

75
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,880
I'll get inside.

76
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,040
Hello, sir.

77
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,520
May I help you?

78
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:06,940
Coffee beans.

79
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:07,810
Why did he come?

80
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,330
Okay, wait a minute.

81
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,800
I think it's over between you.

82
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,890
Something happened today.

83
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,550
He just gave me a lift here.

84
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,220
You've dressed up today.

85
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,860
Is it an interview or a blind date?

86
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,860
What do you think? Do I look good?

87
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,530
Very good.

88
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,550
You look like a playboy now.

89
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,740
No, handsome boy.

90
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,790
Where are you going exactly?

91
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,190
The teacher let me take part in
the oratorical contest.

92
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,640
So I bought a suit for it.

93
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,070
But I realized I was unable to wear a tie
after I got home.

94
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,120
I want you to teach me.

95
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,130
I don't know how to do it either.

96
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,460
Aren't you a girl?

97
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,480
Not all girls know how to wear a tie.

98
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,760
Oh, what do we do?

99
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,760
I also have no idea.

100
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,350
Wait a second.

101
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,810
Let me search on online.

102
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,940
Give me the tie.

103
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,500
Come on. Stand up.

104
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:44,730
Hello, sir.

105
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,270
Your coffee beans.

106
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,920
Thank you. How much?

One moment, please.

110
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,400
Well, I'm sorry.

111
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,060
How about taking it as the red scarf?

112
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,980
Let me have another try.

113
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,680
Why is it so difficult? What's going on?

114
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:15,980
Like this.

115
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,740
You don't know how to do such a simple thing?

116
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,310
I'm not a middle-aged man

117
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,460
who wears a suit and tie all day.

118
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,850
I don't need this skill.

119
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,030
A man who can't even wear a tie

120
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,360
is not a true man.

121
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,830
Well,

122
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,900

Take out the materials

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,630
Erduo, come to the seaside.

129
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,310
Now, right away, at once.

130
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,700
Okay, thank you, Boss Yu.

131
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,420
Tang Li is back.

132
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,590
So are Boss Yu and Xing Zhen gonna break up?

133
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,320
I think it's time for Tang Li to step aside.

134

You are here.

135

The beer now is bloody awful.

00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,210
Right, just like Huoxiang Zhengqi Liquid.

137
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,440
Love really requires courage

138
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,830
to face the gossip.

139
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,020
As long as you're sure,

140
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,480
my love will be meaningful.

141
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,250
We all need courage

142
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,220
to believe we will be together.

143
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,970
I can feel you in the crowd

144
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,640
and put your heart

145
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,080
in my hand.

146
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,590
I haven't sung this song for long.

147
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,200
Long enough for me to forget what's courage.

148
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,930
Courage is

149
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,390
being against by thousands,
I go forward anyway,

150
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,280
though I'm alone for the journey ahead.

152
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,680
Look at the sea.

153
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,930
You jump.

154
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,410
I'll just see you.

155
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,650
Come on.

156
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,660
You've finally laughed.

Thank you, Erduo.

158
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,800
What other choice do I have?

159
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,510
I'm your little fairy.

160
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,530
My little fairy,

161
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,610
if I make a wish to you,

162
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,850
could it be realized?

163
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,150
You must collect the seven Dragon Balls.

164
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,270
You're useless.

165
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,720
Go ahead. Say it.

166
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,410
I'll satisfy you.

167
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,360
I want the superpower

168
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,610
which I can see what's going on

169
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,320
on the mind of another man.

170
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,970
I want to know what he's thinking.

171
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,360
I wonder if we're

172
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,720
getting farther away from each other.

173
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,690
In fact, I'm asking for trouble myself.

174
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,020
That person hasn't said anything.

175
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,020
But somehow I think

176
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,530
we are in a relationship naturally.

177
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,030
Aren't you?

178
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,500
Who knows?

179
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,970
I'm more and more losing myself.

180
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,960
All this is just my wishful thinking.

181
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,370
I'm being narcissistic.

182
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,580
Maybe you're not meant for each other.

183
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,680
Don't doubt yourself.

184
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,950
The other day, you told me

185
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,990
to have faith in myself,

186
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,670
and be confident.

187
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,900
You think I deserve better.

188
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,840
Looks like I really need

189
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,330
to take some time off.

190
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,050
Maybe I can find a quiet place

191
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,610
to explore what's going on

192
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,000
in my inner heart.

193
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,920
Go, Pikachu.

194
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,760
Don't feel lost even if you're hurt.

195
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,530
Our target is

196
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,210
the ocean of stars.

197
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,640
Remember to bring me local specialty.

198
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,010
Delicious ones.

199
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,000
Come on!

200
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,410
You spoiled the atmosphere!

201
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,090
What.

202
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,810
What!

203
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,380
Enough.

204
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,470
What are you doing?

205
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,420
He Yang.

206
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,720
Boss, what do you need?

207
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,410
Sit.

208
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,120
Sit.

209
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,800
When's the birthday party

210
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,400
you mentioned last time?

211
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,970
Next Monday, boss.

212
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,640
You're not coming, are you?

213
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
But I remember that you said

214
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,630
you wouldn't come last time.

215
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,400
What changed your mind?

216
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,080
Are you going to

217
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,650
blow off all important things

218
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,800
for my small birthday party?

219
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,440
Boss, you're really nice…

220
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,190
Invite Bei Erduo to your party.

221
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,130
Sure, of course.

222
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,290
Boss, you didn't need to tell me that.

223
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,810
You can just come together then.

224
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:20,790
I got it.

225
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,990
You're asking me to invite her, right?

226
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:23,840
No problem.

227
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,110
I'll call her now.

228
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,050
I don't have her phone number.

229
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,050
I'll go to call her.

230
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,870
Wait.

231
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,400
Here.

232
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,370
Hello.

233
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,590
Hello.

234
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,560
I'm He Yang, assistant in Ye Shuwei's Studio.

235
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,100
Hello, what's the matter?

236
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,040
Here's the thing.

237
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,750
Next Monday is my birthday.

238
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,460
I want to invite everyone out for a meal.

239
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,250
Do you have time for it?

240
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,100
Next Monday? Well…

241
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,370
I… I'm…

242
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,630
Actually, everyone wants you to come.

243
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,840
You must come.

244
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,820
This is also a chance to

245
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,490
grow the relationship among all of us.

246
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,510
It'll be warm.

247
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,130
Thank you.

248
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,970
What about your boss?

249
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,260
Our boss is very kind.

250
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,410
He has blown off many vital things to come.

251
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:56,990
Just come.

252
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,720
How nice it is for us
to play together and get intimate!

253
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,400
Well…

254
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,980
Okay.

255
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,410
It's settled then.

256
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,480
About the location,

257
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,920
I'll text you the details later.

258
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,000
Okay, thank you.

259
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,210
It's high-sounding for him to say so.

260
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,010
What happened?

261
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,480
He Yang from Ye Shuwei's Studio

262
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,220
is having a birthday party next Monday.

263
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,420
Where?

264
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,410
Here's the message.

265
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,630
In Youtang KTV.

266
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,280
Le Tian,

267
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,940
you are curious,

268
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,860
aren't you?

269
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,460
Well…

270
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,290
Write this sentence for three times.

271
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:51,920
This one.

272
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,700
What are you doing?

273
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,090
Mom, why are you dressed so formally?

274
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,730
Wedding ceremony?

275
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,770
Would I dress like this for any wedding?

276
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,260
I went to get a lawyer.

277
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,110
You needn't dress like this for lawyers.

278
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,930
I thought they may…

279
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,160
What did the lawyer say?

280
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,250
Erduo.

281
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,980
I'm sorry.

282
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,020
The lawyer said

283
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,260
we probably couldn't

284
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,810
get the money back.

285
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,160
I've guessed so.

286
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,730
Don't blame yourself.

287
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,460
The frauds now are very cunning.

288
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,080
You're not the only one being conned.

289
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,050
Let's take it as a lesson this time.

290
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,320
You won't be fooled next time.

291
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,290
But this one is too serious.

292
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,900
I… I…

293
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,050
Actually, I did it to ease your burden.

294
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,700
But it turned out

295
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,070
that your burden got heavier instead.

296
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,700
I have no burden, Mom.

297
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,510
What I'm doing now

298
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,290
is what I like to do.

299
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,450
I'm not tired at all.

300
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,420
I mean it.

301
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:45,830
Erduo,

302
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,540
when will you stop

303
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,250
doing part-time jobs?

304
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,760
Could you listen to me

305
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,510
and stop thinking about studying abroad?

306
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,130
Okay?

307
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,280
Find a stable job and work hard.

308
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,050
And then find a good man

309
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,330
to get married and have children.

310
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,240
Only then can I stop worrying about you.

311
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,260
Mom,

312
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,060
I have no grand ambition.

313
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,420
I just want to do

314
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,030
the thing that I really enjoy.

315
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,290
Maybe I can't have the life

316
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,020
which is desired by others.

317
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,990
But for me, that doesn't matter.

318
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,180
Happiness is a subjective feeling
for everyone.

319
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,050
Mom,

320
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,410
please let me have a try.

321
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,690
At least in the future, I could say,

322
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,380
"Bei Erduo, you've worked hard and tried,

323
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,340
so there would be no regrets."

324
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,830
As the saying goes,

325
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,430
the money lost will come back in the end.

326
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,460
If we could get through this difficulty,

327
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,380
there's nothing to trip us in the future.

328
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,820
But keep one thing in mind.

329
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,160
If you come to a dead end one day,

330
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,110
remember to go home.

331
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,700
But,

332
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,460
you should let me find the dead end first.

333
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,820
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

334
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,680
I'll make you some food.

335
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,260
You are quite fit to be a servant.

336
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,280
Are you letting your master stand
at the door entrance?

337
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,840
Master, please allow me

338
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,970
to send you blessings.

339
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,350
Here is the menu.

340
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,860
Shouldn't you introduce the menu to me?

341
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,830
Master, do you prefer sweet coffee

342
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,740
or bitter one?

343
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,500
If you prefer sweet coffee,

344
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,120
I'll recommend our specialty,
strawberry milk coffee.

345
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,180
If you prefer bitter coffee,

346
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,880
we also have espresso here.

347
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,770
How is your coffee different
from that in other stores?

348
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,850
No difference. They're all coffee.

349
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,870
I'll have this magic macchiato.

350
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,200
Okay, just a minute.

351
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,330
Xin, a cup of magic macchiato.

352
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,080
Okay, what latte art?

353
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,410
Whatever.

354
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,420
Then Elizabeth.

355
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,400
Done.

356
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,050
Xin, you're getting more skilled.

357
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,310
That's basically her.

358
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,930
Do you need help?

359
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,350
It's okay.

360
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,030
Your magic macchiato.

361
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,010
Master, please enjoy.

362
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,480
What is this?

363
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,000
It's so ugly.

364
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,000
The big eyes.

365
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,660
And the long eyelashes.

366
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,790
Are you mocking me?

367
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,680
This is Elizabeth.

368
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,870
It's a pet in GINTAMA.

369
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,090
What pet looks so ugly?

370
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,020
The big eyes.

371
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,370
The long eyelashes.

372
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,720
Are you sure you're not mocking me?

373
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,990
Get your boss here.

374
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,010
I need to talk with him.

375
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,660
Is this the right way to treat your master?

376
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,630
Master, please keep your voice down.

377
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,640
There are other guests here.

378
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,910
If you don't like it,

379
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,890
I'll get you another cup.

380
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,940
Another cup? So that you can
continue to mock me?

381
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,720
Can you stop being so unreasonable?

382
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,870
I'm unreasonable?

383
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,650
I think you are unreason…

384
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,390
You're heartless.

385
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,180
You are shameless.

386
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,210
You're unreasonable.

387
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,180
Elizabeth is so cute.

388
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,090
How could you say it's ugly?

389
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,220
Are you here to make trouble?

390
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,350
It's none of your business.

391
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,380
Don't go too far.

392
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,710
Okay.

393
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,190
I won't make a scene

394
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,380
as long as you apologize to me.

395
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,320
I'm sorry.

396
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,730
That's it?

397
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,440
What do you still want?

398
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,540
Kneel down.

399
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,860
What are you doing?

400
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,960
Don't you know how to kneel down?

401
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,850
This guest,

402
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,670
you're not welcome here.

403
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,550
Please get out.

404
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,760
I also don't want to stay here.

406
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:00,760
You take that back!

407
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,620
Who are you calling idiots?

408
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,430
Don't flaunt your ignorance here!

409
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,250
Watch your mouth!

410
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,280
Please get out.

411
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,410
You are not welcome here.

412
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,620
I also don't want to stay.

413
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,140
Move!

414
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,800
Are you okay?

415
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,970
I'm fine.

416
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,520
How about this?

417
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,950
Go home to have a rest.

418
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,920
You look preoccupied these days.

419
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,930
Go home to have a rest and get relaxed.

420
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,210
Thank you, Xin.

421
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,540
I'll get a cloth to clean up here.

422
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,050
Go ahead.

Look, there's really a Saiki Kusuo.

00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,530
I thought since Yamazaki Kento
cos-played him,

432
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,760
no one has dared to challenge this character.

433
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,010
A cup of latte, please.

Mr. Saiki Kusuo.

435
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,330
I remember you use telepathy all the time.

436
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,600
You never speak.

437
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,680
I am using telepathy to communicate with you.

438
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:37,940
What?

I am using telepathy to communicate with you!

What did you say?

441
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,530
I didn't get it. Your speaking is instinct.

442
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,880
A cup of latte.

443
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,130
Come on.

444
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,690
Find a place to get seated.

445
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,000
There will be no place when more people come.

446
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,930
Why are you cos-playing a male today?

447
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:57,670
Cool, right?

448
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,510
I wanted to be Sebastian.

449
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,410
But my limbs are not long enough.

450
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,120
So I could only cos-play Ciel.

451
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,640
I think it's cute.

452
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,640
If I had known it earlier,

453
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,610
I would have cos-played Sebastian.

454
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:15,120
Your character is also good. Really.

455
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,560
After all, he has superpower.

456
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,550
I'll get you coffee.

457
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,380
Today, we have a little surprise for you,

458
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,390
dear masters.

459
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,250
Sebastian, the Black Butler,

460
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,220
has come to our castle.

461
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,140
And,

462
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,650
he will play the violin to add to the fun.

463
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,420
Let's welcome him!

464
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,840
This Sebastian is doing a vivid cos-play.

465
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,130
And he can play the violin.

466
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,570
Master, your dinner, please.

467
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,300
What's this?

468
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,460
Isn't this your favorite coffee pudding?

469
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,780
I prefer strawberry pudding.

470
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,240
Who's this Sebastian?

471
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,970
I've no idea.

472
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,860
Maybe a friend of the owner's.

473
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,890
Or he just came here to have fun.

474
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,470
I've never seen him before.

475
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,100
He's a good violin player.

476
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,260
Very professional.

477
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,960
But why is he

478
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,340
dressed as Sebastian?

479
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,230
Have you talked about it?

480
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,830
No, I don't even know him.

481
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,080

482
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,180

484
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,520
has almost reached the acme of perfection.

Nice to meet you.

491
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,310
Aren't you going to shake hands with me?

492
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,800
This is not like you.

493
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,800
Sir, I'm sorry

494
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,720
to offend you.

495
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,400
Is this your first time here?

496
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,300

00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,680
You recognized me at the first sight?

506
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,370
Do you think you're in a costume drama?

507
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,150
You wear a beard and a night suit.

508
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,240
and then I can't see you?

509
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,960
With that height and your way of walking,

510
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,910
it's hard not to recognize you.

511
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,910
What's wrong with you?

512
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,730
Why did you suddenly come here today?

513
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,800
You look furtive.

514
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,740
I came to take part in the cos-play.

515
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,310
What of it?

516
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,360
Guru Ye and dogs not admitted?

517
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,330
I…

518
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,190
It's the first time that I've heard
somebody call himself a dog.

519
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,090
It's okay that you wanted to do a role play.

520
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,380
Why did you wear a mask?

521
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,080
Are you chatting inside?

522
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,990
Kids,

523
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,500
go to play somewhere else.

524
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,060
Don't play in the dressing room
or the bathroom.

525
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:53,480
What do we do?

526
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,860
I am using the toilet.

527
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,210
What's the matter?

528
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,920
I just heard the voice of two people.

529
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,080
Why is there only one person now?

530
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,830
I'm talking to myself.

531
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,650
Be quick.

532
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,330
Just this cubicle is left uncleaned.

533
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,140
How did you know that?

534
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,850
Because I have a brain.

535
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,880
Why are all cubicles taken?

536
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,650
I can't hold it.

537
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,510
Boy, ask the one out in this cubicle.

538
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,700
He has been inside for long.

539
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,000
Ask if he could hurry up.

540
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,000
Bro, bro, make it quick.

541
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,180
I can't hold it.

542
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,480
It's urgent. Help me.

543
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,630
What do we do?

544
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,370
Get ready.

545
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,050
Sebastian. Seba…

546
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,780
I like Black Butler most.

547
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,890
I didn't expect to see one

548
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,260
with such a high similarity.

549
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,520
Yes, yes.

550
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,900
Could you reproduce

551
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,360
the classic pose in Black Butler?

552
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,660
Your charming smile.

553
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,450
This height difference is just right.

554
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,810
Stand closer. Stand closer.

555
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,360
Yeah, right, right, right.

556
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:56,990
Closer, closer.

557
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,150
Sebastian, your…

558
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,140
Your 45-degree bow.

559
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,470
Right!

560
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,430
Right, right, right.

561
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,180
That's it.

562
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,820
Sebastian, smile.

563
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,250
You should make some eye contact.

564
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,010
Right, right, right.

565
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,590
Good.

566
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,010
Hold it.

567
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:16,810
Erduo.

568
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,270
Did you agree in advance?

569
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,880
You cos-play Ciel.

570
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,480
You cos-play Sebastian.

571
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,040
No, no.

572
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,100
It's just a coincidence, really.

573
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,450
Why don't you take a picture together?

574
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,620
Sure, of course.

575
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,430
Come on.

576
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,530
Three.

577
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,590
Two.
