Mr. Ye, is Miss Bei

4
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,810
very important to you?

5
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,950
Why did you ask so?

6
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,780
Only when you care about her

7
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,600
will you feel happy for her progress.

8
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,600
When others praise her,

9
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,050
you feel as if you were praised, too.

10
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,050
Because

11

it's the way we usually get along.

12

Sometimes, I want to care more about her,

13
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,470
but I don't know how.

14
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,250
She seldom shows

15
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,960
how eagerly she wants something.

16
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,330
I don't know why,

17
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,070
but her emotions begin to affect me.

18
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,480
I feel sad, too.

19
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,480
So, I just want to try

20
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,520

of Season 2 of LOVING is
Meng Fan and Liu Yike.

172
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,510
Congratulations.

173
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,100
Let Miss Etiquette bring them

174
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,170
the check reward of 500,000 yuan.

175

Again, congratulations.

(Gate No. 3 of Studio No. 1)
And thank you for supporting them.

178
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,350
Miss Bei,

179
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,820
why were you and Ye Shuwei absent

180
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,400
from this episode?

181
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,940
Miss Bei, some sources say

182
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,160
that you and Ye Shuwei broke up.

183
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,040
Is this true?

184
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,360
Why are you here alone for the show?

185
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,750
Why didn't you appear on the stage?

186
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,130
Did he cheat on you?

187
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,360
Now that I'm here,

188
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,480
I will not avoid your questions.

189
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,600
And he didn't cheat on me.

190
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,990
I clarified it a long time ago.

191
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,350
Excuse me.

192
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,980
Excuse me, everybody.

193
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,800
Sorry,

194
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,820
but she doesn't do the interview.

195
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,700
Please kindly leave.

196
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,810
Let's go.

197
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,290
Ye Shuwei didn't cheat on me.

198
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,730
We didn't break up, either.

199
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,410
Ye Shuwei and I decided together

200
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,400
to participate in this variety show.

201
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,650
So, when he wasn't here,

202
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,410
I had no reason to appear on the stage alone.

203
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,340
Tonight, Ye Shuwei failed

204
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,480
to come here for a subjective reason.

205
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,910
It has nothing to do with the show crew.

206
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,100
But I hope

207
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,310
you can give us some privacy.

208
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,210
Thank you.

209
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,380
Sorry, everybody.

210
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,500
You had a long day.

211
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,820
Let me drive you home.

212
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,060
Mr. Yu, drive to this hospital.

213
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,320
Okay. It's in the neighboring hospital.

214
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,900
No wonder I didn't find
his record in local hospitals.

215
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,650
Um...

216
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,640
Thank you so much.

217
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,920
On my way here,

218
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,530
the nurse told me what happened.

219
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,380
You're welcome. It's no big deal.

220
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,300
It was just a coincidence.

221
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,240
You stay and take care of him.

222
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,030
I'm really grateful to you.

223
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,280
I'll find you later to express my gratitude.

224

Don't bother.

225
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,490
I won't stay to disturb him.

226

Thank you.

227
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,390
Let me walk you out.

228
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,090
Okay.

229

He helped someone, but ended up in hospital.

230
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,360
Luckily, his condition isn't serious,
according to the doctor.

231
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,550
And he'll wake up tomorrow.

232
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,910
Erduo, have something to eat.

233
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,000
You had nothing to eat for dinner.

It's already two in the morning.

235
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,570
Mr. Yu, help yourself.

236
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,840
I'm not hungry.

237
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,660
I'll leave it here.

238

Eat it when you're hungry.

239

Ye Shuwei's car was towed away.

240

The police gave me his belongings.

So, you went for this.

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,980
sufficient information.

267

From her works, I heard her improvement

268
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,710
in the dubbing.

Excuse me,

Miss Bei.

272
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,010
Her early problems are

273
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,370
that she didn't dub fluently

274
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,030
and she couldn't make pauses perfectly.

275
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,950
The rhythm problem will affect
the cooperation of her partner.

276
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,520
But later, she overcame

277
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,070
such problems.

278
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,690
Mr. Ye, is Miss Bei

very important to you?

280
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,220
I haven't done too much for her.

281
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,260
Actually, I feel quite lucky

282
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,330
to have this chance.

283
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,120
What makes you say so?

284
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,720
Because

285
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,620
it's the way we usually get along.

286
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,370
Sometimes, I want to care more about her,

287
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,460
but I don't know how.

288
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,790
She seldom shows

289
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,870
how eagerly she wants something.

290
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,150
This time,

00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,210
when she can't come to your lecture,

292
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,320
I think she's really upset.

293

I don't know why,

294

but her emotions begin to affect me.

I feel sad, too.

00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,850
He's all right.

342
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,690
It's okay.

343
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,530
Go have some sleep. We'll take care of him.

344
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,170
Go.

345
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:47,640
Yes, yes.

346
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,990
I'm okay.

347
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,130
Your hair is messy.

348
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,050
What are you doing?

349
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,430
You're awake?

350
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,140
Son, you're awake?

351
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,210
You're awake?

352
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,470
How do you feel?

353
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,260
Not bad.

354
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,030
How was the show?

355
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,350
It was over.

356
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,410
Don't bother to think about it now.

357
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,010
I'll go get the doctor.

358
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,550
Okay. Go ahead.

359
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,120
Off you go.

360
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,250
Mars, thank you so much this time.

361
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,270
This is our worker's mistake.

362
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,890
So, I'm so sorry.

363
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,380
Oh, it's okay. You don't need
to worry, I told you.

364
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,810
You don't need to apologize, either.

365
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,950
It's my pleasure.

366
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:29,960
Thank you.

367
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,900
Hello. The coffee for you.

368
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,240
Thank you.

369
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,390
Thank you.

370
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,610
Let's try this famous Chinese coffee.

371
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,290
Yeah, you want sugar?

372
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,810
Darling, whenever I'm with you,
I don't need sugar.

373
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,590
There's already sweetness in the air.

374
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:53,800
Excuse me.

375
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,560
Excuse me.

376
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,010
Are you Mars,

377
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,800
the Italian violin maker?

378
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,890
I am.

379
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,830
Hello. I also play the violin.

380
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,600
Could we have your autograph?

381
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,910
Yes.

382
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,980
I'm going to the bathroom.

383
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,920
Okay.

384
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:15,820
Done.

385
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:16,680
Thank you.

386
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,290
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

387
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,280
Shall we invite you to a pub tonight?

388
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,490
Sorry,

389
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,880
but I adore a girl.

390
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,920
So, I can't hang out

391
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,370
with other girls.

392
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,070
It's okay. It's okay.

393
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,500
Go.

394
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:30,880
Thank you.

395
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,710
Thank you. Thank you.

396
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,590
Go, go.

397
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,160
Mars is quite devoted.

398
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,420
We invited him to a pub,
but he turned us down.

399
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,450
I thought foreigners loved pubs.

400
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,540
Didn't he just explain?

401
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,340
He adores a girl

402
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,980
and he won't hang out with other girls.

403
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,880
Save your breath.

404
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,790
But he's so charming.

405
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,580
He is.

406
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,180
I heard

407
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,200
that you turned down two pretty girls.

408
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,690
The prettiest girl is sitting
across the table.

409
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,580
There's a good pub.

410
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,410
You can have fun there.

411
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,030
I'm not interested.

412
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,320
The girl I adore is beside me.

413
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,180
I won't hang out
with any other girls in a pub.

414
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,860
Don't you fear that your fans will be angry?

415
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,220
Maybe it'll make me more popular.

416
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,620
Excuse me for a minute.

417
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,650
Hello, Erduo.

418
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,710
What?

419
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,030
How's he now?

420
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,420
I'm having coffee with Mars.

421
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,190
Okay. Don't worry.

422
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,020
I'll be right there.

423
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,530
What happened?

424
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,890
Something happened. Let's get there.

425
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,150
Come on.

426
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,010
Does it taste good?

427
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,430
It's too hot.

428
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,730
Let me cool it.

429
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,050
Hello.

430
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,250
Thank you. Thank you.

431
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,490
You're welcome.

432
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,780
Erduo, come over.

433
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,040
How are you holding up?

434
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,480
Not bad.

435
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,250
How's Ye Shuwei?

436
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,080
He's very well.

437
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,560
You missed the last episode.

438
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,500
What a pity!

439
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,260
That was close.

440
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,780
I'm glad he's all right.

441
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,670
But you failed to get the bonus.

442
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,650
Your fund for going to Japan...

443
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,220
I see that you're being taken good care of.

444
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,370
Is there a saying

445
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:40,050
that sweet goals make men mental?

446
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,340
Sweet girls make men gentle.

447
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,320
Yep. Exactly.

448
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,080
By the way, there's still plenty of time
before the deadline.

449
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,810
You don't need to worry about anything.

450
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,010
You just get better.

451
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,180
If there's anything that I can do
to help you with,

452
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,690
just let me know.

453
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:07,850
Thank you.

454
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:11,690
A new necklace?

455
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,540
I bought it before, all right?

456
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,500
I bought some fruit. Oranges and apples...

457
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,940
Long time no see.

458
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,770
There you are.

459
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,030
Would you like some fruit?

460
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,630
I'll go wash it.

461
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,650
Don't bother. We're leaving in a minute.

462
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,850
Come on.

463
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,400
Who's this man?

464
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,080
Mr. Yu. My ex-boss.

465
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,020
He's your ex-boss?

466
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,080
Yeah.

467
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,780
This is Mars.

468
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,390
My partner for the moment.

469
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,180
Darling, I'm not only your partner,

470
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,650
but also your admirer.

471
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,060
Come on, Li.

472
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,610
You can sue him for sexual harassment at work.

473
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,300
I'm serious, you...

474
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,020
I'm warning you.

475
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,910
Don't.

476
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,210
Mars, stop joking, please.

477
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,420
I'm not joking.

478
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,890
Including this time,

479
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,330
I've confessed my love to you 23 times.

480
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,300
You know what?

481
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,200
Don't touch her.

482
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,480
Show some respect, will you?

483
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,290
Let go of me!

484
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't need your concern.

485
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,320
We'll leave you alone.

486
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,390
Mars, let's go.

487
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,770
Bye-bye.

488
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,870
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

489
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
[Surgical Inpatient Department]

490
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,780
Your ex-boss doesn't look so friendly.

491
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,860
- Be careful!
- What's wrong?

492
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,560
Thank you.

493
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,220
Alicia,

494
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,780
you have prettier than you were yesterday.

495
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,810
Are you saying
I'm prettier than I was yesterday?

496
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,560
Tomorrow, you'll be prettier, too.

497
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,210
Here's the thing.

498
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,530
I want to visit the pub
you told me about yesterday.

499
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,340
Okay. I will take you there.

500
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,490
Perfect.

501
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,660
Erduo, I'll leave my uncle to you.

502
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,020
I've got work to do and I'll take my leave.

503
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,730
Rest assured.

504
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,560
See you.

505
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,780
Would you like to lie in bed for a while?

506
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:11,380
I'm all right.

507
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,740
I've been lying all these days.

508
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,740
I'll just sit for a while.

509
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:21,890
Lean on it.

510
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,720
Thank you.

511
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,290
Erduo.

512
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:51,680
My apologies.

513
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,400
Sorry that I missed the last episode

514
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,070
so that you didn't get the bonus.

515
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,500
I know the money matters a lot to you.

516
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,800
So...

517
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,180
If there's anything I can help you with,

518
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,070
let me know.

519
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,200
I appreciate your kindness.

520
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,390
But I will take care

521
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,930
of my own problem.

522
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,420
Don't worry about me.

523
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,020
What you should do is

524
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,850
get very healthy.

525
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,440
Don't bother to worry about anything else.

526
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,110
And it wasn't your fault.

527
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,330
Don't say sorry.

528
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,060
Why don't you get up for a rest?

529
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,020
I'll be done cooking soon.

530
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,640
Fine, then. Thank you.

531
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,330
Ye Shuwei,

532
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,600
what's wrong? Do you feel unwell?

533
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,970
No. I'm just a little bit tired.

534
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,100
Stop it.

535
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,500
I've divided up the pills for you.

536
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,960
These are for the morning.

537
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,320
These are for the noon and evening.
They're divided up.

538
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,190
Don't muddle them.

539
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,480
And take the pills half an hour after meals.

540
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,120
Remember?

541
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:28,940
Erduo,

542
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,610
I'm not a little kid.

543
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,580
You don't need to supervise me like this.

544
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,300
But you're a patient.

545
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,580
A patient must take pills and rest regularly.

546
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,020
Fine. You call the shots.

547
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,260
Well, Ye Shuwei, get to the bed, please.

548
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,650
It's the beef I just boiled.

549
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,530
It'll taste bad after a long time.

550
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,630
Let me eat it on your behalf.

551
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,050
But...

552
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,350
It tastes perfect.

553
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,860
Forge it. Let it be.

554
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,710
Miss Bei, what's the good news?

555
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,880
You seldom invite me to lunch.

556
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,410
There's certainly good news.

557
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,780
I passed the N1 test.

558
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,940
I'm also likely to get a scholarship.

559
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,170
Congratulations.

560
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,150
Wish you'll get everything you want.

561
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:53,370
Look, I finally passed the N1 test.

562
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,200
But after the courses of this semester,

563
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,640
I'm not going to school.

564
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,830
And I can no longer

565
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,060
give you lessons.

566
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,660
Why?

567
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,650
Don't you want to make more money?

568
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,510
If it's because of me...

569
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:10,930
No, no, no.

570
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,090
I simply want to fully support Ye Shuwei.

571
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,120
There's one month to go
before his competition.

572
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,970
He still has some sequelae

573
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,690
from the car accident.

574
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,170
It's not a bad idea to stay with him

575
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,380
and take care of him.

576
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,210
What about your job?

577
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,610
What about your dream of studying aboard?

578
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,930
I'll still do the dubbing job.

579
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,210
I may be a little bit tired.

580
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,690
But that's life, right?

581
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,290
If you take care of him and work,
you'll lose more than gain.

582
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,500
How about this?

583
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,140
I'll give you three months' tuition fee
in advance.

584
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,850
Don't. I can use my time properly.

585
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,210
Here's another thing.

586
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,310
There's a girl who speaks Japanese

587
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,280
much better than me.

588
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,530
She can give you lessons in the future.

589
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:02,140
She's nice and patient.

590
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,180
I'll share her WeChat account with you later.

591
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,530
Mom.

592
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,210
Mom.

593
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,630
What soup are you making?

594
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,320
Me?

595
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,690
Don't mess with it.

596
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,040
I...

597
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,690
Swine brain soup
with gastrodia and wolfberries.

598
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,570
Come on.

599
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,440
Don't mess with it.

600
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,450
What on earth are you doing here?

601
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,020
Swine brain?

602
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,660
Why? For your own brain?

603
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,330
Not me.

604
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,770
Didn't you say Ye Shuwei had a concussion?

605
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,690
For his brain,

606
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,330
I'm then making the swine brain soup

607
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,300
with supplemental nutrition.

608
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,470
When you bring the soup to him, ask him

609
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,850
to drink it up.

610
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:53,990
It's extremely efficacious.

611
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,970
I've also had some walnuts bought for him.

612
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,270
Bring them to him, too.

613
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,010
Why are you so nice to him?

614
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,320
You haven't even been so nice to me.

615
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,540
What are you talking about?

616
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,840
Don't you remember?

617
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,610
When I was in hospital, he helped a lot.

618
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,420
Shouldn't I care about him, too?

619
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,530
He's in hospital, after all.

620
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,380
You make sense.

621
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,430
Let me remind you.

622
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,840
Lately,

623
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,010
don't do the dubbing work.

624
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,800
When you have time, go to the hospital

625
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,210
and stay with Ye Shuwei.

626
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,090
Get along with him.

627
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,550
Get along?

628
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,490
We always get along very well.

629
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,250
Come on.

630
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,920
Why do I have

631
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,110
such a stupid daughter?

632
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,260
Am I really talking about that?

633
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:39,900
I'm asking you

634
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,210
to be in a relationship with him.

635
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,490
He's from a good family and he's excellent.

636
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,100
Be a good girlfriend
and don't be of two minds.

637
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,520
What are you talking about?

638
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,930
I hear his parents are artists.

639
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,430
If you have a child after getting married...

640
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,080
Stop, Mom.

641
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,020
...he'll have an artistic temperament.

642
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,800
Don't wander from the subject.

643
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,420
What getting married?

644
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,260
I'm going to study in Japan.

645
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,740
We're not getting married.

646
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,690
Study what?

647
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:02,500
You're no longer young.

648
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,890
Why will you still study?
