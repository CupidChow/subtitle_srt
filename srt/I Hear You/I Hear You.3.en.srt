00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,130
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,520
It's okay. Let's go together.

177
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,660
I can practice bicycle riding.

178
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,310
And we're also on the same direction.

179
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,720
The same direction?

180
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,240
I'm going to have a rehearsal today.

181
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,860
So I won't go home.

182
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,390
Okay.

183
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,750
Is that guy in the show

184
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,260
really you boyfriend?

185
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,030
For now. I'm not sure about the future.

186
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,760
I've got to go, Le Tian.

187
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,590
Tomorrow's theme is an evening party
for knights and princess.

188
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,480
You'll have an archery competition tomorrow,

189
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,750
and we'll rank your scores.

190
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,940
Your ranking will decide

191
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,330
which costume you can get for the party.

192
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,340
Now,

193
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,570
let's give a warm applause

194
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,830
and have the two teachers show us the dance.

195
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,900
Excellent!

196
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,600
Really great.

197
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,920
Yeah, perfect.

198
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,340
Right.

199
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,500
That's it, students.

200
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,620
Waltz is very easy.

201
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,950
Stand up and let's give it a try together.

202
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,760
Find yourself a partner.

203
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,890
Okay, get you posture prepared.

204
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,090
Let's practice measured steps first.

205
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,890
Men's hands should be of arc shape.

206
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,070
Relax. Right.

207
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,030
Thumb. Other four fingers close together.

208
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,630
Lady, your thumb.

209
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,520
Here.

210
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,710
Good. You stand too far for this dance.

211
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,650
Come closer.

212
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,520
Right, half of your body
is against each other.

213
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,320
Here we go. One, two, three.

214
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,830
One, two, three.

215
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,290
Okay, keep practicing.

216
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,910
You stepped on my foot.

217
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,080
Sorry, I'm sorry.

218
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Ye Shuwei, could you take smaller steps?

219
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,520
I can't keep up.

220
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,120
All right.

221
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,130
Okay. Now you can practice
the second movement, the rotation.

222
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,800
Practice the rotation.

223
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,670
Gentleman, put you hand on the lady's waist.

224
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,150
Push away.

225
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,730
Push your hands away. Good.

226
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,590
Ladies, look at your fingers.

227
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,210
Okay. Turn.

228
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,250
One.

229
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,380
Two.

230
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,540
Three.

231
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,950
Hug her leg.

232
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,860
Turn.

233
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,770
Okay.

234
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,090
Turn.

235
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,760
Lower her down.

236
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,700
One, two, three. Get up.

237
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,570
You really should hit the gym more.

238
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,800
You've gained weight, okay?

239
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,010
I've told you many times

240
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,980
that exercise means not only muscles

241
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,220
but also weight control.

242
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,700
Then it's my fault?

243
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,930
You stepped on me again?

244
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,780
Are you trying to cripple me?

245
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,500
All right, students.

246
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
That's all for today's class.

247
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,080
Find time to practice more after you go back.

248
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,880
Goodbye, everyone.

249
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,160
Goodbye, teachers.

250
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,920
Everyone, wish you good luck tomorrow.

251
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,290
Come on!

252
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,840
[SUGARENT ENTERTAINMENT]

253
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,770
Erduo.

254
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,990
Have you asked Ye Shuwei
about the class reunion?

255
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,660
Yeah.

256
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,470
I asked him on WeChat
but he still hasn't replied.

257
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,020
This is so awkward.

258
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,360
Maybe he missed your message.

259
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,830
Mr. Yu has gone to pick him up.

260
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,360
They should be here in a minute.

261
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,090
Let's discuss about the recording

262
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,360
of the next episode of the program.

263
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,040
Later you can ask him directly later.

264
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,090
He's coming?

265
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,520
That will be embarrassing.

266
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,140
No, I must slip away now.

267
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,880
As for the next epidose,

268
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,600
recording and whatever,

269
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,930
tell me after I get home.

270
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,800
You are…

271
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:55,770
Let go of me.

272
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,280
Don't you stop me! What are you doing?

273
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,440
What are you doing? Let go of me.

274
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,040
Sister Li.

275
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,740
Mom.

276
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,820
It's all right, just go.

277
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,010
Mom.
Aunt.

278
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,190
Go home with me.

279
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,250
I'm working.

280
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,980
Aunt, we are talking about work.

281
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,520
Would you like to rest in the VIP room first?

282
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,130
Right, right, right.

283
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,680
What rest? What work?

284
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,260
You are so brave now!

285
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,540
You want a free life?

286
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,040
How dare you quit your job
without telling me?

287
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,070
Are you out of your mind?

288
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,960
Mom, please listen to me.

289
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,870
Listen what?

290
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,910
I can forgive you about that.

291
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,900
But now you are

292
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,640
having a relationship with a stranger!

293
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,680
What are you doing?

294
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,880
Aunt, calm down.

295
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,460
Relax. Have a good talk.

296
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,140
Tang Li, I think I treat you well.

297
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,190
How could you get her involved

298
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,190
in this kind of program?

299
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,890
After your program is on the air,

300
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,970
how could she get married?

301
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,180
And how?

302
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:39,660
Aunt.

303
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,370
What are you saying?

304
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:40,730
Aunt, I…

305
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,220
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

306
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,980
Come home with me.

307
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,780
No, Mom.

308
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,060
Aunt, Aunt, I…

309
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,090
You.

310
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,610
Stop it.

311
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,370
Are you the Ye…

312
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,880
I don't care about your name.

313
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,860
Tell me,

314
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,530
are you dating my daughter?

315
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,420
Answer my question.

316
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,180
Yes.

317
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,700
Yes? Good.

318
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,800
Then what do you do for a living?

319
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,570
What's your job?

320
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,390
Violin maker.

321
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,390
Violin maker?

322
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,120
Some kind of carpenter?

323
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,020
That's not wrong.

324
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,250
You…

325
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,850
Aunt, calm down. Take it easy.

326
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,150
Please sit and have some water.
Let's have a nice talk.

327
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,930
Hands off me.

328
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,340
Get your hands off me.

329
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,730
What do you think you are?

330
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,020
Have your parents never told you

331
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,520
that it's very rude

332
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,680
to casually interrupt the talking

333
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,610
of your elders?

334
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,310
Well, well, well.

335
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,130
Please tell me

336
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,500
what future you could have

337
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,040
as a carpenter

338
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,910
who does dirty work every day.

339
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,330
Listen well, all of you.

340
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,190
I'm not an ignorant woman.

341
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,420
Do you know who made
all the furniture in my house?

342
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,140
Do you know Carpenter Hu,

343
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,210
the most famous one in town?

344
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,230
All the furniture in our house

345
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,180
was made by him.

346
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,760
Carpenter Hu is already that famous.

347
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
But how much he earns for a wardrobe?

348
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,390
I know it very well.

349
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Now you, a violin maker.

350
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,620
A violin is much smaller than a wardrobe.

351
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,140
So how much is it worth?

352
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,130
Mom, what are you talking about?

353
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:17,900
Keep your voice down.

354
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,410
Could you show some respect?

355
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,640
Respect for everyone.

356
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,170
Let go of me.

357
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,280
I'm doing it all for your good, aren't I?

358
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,620
I want you to have a good future.

359
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,410
Good. Everyone is here today.

360
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,050
Then I'll make it clear to you.

361
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,700
I will never allow my daughter

362
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,660
to be in a relationship with a carpenter.

363
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,820
I can't stand by

364
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,350
and watch her bright future ruined.

365
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,030
Go home with me.

366
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,480
Come.

367
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,460
I'm not leaving.

368
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,080
Where are you going?

369
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,280
Take your things and go home with me.

370
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,930
You don't even know the truth.
You really want to go?

371
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,150
Where to go?

372
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,610
You won't listen to me, right?

373
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,370
You just don't want to listen to me, right?

374
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,450
Come on,

375
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,140
I've treated you well since childhood.

376
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,260
Well, now two years after your graduation,

377
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,880
two years, girl,

378
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,580
you still haven't got a stable job

379
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,160
and have no savings at all.

380
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,240
All you think every day

381
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,410
is to become a voice actress or somewhat.

382
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,060
All right, I can put up with all these.

383
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,890
But now,

384
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,510
you find yourself a carpenter

385
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,970
to be your boyfriend.

386
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,740
You are with him?

387
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,850
Don't you feel sorry for me?

388
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,160
Or you just want to piss me off?

389
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,070
You have nothing to say, right?

390
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,770
Aren't I telling the truth?

391
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,020
It must hurt.

392
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,830
Hurt a lot, right?

393
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,240
Aunt, Erduo is working very hard.

394
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,750
She is just…

395
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,500
You shut up!

396
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,690
Stop talking nonsense.

397
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,500
Get your things now.

398
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,590
Your bag, where's your bag?

399
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,220
This is your phone, right? Get your bag.

400
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,780
Go with me.

401
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,950
I'm not leaving.

402
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,130
Yeah, everything I've done is a mistake.

403
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,790
Whatever you say is always right.

404
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,640
I don't deserve to be your daughter.

405
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,660
I don't deserve to be his girlfriend, okay?

406
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,850
We've signed a contract.

407
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,920
If she leaves in the middle of the filming,

408
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,970
Bei Erduo will have to pay

409
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,290
a huge sum of penalty.

410
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,290
As far as I know,

411
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,290
she can't afford the amount.

412
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,270
You…
Yes.

413
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,050
If She breaches the contract unilaterally,

414
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,840
Miss Bei will need to compensate

415
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,860
about 1,500,000 yuan.

416
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:21,820
1…

417
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,980
Plus the advertisers and sponsors,

418
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,180
the total fee will stand

419
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,460
at some 3,000,000 yuan.

420
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,130
Three million?

421
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,380
You…

422
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,260
She's aware of it.

423
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:35,970
There's her signature.

424
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,160
Yes.

425
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,040
We've told her about it clearly

426
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,690
when she signed the contract.

427
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,560
The contract is legally effective.

428
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,010
If you take her away now,

429
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,350
it will be a breach of contract.

430
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,010
Then you must pay the penalty immediately.

431
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,400
Otherwise, our company
will get the police involved

432
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:50,990
and go through the judicial procedure.

433
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,290
But if Bei Erduo

434
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,850
continues to participate in this show,

435
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,390
you will have a big amount of income soon.

436
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,260
No, she'll gain both fame and fortune.

437
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,480
Yes, Aunt.

438
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,860
There are already agents

439
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,670
who contacted me to

440
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,980
get Bei Erduo's information

441
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,660
and sign her as a star.

442
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,920
And most importantly,

443
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,790
our program

444
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,530
is now the most popular one,

445
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,180
with over ten million of view
for a single episode.

446
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,260
We're No.1.

447
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,250
With a simple math,

448
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,480
you'll know how many fans

449
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,320
she could get from last episode

450
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,380
and how many star agents

would want her, a girl who's so cute,

452

pretty and talented.

Well, are you saying

454
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,140
my daughter will be a star in the future?

455
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,890
Yes, and in the near future.

456
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,900
You really have such a lovely daughter.

457
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,720
Aunt, you must have been a beauty

458

when you were young.

If not you, who could

460
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,290
give birth to such a perfect girl?

461
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,330
Lovely face, sweet voice.

462
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,810
And hard-working.

463
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,840
She has it in her to be a star.

464
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,880
Our company also plans

465
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,800
to renew the contract with Miss Bei

466
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,170
after this program is over.

467
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,910
If you like,

468
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,910
you can come and be her agent.

469

Then you'll be fully responsible
for her personal business.

470
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,180
Who is he?

471
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,220
Aunt, he is the boss of our company.

472
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,530
You can trust him.

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,800
Couldn't I criticize you a little bit?

481
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,280
Didn't you feel embarrassed?

482
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,660
Now you know it's embarrassing.

483
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,580
Then why did you lecture me in front of them?

484
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,770
I've signed the contract

485
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,160
so it's also a job.

486
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,120
Do you really think

487
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,610
that crap is a job?

488
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,520
But why didn't you tell me

489
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,900
about the penalty

490
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,190
for not taking part in the program?

491
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,840
You wouldn't listen to me.

492
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,430
You think you're doing so great?

493
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,790
You got a boyfriend who's a carpenter

494
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,650
and a job in that program.

495
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,700
Now if you don't join it,
we need to pay a penalty.

Don't call me Mom. That doesn't work.

From now on, you must do as I just said

Ms. Bei, who did this to you?

517
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,560
I'll let this person suffer.

518
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,420
My mom.

519
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,970
Last question.

520
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,530
Why did you take part in that program?

521
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,330
It was an accident.

522
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,930
Hello, Mom. What's the matter?

523
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,520
Erduo, have you finished your class?

524
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,260
It's just over.

525
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,890
Let me tell you something.

526
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,250
Last time I got heatstroke.

527
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,790
Luckily, Aunt Zhang took good care of me.

528
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,560
A good neighbor is better
than a distant relative.

529
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,170
Oh what?

530
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,570
Shouldn't we thank her for it?

531
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,520
I've booked a restaurant

532
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,250
to invite your Aunt Zhang over for lunch.

533
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,180
But now I'm dealing with an insurance.

534
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,050
So I'll be a little late.

535
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,660
You go there now and keep her accompany.

536
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,360
This is about manners.

537
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,340
Don't be late.

538
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,330
I'll send you the address later.

539
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:16,860
Okay.

540
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:17,770
Bye-bye.

541
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:26,630
[JOY ROOM]

542
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,330
Pretty boys.

543
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,530
But why are they so expensive?

544
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,820
Erduo, you've watched them for many times.

545
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,340
Buy one if you like them.

546
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,050
I like them, but I don't have to own them.

547
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,270
I've felt happy enough

548
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,980
that I can often see them.

549
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,340
Come on.

550
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,000
You say that every time.

551
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,740
I'm tired of hearing it
even if you can still say it.

552
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,320
A little reminder.

553
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,050
You'd better save up quickly.

554
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,200
Many customers have shown interest in him.

555
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,920
No, Suda Sama.

556
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,960
Are you willing to let them leave?

557
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,450
I've got to go.

558
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,490
Bye-bye.

559
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,450
I'll visit you next time.

560
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,080
Which one did the short girl like just now?

561
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,450
I'm also not very sure.

562
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,890
I just know that she stands here

563
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,290
to watch them every time.

564
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,250
Then I'll buy them all.

565
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,570
All… All of them?

566
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,450
This row?

567
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,660
This whole wall.

568
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,950
Please wait. I'll give you a suitcase.

569
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,810
Hello.

570
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,370
I've already reserved this seat.

571
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,550
Are you sitting in the wrong place?

572
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,040
You must be Bei Erduo.

573
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,450
I'm the cousin of Aunt Zhang's

574
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,130
sister's nephew's classmate.

575
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,680
My name is Chen Chen.

576
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,520
You could call me Dr. Chen.

577
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,060
So Aunt Zhang hasn't come yet, right?

578
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,180
Aunt Zhang?

579
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,520
What would she come?

580
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,990
Excuse me, I need to make a phone call.

581
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,120
Just a phone call.

582
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,370
Get our food served.

583
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,740
Mom,

584
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,000
did you find me in a trash can
and take me home?

585
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,840
Why are you saying that?

586
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,710
How's the boy? How's it going?

587
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,710
Nothing is going on.

588
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,140
I'll go to tell him the truth.

589
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,160
Aunt Zhang did it out of kindness.

590
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,000
Besides, she saved

591
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,360
your mother's life.

592
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,280
You could at least chat with him a little.

593
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,450
Or how will I explain to Aunt Zhang?

594
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,890
Mom, I have a boyfriend.

595
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,150
What of it?

596
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,960
This one is at least a doctor.

597
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,020
He has fame and fortune alike.

598
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,470
Isn't he much better than your carpenter?

599
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,700
All right, all right, all right. I got it.

600
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,420
I bought a small villa for getting married.

601
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,070
Not very big, just around 300 square meters.

602
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,180
I also invest a little.

603
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,280
But I can't tell you too much now.

604
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,480
It's a business secret.

605
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,880
As for assets,

606
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,900
one is born and die without them.

607
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,100
I don't care.

608
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,720
Thus I went abroad to study music.

609
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,520
I want to live for art.

610
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,810
Well, Mr. Chen,

611
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,040
today, how about we…

612
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,010
Please call me Dr. Chen.

613
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,580
One more thing.

614
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,810
I never watch any anime.

615
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,690
Those things

616
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,890
are not refined arts.

617
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,420
I suggest that you get another job

618
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,430
while you're still young.

619
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,860
It's just pure communication.

620
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,960
Please don't mind.

621
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,380
Dr. Chen,

622
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,380
have you watched
Miyazaki Hayao's Spirited Away?

623
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,480
I think your work is also related with music.

624
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,250
I suggest you listen to the music

625
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,580
in the anime.

626
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,850
I've heard of the film.

627
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,490
But I don't have time to watch it.

628
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,780
You may think differently

629
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,770
after you watch it with patience.

630
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,960
You think those music works

631
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,750
are childish and not refined.

632
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,720
But they accompanied my growth

633
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,220
and gave me the courage

634
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,690
to pursue my dream.

635
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,180
To be honest, I want

636
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,420
to become an anime worker

637
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,400
and use my own strength

638
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,140
to convey the beauty of anime.

639
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,900
Now I sense our generation gap.

640
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,850
You take Joe Hisaishi as a great master.

641
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,210
But actually his works are all the same,

642
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,490
devoid of change and diversity.

643
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,030
I'm sorry

644
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,320
but as an expert in this field,

645
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,700
I felt an urge to express my opinion.

646
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,680
Please forgive me.

647
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,120
You must be the No.5.

648
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,800
It looks

649
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,770
you are poor in not only music appreciation

650
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,440
but also self-cognition.

651
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,020
Joe Hisaishi film soundtrack

652
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,520
is first-rate internationally.

653
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,330
He's a professional film music composer.

654
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,040
He didn't compose to express himself,

655
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,490
let alone to destroy the entirety

656
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,140
and harmony of art just to highlight himself.

657
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,700
He used music to serve the theme of the film,

658
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,940
which was not a defect, but a noble idea.

659
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,190
Sure enough,

660
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,410
this kind of nobility

661
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,160
can't be understood by ignorant common folks.

662
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:33,340
Let's go.

663
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,410
I can't park here for too long.

664
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,280
Please excuse me.

665
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,850
My boyfriend came to pick me up.

666
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,260
And there's no parking lot here.

667
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,610
I'm sorry.

668
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,770
Then why did you come for the blind date?

669
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,340
Marital fraud?

670
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,250
Boss Yu.

671
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,170
I just came to get a document.

672
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,540
This is really a bad time.

673
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,010
Stop, come back.

674
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,580
I saw that Ye Shuwei sent you back.

675
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,210
You two are going very well.

676
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,230
It was a coincidence that we met.

677
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,560
It was not.

678
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,820
Look, there's no such thing as coincidence

679
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,140
for Ye Shuwei.

680
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,760
You know what?

681
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,000
He has learned everything faster
than others since a kid.

682
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,140
And he excels in every subject.

683
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,440
No one has ever been his match.

684
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,520
So wherever he goes,

685
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,660
people call him Guru Ye.

686
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,720
Wait, wait, wait.

687
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,740
He can't that kind of person

688
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,860
as you just described.

689
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,250
If he hadn't ruined my interview,

690
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:03,900
how would I…

691
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,260
Wait a minute.

692
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,750
He ruined your interview?

693
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,870
We can do nothing about it
if you want to pull some strings.

694
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,210
But if you didn't prepare

695
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,230
to give us any chance,

696
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,640
what the point of organizing this interview?

697
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,440
Ye…

698
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:31,340
Ye Shuwei is a cold and celibate person.

699
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,060
How is it possible that he has any girlfriend?

700
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,030
He's also unlikely to pick up girls.

701
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,290
Besides, you've known him for long.

702
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,720
Don't you know what's he like?

703
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,180
There must be a misunderstood before.

704
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,220
If there was one,

705
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,600
why didn't he explain?

706
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,070
He may find it unnecessary.

707
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,800
Yu Sheng, wait.

708
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,600
So you mean

709
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,960
Ye Shuwei still hasn't had his first love.

710
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,480
If that's the case,

711
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,280
you two are perfect for each other.

712
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,360
If that's the case,

713
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,040
you two are perfect for each other.

[Archery Zone LIVE]
It's been a week and I miss you so much.

728
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,010
Last week we had a heated interaction.

729
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,510
Honey, could you hold the bow for me?

730
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,440
It's a little heavy.

731
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,090
Okay.

732
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,590
Give it to me.

733
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,060
It's loose here. Let me adjust it.

734
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,330
It's okay now.

735
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,140
Why are your hands so cold?

736
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,720
I'm a little nervous.

737
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,810
Take it easy. I got this.

738
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,080
Okay.

739
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,610
Today we prepared a dreamy ball

740
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,880
for our four couples.

741
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,520
But before that,

742
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,270
there's a small test

743
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,640
waiting for them.

744
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,310
Each couple will shoot arrows

745
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,170
respectively in ten minutes.

746
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,780

I've never done it before.

750

Correct posture is put first in archery.
