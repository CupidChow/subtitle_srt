Good morning.

Good morning, Ms. Tang.

Ms. Tang, bad news.

- What's wrong?
- Watch today's video.

[Sweet Height Difference Couple on LOVING
is fake, and has a secret blind date]

182
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,560
These shows have no respect

183
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,690
for the truth nowadays.

184
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,810
They're all fake.

185
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,920
You know,

186
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,810
the girl on LOVING,

187
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:58,970
Bei Erduo,

188
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,580
we had a blind date days ago.

189
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,260
She wants houses and cars.

190
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,660
It is clearly a sugarcoated scam.

191
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,250
The last crisis was resolved a night ago.

192
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,010
Another one now?

193
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,540
I didn't know what was wrong.

194
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,190
Now the online comments are all buying it,

195
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,110
saying Bei Erduo and Ye Shuwei are faking.

196
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,910
Go initiate

197
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,830
Plan B I told you to make right now.

198
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,270
And, get a PR firm

199
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,260
and contact the media close to us

200
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,000
to withdraw and delete

201
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,840
all negative news.

202
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,710
OK, I'm on it.

203
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,800
So if there's anything you don't know,

204
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,940
feel free to ask me.

205
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,490
I understand this.

206
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,010
But there are many others that I don't.

207
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,580
Yu Sheng, it's urgent.

208
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,320
Hold on.

209
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,110
Boss Yu, I'll leave.

210
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,750
Alright.

211
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,870
Sit.

212
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:07,880
I...

213
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,110
I know what you want to say.

214
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,700
And I know what happened.

215
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,010
We've done what we could.

216
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,370
The situation is going for the better.

217
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,710
But now the negative comments

218
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,530
are going viral on the Internet.

219
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,670
If the leadership cuts the show,

220
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,300
Erduo will be held accountable.

221
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't want to get her in trouble.

222
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,190
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

223
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,810
What plan?

224
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,810
Didn't they question the authenticity
of the show?

225
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,520
Let's do a crackdown on fake.

What do you mean?

227
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,460
Actually, it's Katie's idea.

228
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,880
That girl really is...

229
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,620
Stick to the point.

230
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,120
Well, I'm planning a poll on Weibo

231
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,980
to find the most impartial hater.

232
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,720
He'll shadow and record with his camera

233
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,740
the love moments of Ye Shuiwei and Bei Erduo.

234
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,020
Love moments?

235
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,180
You know the tension between them.

236
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,790
There are no love moments.

237
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,850
So our first step is to

238
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,070
move them under one roof.

252

259
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,170
Li, I'm really sorry.

260
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,500
I shouldn't have gone to a  blind date

261

after we entered into a contract.

262

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,880

She wants to make up for her mistake.

275

But she needs your cooperation, right?

276
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,160
I'm not obliged to do that.

277
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:53,880
And,

278
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,180
does this

279
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,200
fit on this side?

280
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,900
Li, it was ill-considered.

281
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,730
I didn't know it'd cause so much trouble.

282
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,800

Li.

284
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,400
You see, this is what happened.

285
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,160
There are no other options.

286
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,240
So run away.

287
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,280
As for the rest,

288
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,330
don't worry.

289
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,180
I'll take responsibility.

290
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,630
No, wait, Li.

291
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,500
Is there really no other solution?

292
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,210
Solution?

293
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,490
There is a solution, but...

294
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,910
Don't worry, Li.

295
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,020
I know that I should be blame.

296
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,620
So whatever your solution is,

297
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,020
I'll be cooperative.

298
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,020
Now the thing is that

299
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,860
everyone believes your love is fake.

300
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,210
To make them believe that you're real,

301
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,720
you have to do a live stream

302
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,740
of your daily life as a couple,

303
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,300
right?

304
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,050
So what do I have to do?

305
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,470
You're in?

306
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,090
Uncle,

307
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,730
if the program is suspended,

308
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,170
not only will Tang Li and I be screwed,

309
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,520
Bei Erduo will also get involved.

310
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,910
I've read the contract.

311
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,490
Bei Erduo, as the person at fault,

312
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,490
will face a penalty of 3 million.

313
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,420
How can she afford it?

314
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,270
Then she can forget about the study in Japan

315
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,600
and spend her whole life in debt.

316
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,460
Alright, enven if you don't like her,

317
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,580
she's just

318
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,700
a simple girl

319
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,630
who works as a voice actress

320
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,150
and does other jobs for her dream.

321
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,680
She's on the show to earn tuition.

322
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,680
Let's not ruin her dream.

323
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,190
Help her, if not for me, OK?

324
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,300
As long as we can get through this,

325
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,140
Li, I...

326
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,950
Great, I'm packing for you now.

327
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,750
Why do you still have to pack?

328
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,880
Didn't you say you're in?

329
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,400
You're moving in with Ye Shuwei tomorrow.

330
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,370
Your cohabiting details

331
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,210
will be aired on the show.

332
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,760
Cohabiting?

333
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,900
So are you

334
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,260
in this?

335
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,200
Ask her to tell me herself.

336
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,240
Right.

337
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,120
What she did

338
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,920
is reckless and irresponsible.

339
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,110
She ought to come and apologize.

340
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,390
Yes.

341
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,060
Hello?

342
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,090
Guru Ye is very angry.

343
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,240
But he's willing to give Erduo

344
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,360
a chance to make amends.

345
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,260
Waste no time.

346
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,800
Let her come and talk to him herself.

347
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,440
Apologize face to face.

348
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,270
Understand?

349
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,700
What? Apologize? Is Ye Shuwei a maniac?

350
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,800
Oh, my gosh!

351
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,940
What...

352
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,620
What is this?

353
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,250
Why are you wearing that stupid thing?

354
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,230
Because I'm too ashamed to meet anyone.

355
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,390
You... You're Bei Erduo?

356
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,620
Boss, your girlfriend is so avant-garde.

357
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,950
I didn't know it was her until she talked.

358
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,840
You want more exercise?

359
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,740
OK, I got it.

360
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,170
I should leave you.

361
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,820
Ye-san, I'm here to apologize.

362
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,880
Due to my negligence,

363
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,990
I violated our agreement

364
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,620
where I promised

365
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,140
not to date other men

366
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,720
or go on a blind date.

367
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,360
Now everyone thinks we're a couple.

368
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,430
Due to my violation,

369
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,650
you're cheated.

370
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,640
Last time at the hot spring resort,

372
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,440
to spook Li,

373
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,900
I pretended to be drowning and you saved me.

374
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,580
I'm sorry.

375
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,940
My mom called you a little carpenter.

376
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,600
I'm sorry.

377
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,490
I used to think you were a punk

378
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,900
who bent rules to get close to girls.

379
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:44,900
I'm sorry.

380
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,580
And I thought you were hypocritical,

381
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,160
cold-blooded and vindictive.

382
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,170
I'm sorry.

383
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:57,610
What?

384
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,920
I apologize for that, OK?

385
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:13,530
Alright.

386
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,780
You can live in my house,

387
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,410
but we have to make three rules.

388
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,250
First,

389
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,840
you'll do two hours of housework as rent,

390
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,030
30 yuan each.

391
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,010
So it's 1,800 yuan per month.

392
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:32,740
Surely,

393
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,500
the money is not enough

394
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,770
to rent three sqm of my house.

395
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:42,630
Second,

396
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,650
any area covered with carpet

397
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:45,900
is prohibited from you.

398
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:49,990
Third,

399
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,550
no loud noises are allowed.

400
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,240
You must keep quiet all the time.

401
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,520
No living things are allowed.

402
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,330
You said three rules.

403
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,690
This is the fourth rule.

404
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,620
It's included in the third rule.

405
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,920
If you violate any of the rules,

406
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,160
you'll do an extra hour of housework

407
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,890
each day as a penalty.

408
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,320
That's it.

409
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:31,850
You can go now.

410
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,470
I'll leave now.

411
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,350
Uh, my luggage is downstairs.

412
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,220
I brought it here.

413
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,530
It's right there.

414
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,030
Can you take it to your house for me?

415
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,050
The suitcases are too dirty.

416
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,560
Take a taxi.

417
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,500
I'll drive home.

418
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,270
Where do you live?

419
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,890
I'll call a taxi for you.

420
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,540
Hello?

421
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,060
Mr. Zhang,

422
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,670
please have someone clean up the house.

423
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,420
In an hour.

424
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,750
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

425
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,640
How did it go?

426
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,840
I'm on my way to Ye Shuwei's home now.

427
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,020
Impressive, Erduo. That's quick.

428
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,440
I wish you a happy life together!

429
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,440
Happy?

430
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,390
That guy

431
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,700
even detests my suitcases.

432
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,370
Ma'am!

433
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,370
Ma'am, does Ye Shuwei live here?

434
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,160
I'm so sorry.

435
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,200
Look.

436
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,920
Ye Shuwei.

437
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,950
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

438
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,770
Ye Shuwei, why are you faster than me?

439
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,680
Quiet.

440
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,640
Wait here for a moment.

441
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,870
Hi, Li.

442
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,440
Hi, Erduo, have you arrived at his home?

443
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,690
I'm in a meeting.

444
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,380
How's it going over there?

445
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,770
Ye Shuwei is intolerably sullen.

446
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,020
He asked me

447
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,350
to wait in the lobby.

448
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,830
Hey, hang in there.

449
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,640
After you unpack,

450
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,210
talk to Ye Shuwei as soon as possible

451
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,470
about the house decoration.

452
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,780
The cameraman will be there early tomorrow.

453
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,870
And he's an unpleasant

454
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,690
and picky man.

455
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,280
You must be very careful.

456
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,090
Pay attention to the details.

457
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,360
Do nothing that will make them think

458
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,860
that you're faking a couple.

459
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,600
Got it.

460
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,220
Otherwise, we're all screwed.

461
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,080
Do you hear me?

462
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,350
Remember, Erduo,

463
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,320
especially the cameraman.

464
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,750
OK.

465
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,300
I have to go now.

466
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,100
Bye-bye.

467
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,040
Bye-bye.

468
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,010
I'll take you to your room first.

469
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,570
Thank you.

470
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,940
Living things?

471
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,180
Yes, cute plants.

472
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,760
Not even the succulent plants?

473
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,240
You can trust me.

474
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,420
I'll keep them in my room.

475
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,190
They don't take up much space.

476
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,490
From today onwards,

477
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,770
you won't see them again.

478
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,760
I'd rather take them myself.

479
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,510
Ye Shuwei, I'm a guest, OK?

480
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,060
You let me wait

481
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,960
outside of your home.

482
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,470
Isn't that a little bad-mannered?

483
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,180
You are already in my house, aren't you?

484
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,350
This is the hallway.

485
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,510
I mean,

486
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,110
your home is so big. Will you...?

487
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,950
Your home is so big.

488
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,120
Will you get lost?

489
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,660
I feel like I'm getting lost.

490
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,730
Did you just move in?

491
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,150
Why is this place so bleak?

492
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,100
I don't smell fresh paint, though.

493
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,940
Haven't had time to buy furniture?

494
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,910
I lived here before I went to Italy.

495
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,220
Seven years.

496
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,710
Your taste in home decoration
is quite unusual.

497
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,200
Where's the trash can?

498
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,990
That's funny.

499
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,890
Just like you,

500
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,490
the house is lack of human touch.

501
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,570
What?

502
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,060
I said,

503
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,600
it's clean.

504
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,980
Very clean and great.

505
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,610
You can unpack.

506
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,340
Hey, Ye Shuwei.

507
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,160
I need to talk to you about something.

508
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,620
I'll meet you there.

509
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,490
Isn't it great?

510
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,450
Doesn't it look much more comfortable?

511
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,080
It was more comfortable before.

512
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,280
Don't worry.

513
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,080
When I move out,

514
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,920
I'll restore it to its former look.

515
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,600
What is it?

516
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,460
Li said a cameraman
is coming tomorrow morning

517
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,640
to make some teasers of our cohabitation

518
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,560
for the live broadcast.

519
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,240
We should arrange it like we live together.

520
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,260
This is your room?

521
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:19,550
You have three partitions.

522
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,770
That's so...

523
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,520
So what?

524
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,850
I thought

525
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,240
my room is the only one that's simple.

526
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,630
I didn't expect your room
to be so simple, too.

527
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:35,880
This is called

528
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,510
abstinent.

529
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,990
Except for the necessities,

530
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,280
everything else is superfluous.

531
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,840
So how are we going to make it

532
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,780
look like we're a couple?

533
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,880
Go get your clothes and pillow.

534
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,200
Is everything alright?

535
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,680
I think something is wrong.

536
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
You're right.

537
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,200
Take these back.

538
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:03,830
And this.

539
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:07,870
You can go.

540
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,740
Put only one set of

541
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,670
toiletries in the bathroom.
