[Episode 11]

3
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,250
Let me do it.

4
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,130
Open your eyes and look left and right.

5
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,430
No. I have a fear of heights.

6
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,060
Fear of heights?

7
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,940
Why didn't you say it earlier?

8
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,140
You didn't ask. You are a fool.

9
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,950
Here you are.

10
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,280
Thanks.

11
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,530
You got a message.

12
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,960
What's up?

13
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,120
It's the weekend.

14
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,210
Are you going to work overtime?

15
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,190
I have to go back to the company.

16
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,810
They are waiting for me.

17
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,230
Sorry for that.

18
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,350
I got to go.

19
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,850
You just lie down

20
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,340
and have a good rest.

21
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,140
Okay?

22
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:40,840
Okay.

23
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,030
Eat the apple.

24
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,340
You'll feel better to drink something warm.

25
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,020
Thank you.

26
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,900
Were you born with a fear of heights?

27
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,900
No.

28
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,680
When I was eight years old,

29
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,140
the school organized a mountaineering trip.

30
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,250
Some classmate pushed me for a joke.

31
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,720
Fortunately, I was caught by a vine

32
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
and had a protruding rock under my feet.

33
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,370
So, I didn't fall down the hill.

34
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,230
But I was hung there for really a while.

35
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,220
Finally, I was saved

36
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,000
by a local person passing by.

37
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,340
When I got home, my mom called me stupid.

38
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,940
Then she told me not to go mountain-climbing

39
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,920
organized by the school after that,

40
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,660
and let me use fear of heights as the excuse.

41
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,550
From then on,

42
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,540
I seemed to really have a fear of heights.

43
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,840
When you were stuck there,

44
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,230
because your teachers and classmates
were unable to help you,

45
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,080
you already felt aggrieved and hurt.

46
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,480
You were also scolded by your mom
as you got home.

47
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,780
You've lost your sense of safety.

48
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,320
So, when you look down from a high place,

49
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,320
you would have negative emotions

50
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,780
and of course have a fear.

51
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,280
Everyone may dislike

52
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,600
or fear something.

53
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,530
You don't have to feel embarrassed.

54
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,180
So next time, you'd better say it in advance

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,180
to avoid suffers.

56
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,720
So, what do you fear?

57
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,730
I fear

58
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,880
unknown things in the dark.

59
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,890
You put it so literarily.

60
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,610
Isn't it a fear of darkness?

61
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,300
I'm not saying the kind of fear

62
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,600
that would disappear

63
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,540
if someone is with me

64
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,620
I'm saying that

65
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,420
I would still fear

66
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,970
when someone is with me.

67
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,320
No wonder
lights are always on in the living room.

68
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,580
Let's go.

69
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,630
What? Where do you want me to go this time?

70
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,610
Bei Erduo,

71
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,090
you must face what you fear to overcome it.

72
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,930
In fact, you keep telling yourself inwardly

73
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,680
that you fear it.

74
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,620
Maybe you don't fear it at all.

75
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,420
Ye Shuwei, stop.

76
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,190
I really fear it. Really.

77
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,180
I won't let you fall.

78
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,830
Trust me.

79
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,930
Let's forget this.

80
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,640
Let me just fear heights.

81
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,660
I've got used to it.

82
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,090
Come up.

83
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,540
What about this?

84
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,190
We are even now.

85
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,000
You lead me up.

86
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,530
I seem to have a sense of accomplishment.

87
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,210
Shall we take a picture to remember this?

88
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,610
I overcame my fear of heights
for the first time.

89
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,330
A bit lower.

90
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,610
Only half your head can be seen. A bit lower.

91
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,080
Look, you can't be seen.

92
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,520
Completely…

93
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,460
Miss, this is the chairman's office.

94
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,620
You can't get in there.

95
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,620
Excuse me, you are…?

96
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,070
Mind your language.

97
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,220
Don't talk to me like that.

98
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,360
Who are you?

99
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,960
I'm Chairman Zhang's secretary.

100
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm his daughter.

101
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,890
Hello, hello.

102
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,780
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,540
Chairman Zhang told me

104
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,690
that you'd be in charge of the company

105
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,650
during the days he is abroad.

106
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,480
Go tell Mr. Liang to come for a meeting.

107
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,840
Okay, okay.

108
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,410
Why do you always take pictures of me
being ugly?

109
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,770
And you decided what to play.

110
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,530
Whatever, I want to drive a bumper car.

111
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,430
Time for interactions is up. Let's go home.

112
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,300
Bei Erduo. Ms. Bei.

113
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,220
You are also here in the amusement park.

114
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,310
Who are you here with?

115
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,220
Ms. Wang.

116
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,300
Ms. Bei, I saw you online.

117
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,090
Ms. Bei, you're dressed so beautifully today.

118
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,120
Thank you.

119
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,110
Don't be afraid.

120
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,830
He looks scary.

121
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,690
But in fact,

122
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,610
he is really scary.

123
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,370
Brother, you are so tall.

124
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,550
He is not brother. Call him uncle.

125
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,080
I know. He is your boyfriend.

126
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,020
Brother, I want a hug.

127
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
Brother, you are so handsome.

128
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,120
Would you like to eat lollipops?

129
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,030
Come on.

130
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,990
Who likes pudding flavor?

131
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,590
Me.

132
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,540
Who likes peach flavor?

133
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,450
Apple?

134
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,040
I like it.

135
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,020
Ms. Bei Erduo is going to drive a bump car.

136
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,310
Do you want to go with me?

137
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,080
Yes.

138
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,920
Will he go with us, too?

139
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,520
The kids are inviting you.

140
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,950
You can't say no.

141
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,580
Okay, okay.

142
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,890
Let's go.

143
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,780
Lu,

144
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,990
you are here.

145
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,960
You are a very popular online celebrity.

146
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,340
How do you have time to come here for fun?

147
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,550
Mr. Liang, I'm not here for fun.

148
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,760
I'm here

149
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,720
because my father forced me.

150
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,930
I know my father.

151
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,460
He is overwhelmed by my stepmother's matters.

152
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,130
I'm his biological daughter anyway.

153
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,640
He asked me to take care of the company
for some days.

154
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,520
I couldn't refuse him.

155
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,310
Yeah, yeah.

156
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,000
Mr. Liang, please have a seat.

157
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,070
Have a seat.

158
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,850
Let's sit down and talk.

159
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,020
Mr. Liang, let me be straight with you.

160
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,750
You also know

161
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,900
my stepmother always wants to have a kid.

162
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,860
She tried IVFs several times domestically
but all failed.

163
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,960
So, she asked my father to go abroad with her

164
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,690
to try it again.

165
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,060
My father has his secret sorrow.

166
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,110
Yes.

167
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,140
Mr. Zhang also said

168
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,240
that he would be back in a few days.

169
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,820
If there is any problem

170
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,920
in the company's business development,

171
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,980
we can meet and coordinate for a solution.

172
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,980
Yes, Mr. Liang.

173
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,020
I'll need more help from you.

174
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,710
And I'll just hear what you say

175
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,680
to learn more from you.

176
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,120
No problem.

177
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,350
Just come to me if you want to know anything.

178
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,270
I'll issue a notice later to ask directors of

179
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,080
all departments to coordinate with your work.

180
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,390
I'll call them here right now.

181
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,290
Mr. Liang, I'm sorry for the trouble.

182
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,800
What else can we play?

183
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,840
We have to go back.

184
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,000
Ye Shuwei,

185
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,540
how did you make these troublemakers

186
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,540
listen to you?

187
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,440
They are probably

188
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,280
less troublesome than you.

189
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:11,870
Come on,

190
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,290
I'll play with you next time, okay?

191
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,100
- Okay.
- Okay.

192
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,750
Then let's go.

193
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,350
Come on, go home with Ms. Wang.

194
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,330
Come on, kids.

195
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,330
What happened to your hand?

196
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,620
It's scratched by a kitten.

197
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
A few days ago, a stray cat came to

198
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,160
the backyard of the kindergarten

199
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,100
and scratches anyone who touches it.

200
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,900
I'll ask someone to take it away tomorrow.

201
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,520
Ms. Bei, you know best how to raise animals.

202
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,420
You can just take the kitten with you.

203
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,560
You can live in my house,

204
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,860
but no living things are allowed.

205
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,470
Brother, are you interested in

206
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,880
having a kitten?

207
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,530
Brother, would you take in the kitten.

208
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,420
I may not have time lately.

209
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,780
You may ask Ms. Bei to take care of it.

210
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,700
You mean I can have it, right?

211
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,980
No regret.

212
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,870
Lu,

213
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,440
all department directors are here now.

214
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,980
Sorry to

215
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,690
call you here in such a rush.

216
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,190
Let me introduce myself first.

217
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,760
I'm Zhang Yilu.

218
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,170
Mr. Liang must have told you.

219
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,970
In the coming few days,

220
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,010
I'll be the acting president.

221
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,820
And I hope to have a good time with you all.

222
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,360
I'm not quite familiar with a lot of things.

223
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,380
It's a process to learn about those.

224
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,210
I'll do it project by project.

225
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,970
I personally know new media very well.

226
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,170
So, I'll start from

227
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,120
LOVING.

228
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,640
Except the director in charge of the project,

229
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,850
all others may leave
and wait for my further notification.

230
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,170
Ms. Bei, the kitten is right there.

231
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,740
Don't put your hand in there.

232
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,930
You may get scratched.

233
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,700
Brother, are you talking with the kitten?

234
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:09,840
Yes.

235
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,350
I'm telling it not to be afraid

236
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,890
and I'll take it to the hospital
before taking it home.

237
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:19,300
Brother, how do you understand what it says?

238
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,080
Because I know cat language.

239
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,170
Okay, kids,

240
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,920
we will take it to the hospital.

241
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,050
You go back with Ms. Wang, okay?

242
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,910
- When the kitten gets better,
- When the kitten gets better,

243
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,560
can we go to the hospital to see it?

244
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,690
Of course you can.

245
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,240
But you must listen to Ms. Wang.

246
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,390
Okay.

247
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,220
Come on.

248
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:48,830
Let's go.

249
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,230
Bye-bye.

250
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,910
Bye-bye.

251
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,750
Cat's gratitude?

252
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,280
You really have a way with kids.

253
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,270
Do you think only you are good at that?

254
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:12,850
Come on.

255
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,570
Be careful.

256
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:27,990
Let's go.

257
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,460
About these four pairs of guests on the show,

258
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,380
I've come up with

259
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,940
a particularly detailed risk report.

260
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,880
This pair of guests is really poor in data.

261
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,900
It's serious. You may take a look.

262
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,190
Really?

263
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,630
Therefore, we must dismiss them immediately.

264
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,630
Miss Zhang…

265
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,410
Oh, no. President Zhang,

266
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,870
this couple has been very popular

267
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,970
and received positive comments from netizens.

268
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,050
They enjoy a large number of followers.

269
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,860
I don't think we should dismiss them.

270
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,210
Lu, I didn't expect

271
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,970
you've done a lot of work about this.

272
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,250
You also have a profound
understanding of online variety shows.

273
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,240
But it's a big taboo for sponsors
to dismiss the guests in the middle.

274
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,810
We need to think it over.

275
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,100
What about this?

276
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,610
I'll go back to study this carefully.

277
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,610
We can't jump to conclusions.

278
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,930
Mr. Liang, this can't be delayed.

279
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:43,930
We have to make the decision quickly.

280
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,600
Okay, I'll be sure to check this quickly.

281
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,590
We are home now.

282
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,430
From now on,

283
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,140
you're a kitten with a home.

284
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,220
You've got the shot and showered.

285
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,740
Now we're so happy.

286
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,750
Come on, give it to me.

287
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,320
Go clean up.

288
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,430
Come on.

289
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,260
Good.

290
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,760
That cage is for it to sleep in.

291
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,770
You may put it back there,

292
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,470
in front of the kitchen.

293
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,000
There are two basins.

294
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,910
One is for food

295
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,760
and the other is for water.

296
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,190
You may put them beside the cage.

297
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,860
Remember to cut its nails regularly

298
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,470
and teach it how to use the scratching board.

299
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,930
If it scratches something, you'll pay for it.

300
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,460
And the litter box,

301
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,640
you need to clean it twice a day.

302
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,300
There must be no peculiar smell in the house.

303
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,600
Also, inside…

304
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,290
I've successfully become a cat slave.

305
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,110
I'm taking back a "little master".

306
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,450
Now that you've decided to keep it,

307
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,790
you must take on the responsibility.

308
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,520
Well, let's give it a name.

309
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,320
Can't we just call it cat.

310
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,650
You are so boring.

311
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,260
There are so many cats in the world.

312
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,620
How could it know you're calling it?

313
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,600
Can I just call you human? Human?

314
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,860
Then

315
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,990
we can call it dog.

316
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,800
So, it won't misunderstand.

317
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,690
Let's just ignore this weird uncle.

318
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,050
I take you here.

319
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,120
So, you must use my family name, right?

320
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,670
Let me call you Bei…

321
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,500
Bei…

322
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,280
Beckham.

323
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,300
Beckham.

324
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,750
Beckham?

325
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,490
No, no, no.

326
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,440
Bei…

327
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,480
Bei Duofen.

328
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,780
Bei Duofen?

329
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,980
Bei Duofen.

330
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,510
Bei Duofen.

331
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,240
It responded.

332
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,030
You are called Bei Duofen.

333
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,190
Bei Duofen. Bei Duofen.

334
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,820
[A8 Music Mansion]
Then let me cut the chase.

335
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,990
About this sponsorship project,

336
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,380
the biggest problem is high risk.

337
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,180
There are too many uncontrollable factors

338
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,430
in a reality show of unknow guests.

339
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,580
Besides, the biggest risk

340
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,160
comes from each pair of unknown guests.

341
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,160
Because if something goes up

342
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,560
with any one of them,

343
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,440
our sponsorship revenue will be slashed.

344
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,030
Moyu, it's still

345
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,060
at 3:06.

346
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,520
Back a little bit.

347
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:22,770
Yeah.

348
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,050
But this is a time of turbulence.

349
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,100
Are you close to finding Assad?

350
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,920
Okay, I'll be right there.

351
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,210
Assad, the man I just mentioned

352
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,340
is one of the inferior terrorist leaders.

353
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,110
Hope we can

354
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,640
learn some useful information from him.

355
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,640
Except for Assad,

356
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,760
we are also looking for a fatty.

357
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,240
He is one of the leaders, too.

358
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,610
But unfortunately,

359
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,160
we don't know anything about him now,

360
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,110
including his name.

361
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,180
I bet it must not feel good

362
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,110
to step on a dead body.

363
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,140
I don't feel right about this you dubbed.

364
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,220
I bet…

365
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,080
But I think it's similar to…

366
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,860
Here, it's similar to here.

367
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,170
All right.

368
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,450
- I bet…
- It's okay.

369
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,780
Let's take a break

370
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,920
and get back later.

371
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,050
Last time, I mentioned the problems with

372
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,120
Bei Erduo and her partner.

373
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,940
Mr. Liang, how is your reading of the report?

374
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,930
Lu, your report is well done.

375
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,240
But I don't think it's necessary

376
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,830
to dismiss this pair of guests although

377
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,540
their support data fell
in the latest episode.

378
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,900
We are about to produce the last episode.

379
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,770
We may ask the Show Crew

380
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,580
to tell them to get ready for it.

381
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,320
I don't think there would be problems.

382
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,070
Mr. Liang, you don't seem to know it yet.

383
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,650
Their problem is not simply

384
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,140
the falling support data.

385
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,300
According to the latest news,

386
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,440
Ye Shuwei insulted a female follower.

387
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,840
And the police are investigating it.

388
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,840
If the evidence is certain,

389
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,840
he would be an actor with notorious records.

390
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,560
The entire show might be banned

391
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,580
and ordered to be taken offline as a result.

392
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,400
If we dismiss them now,

393
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,050
maybe we could prevent that from happening.

394
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,390
We must not hesitate any longer.

395
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,220
We must make the decision today.

396
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,610
Erduo, come out and have some coconut milk.

397
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,720
What's up?

398
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,210
They could have finished this

399
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,030
an hour earlier.

400
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,190
But they've been delayed because of me.

401
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,490
Erduo, you did it really well.

402
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,440
Sometimes you're just not quite relaxed.

403
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,740
You need to have confidence in yourself.

404
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,560
Moyu, I understand that.

405
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,420
But I always feel

406
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,060
I'm one breath away,

407
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,760
no, several breaths away from you.

408
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,420
Taking the first part as an example,

409
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,360
if I shouted it out as hard as I can,

410
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,540
my voice will be hoarse.

411
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,030
But if I shout in a suppressed voice,

412
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,130
I couldn't show the emotions as you do.

413
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,360
About this,

414
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,430
let Youyou tell you her experience.

415
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,850
She used to face the same problem.

416
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,270
Youyou.

417
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,090
Oh, shout "Ah"?

418
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,200
Come on, like this. "Ah".

419
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,680
You try it.

420
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,360
Let me try.

421
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,830
President Zhang,

422
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,280
that has been officially clarified.

423
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,950
Ye Shuwei is the victim.

424
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,010
There're still rumors even it's clarified.

425
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,880
That still has a negative effect on the show.

426
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,140
The main cause is Bei Erduo.

427
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,940
From the start of the show,
she has caused a lot of troubles.

428
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,130
Can you afford to such a risk?

429
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,770
Lu has a point.

430
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,650
The image of our show

431
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,260
has always been positive and sunny.

432
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,790
Well,

433
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,300
you go talk to Strawberry.com

434
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,970
and change these two guests.

435
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,760
Yes. And it has to be done quickly.

436
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,220
Go do it.

437
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,800
Bei Duofen?

438
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,050
Bei Duofen?

439
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,970
Bei Duofen?

440
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,060
Bei Duofen?

441
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,680
Bei Duofen?

442
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,760
Ye Shuwei,

443
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,560
when can I go to your studio

444
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,670
to watch you make violins?

445
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,820
Tomorrow.

446
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,240
Okay, tomorrow is okay.

447
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,590
I happen to have nothing to do in the studio.

448
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,870
Bei Duofen?

449
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,570
Director Liu,

450
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,130
you know

451
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,260
how popular Ye Shuwei and Bei Erduo are.

452
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But…

453
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,140
What?

454
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,960
Ye Shuwei…

455
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,990
We issued a clarification announcement.

456
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,490
It has nothing to do with him.

457
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,290
Online comments are changing every day.

458
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:04,800
Right?

459
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,970
You know it.

460
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,640
The wind direction will change, right?

461
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,560
And there is nothing wrong with

462
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,650
Ye Shuwei's personality. I assure you that.

463
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,890
Okay.

465
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,490
It's okay. Then let's keep in touch.

466
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,620
Boss Yu, what did Director Liu say?

467
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,070
Do they have to be dismissed?

468
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,080
But we can't just do whatever he asks.

469
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,810
Maybe we can talk to Strawberry.com.

470
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,500
Let's go find Mr. Liang.

471
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,170
Okay.

472
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,280
Duofen?

473
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,340
Bei Duofen?

474
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,990
Bei Duofen?

475
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,790
Bei Duofen?

476
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,510
I found it.

477
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,600
Bei Duofen, Bei Duofen.

478
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,800
Bei Duofen.

479
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,580
Duofen.

480
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,600
Duofen.

481
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,470
Mr. Liang,

482
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,670
Mr. Liang, about…

483
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,670
You don't need to say more.

484
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,740
It's the company's decision.

485
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,780
I don't understand

486
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,190
why we have to dismiss them.

487
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,530
There's only one episode left in this season.

488
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,310
Just because there is only one episode left,

489
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,260
we can't allow the existence of any risk

490
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,990
that may damage our company's reputation.

491
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,400
I understand. But Mr. Liang,

492
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,160
can you give them one last chance?

493
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,280
I'm sure in the last episode,

494
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,870
they will set a new record in clicking rate.

495
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,660
Mr. Yu, I don't want this either.

496
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,330
I got to go.

497
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,890
Your hand is healing well.

498
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,380
There is no inflammation

499
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,600
and all indicators are normal.

500
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,510
Okay.

501
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,240
Just have some rest and you'll be discharged.

502
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,380
Okay.

503
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,470
Thank you, Ms. Lin.

504
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,960
I can finally leave the hospital.

505
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,120
Hospital is the place for treatment.

506
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,720
Take a good rest since you're injured.

507
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,080
Here in the hospital,

508
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,220
you'll get well even without surfing online.

509
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,330
Thank you, Ms. Lin.

510
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,650
The show produced by our company

511
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,680
will be live streamed in a couple of days.

512
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,440
It will be the last episode.

513
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,750
I have to check it out online.

514
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,110
Hello, Boss.

515
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,400
Good morning, Miss Bei.

516
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,730
You may just call me Bei Erduo.

517
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,420
When I was here last time,

518
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,930
I didn't look around carefully.

519
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,810
Ye Shuwei,

520
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,660
do you use salad sauce for making violins?

521
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,690
That's wood glue.

522
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,900
I know. I'm kidding you.

523
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,400
How do you make violins?

524
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,970
It takes about three months

525
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,940
to tailor-make a high-end violin by hand.

526
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,360
Sometimes, it takes longer.

527
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,730
But,

528
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,780
I can show you one of the procedures.

529
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,120
Then I want to see the most difficult one.

530
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,620
Let me show you how to scrape plate.

531
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,530
Come over.

532
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,480
Hold it like this.

533
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,900
Is it that difficult?

534
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,300
This will directly affect

535
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,490
the timbre of a violin.

536
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,400
Therefore, this is an important process.

537
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,030
Only an experienced violin maker

538
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,330
can do this.

539
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,770
May I try?

540
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,620
Have a try.

541
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,320
Well, like this.

542
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,520
Put your fingers on it.

543
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,240
Yes. Push it forward.

544
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,610
Yes. One more time.

545
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,440
It's okay.

546
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,760
You may try other steps.

547
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,570
But I still can't do this well.

548
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,840
This is not suitable for a newcomer.

549
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,320
I'll find you one suitable for you.

550
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,860
This one. This one is perfect.

551
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,470

This one.

554
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,610
It's a very good fir wood.

555
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,470
It's for making the front board.

556
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:04,670
Wait a second.

557
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,960
This one.

558
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,930
Put your forefinger on it.

559
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,410
Yes. Push forward slowly.

and forcing us to suspend the show.

Have you talked to Mr. Liang?

Don't you think I wouldn't go?

575
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,320
Then go talk to Mr. Zhang.

you are not discharged yet.

581
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,210
You must not worry about this.

582
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:35,500
How could I not worry about this?

583
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,100
We've made so much efforts for this.

at least we are in sync at work.

Ye Shuwei, what is it?

599
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,430
This one? It's the bridge.

600
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,720
Do you know

601
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,800
how a violin makes a sound?

602
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,690
The vibration of strings is transmitted

603
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,410
to the plate by the bridge

604
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,210
and then to side and back plates
via the waist.

605
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,250
That resonates with the entire violin speaker,

606
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,500
and thus produce beautiful sounds.

607
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,810
Are you speaking Chinese?

00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,650
I don't understand even a single word.

609
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,950
Anyway, this is like the heart of a violin.

610
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,300
