1
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:07,860
[I Hear You]

2
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,460
[Episode 23]

3
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,170
I heard that the role assignments
for the next project

4
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,470
will be announced soon.

5
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,870
Do you think we will be protagonists
this time?

6
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,760
Erduo.

7
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,480
I'm fine as long as I could get a role.

8
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,330
But I'd like to be the protagonist.

9
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,860
Otherwise, I've always been

10
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,160
insignificant roles,

11
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,420
and I just can't stand it.

12
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,980
You should already know that

13
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,480
our next project is to

14
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,030
do Chinese dubbing

15
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,790
for a Japanese animation that
will be broadcast on CCTV.

16
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,040
This anime is very famous in Japan,

17
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,320
and it's also popular in China.

18
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,910
So they must have a preconceived impression

19
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,970
of the Japanese version.

20
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,220
Anyway,

21
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,740
there will always be fling abuses.

22
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,680
Don't completely block these voices,

23
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,340
since some of them are instructive.

24
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,960
Now I'm going to assign roles.

25
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,550
Lin Yechen will be the leading actor Seko.

26
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,270
Bei Erduo will be the leading actress Yami.

27
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,800
Wu Youyou will be
the supporting actress Jixiang.

28
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,390
The above are assignments
for the main roles.

29
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,440
I'd like to mention Bei Erduo
and Wu Youyou.

30
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,000
We made a discussion.

31
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,680
Given your hard work during this time,

32
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,540
we all agree that you are up
to the main roles.

33
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,610
But don't treat it lightly.

34
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,890
You may be replaced at any time.

35
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,030
Mr. Xu, don't worry.

36
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,420
We will try our best.

37
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,700
I promise to work assiduously
and tirelessly every day

38
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,660
and never fail to live up
to your expectations.

39
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,790
Okay, get ready.

40
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,350
Hello.

41
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,250
Did you get off work?

42
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,560
I have a news for you.

43
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,560
I was chosen to dub the leading actress.

44
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,430
Although the leading actor is the key,

45
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,910
I am the leading actress.

46
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,240
It's the first time for me
to be the leading actress.

47
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,540
Congratulations.

48
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,010
Should we celebrate?

49
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,420
Sure, what do you want to eat?

50
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,480
Let me handle it.

51
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,950
Hello, I would like to reserve a seat
on the top floor.

52
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,060
For what time?

53
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,480
My palms are small?

54
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,470
Visual inspection…

55
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,830
Visual inspection…

56
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,410
Bei Erduo, will you marry me?

57
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,390
There seems to be a change
in your dressing style.

58
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,480
You also

59
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,640
look different.

60
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,960
This is my new dress.

61
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,140
Does it look good?

62
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:20,930
Let's go.

63
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,090
Let's eat.

64
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,210
Are you eating

65
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,470
like a gentlewoman

66
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,000
to match your outfits?

67
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,620
No, I've been on a diet recently.

68
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:26,500
Come on.

69
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,450
May Miss Bei Erduo's first time

70
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,960
as the protagonist a success.

71
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,540
Thank you.

72
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,950
I didn't expect that

73
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,340
I could dub the leading actress so soon.

74
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:54,010
I think everything

75
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,890
is gradually getting better.

76
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,420
It's getting better after meeting me.

77
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,230
Not at all.

78
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,540
After meeting you, my life is like this.

79
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,090
Excuse me.

80
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,330
Hold on, I will do it myself.

81
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,200
Wish you good appetite.

82
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,640
What's the matter?

83
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,120
Eat it.

84
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,710
Easy. Don't get choked.

85
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,290
You've got cake all over your mouth.

86
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,770
What's wrong with you?

87
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,400
You look absent-minded.

88
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,220
Nothing.

89
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,950
You must be very busy

90
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,370
after getting the job.

91
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,110
I think so.

92
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,630
It's my first time to
dub the leading actress.

93
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,410
It makes sense.

94
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,280
Although I am not the key role,

95
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,930
I would appear a lot.

96
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,300
So I should go all out.

97
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,160
You deserve to be the top voice actress.

98
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,190
This is a hard-earned opportunity.

99
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,490
I have to hold it

100
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,120
tightly and firmly.

101
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,630
What about you?

102
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,080
Your life is perfectly satisfactory.

103
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,030
Do you have any other wish?

104
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,100
You wonder?

105
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,150
Be the man of top voice actress.

106
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,570
There is faulty wording in this sentence.

107
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,390
Bei Erduo.

108
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,540
Close your eyes.

109
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,560
No peeking.

110
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,710
Open your eyes.

111
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,970
What's this?

112
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,200
Bridge.

113
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,100
Award-winning quiz.

114
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,340
Let's see if you memorize all the materials.

115
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,080
Question: what's a bridge?

116
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,770
Are you going to say something

117
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,100
I don't understand again?

118
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,190
It's not that complicated.

119
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,740
Just tell me

120
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,600
the bridge is the heart of the violin.

121
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,830
Let's go. I will take you to a place.

122
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,340
Will there really be meteor here?

123
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,540
It depends on the weather.

124
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,290
These days

125
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,610
are the best time to observe
the Lyra meteor shower.

126
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,130
The moonlight is weak tonight.

127
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,010
So there may be a chance.

128
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,480
Are you cold?

129
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,260
If so, wait for me on the car.

130
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,840
I'll be here waiting for the meteor.

131
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,870
I'd like to make a wish.

132
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,270
Have you thought of what wish to make?

133
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,480
I have to make a draft

134
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,890
and practice in my heart.

135
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,660
Or I might not be able
to finish them all at once.

136
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,950
I can't see anything.

137
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,310
Just stop it.

138
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,150
Never look at things which
don't conform to the rites.

139
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
How could you say that?

140
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,150
It was your idea to assist the boss.

141
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,940
Look at you.

142
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,440
What's wrong with you?

143
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,500
I don't care.

144
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,690
I'll set off fireworks

145
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,650
in five minutes.

146
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,450
We can't see the meteor shower today.

147
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,490
Why?

148
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,490
It's already crossed the sky.

149
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,870
We may not be within the radiant range.

150
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,340
Let's go home then.

151
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,140
What?

152
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,840
As long as you are willing to,

153
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,480
there will be meteors for you

154
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:34,970
to fulfill your wishes.

155
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,400
Close your eyes.

156
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,380
So?

157
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,200
Are you going to make a meteor for me?

158
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:05,980
Open your eyes.

159
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,050
Here comes the meteor.

160
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,470
Thank you.

161
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,940
Thank you for not being in front
of a lot of people

162
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,510
and just putting the ring on my finger

163
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,920
like this.

164
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,270
No getting down on one knee.

165
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,200
No sensational music.

166
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,110
No sentence like “would you marry me”.

167
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,760
Only the two of us.

168
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,390
While in the restaurant, I thought…

169
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,460
What?

170
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,710
I also like the necklace you gave me.

171
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,210
Look.

172
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,130
Who is setting off fireworks today?

173
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,250
Is that you?

174
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,500
Meteor showers belong to everyone.

175
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,340
But the firework belongs only
to both of us.

176
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,000
Also, this one belongs to you.

177
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,830
Mom.

178
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,880
Erduo.

179
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,550
Where did you go early in the morning?

180
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,370
I…

181
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,840
I went jogging.

182
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,170
To keep fit.

183
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,020
Take the groceries to the kitchen.

184
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,660
Ask Ye

185
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,210
when his parents would be available.

186
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,150
Let's have a meal together

187
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,980
and discuss about your marriage.

188
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,520
Is it necessary to be so soon?

189
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,400
Soon?

190
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,390
You are living together.

191
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,710
And you even received his ring.

192
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,330
It has to be put on the agenda.

193
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,000
Hurry up.

194
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,630
Bring me the groceries.

195
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,290
Coming.

196
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:35,920
Let's go?

197
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:04,780
What's the matter?

198
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,700
I'm so nervous now.

199
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,980
Is there any way to calm down?

200
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,200
Why are you nervous?

201
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,880
We've met each other before.

202
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,110
It's different now.

203
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,800
What's the difference?

204
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,630
It used to be fake, but now it's real.

205
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,780
So what?

206
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,940
So

207
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,530
if you can deal with the fake,

208
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,160
you can definitely deal with the real.

209
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,920
Come on. Let's go.

210
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,850
Get off the car.

211
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,890
Let's go.

212
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,090
Let's go.

213
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,830
Mom, dad.

214
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,630
Uncle, aunt.

215
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,000
You are back.

216
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,000
Here you are.

217
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,370
Uncle, it's for you.

218
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,370
Thank you.

219
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,890
Erduo, you must be thirsty.

220
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,980
Mrs. Wang.

221
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,610
Aunt, it's okay.

222
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,530
Take a seat.

223
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,530
Uncle, aunt.

224
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,090
This is what I prepared for you.

225
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,470
I hope you like it.

226
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,050
Erduo, it's so kind of you.

227
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:32,850
To be honest,

228
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,650
our whole family loves the cake.

229
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,650
I'm glad you like it.

230
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,540
Uncle, do you like it?

231
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,940
So artistic.

232
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,910
Erduo, you have a good taste.

233
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:43,700
Pretty good.

234
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,700
I'm flattered, uncle.

235
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,020
The dinner is ready.

236
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,680
- Okay.
- All right.

237
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,090
Let's have dinner.

238
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,200
Let's go.

239
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,680
Here.

240
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,700
Come on.

241
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,130
Eat more dishes.

242
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:03,840
Erduo.

243
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:04,970
Eat more.

244
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,780
Son, eat more.

245
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,110
Thank you, I will help myself.

246
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,260
I'll buy you a ring

247
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,340
for your birthday next year.

248
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,820
And the name of it should be
you are the only one in my life.

249
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,410
What about it?

250
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,950
The kids are here.

251
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,480
What are you talking about?

252
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,890
This is my house.

253
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,920
They could go back if they can't bear it.

254
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:30,940
Let's go after the meal.

255
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,600
Son, your dad didn't mean that.

256
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,890
He has ignored me since I was back.

257
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,700
I shouldn't be his son.

258
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,770
I only need my daughter-in-law Erduo.

259
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,970
You don't have to come back next time.

260
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,670
Your mission is to marry her

261
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,250
and have a baby.

262
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,860
Remember that

263
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,820
this ring cannot be used at your wedding.

264
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,550
Of course.

265
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,640
I will buy you another one later.

266
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,980
Erduo, this is homemade plum wine

267
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,850
and it

268
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,510
tastes good.

269
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,610
Take a try.

270
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:20,940
Come on.

271
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,890
Cheers.

272
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,870
How is it, Erduo.

273
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,720
Does it taste good?

274
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,630
Yes.

275
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,910
It tastes good.

276
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,220
One more.

277
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,490
You won't get drunk by drinking plum wine.

278
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,280
Cheers.

279
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:51,960
Drink less.

280
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,530
It's okay.

281
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,020
Erduo, cheers.

282
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,820
Erduo, here.

283
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,130
Nice wine.

284
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:06,990
Right?

285
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,970
One more.

286
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,070
Drink more.

287
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,480
Enough.

288
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,240
It's okay.

289
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,940
It's okay.

290
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,340
Never mind.

291
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,100
This is homemade wine
with low alcohol content.

292
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,430
Come on.

293
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,610
Let me drink for her.

294
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,410
It's none of your business.

295
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,680
It's okay.

296
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,050
It's for my daughter-in-law.

297
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,350
None of your business.

298
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,010
Erduo is a good drinker.

299
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,540
A good drinker.

300
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,070
Erduo.

301
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,390
Mom, leave her.

302
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,010
I will take her home.

303
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,620
Okay, take care.

304
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,960
Don't do anything bad.

305
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,650
Look at your dad.

306
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,720
Erduo. Erduo.

307
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,240
Take care.

308
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,490
Take care.

309
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,310
We are leaving.

310
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,630
Take care.

311
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,090
It's been a long time since I
listened to your new program.

312
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,800
You should be stepping up

313
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,280
to realize your dream.

314
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,260
It will take a while to quit your voice,

315
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,010
but you already have

316
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,740
something you really want to do.

317
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,440
I will also try hard to move forward.

318
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,110
Will you check

319
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,840
this broadcasting station again?

320
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,060
Wish you all the best.

321
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,530
Be happy forever.

322
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,380
I've decided to have the wisdom tooth

323
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,480
that has been bothering me removed.

324
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,830
My offer and scholarship!

325
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,830
Report to school.

326
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,610
Only two months left.

327
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,190
Thank you.

328
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,590
What are you doing?

329
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,790
What?

330
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:43,950
What's the matter?

331
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,210
Nothing, drink milk.

332
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,390
It's for you.

333
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,730
Come on.

334
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,720
Shuwei, leave Erduo to me.

335
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,880
I will take her to go shopping.

336
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,580
Let her keep you company.

337
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,600
Just go.

338
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:26,560
Good girl.

339
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,000
Come on, get in the car.

340
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,080
Go.

341
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,060
Take care.

342
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,430
Bye.

343
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,000
The floral dress.

344
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,260
This piece

345
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,530
is cute and has a lace pattern
that suits you.

346
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,020
No, I can't buy clothes.

347
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,760
Just take a try.

348
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,540
It's okay.

349
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,720
Let's look around.

350
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,830
Well, I think that one is fine.

351
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,170
- Which one?
- The one we just looked.

352
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,790
The one with floral patterns?

353
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,330
Okay, take a try later.

354
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,100
What's this?

355
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,740
Aunt, I think this one looks good.

356
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,880
This one

357
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,510
may make me younger.

358
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,930
But would it be appropriate for me
to wear it at my age?

359
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,860
How come?

360
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,540
It can show your temperament

361
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,910
and flatter your skin tone.

362
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,990
You have fair complexion. Just take a try.

363
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,770
Okay, as you say.

364
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,620
Let me try it.

365
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,700
Excuse me.

366
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,040
So nice.

367
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,840
Really?

368
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,000
I mean it.

369
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,730
Uncle Ye would love it.

370
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,250
When we were young and in love,

371
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,340
he always bought me clothes

372
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,930
and jewelries.

373
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,640
I kept them all.

374
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,880
And there are five boxes of them.

375
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,630
Five boxes?

376
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,160
Yes.

377
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,020
Uncle Ye loves you so much.

378
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,430
Yes, he treats me well.

379
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,180
Not only material needs,

380
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,490
in other respects, he also grants
whatever is requested.

381
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,550
You don't have to envy me.

382
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,820
Listen.

383
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,430
My son

384
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,040
is quite like his dad in this respect.

385
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,510
Come on, let's take a seat.

386
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,530
Erduo, look.

387
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,580
When I was packing my jewelries
the other day,

388
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,000
I found this pair of earrings
suitable for you.

389
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,930
So I took it for you.

390
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,990
Aunt, it's way too precious.

391
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,130
I can't take it.

392
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,350
You have to.

393
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,610
You know what?

394
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,990
This was the first gift his dad gave me

395
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,800
when we fell in love.

396
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,010
I am giving it to you now

397
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,100
to pass it on from generation to generation.

398
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,370
No way, aunt.

399
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,790
No more refusal.

400
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,430
Just take it.

401
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,410
Listen to my words.

402
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,050
I heard from Shuwei

403
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,840
that you were also a famous violinist
at that time.

404
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,590
Well, I have loved music since I was a child.

405
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,820
I chose to play the violin later on.

406
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,230
I intended to reach a higher level in art

407
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,090
at a young age.

408
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,280
But I met his dad later.

409
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,870
So I gradually gave up on world tours.

410
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,070
Do you think it a pity?

411
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,570
Although his dad is like a kidult now,

412
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,100
he was quite serious when he was young.

413
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,390
I remember when I was on world tours,

414
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,130
he often finished work overnight

415
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,860
and stayed by my side.

416
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,540
Seeing him working so hard,

417
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,610
I gradually reduced my work.

418
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,030
Maybe it's just a choice.

419
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,960
Every time I saw him

420
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,280
willingly pay for me,

421
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,080
I felt that

422
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,850
everything else

423
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,010
was less important.

424
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,720
Right, Erduo?

425
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,090
Kid, my only wish right now

426
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,520
is for you and Shuwei to be safe, healthy

427
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,710
and together forever.

428
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,990
All right. Let's look around.

429
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,720
Sure.

430
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,280
Let's go.

431
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,320
You have been searching information
for a long time.

432
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,680
Aren't you tired?

433
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,330
Well, look.

434
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,510
These are a few routes I planned.

435
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,960
It won't take a long time,

436
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,920
but there will be many tourist attractions.

437
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,160
What do you think?

438
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:47,830
No problem.

439
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,780
What about the place to live?

440
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,070
Any requests?

441
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,190
Would you like to stay in an ordinary hotel

442
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,230
or a unique homestay?

443
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,510
But I checked.

444
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,770
Hotels and homestays near the scenic spot

445
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,320
cost a lot.

446
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,320
While the accommodation
further away from the scenic spot

447
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,120
is cheap but inconvenient to travel.

448
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,880
Don't think about me, choose one as you like.

449
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,960
But it's a trip of us two.

450
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,600
It can't be all up to me.

451
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,660
Just choose one.

452
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,020
All right.

453
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,220
I would choose the farther one
with a better environment.

454
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,920
Accommodation is done.

455
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,810
Everyone,

456
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,960
I have something to announce to you all.

457
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,040
For my personal reasons,

458
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,470
I'm going to Japan

459
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,180
next week

460
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,130
for two years.

461
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,330
Our studio will work as usual.

462
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,880
But since I have no way

463
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,910
to participate in any production
during this period of time,

464
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,770
from today on,

465
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,840
I won't take any orders

466
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,010
of advanced customization violins

467
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,710
that need to be made by me.

468
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,480
The recovery time will be decided

469
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,480
after I return from Japan.

470
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,460
At last,

471
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,610
I will also officially decline

472
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,200
the previous violin production order

473
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,950
from the Vienna Philharmonic.

474
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,150
Boss, don't you want

475
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,380
to take this order?

476
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,970
It's such a rare opportunity

477
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,770
and not through seeking.

478
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,040
We can understand that you
cut back business after you go to Japan.

479
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,080
But it's not in your style

480
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,380
that you give up

481
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,480
such an important order.

482
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,230
I've made up my mind.

483
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,990
Hope you can understand me.

484
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,750
Come over.

485
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,940
Charging time.

486
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,520
Are you tired?

487
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,580
Exhausted.

488
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,150
Would you like to eat hot pot?

489
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,090
I prefer eat at home.

490
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,020
Okay, let's go home then.

491
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:37,990
Let's go.

492
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:40,790
Here.

493
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,660
Chef Ye, are you ready?

494
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,780
There are plenty of dishes.

495
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,920
It would be a waste.

496
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,450
Almost done.

497
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,830
Just one more soup.

498
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,980
Shuwei, let's have a good talk.

499
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,070
It's only good for you, nothing bad.

500
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,050
Leaving our business aside,

501
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,880
don't you care about

502
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,260
your apprenticeship with my dad?

503
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,970
I'll wait for your call.

504
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,200
Please don't let my dad down, okay?

505
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,030
Done.

506
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,870
Can we eat so much meat?

507
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,680
More food, more nutrition.

508
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,330
You have been working hard lately.

509
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,420
I remember that when I was injured,

510
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,690
you often prepared swine brains for me.

511
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,160
More food, more nutrition.

512
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,670
It sounds like

513
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,050
you're raising a pig.

514
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,810
So is this a food chain?

515
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,450
You feed me first.

516
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,790
Then eat me.

517
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,050
No wonder there is warning
not to eat too much,

518
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,870
otherwise you will be eaten.

519
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,780
It's too late

520
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,270
to realize it now.

521
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,360
Let's eat.

522
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,540
Hello.

523
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,200
Hello, Erduo.

524
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,250
This is Lin Qingzhuo.

525
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,250
Hello.

526
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,860
Long time no see.

527
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,830
How are you doing recently?

528
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,390
Is the tour going well?

529
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,960
Yes.

530
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,110
I am in America now.

531
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,930
There is another show tomorrow night.

532
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,550
It should be daytime where you are.

533
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,640
Yes.

534
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,720
Erduo, I thought for a long time

535
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,880
and decided to call you.

536
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,600
It's about Shuwei.

537
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,180
Ye Shuwei?

538
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,210
It may be inappropriate for me to say this,

539
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,070
but I hope you could let him go properly

540
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,140
and set him free.

541
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,960
What do you mean?

542
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,550
Has he never told you?

543
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,050
Told me what?

544
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,860
My dad got sick

545
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,120
and lost the ability to make violins.

546
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,910
The level of apprentices

547
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,730
in the workshop is uneven,

548
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,840
so many orders have been backlogged.

549
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,660
My dad has always been

550
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,930
thinking highly of Shuwei.

551
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,820
He hopes him to come back and
to take over the workshop.

552
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,660
For some personal reasons,

553
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,200
I came back last time

554
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,390
to discuss this matter with him, too.

555
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,330
I know that although he said
he would consider it,

556
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,940
he didn't

557
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,960
take it seriously at all.

558
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,160
Why did you call me?

559
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,350
I know he declined the offer because of you.

560
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,150
I thought he once told you about it.

561
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,380
Erduo, you know what?

562
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,080
After Shuwei left my dad
to work independently,

563
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,440
he went through a period of silence
for several years.

564
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,620
He paid a lot of effort into the studio

565
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,460
to make it what it is now.

566
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,730
My dad's violin brand

567
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,840
is quite influential in Italy.

568
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,200
If he runs these two studios together,

569
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,130
I am sure he will achieve even more
in the future.

570
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,720
I say this just in the hope

571
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,140
that they can continue

572
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,850
their painstaking effort.

573
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,420
So you want me to persuade him?

574
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,270
Yes.

575
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,610
He has been avoiding my contact lately.

576
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,930
So I had no choice

577
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,730
but to ask for your help.

578
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,210
Ms. Lin.

579
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,380
Shuwei has always been free.

580
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,560
I never restrict what he wants to do,

581
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,560
neither does he restrict mine.

582
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,000
Mom, I am back.

583
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,670
You must be tired.

584
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,410
Have you eaten anything?

585
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,620
Yes.

586
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,900
I'm going upstairs first.

587
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,890
