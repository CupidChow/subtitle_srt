00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,460
[Episode 9]

3
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,460
Erduo, for the first time,

4
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,890
watch the mouth shape of the animation.

5
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,890
Cheng Lu, do it first.

6
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,420
Erduo, remember your lines as you watch.

7
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,070
Yes.

8
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,250
Why did your mother never tell you?

9
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,520
Yes, she's celestial being.

10
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,170
Chen Xiang, your mom is no longer alive.

11
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,390
Okay, stop.

12
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,430
Erduo, do it with Cheng Lu.

13
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,240
Action.

14
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,680
Are you really my uncle?

15
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,950
Then why did my mother

16
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,620
never tell me?

17
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,890
Yes.

18
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,380
Why did your mother never tell you?

19
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,470
Uncle, since you are celestial being,

20
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,750
is my mom also celestial being?

21
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,230
Yes, she's celestial being.

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,320
Do you know where my mom is now?

23
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,900
Your mom…

24
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,450
Chen Xiang, forget your mom.

25
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,450
Just stay in heavenly palace with me.

26
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,020
What did you say?

27
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,960
Okay, stop.

28
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,690
Get out, please.

29
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,290
Let's go.

30
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,160
How is it, Erduo?

31
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,300
I think it's very difficult.

32
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,830
Am I bad at dubbing?

33
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:40,970
Not at all.

34
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,590
You are just way too involved.

35
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,110
It's pretty good to do this

36
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,980
for the first time.

37
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,110
You know what?

38
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,790
I was much more embarrassed than you

39
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,330
when I dubbed for the first time.

40
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,810
Come on, it will get better and better.

41
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,250
Le Tian, why are you still here?

42
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,720
Of course I'm here waiting for you.

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,590
Ms. Bei.

44
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,660
Let's go home.

45
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,140
You shouldn't waste time waiting for me here.

46
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,480
I will go back with Ye Shuwei.

47
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,110
His luxury car is not here.

48
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,650
I guess he's home.

49
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,420
Let's go back together.

50
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,750
Boss, your violin playing

51
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,960
is simply amazing.

52
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,740
It's different in the recording studio
just now.

53
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,740
It's still lingering in the air.

54
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,850
Boss, you didn't drive today.

55
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,020
Let me take you back.

56
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:00,930
No need.

57
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,080
I'll take a taxi back by myself.

58
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,810
I'll go back by bus.

59
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,700
Just go. Take care.

60
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,700
Go back to the studio
and keep well the violins.

61
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,280
Okay.

62
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,060
I can go back by bus.

63
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,840
It's okay, I'm fine…

64
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,860
Have you finished?

65
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,680
Let's take the bus back together.

66
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,150
Let's go.

67
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,030
So rich of you.

68
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,820
Don't flaunt wealth like this.

69
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,090
Fortunately, I have change.

70
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,790
Thanks.

71
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,580
The Japanese class was delayed
this afternoon.

72
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,900
Le Tian sent me here because
he was afraid that I would be late.

73
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,050
I mean it.

74
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,380
You really don't need to explain to me.

75
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,380
Right.

76
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,980
Bei Erduo.

77
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,540
Your dream is to study in Japan

78
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,520
and become a professional voice actress
in the future, right?

79
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,470
Yes.

80
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,700
So why do you always spend time

81
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,160
on things that don't make sense?

82
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,730
I think you are not working hard

83
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,600
and focusing on your dreams at all.

84
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,400
Instead, you are often distracted

85
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,560
to do unimportant things.

86
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,750
For example, you make up lessons
for Le Tian,

87
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,060
work part-time,

88
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,740
and you even participated
in Internet Celebrity Festival,

89
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,070
so that there was a disturbance
of taking pictures.

90
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,050
Don't you think these things

91
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,540
are distracting you?

92
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,890
It's not safe for a girl

93
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,950
to come back home late, you know?

94
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,200
And someone else needs to pick you up.

95
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,320
What qualifications do you have
to judge my life?

96
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,620
You are the one who lives in the castle.

97
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,120
How could you possibly know

98
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,340
how much effort I put in every day

99
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,980
to get closer to my dream?

100
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,240
I don't have access to your financial
foundation and connections.

101
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,300
I can only work part-time
to save tuition fees.

102
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,520
I can only get a good chance

103
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,750
by participating in more activities.

104
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,660
Once I get an opportunity like this,

105
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,660
I will seize it firmly,

106
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,250
for fear of missing it.

107
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,290
Do you think I don't want to go home early?

108
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,190
I also want to go home early,

109
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,980
have a big meal,

110
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,760
and start studying leisurely,

111
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,510
instead of hanging out
in the middle of the night.

112
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,450
I am eager for that.

113
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,400
What's more,

114
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,380
I didn't ask you to come pick me up.

115
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,860
Listen,

116
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,010
if Le Tian's presence today

117
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,010
made you feel ashamed
in front of your colleagues,

118
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,490
I apologize.

119
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,490
Sorry.

120
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,010
Why are you following me?

121
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,010
Ye Shuwei.

122
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,210
You know me?

123
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,950
Are those things sent by you?

124
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,510
Did you get them?

125
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,920
Do you like the stuff I made for you?

126
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,240
I am not so good at handcraft.

127
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,840
It will get better after several times.

128
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,570
And those garage kits.

129
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,920
I asked a friend to bring them back
from Japan

130
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,220
and they will arrive in a few days.

131
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,730
It's such a coincidence to meet you today.

132
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,310
I don't have makeup on. Hope you don't mind.

133
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,880
You sent those threatening things

134
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,080
to Bei Erduo?

135
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,450
Bei Erduo?

136
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,690
You can't like that woman!

137
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,690
She doesn't deserve you at all.

138
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,640
She is simply…

139
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,960
Your actions have constituted a crime.

140
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:36,970
Hello.

141
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,990
I want to call the police.

142
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,670
Call the police?

143
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,410
Why are you doing this?

144
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:40,950
Let me go.

145
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,030
I like you so much.

146
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,630
Let me go.

147
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,540
No way.

148
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,890
Hello.

149
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,640
Help!

150
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:46,860
Yes.

151
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,680
Sexual harassment!

152
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,330
She's still here.

153
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,310
Sexual harassment!

154
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,230
Yes.

155
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,210
- I want to call the police.
- Here.

156
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,220
You said he sexually harassed you

157
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,850
after he stalked you

158
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,950
into the park, right?

159
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,220
Can you show any evidence?

160
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,530
You are not working hard

161
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,680
and focusing on your dreams at all.

162
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,800
Instead, you are often distracted

163
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,320
to do unimportant things.

164
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,280
A case cannot be filed without evidence.

165
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,640
I think this should be a misunderstanding.

166
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,240
I want to call the police.

167
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,680
I said it was a misunderstanding.

168
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,060
I'm sure it's not a misunderstanding.

169
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,240
I've been getting packages

170
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,770
with threatening content lately.

171
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
And she stalked me today.

172
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,160
To sum up the above situation,

173
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,970
all this is bound to be done by this lady.

Do you have any evidence?

175

We're going to be late.

What happened?

188

It's okay. I just slept too late last night.

189
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,860
So I overslept.

We are at the seaside in this episode.

198
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,890
Today, four couples

199
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,890
will undergo four rounds of tests

200
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,890
to test their tacit understanding.

201
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,710
The winning couples will not be rewarded.

202
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,720
But the losing ones

203
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,170
will receive the harshest punishment.

204

I'll say “bubble gum”.

And you should ask “what to adhere to”.

208

I'll say

a random part of the body.

After that,

you should quickly fit this part of yourself

212
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,620
with the same part of your partner.

213
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,620
We will rate based on speed and accuracy.

was exposed to stalk a girl late at night.

Is it because Ye Shuwei

is just a gentleman on the surface,

265

00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,040
Would you like some?

346
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,660
Eat it yourself.

347
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,490
I usually prepare for two.

348
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,800
Really?

349
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,580
I believe you can eat it all.

350
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,600
Cash.

351
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,740
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight. Eight hundred.

352
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,490
All the family savings over the years

353
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,310
are here.

354
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,550
Hello.

355
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,780
Erduo, are you busy now?

356
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,470
What's the matter, mom?

357
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,320
I have something to tell you.

358
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,770
Something's wrong with my eyes.

359
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,080
My vision is blurry and overlapping.

360
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,850
Sometimes I get blacked out

361
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,770
out of sudden.

362
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,680
Mom, what's wrong with your eyes?

363
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,960
I'll take you to the hospital right away.

364
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,660
You don't have to.

365
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,370
I have been to the hospital.

366
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,740
The doctor said it wasn't a big deal,

367
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,060
just a cataract.

368
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,100
Mom, you must be way too tired.

369
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,760
Daughter, it's my duty to

370
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,070
work hard for this family.

371
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,860
Erduo, I put all our family's money

372
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,600
in a regular financial account.

373
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,760
But I have to treat my eyes.

374
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,240
So I'd like

375
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,160
to ask you

376
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,830
if you have any spare money?

377
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,690
How much do you need?

378
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,940
I won't receive the money for the show
in a few days.

379
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,030
Really?

380
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,200
Great.

381
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,750
After the program team transfers
the money to you,

382
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,880
send it to me.

383
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,140
Keep it in mind.

384
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,330
There are discounts now.

385
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,890
Discounts?

386
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,730
Well.

387
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,610
That hospital

388
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,100
is holding

389
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,420
its 20th anniversary, so patients can
get a discount.

390
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,760
It's the first time I've heard

391
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,750
of a hospital offering discounts.

392
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,520
Yes.

393
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,850
It's the first time I heard of this

394
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,150
after so many years of seeing a doctor.

395
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,940
Erduo, hold on.

396
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,410
Let me remind you.

397
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,440
When you record a program

398
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,340
in the future,

399
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,180
pay attention to your words

400
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,610
and deeds.

401
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,500
You are now a public figure.

402
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,250
Be careful to avoid bad news.

403
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,050
That will have a bad influence on you.

404
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:27,580
Understand?

405
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,740
Yes.

406
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,270
Let me ask you.

407
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,890
What's wrong with Ye Shuwei?

408
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,820
It's said on the news that he stalks women.

409
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,280
Is he a normal person?

410
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,000
Why is there sexual harassment?

411
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,000
Mom, it's all nonsense.

412
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,840
It's not true.

413
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,090
Don't believe in it.

414
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,130
You may believe him.

415
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,050
But would

416
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,100
others do the same?

417
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,930
When others see this news,

418
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,320
they will think that

419
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,770
his character is questionable.

420
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,140
A clean hand wants no washing

421
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,370

Maybe four hours, cyclic covering.

432
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,170
Why are you asking about this?

433
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,160
You don't have a car.

434
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,090
Only four hours?

435
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,840
Right.

436
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,230
That's indeed hopeless.

437
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,610
But let's try.

438
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,790
Let's put this

443
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,760
There is little hope of this approach

444
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,420
to find that person.

445

Why don't you check the surveillance?

446
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,210
I did check the surveillance in the park.

447
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,390
But there is blind angle.

448
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,080
Or it wouldn't be so troublesome.

449
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,100
This is the worst way.

450
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:20,870
All right.

451
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,220

circumstantial evidence.

460

No way.

00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,260
I didn't expect

518
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,500
our trouble this time

519
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,070
to be solved by the midnight cyclist.

520
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,840
Long live the midnight cyclists!

521
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,950
Long live the midnight cyclists!

522
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,980
Li.

523
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,810
I know you've been under much pressure
because of the show lately.

524
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,620
But relax.

525
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,980
There is always a way.

526
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,990
Yes.

527
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,530
Since I was in charge of the show,

528
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,620
I have been busy all the time.

529
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,960
My mind is full of the show,

530
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,350
nothing else,

531
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,700
and I have no time to think about
anything else.

532
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,250
I'm afraid of messing up the show.

533
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,510
Li is the best!

534
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,200
With your intelligence and wisdom,
you can do everything.

535
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,800
But it's your first time

536
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,880
in charge of a large live event.

537
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,970
It's normal for you to
be nervous and stressed.

538
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,340
I feel that the show

539
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,490
is a test arranged by God for me.

540
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,530
Before the show,

541
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,920
the two actors were lost.

542
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,870
If it wasn't for you and Ye Shuwei,

543
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,780
I really didn't know what to do.

544
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,500
That's what I should do.

545
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,930
We've had a lot of trouble,

546
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,930
but we've gotten over it all.

547
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,870
And you achieved a success, right?

548
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,760
In the future, Ye Shuwei and I

549
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,130
will need to wear sunglasses and masks
when going out.

550
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,300
I will really be embarrassed

551
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,770
to cause a social stir.

552
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,220
But after a few episodes of the show,

553
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,910
I think Ye Shuwei

554
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,050
is pretty good.

555
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,580
Although he is usually cold

556
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,060
and expressionless,

557
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,400
he has a great figure.

558
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,720
He has at least six abdominal muscles.

559
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,590
I'm not inferior either.

560
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,230
I am

561
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,070
sexy,

562
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,070
noble,

563
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:04,820
and cute.

564
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:06,930
Enough.

565
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,310
Save it.

566
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:09,890
Cheers.

567
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,060
How deep I loved you.

568
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,410
My feeling is true.

569
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,400
My love is never changed.

570
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,800
The moon represents my heart.

571
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,760
Thank you.

572
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,540
Li.

573
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,300
Li.

574
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,090
My gosh, how did I sing?

575
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,280
I haven't sung for a long time.

576
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,040
I was so nervous.

577
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,170
Not bad.

578
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:05,670
Not bad?

579
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,890
Yes, not bad.

580
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,420
I sang a soulful song for you.

581
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,310
But that's it?

582
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,440
It didn't impress me at all.

583
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,710
Let me sing a touching song.

584
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,420
Okay.

585
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,080
Sing a song.

586
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,300
A song for you.

587
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,850
Okay.

588
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,480
Erduo. Erduo.

589
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,190
I am Li's bestie.

590
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,560
I'd like to

591
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,200
sing a song for Li.

592
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,880
I want to tell you that

593
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,180
no matter what you do, I will support you

594
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,190
and always be by your side.

595
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:38,540
Okay!

596
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,930
Zebra, zebra.

597
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,430
Don't fall asleep.

598
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:58,560
Show me your wounded tail.

599
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,590
Nice.

600
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,310
Erduo. Erduo.

601
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,620
A hug.

602
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,550
I am so touched.

603
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,170
Did you cry?

604
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:15,740
Come on.

605
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,040
Okay, you won.

606
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,190
Drink it.

607
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,700
Come on.

608
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,470
The wine is on me today.

609
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:22,920
Come on.

610
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,340
Cheers.

611
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,010
Did you cheat me?

612
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,760
Why do I feel your breasts
are getting bigger?

613
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,620
Let me check.

614
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,650
Come on.

615
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,730
I put something inside.

616
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,970
I put something inside.

617
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:51,700
You did?

618
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,260
I put

619
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,100
the polyfoam inside.

620
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:56,900
What?

621
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,620
Teach me how.

622
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,140
I am just kidding! You fool.

623
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,870
Just teach me. It's so hard for me
to fall in love.

624
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,370
Erduo.

625
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,420
Tell me is there a pure friendship

626
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,830
between men and women?

627
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,040
Yes.

628
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,650
There is.

629
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,470
Of course.

630
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,450
What?

631
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,610
Between a rotten girl and a gay.

632
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,910
Oh, come on!

633
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,250
Let me tell you.

634
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,010
There is no pure friendship
between men and women at all.

635
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,210
If there is, it should be

636
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
the prelude to love

637
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,950
or the aftermath of love.

638
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,670
Anyway, it never exists,

639
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,220
never ever.

640
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:49,010
Is your relationship the prelude to love

641
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,740
or the aftermath of love?

642
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,370
How could I know?

643
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,050
He didn't tell me anything.

644
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,220
I have no idea at all.

645
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,110
Just let him go.

646
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,510
Li.

647
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:06,610
What?

648
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,840
Your favorite.

649
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Poor and Happy.

650
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,140
Poor and Happy.

651
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,700
I am poor and happy.

652
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,930
Poor and happy every single day.

653
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,390
I am not that serious.

654
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:21,730
It should be…

655
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,300
It's talking about you.

656
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,490
My soul.

657
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,690
Leave me alone.

658
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,170
I drank too much.

659
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,280
I am going to the bathroom.

660
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,380
Stay here.

661
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,130
Stay here. I will be right back.
