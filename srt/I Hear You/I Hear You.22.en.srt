[I Hear You]

2
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,460
[Episode 22]

3
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,270
Here you are.

4
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,880
Thank you.

5
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,160
She just sneaked,

6
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,750
and she lied.

7
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:31,810
Yes.

8
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,920
You didn't use to be this.

9
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,540
Qingzhuo.

10
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,680
Erduo has me.

11
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,870
Don't worry about her.

12
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,700
Mind your own business.

13
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,350
I'm just thinking…

14
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,090
Where were we?

15
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,790
Violin?

16
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,890
Can we not talk about work?

17
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,120
Work is all we can talk about.

18
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,800
Okay.

19
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,950
Let's talk about something else.

20
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,800
Don't we have any other topic

21
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,860
to talk about?

22
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,640
Are you in a bad mood

23
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,180
because of worrying about professor?

24
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,120
Yes, he's in poor condition.

25
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,120
What happened to him?

26
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,460
Is he getting worse?

27
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,640
He could never make a violin

28
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,280
since the stroke.

29
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,000
He was in the best condition

30
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,120
when you came to visit him last year.

31
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,800
At that time he would like to
say something to you,

32
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,570
but he finally failed.

33
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,610
The staff of the workshop
can't make the violins as good as his.

34
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,190
Orders have been delayed to next year.

35
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,900
This time I got home,

36
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,150
he deliberately asked for your help
in the studio.

37
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,260
If you are not willing to,

38
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,700
you don't have to force yourself.

39
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,050
More importantly,

40
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,630
he should now be very angry

41
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,630
with his daughter.

42
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,920
I can't even be with the one I like…

43
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,680
You must be tired.

44
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,050
Take a holiday

45
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,060
after the tour.

46
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,840
That's all for today.

47
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,110
Go to sleep.

48
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,200
Are you going to avoid this now?

49
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,070
I proposed it now.

50
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,840
Qingzhuo, I made it clear

51
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,120
the first day you moved in.

52
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,670
Bei Erduo is my girlfriend.

53
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,090
Are you sure she is the last one?

54
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,970
I hope so.

55
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,000
I have no chance at all?

56
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,150
You will find your own happiness.

57
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,650
Don't leave the opportunity to me.

58
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,590
Yes.

59
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,520
All the time, I am not giving you
the opportunity,

60
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,290
but myself.

61
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,490
It's been fifteen years.

62
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,150
I failed to let you fall in love with me
for so long.

63
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,010
I know that

64
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,730
I am very boring.

65
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,460
I know nothing except playing the violin.

66
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,040
When I miss you, I can only play the violin.

67
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,400
Tell me what I can do.

68
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,170
Enough.

69
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,090
I will book you a hotel room tomorrow.

70
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,470
No need.

71
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,450
I can arrange it myself.

72
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,670
Wait a moment.

73
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,720
This is the violin that I promise you

74
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,580
to play in the tour.

75
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,670
If you get used to it

76
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,340
after the tour,

77
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,960
you can always keep it.

78
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,280
She also participated in the production?

79
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,800
Yes.

80
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,320
Aren't you afraid that I would break it?

81
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,720
We can make new ones then.

82
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,790
But I don't think you will do that.

83
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,690
Bei Duofen.

84
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,440
Why are you here?

85
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,190
I am leaving tomorrow.

86
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,700
Behave yourself.

87
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,580
Okay.

88
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,920
Is it inappropriate leaving
without saying goodbye?

89
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,300
Ye Shuwei, I will stay with my mom
for a while.

90
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,260
Take good care of Bei Duofen.

91
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,450
Ye Shuwei, I will stay with my mom
for a while.

92
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,550
Take good care of Bei Duofen.

93
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,500
Why didn't he say anything?

94
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,970
Does he feel happy secretly that

95
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,460
I took the initiative to move out?

96
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,290
Does he lure the enemy away from base?

97
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,080
Hello.

98
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,060
Are you home now?

99
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,070
No.

100
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,710
So why is the light in your room on?

101
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:26,950
What?

102
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,310
Come out.

103
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,760
I get changed into the pajamas
and I am ready to sleep.

104
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,790
I won't come out.

105
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,350
Or let me come in for you?

106
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,060
Don't. I will come out.

107
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,580
Hold on.

108
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,930
What's up?

109
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,720
Get down.

110
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
I can't see your face clearly.

111
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,910
Jump off.

112
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,710
Jump off?

113
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,780
Jump off?

114
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,200
What?

115
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:22,970
Don't you dare?

116
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,340
Don't I?

117
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:25,890
I…

118
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,230
Of course I dare to.

119
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,170
Don't I dare?

120
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,230
I feel that

121
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,080
I haven't seen you for a long time.

122
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,070
Didn't you see me yesterday?

123
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,710
You forgot that?

124
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,190
It's not enough.

125
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,210
Why did you sneak away?

126
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,790
I didn't sneak away.

127
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,770
When I left,

128
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,380
I said goodbye to the gardener.

129
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,270
And I also sent you a message.

130
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,580
I saw it.

131
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,570
But it's not enough.

132
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,010
You only

133
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,770
informed me afterwards.

134
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,380
I…

135
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,090
My mom asked me stay with her.

136
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,330
So I rushed home

137
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,550
immediately.

138
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,860
And I had no time to inform you.

139
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,770
Are you jealous?

140
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,530
Jealous?

141
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,660
I never get jealous.

142
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,180
So didn't you leave

143
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,210
because of anger?

144
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,260
No, I just wanted to go home.

145
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,140
Don't think too much.

146
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,020
Lin Qingzhuo is gone.

147
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,830
Today.

148
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,830
And she's now living in a hotel.

149
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,530
She will be back to Italy in a few days.

150
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,030
Okay.

151
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,640
I made it clear to her.

152
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,720
Okay.

153
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,310
Erduo.

154
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,750
From the moment

155
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,650
you appeared in my life,

156
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,660
everyone was turned into a compromise.

157
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,540
But I'm not

158
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,790
willing to compromise.

159
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,290
Understand?

160
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,790
I got it.

161
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,170
I am going to sleep.

162
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,780
Hold on.

163
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,840
Don't you have anything to say?

164
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,710
What?

165
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,210
Other couples

166
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,700
will kiss each other

167
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,840
before separation.

168
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,530
All right.

169
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,970
I mean a kiss.

170
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,720
Don't go so far.

171
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,080
I will give it back to you.

172
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,180
What?

173
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,890
Three.

174
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,390
Two.

175
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,840
Your wish came true.

176

Your hand is so small.

179

Ye.

181

Hello, aunt.

Hello.

184

My daughter was just back, and here you are.

185
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,310
What a coincidence.

186
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,550
What a coincidence.

187
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,530
Ye, I have something to tell you.

188
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,970
I can tell that

189
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,380
you are getting along well.

190
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,460
As you know,

00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,760
my girl is

192
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,940
going to study in Japan.

193
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,450
It's so far away from here.

194
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,060
Do you have

195
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,320
any plan?

196
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,390
Well.

197
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,980
You can't only

198
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,700
fall in love, right?

199
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,590
Do you have any further plan

200
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,180
other than fall in love?

201

Erduo, don't worry.

what kind of person I need,

244
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,800
even if he has many shortcomings.

245

We can recognize each other's advantages,

people who have been hurt

a positive and optimistic mind,

251
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,700
right?

252
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,990

skip the dating

254
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,690
and get married directly.

255
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,170
We had a serious talk before marriage.

256
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,550
Mars said that

257
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,420
there is no so-called time to marry,

258
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,300
only people who want to get married.

259
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,350
Mars can always

260
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,550
express his feelings clearly,

261
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,270
which makes me very safe.

I really want to try

263
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,660
the kind of life he described.

264
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,570
So I am willing to get married,

265
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,960
and I will work hard

266
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,880

You hit me.

Didn't you see Ye Shuwei?

273
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,300
No, I came here right after getting changed.

274
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,240
What?

275
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,860
Isn't he groomsman?

276
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,580
Yes.

277
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,710
Don't you want to be the first one

278
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,090
to see his good looks in best man suit?

279
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,280
It's nothing special.

280
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,130
I get tired of looking at him
at home every day.

281
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,760
Is everything going well between you two?

282
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,800
Yes, as usual.

283
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,410
Don't lie to me.

284
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,200
Just tell me

285
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,030
what happened.

286
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,410
Come on.

287
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,420
Li.

288
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,660
When I was at home,

289
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,840
I was almost overwhelmed

290
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,390
by the jealousy.

291
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,990
I'm talking serious.

292
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:43,940
All right.

293
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,660
Go ahead.

294
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,800
I actually trust Ye Shuwei.

295
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,420
And I know there is nothing between them.

296
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,860
Ye Shuwei always keeps a distance
with Lin Qingzhuo.

297
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,360
But

298
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,650
every time

299
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,210
I see them together,

300
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,200
I feel chest distress

301
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,010
and shortness of breath.

302
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,650
I feel uncomfortable,

303
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,510
as if there is a mystic energy

304
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,430
that's about to explode.

305
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,530
You know how that feels?

306
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,580
So I

307
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,120
moved out

308
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,680
before losing control

309
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,860
and doing something strange.

310
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,160
Out of sight, out of mind.

311
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,650

312
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,550

Okay, I will be right there.

316
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,220

318
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,210
and how you feel.

319
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,870

320
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,130
hold the right in your own hands.

321
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,440
Whether you intend to fight, guard

322
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,150
or give up,

323
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,480

please announce the vow of love
to each other.

Dear groom Mars,

340
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,130
marriage is a responsibility and commitment.

341
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,390

are you willing to

344
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,590

Yes.

347
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,930
Dear bride Tang Li,

348
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,350
marriage is a trust and tolerance.

349
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,650

00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,930
when your husband is tired,

351
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,570
are you willing

352
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,170
to hug everything

353
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,960
with your warm arms?

354
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,020
Yes.

355
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,540
The simple words

356
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,030
show their

357
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,220
heartfelt wishes

358
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,510
and responsibilities.

359
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,070
Next, bridesmaid, please

360
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,710
turn the responsibility and heartfelt wishes

361
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,430
into eternal rings.

362
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,030
Please exchange your rings.

363
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,900
Happy groom,

364
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,590
now you can open your arms

365
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,420
and kiss your beautiful princess.

366
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,300
Every couple will receive

367
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,710
the witness and blessings of all guests
at present.

368
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,930
Today, this couple

369
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,200
prepared a gift

370
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,530
to someone at present.

371
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,530
Erduo.

372
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,880
Erduo, come here.

373
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,100
I'm going to give the bridal bouquet

374
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,160
to my best friend.

375
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,600
Erduo, be happy.

376
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,140
Hereby,

377
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,120
I will solemnly ask this couple

378
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,210
if they get prepared

379
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,270
to lead a perfect marriage life

380
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,180
with their beloved.

381
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,640
Are you ready?

382
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,930
We are ready.

383
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,060
Don't cry.

384
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,170
You are crying

385
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,300
as if you would take her for marriage
by force.

386
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,150
Would you cry more miserably
on our wedding?

387
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,850
Forget it.

388
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:17,680
Just cry.

389
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,280
Shuwei.

390
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,060
May I have a dance with you?

391
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,970
May I have a dance with you?

392
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,550
My honor.

393
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,290
Sorry.

394
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,060
We are the only two left.

395
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,380
And it may be our last dance.

396
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,350
Mr. Yu,

397
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,950
do you like to eat hot pot, barbecue,

398
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,270
or spicy hot pot?

399
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,500
Your way of comforting is really special.

400
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,580
If you would like some comforting words,

401
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,450
no problem.

402
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,310
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

403
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,030
Don't listen to love songs.

404
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,220
Sorry, my bad.

405
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,250
How is it?

406
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,440
Now it's my turn to comfort you.

407
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,610
Don't talk nonsense.

408
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,460
Silly girl, listen to me.

409
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,740
Hurry home and take a hot bath.

410
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,240
And there will be so many men outside,

411
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,000
all better than Ye.

412
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:57,050
Those in love

413
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,600
are really similar.

414
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,690
You should look into the mirror.

415
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,410
There are only a few words on your face.

416
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:07,810
What words?

417
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,620
Bei Erduo.

418
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,220
Mr. Yu, let's change dance steps.

419
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,420
Have you ever tried cha-cha?

420
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,900
- Something like this.
- Slow down.

421
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,320
That's it.

422
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,160
- Hold on.
- The feeling.

423
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,880
The steps are different.

424
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,840
Mr. Yu, what you have to do now

425
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,290
is to keep smiling.

426
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,360
Just go.

427
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,980
Since you are here,

428
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,220
let's dance.

429
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,160
Shuwei, would you like to reconsider

430
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,540
about taking over the workshop?

431
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,190
My dad thinks highly of you.

432
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,790
And with the fame of Italian studio,

433
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,030
your career will get better and better.

434
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,130
I don't want you to reject him
because of me.

435
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,060
I will.

436
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,060
Let's talk about it later.

437
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,640
All right.

438
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,780
I will return to Italy tomorrow morning.

439
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,680
Let me send you off.

440
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,280
No need.

441
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,540
I asked the driver to pick me up tomorrow.

442
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:08,550
Li.

443
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,850
If he bullies you, just let me know.

444
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,120
I won't let him go.

445
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,370
Don't worry. He won't bully me.

446
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,650
I will deal with it well.

447
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,200
Maybe it's me who bully him.

448
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,080
Right.

449
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,850
You have always dealing with everything well.

450
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:31,830
Li.

451
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,020
Be happy.

452
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,310
I will. You, too.

453
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,440
Need any help?

454
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,480
I have a headache.

455
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,070
Why did you drink so much?

456
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,510
Where is Mr. Yu?

457
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,860
Why isn't he here?

458
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,510
He asked me to drink with him.

459
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,110
He should be drunk

460
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,050
or tired of crying,

461
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,480
so I found someone to send him home.

462
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,570
Let me take you home.

463
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,400
What did you

464
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,820
ask Yu Sheng just now?

465
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:54,160
You didn't dance with me.

466
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,910
How could you blame me?

467
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,360
It's your fault.

468
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,060
Sorry.

469
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,680
It's Yu Sheng's fault.

470
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,430
He came to you first.

471
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,920
And later…

472
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,830
Why did you drink so much?

473
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,370
I didn't.

474
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,370
You are acting like a kid

475
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,490
as you fell ill.

476
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,940
What are you doing?

477
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,050
It's more comfortable to take the shirt off.

478
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,750
Ye Shuwei, don't play mad.

479
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,550
So what?

480
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,490
Step aside if you are not drunk.

481
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,780
Behave yourself.

482
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,900
I will serve you hydromel.

483
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,080
Sure.

484
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,750
You!

485
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,620
What are you doing?

486
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,300
