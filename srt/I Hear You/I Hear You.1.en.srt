00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,350
Come on, Erduo.

174
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,720
I won't sign it.

175
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,940
But Guru Ye, didn't you lose the bet?

176
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,930
Yes, we only requested you

177
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,880
to appear in one episode.

178
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,500
But,

179
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,410
you were recognized by the audience.

180
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,390
Someone needs to apologize to me.

181
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,520
You.

182
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,400
Why must I apologize to you?

183
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,890
I've done nothing wrong.

184
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,380
I don't like to talk nonsense.

185
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,980
Erduo, Erduo,

186
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,410
calm down. Think about it.

187
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,550
Think more about it.

188
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,250
You offended me in public.

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,230
You have to apologize to me in public, too.

190
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,900
Umm...

191
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,320
Hello.

192
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,550
We're recruiting voice actors and actresses.

193
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,630
That's why we have this kind of interview.

194
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,000
Okay.

195
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,000
Introduce yourself.

196
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,620
Hello, mentors.

197
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,530
I'm No. 34, Bei Erduo.

198
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,950
I'm a senior anime fan.

199
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,570
I'm preparing for the exam

200
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,610
of the voice acting school in Japan.

201
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,240
All right.

202
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,800
Get started.

203
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,990
Once upon a time, in a big forest,

204
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,900
there was a village of the Smurfs.

205
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,580
In the mushrooms of the village

206
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,180
lived many happy Smurfs.

207
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,070
They were a brave team

208
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,590
who helped and worked with each other.

209
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,870
They were a group

210
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,570
of free and clever Smurfs.

211
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,870
Hello, I'm Papa Smurf.

212
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,850
I'm 543 years old.

213
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,660
I... I'm in charge of this village.

214
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,190
Hello, I'm Smurfette.

215
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,610
Do I look beautiful?

216
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,190
I'm Gargamel.

217
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,090
I have great magic.

218
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,460
I created Smurfette.

219
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,950
Don't be tricked by Gargamel.

220
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,860
I've been a good girl already.

221
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,380
All right. We're going to labor.

222
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,910
Labor is the most glorious.

223
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,100
I'm done.

224
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:21,740
Very good.

225
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,470
Thank you, mentor.

226
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,020
Yeah.

227
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,370
Even if I did a poor job, it's all right.

228
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,810
The result is cut and dried, anyway.

229
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,850
You know what?

230
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,150
Those interviewees are quite stupid.

231
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,930
I don't know what makes them happy.

232
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,600
They won't be recruited, anyway.

233
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,520
Thank you for helping with our recruitment.

234
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,110
You're welcome.

235
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,170
In my humble opinion,

236
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,490
No. 34 Bei Erduo did a good job.

237
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,270
But...

238
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,710
The last interviewee is

239
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,920
the niece of our boss.

240
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,860
We have to recruit her for his sake.

241
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,180
In this case,

242
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,040
why did you still invite me?

243
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,120
Ye, your reputation is beneficial

244
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,360
to the image of our company.

245
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,790
The interview is over.

246
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,770
You may leave.

247
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,860
Thank you for coming.

248
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,620
This way, please.

249
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,570
This way, please.

250
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,990
I'm No. 34, Bei Erduo.

251
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,120
I wonder if you could announce

252
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,040
the results of the interview

253
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,570
so that it'll be fair to us.

254
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,930
Sorry, Miss,

255
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,070
but the interview is over.

256
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,660
- The female supporting role Bingbing isn't decided.
- Thank you for coming.

257
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,700
- I'll recommend your sister later.
- You may leave. This way, please.

258
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,350
She'll be recruited.

259
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,400
Ruirui.

260
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,480
What Ruirui?

261
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,600
The name of the female
supporting role is Ruirui.

262
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,140
Don't mess with me.

263
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,390
I'm not an ordinary woman.

264
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,810
You can't even speak
Mandarin Chinese very well.

265
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,970
Of course, you're not ordinary.

266
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,480
Believe it or not,
I'll have you banned in this company.

267
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,630
Do it.

268
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,660
I won't work for such a company
even if I'm invited.

269
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,910
What did you say, Miss?

270
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,190
She's jealous that I've been chosen

271
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,160
and she just slandered me.

272
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,680
Ugly guys like to make trouble.

273
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,960
Ugly guys?

274
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,600
Come on, you...

275
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,810
If you keep making trouble out of nothing,

276
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,930
I'll call the security guys.

277
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,170
You...

278
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:16,720
Make way, please.

279
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,560
You must be the interviewer.

280
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,990
I remember your voice.

281
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,800
You're No. 34, right?

282
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,350
I remember your voice, too.

283
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,550
Look at you.

284
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,330
You have a nice voice.

285
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,380
And you look like a good guy.

286
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,170
But why did you do such a shameless thing?

287
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,700
What did I do?

288
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,790
People like us

289
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,640
have been studying dubbing skills

290
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,770
very carefully every day,

291
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,790
just to get such an offer.

292
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,790
We can't stop you

293
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,960
from pulling strings,

294
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,210
but if you had

295
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,630
no intention of giving us any chance
in the first place,

296
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,080
why bother to hold this interview?

297
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,350
Little chap, don't cook up stories.

298
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,200
You think you've got privilege

299
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,100
because of your relationship?

300
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,630
What's your name?

301
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,920
Why?

302
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,920
I'll remember you.

303
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,680
Wherever you are,

304
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,070
I won't have an interview there.

305
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,380
You sound ambitious.

306
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,290
What's your name?

307
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,290
Bei Erduo.

308
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,650
Come on, ban me.

309
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,700
You...

310
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,650
Go back to the dubbing studio,

311
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,990
apologize to me in front of those concerned,

312
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,840
and rehabilitate me.

313
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,170
In your dream.

314
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,380
The point is...

315
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,890
Ye, what brings you here?

316
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,380
Someone wants to say something to you.

317
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,940
I came to apologize

318
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,690
to Mr. Ye Shuwei.

319
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,960
Mr. Ye Shuwei,

320
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,830
I used to think

321
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,220
you were a very unfair interviewer

322
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,180
who abused his power

323
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,340
to recruit an interviewee

324
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,530
because of their affair

325
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,490
so that other interviewees...

326
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,640
I mean those interviewees

327
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,370
who cherished this chance
and had prepared very carefully for it

328
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,190
were treated extremely unfairly.

329
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,280
They wasted their time

330
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,330
performing in a show

331
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,530
because he showed partiality for his girl.

332
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,040
So, I thought you were

333
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,560
a selfish man who was unprincipled,

334
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,850
amoral, hypocritical, and domineering.

335
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,720
So much for this.

336
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,460
My apologies. I'm sorry.

337
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,680
Apologies accepted.

338
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,010
I have a few more requests.

339
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,980
Why are you so demanding?

340
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,440
Fine.

341
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,690
Li, put down his requests.

342
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,180
Okay.

343
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:09,610
First,

344
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,070
out of the variety show,

345
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,150
we don't interfere
with each other's private life

346
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,150
and we don't contact each other
unless we have to.

347
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,000
Second,

348
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,000
during the shooting of the variety show,

349
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,530
you should keep a good image
and behave yourself

350
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,740
instead of doing stupid things.

351
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,240
It's okay that you lose face.

352
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,700
But don't make people think
I have poor taste in girls.

353
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,010
Mr. Ye, you should pay attention

354
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,060
to your image.

355
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,470
Fine. Now that you expressed your requests,

356
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,120
I have several requests, too.

357
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,310
Hope you two can fulfill them.

358
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,260
First, you must sign
the confidentiality agreement.

359
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,840
Second,

360
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,450
I want you to at least behave like a couple

361
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,850
when you do things.

362
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,140
At last, during the variety show,

363
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,700
you mustn't be in a relationship
with anyone else.

364
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,330
Ask her to behave herself.

365
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,230
I will.

366
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,940
Because I won't...

367
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,470
Won't what?

368
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,160
You're a well-known couple.

369
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,540
If any of you cheats on the other,

370
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,730
there would be scandals, right?

371
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,880
If any of us cheats,

372
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,480
he or she must apologize to the other.

373
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,480
In public, I mean,

374
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,550
so as to vindicate the other.

375
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:19,870
Deal.

376
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,070
Don't move.

377
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,150
[Cooperation Agreement]

378
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:36,530
Ye...

379
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,190
Don't move.

380
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,170
Okay. Now you're a couple.

381
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,270
The last episode was good.

382
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,360
I hope the next episode

383
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,610
will be great, too.

384
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,380
I won't guarantee any effects of the show.

385
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,540
It's not required in the agreement.

386
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,810
How about this?

387
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,990
Follow each other on Weibo, okay?

388
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,920
You can then post some routines.

389
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,460
Nowadays, netizens are
like detectives, after all.

390
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,490
If anything goes wrong, they may realize...

391
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:12,930
Don't bother.

392
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,930
I don't have a Weibo account.

393
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,330
Erduo, I'll leave this to you.

394
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,540
You post some on Weibo, all right?

395
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,440
By the way, friend each other on WeChat.

396
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,720
I don't have a WeChat account, either.

397
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,910
Erduo, I'll share his contact with you later.

398
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,380
Now that you've signed the agreement,

399
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,640
I must work professionally.

400
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,280
I think you can rehearse once a week.

401
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,080
In this way,

402
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,770
your personal space won't be occupied.

403
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,400
During the live broadcast,

404
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,420
you will behave more freely, too.

405
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,810
What do you think?

406
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,880
One hour is the longest time I accept.

407
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,290
I'll only provide my free time.

408
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,120
Nothing else will be my concern.

409
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,180
Fine. It's a deal, then.

410
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,700
Thank you very much, Guru Ye,

411
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,120
for offering your precious time.

412
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,730
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

413
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,220
No, thanks.

414
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,480
Anything else?

415
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,070
Where are you going?

416
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,020
How about driving Erduo?

417
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:23,470
We don't go in the same direction.

418
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,680
I'll ride the shared bike!

419
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,090
Erduo...

420
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,130
How did you find such an arrogant man?

421
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,970
Tell me.

422
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,090
What's wrong with him?

423
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,100
Why did he bully Erduo?

424
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,290
I'm so pissed off.

425
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,710
I'm not to blame.

426
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,930
Come on. I didn't expect any of this.

427
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,840
[Four days ago]

428
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,710
You know Mr. Ye's temper.

429
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,100
He never explains. He's cold and vindictive.

430
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,990
But you want him to be on your variety show?

431
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,840
Are you serious?

432
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,650
- Where's he?
- He's gone to help with an interview.

433
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,680
A friend of his father's

434
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,820
asked him for help with many efforts.

435
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,130
He won't be on your show.

436
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,780
Never think of it.

437
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,680
Guru Ye.

438
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,570
Don't call me that.

439
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,130
He Yang.

440
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,110
When you have time for gossip,

441
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,410
why don't you get to some business?

442
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,350
Have you delivered the violin?

443
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,290
I'm on it.

444
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,870
For a low carbon life, walk there.

445
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,630
But Boss, it's five kilometers away.

446
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,030

447
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,880

448

No.

449
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,870
I'll just take some exercise.

450
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:50,860
Uncle.

451
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,430

00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,130
what are you doing?

453
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,560
Erduo, you know what?

454
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,400
When I pull you like this,
you can grow taller.

455
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,610
I don't think this is the right operation.

456
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,620
I can't move at all.

457
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,530
Fine.

458
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:15,470
Erduo, am I nice to you?

459
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,730
Yes. But you still can't do evil things.

460
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,140
Do you want to save up to study in Japan?

461
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,780
I would rather make efforts for that.

462
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,600
Erduo, please help me out.

463
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,120

Uncle, I signed the contract today.

465
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,440
If you don't agree,
I'll have a breach of contract.

466
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,250
The penalty will be tens of millions.

467
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,690
Apply for bankruptcy, then.

00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,720
I can't do that.

470
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,600
I must answer for my partner.

471
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,570
I must answer for my employees, too.

472
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,390
Besides, you're exactly needed for this show.

473
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,340
How could I find another male guest

474
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,740
as handsome and talented as you?

475
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,280
Right?

476
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,330
If you don't agree to help me,

477
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,840
I'll live in your studio.

478
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,900
Live here as long as you want.

479
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,250
No, no.

480
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,270
How can I be in a relationship
with a stranger

481
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,070
in front of so many audiences?

482
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,060
Erduo, this is an emergency.

483
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,690
If you don't help me,

484
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,130
my show will be gone.

485
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,990
My efforts throughout the year
will go up the spout.

486
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,150
You don't want to see this, do you?

487
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,440
But you'll be selling me to a man

488
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,550
as his girlfriend.

489
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,780
I won't be selling you.

490
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,330
You said a voice actress was an actress, too.

491
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,380
Pretend you're an actress

492
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,130
and act in a variety show

493
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,240
with an actor.

494
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Think about it, Erduo.

495
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,000
It'll take you at least two years

496
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,620
to save up to study in Japan by working.

497
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,740
But if you're on this show,

498
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,210
it may only take you a season.

499
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,470
It'll save you half a year.

500
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,390
Then your dream to go to Japan

501
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,070
can be realized half a year in advance.

502
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,280
But I haven't been in a relationship before.

503
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,690
If my mother knows that...

504
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,570
Why are you up again?

505
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,080
You know what, Erduo?

506
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,940
You won't have anything to lose.

507
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,040
Your partner is super handsome.

508
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,050
Put true feelings into the show.

509
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,380
Maybe when the show is over,

510
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,130
you and he will be in a real relationship.

511
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,270
Isn't it a great thing?

512
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:41,880
I'm serious.

513
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,850
I'll think about it.

514
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,530
Why?

515
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,300
If you don't agree, you can't get off it.

516
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,470
Fine. I agree. Stay away.

517
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,920
Stay away. Stay away.

518
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,970
You should have agreed earlier.

519
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,490
Right?

520
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,070
Uncle, my mother died many years ago.

521
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,330
Stop.

522
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,470
How about this?

523
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,300
There's a CD on the cabinet.

524
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,210
If you can tell the difference

525
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,810
between the two pieces of music,

526
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,240
I'll be on your show.

527
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,090
But...

528
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,010
If you want to try, forget it.

529
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,830
I do. I'll give it a try.

530
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,730
Give me one day.

531
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,850
12 hours.

532
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,890
What's wrong with Guru Ye?

533
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,480
It took me great trouble
to have persuaded Erduo.

534
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,820
Don't ruin our plan.

535
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,600
He won't break his promise.

536
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,300
The point is no one can tell the difference

537
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,120
of the two pieces of music.

538
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,680
I've asked anyone possible for help.

539
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,460
Where's the CD?

540
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,610
Erduo, come out.

541
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,070
What? What have you got?

542
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,810
The two melodies sound
a little bit different.

543
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,410
What kind of difference. Be specific.

544
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,070
Wait a minute. Let me put it down.

545
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,230
Where there's a will, there's a way.

546
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
I figured out the difference.

547
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,530
The first beat of the second bar

548
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,950
in the first quartet

549
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,770
has a rising tone of half a key. Right?

550
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,810
How did you distinguish that?

551
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,160
Time for applause, isn't it?

552
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,110
Nonsense. You can't have distinguished it.

553
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,340
What makes you think so?

554
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,010
I've listened to this CD

555
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,170
the whole night long.

556
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,110
Look at my dark circles.

557
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,890
Come on.

558
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,830
I extracted the waves
of the two pieces of music

559
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,030
and compared them one by one.

560
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,360
I also searched Google and Baidu.

561
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,110
This is my conclusion. Is it right or not?

562
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,890
Uncle, I won, didn't I?

563
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,120
I lost.

564
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,730
