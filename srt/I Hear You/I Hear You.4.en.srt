00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:31,920
See you later.

349
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,890
This is no joke. I swear!

350
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,110
I've sent you the location.

351
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,940
Drive safe.

352
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,980
[INTERCONTINENTAL]

353
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,720
Hey, are you sure this will work?

354
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,880
I've called the paparazzi

355
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,700
who'll be here tomorrow.

356
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,850
What if those two won't do it?

357
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,990
I'll talk to Erduo

358
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,140
and you take care of Ye Shuwei.

359
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,070
Come on. I wish

360
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,580
we could do something else for a change.

361
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,680
In your dreams!

362
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,490
There they are. Let's go.

363
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,110
OK.

364
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,010
Erduo.

365
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,010
Guru Ye.

366
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:26,770
What's up?

367
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,860
Let's talk in the car.

368
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:30,760
Just do it here.

369
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,900
Fine.

370
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,900
Erduo, you got your ID card?

371
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,310
What for?

372
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,400
It's going viral online

373
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,780
that you two are a fake couple.

374
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,370
So we need hard evidence to prove them wrong.

375
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,640
And...

376
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,080
The best way is

377
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,040
to show them how intimate you are in private.

378
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:51,780
Exactly.

379
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,770
This hot spring resort

380
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,220
is popular among couples.

381
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,700
You want us to get a room?

382
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,800
Keep it down.

383
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,750
Just pretend it.

384
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,240
It's not for real.

385
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,340
Pass.

386
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,060
No, wait...

387
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,630
Erduo!

388
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,350
If you don't do it,

389
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,220
we'll be doomed!

390
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,800
Please! Pretty please!

391
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,990
Do me a favor, OK?

392
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,350
Come on. Think about it.

393
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,630
Everyone is calling you guys liars.

394
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,110
All our integrity is at risk.

395
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,090
The company's, this program's,

396
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,910
and yours, too.

397
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,930
Losing your reputation

398
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,620
and public image is too big a price.

399
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,770
And my virginity is not?

400
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,850
Erduo, listen to me!

401
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,880
You said a voice actor is also an actor, no?

402
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,610
Can't you make a little sacrifice

403
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,260
for your dream?

404
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,060
Don't you wanna study in Japan?

405
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,880
Think about your sensei! Yeah?

406
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,930
Here's your key card.

407
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,550
May I see your IDs, please?

408
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,510
Here's your key card.

409
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,330
Your room is 2104.

410
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,580
Have a good night.

411
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,620
Hi!

412
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,660
Thanks for everything, guys.

413
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:08,860
Thank you. I mean it.

414
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,320
Really.

415
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,700
We don't know who tipped them off.

416
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,830
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

417
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,950
Now what?

418
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,280
I won't share a room with him.

419
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,260
Relax.

420
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,280
You two can

421
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,770
take it easy.

422
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,220
Follow my lead,

423
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,600
work with us for the next few days,

424
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,010
and everything will be fine, OK?

425
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,580
Like I had a choice.

426
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:36,640
Good girl.

427
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,060
Get some rest, girls.

428
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,660
He and I will go to our room.

429
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,620
OK.

430
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,120
Guru Ye?

431
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,060
I'm really sorry. Thanks for doing this.

432
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,850
Erduo, are you tired?

433
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,840
Is it tough?

434
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,740
I gotta take this.

435
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,060
Yes, Lin?

436
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,400
I've posted it with a dummy account.

437
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,440
Call the

438
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,980
troll farms

439
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,200
and have them repost and comment on it.

440
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:31,570
OK.

441
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,660
Erduo,

442
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,360
Mr. Yu and I need to go over
the plan for tomorrow.

443
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,900
Get some rest. Don't wait up.

444
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,120
Don't stay up too late.

445
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:45,920
Got it.

446
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,880
Alright. Good night.

447
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,230
Come on!

448
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,110
Haven't we done enough?

449
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,460
No bath in a hot spring resort?

450
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,840
That doesn't make sense, does it?

451
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,700
We're one step away from success.

452
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,860
Come on, Erduo!

453
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,370
You got this.

454
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,680
Come on! Go for it!

455
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,290
Chop-chop!

456
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,830
I'll wait for you in the back.

457
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,980
Go ahead! Go, go, go!

458
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,400
You can do it, Erduo! Yeah!

459
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,810
Over there.

460
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,110
What are you doing?

461
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:50,680
Reports are at the back.

462
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,650
This kind of company doesn't deserve me!

463
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,880
Excuse me, Miss?

464
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,850
They're... He's...

465
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,750
You think you've got privilege

466
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,660
because of your relationship?

467
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,250
So she's not your...?

468
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,820
We can't stop you from pulling strings,

469
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,350
but if you had no intention of

470
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,280
giving us any chance in the first place,

471
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,580
why bother to hold this interview?

472
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,900
I don't think Ye Shuwei is

473
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,160
as bad as you said.

474
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,870
He's a hypocrite!

475
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,650
Why didn't you say anything about it?

476
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,230
Didn't want to.

477
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,910
It's over!

478
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,350
Erduo, you liked being with him, didn't you?

479
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,450
You two would make a perfect couple.

480
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,890
You're

481
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,930
out of your mind.

482
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,770
Anyway, thanks for helping us.

483
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,690
I owe you.

484
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,100
Come on, stop it!

485
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,640
Speaking of couples,

486
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,590
you should take this chance

487
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,720
and make a move on Mr. Yu

488
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,880
while we're still at this resort.

489
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,940
Stay out of my love life.

490
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,610
I'm curious!

491
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,350
