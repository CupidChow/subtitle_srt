[Episode 20]

3
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,890
Go to school?

4
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,980
Don't you think you're too old for that?

5
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,980
How old will you be after finishing?

6
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,800
Even if Ye can wait for you,

7
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,950
will his parents agree?

8
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,570
Just forget about it!

9
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,650
Mom, um, your soup.

10
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,610
What soup?

11
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,390
The soup over there.

12
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,060
Ugh, my swine brain!

13
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,250
You...

14
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,890
Good morning, Miss Bei.

15
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,880
Ye Shuwei, here's your soup.

16
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,610
You have no idea how talkative my mom is.

17
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,880
Thank goodness I came here,

18
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,420
otherwise I'd have to listen to her ramble.

19
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,360
You're really lucky today,

20
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,890
she hasn't even cooked this for me.

21
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,240
After having the soup, leave a comment

22
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,480
or a suggestion.

23
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,430
But no negative comments are allowed.

24
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,500
Ye Shuwei.

25
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,400
What's wrong?

26
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,060
I'm okay.

27
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,420
Are you having tinnitus again?

28
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,270
If you feel unwell,

29
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,240
tell me. Don't pretend that you're okay.

30
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,860
Boss, how about you rest for a few days?

31
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,090
Yeah.

32
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,320
Boss, we still have a month left.

33
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,160
It should be fine.

34
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,160
Not to mention that dizziness
and tinnitus are serious symptoms

35
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,410
that are likely to affect
the finished product.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,500
Boss, the paint has dried.

37
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,280
We have plenty of time.

38
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,270
There are a few days left.

39
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,900
We need to shine, polish,

40
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,200
assemble and tune.

41
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,700
Boss,

42
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,530
do you still insist on manual tuning?

43
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,610
We can try to use a tuner.

44
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,650
Tuner is not accurate after all.

45
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,300
The human ear is quite sensitive.

46
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,990
Or we can find a violinist

47
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,950
to come here and check.

48
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,610
Violinists

49
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,720
are too busy for this.

50
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,540
What? What have you got?

51
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,400
The two melodies sound
a little bit different.

52
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,710
The first beat of the second bar

53
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,050
in the first quartet

54
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,330
has a rising tone of half a key.

55
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:07,950
Right?

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Maybe... I can help.

57
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,840
This is just like an idol drama.

58
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,990
But,

59
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,620
jokes aside,

60
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,620
do you think that the sound

61
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,200
of this violin is getting better?

62
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,340
It's not just getting better.

63
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,780
It is improving

64
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,630
so rapidly.

65
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,420
Wait a moment.

66
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,460
There was a note
that is a bit inaccurate just now.

67
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,410
But to be honest,

68
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,270
I can't tell

69
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,350
the difference between the sound today

70
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,040
and the one yesterday.

71
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,620
But we've been tuning it for a month

72
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,000
and even I can tell that the sound
has been substantially improved.

73
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,180
Music sensitivity is indeed the key.

74
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,480
In my opinion, this is the power of love.

75
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,490
Is that okay?

76
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,040
Much better.

77
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,070
Let's have a rest.

78
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,500
Time to change the topic.

79
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,980
Okay.

80
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,130
Ye Shuwei, you have so many violins here.

81
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,940
Do you often have them shelved?

82
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,970
Of course not.

83
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,890
The biggest praise for a violin

84
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,890
is to play it every day.

85
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,570
If you really like your violin,

86
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,790
you won't just put it
on the shelf and revere it.

87
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,460
For a great musician,

88
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,730
the violin's sound will get better
and better through playing.

89
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,510
So, I'm just taking care of it
for the time being

90
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,520
before it finds the right owner.

91
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,450
If you like it, you won't leave it
in the cold.

92
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,520
But it sounds like

93
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,690
you're describing a person.

94
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,310
Of course.

95
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,670
Every violin has its life.

96
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,010
So I gave a name

97
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:51,960
to every violin I made.

98
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,390
Name?

99
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,240
So what's the name of this one?

100
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:00,780
Time.

101
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,800
That one?

102
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,580
Nameless.

103
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,290
You've given it a name. How's it nameless?

104
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,040
It will be unhappy.

105
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,310
How about this one?

106
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,400
Medium.

107
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,770
Medium.

108
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,280
Do all the names

109
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,740
have two Chinese characters?

110
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,750
No, not all.

111
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,260
For example, that one below is different.

112
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,730
What's it called?

113
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:29,970
Chase.

114
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,220
It fits you well.

115
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,980
So which is the one
that has won the Golden Prize?

116
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,020
Time.

117
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,640
Do you want to hear its sound?

118
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,540
Okay, that's enough.

119
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,780
Actually, when I first learned violin,

120
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,710
I didn't like Bach very much.

121
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,590
I thought his music was old-fashioned
and boring.

122
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,060
But later, I somehow fell in love

123
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,110
with his solemnity and symmetry.

124
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,930
A perfect cycle.

125
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,500
When listening to this piece, I think

126
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,830
of looking down and praying

127
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,440
in the spire of the church.

128
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,940
I'll bring you coffee.

129
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,990
Now, let's welcome violinist Bei Erduo

130
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,950
to play Air on the G String for us.

131
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,570
Thank you, thank you.

132
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,950
Boss, you were awesome just now.

133
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,600
Are you having too much free time?

134
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,770
No.

135
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,540
By the way,

136
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,650
we have to send the violin to the committee

137
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,410
in ten days.

138
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,540
I see.

139
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,060
I'm almost there.

140
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,290
I'll tell you when it's finished.

141
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:36,830
Okay.

142
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,590
What are you doing?

143
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,700
Why didn't you knock on the door?

144
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,490
This is my studio.

145
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,130
Ah, right.

146
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,760
This violin looks heavy

147
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,740
so I want to check it out myself.

148
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,980
It's quite light.

149
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,610
I can teach you if you want to learn.

150
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,880
For free.

151
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,250
Um, no, thanks.

152
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,830
To learn to play an instrument,
one needs to start at a young age.

153
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,680
I'm already too old for that.

154
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,010
Who told you so?

155
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,170
You can start at any age
as long as you really like it.

156
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,800
Hold it.

157
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,800
Hold it firmly.

158
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,980
Mars, welcome to China.

159
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,090
Thank you.

160
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,700
So this is the famous place
you were telling me?

161
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,810
Yeah, very famous

162
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,320
and very popular.

163
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,500
Come on, let's have a drink first.

164
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,340
Cheers!

165
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,380
- A drink to cool down.
- Come on.

166
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,880
I'll tell you later.

167
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,660
Come on, let's drink.

168
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,360
Come on.

169
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,850
Cheers.

170
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,070
Look over there!

171
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,710
What's happening between you two now?

172
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,120
You broke up?

173
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,300
They have been there for a while.

174

We've been watching them for you.

175
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,330
What's there to watch for?

176
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,130
How can we break up when we've never dated?

177
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,040
What are you thinking about?

178
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,380
Really, brother?

What's wrong?

182
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,020
Turn your face to the side.
There's something...

183
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,170
What's that foreign dude doing?

184
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,850
That's great!

185
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,860
He's a real flirt!

186
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,770
He must be an Italian!

187
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,390
Mars, this...

188
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,450
This is an old trick.

189
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,940
Really?

00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,560
But thank you anyway.

191

193

Cheers.

194

I'm taking something out.

195
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,520
Give me your hand.

196
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,400
Hand. Okay.

197
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,460
What's this?

198
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,360
I put my heart in your hand.

199

What's wrong?

200
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,180
I'm okay.

201

202

or eating regularly these few days.

203
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,540
My stomach aches a bit.

204
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,770
I'm sorry.

205
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,890
I don't know you can't drink.

206
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,590
No,

207
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,980
don't underestimate our Chinese women.

208
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,140
I'll drink you under the table
when I feel well.

209
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,390
Okay. I'll wait for you.

210
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,280
Okay.

211
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,480
But I think we should go home now.

212
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,130
Go home and rest

213
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,570
when you're feeling unwell.

214

Your health is the priority.

Let's go.

216
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,620
Is that okay?

217
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,730
Okay, of course.

218
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,110
Thank you.

219
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,970
Let's go.

220

[The 5th Violin Making Competition of China]
[First Prize]

222
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,410
This violin doesn't need any more tuning.

223
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,380
If you're sleepy, you can go to bed first.

224

I'm not sleepy.

225
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,940
I'm not... I will...

226
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,420
I have to witness the birth
of an exceptionally great violin.

227
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:50,960
What's up?

228
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,720
It feels different

229
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,940
when you've made an effort,

230
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,220
right?

231
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,550
I'm not sleepy...

232
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,870
If you're not sleepy,

233
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,120
help me think of a name

234
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,110
for this violin.

235
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,140
I give you special approval.
You can give it a long name,

236
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,030
maybe even a ten-character one.

What are you doing?

Yu Sheng!

Dude, are you taking advantage of her?

What are you doing? Let go of him.

246
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,350
I mean, he wants to kiss you forcibly
when you're drunk.

247

That's not the case!

It's a misunderstanding.

It's a misunderstanding!

251

Let go of him.

252
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,690
Mars wasn't going to kiss me then.

253
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,590
He was just helping me

254

seeing that I was feeling unwell.

Yes.

You call it a misunderstanding
when you almost kissed?

259

We didn't!

260

Where's the violin?

267
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,510
Where's the violin...

268
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,600
I've finished the tuning.

269
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,580
Finished?

270

Let me see it.

271
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,960
Can't believe I've missed
the most important moment.

272
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,200
Is that so important?

273
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,050
Of course.

274

Had you told me earlier,
I'd have woken you up.

275
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,490
I just want to enjoy the thrill of victory

276

when we give each other a high five
at the last moment.

277
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,170
Let's have a high five now then.

278
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,640
It's not the same feeling
when I've missed that moment.

Is it late?

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,210
You'll know it when we arrive.

284
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,620
You keep me guessing.

285
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,030
Are you going to sell me?

286
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,670
Then your price tag should be "invaluable".

287
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,760
I knew it.

288
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,350
Thirty minutes to go.

Why are we in your backyard?

292
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:46,730
Do you know it?

293

Fireflies can only live for seven days.

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:11,140
and watch over you silently in the dark.

298
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,010
Bei Erduo,

299
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,840
I took you here

300
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,430
because I want you to know that

301
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,650
you're playing this role

302
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,650
in my life.

303
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,780
You showed me the direction

304
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,780
in endless love

305
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,970
and taught me
how to genuinely care about a person.

306
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,040
Now,

307
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,050
I want to prove it to you.

308
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,270
You can make a wish when seeing fireflies.

309
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,800
If you have any wish,

310
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,150
don't miss the chance.

311
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:55,890
I want to be the best voice actress.

312
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,110
You will.

313
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,460
Got it.

314
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,090
I've got the name for the violin.

315
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,350
Night Sparkle.

316
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,460
How's that name?

317
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,810
But you said in the evening

318
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,150
that I'd be the one to name it.

319
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,090
That's because you were asleep.

320
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,120
My hearing is good.

321
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,130
I can hear it even when I'm asleep.

322
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,130
Okay.

323
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,480
You name it then.

324
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,490
I'll name it...

325
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:02,760
Bei Erduo and Ye Shuwei Light up the Night Sky.

326
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,670
Exactly ten characters.

327
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:09,520
Good.

328
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,840
Then, when I introduce this violin later,

329
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,290
I'll use this name.

330
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,180
I'll also tell everyone

331
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,840
that it is named

332
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,080
by a girl called Bei Erduo.

333
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,680
That's just a throwaway remark.

334
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,420
But I'm taking it seriously.

335
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,980
It's a deal.

336
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:32,900
Nope.

337
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,680
That's too sloppy.

338
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,440
We have to give it a meaningful name.

339
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,260
Not necessary.

340
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,480
I think this one is good.

341
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,390
Okay then. It's your violin after all.

342
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,320
Call it whatever you want.

343
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,470

Look at me.

345
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,120
I am looking at you.

346
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,420
Breathe.

347
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,620
What did you do?

348
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,540
You don't like it?

349
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,000
You can kiss me back if you don't like it.

350
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,330
Of course. Who cares?

351
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,940
When will you get off work?
I'll go pick you up.

352

[Li]
Sorry for yesterday. I was a bit drunk.

353
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,580
Can you please give me another chance?

354
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:43,780
Come in.

355
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,370
Boss Yu, this is the new proposal.

356
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,140
I see.

357
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,620
Um, wait a moment.

358
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,360
Boss Yu, what else?

359
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,920
What's the name of the show
Tang Li is filming now?

360
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,560
Ms. Tang?

361
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,270
Recently she's filming a documentary

362
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,410
called Genius and Violin.

363
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,250
Okay.

364
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,870
Got it. You can leave now.

365
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:18,970

[General Manager]

367
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,400
Hello, Boss Yu.

368
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,050
I want to talk about the positioning

369
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,280
of our new show with you.

370
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,400
Do you think we should make

371
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,170
a music-themed reality show?

372
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,830
Xing Zhen,

373
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,430
it's not good to just borrow
other people's ideas.

374
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,680
I prefer original work.

375
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,600
I think now

376
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,170
you should make an effort to figure out

377
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,050
something new for the new show,

378
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,650
rather than use ideas
from other people's shows.

379
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,900
You can't last long this way.

380
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,420
I see, Boss Yu.

381
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,330
Actually, I've long been admiring you.

382
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,240
I think you're a brilliant man.

383
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,520
I wish to receive more advice from you

384
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,950
and to spend more time with you.

385
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,370
We'll have the opportunity to work together

386
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,440
if you give me good creative solutions.

387
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,490
After all, I'm your supervisor

388
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,620
and it's my duty to give you advice.

389
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,370
Okay. I'll leave now.

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,010
What is Allen having?

395
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,670
Looks good.

396
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,440
It's called swine brain soup
with gastrodia and wolfberries.

397
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,080
Swine brain soup?

398
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,400
Oh my God,

399
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,480
Chinese people are amazing.

400
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,360
Do you want to have a try?

401
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,400
I simmered it for over five hours.

402
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,120
Ask Ye Shuwei to share some with you.

403
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,790
Ah, no, thanks.

404
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,790
My brain works fine.

405
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,080
Ah, by the way,

406
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,830
did you just say you'd cook steak?

407
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,550
How does Alicia like her steak?

408
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,070
Medium well,

409
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,340
because she doesn't really like her food raw.

410
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,540
Also, she's allergic to blueberries

411
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,520
and would only have her salad

412
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,510
with sesame dressing.

413
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,600
Sesame dressing...

414
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,410
And...

415
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,210

Moyu,

420
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,710
when you said you were going to study,

421
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,420
I thought you weren't being serious.

422
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,950
I didn't expect that you'd leave so soon.

423
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,760
Yeah.

424
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,670
You've long been the key figure
of our company.

425

Now you're leaving...

There will always be new members
 in the future.

00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,530
And, even though I've left,

431
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,750
I'll always have your back.

Maybe you've forgotten something.

00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,390
It was very late when we got off work

447

last Valentine's Day.

448
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,290
You bought the rest of the flowers

from a girl's basket.

450

I knew I'm wrong. I...

457
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,590
You're not wrong.

458
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,060
I'm the one who thought too much.

459
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,380
No, I... I'm not dating Xing Zhen...

460
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,400
It's not because of other people.

461
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,190
I spent so much time with you,

462
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,570
but I've never told you

463
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,180
I love you.

464
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,470
Li...

465
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,670
This time...

466
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,410
Can we start again?

467
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,610
Let me court you this time.

468
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,590
Are you sure?

469
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,520
I...

470
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,520
Have you thought it through?

471
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,410
I have no sense of security in relationships

472
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,720
and I'm very possessive.

473
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,690
I can't stand you being nice to others,
not even a bit.

474
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,890
Are you sure you can accept me like this?

475
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,680
I'm very strong-willed

476
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,740
and I don't know how to play cute.

477
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,890
If we argue,

478
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,190
I won't even apologize to you.

479
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,210
Are you sure you can accept

480
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,510
and tolerate me as who I am?

481
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,890
I can. I...

482
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:27,430
Also,

483
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,660
are you sure

484
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,320
you're here not because

485
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,290
you saw me with someone else?

486
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,180
Are you sure?

487
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,370
It's not!

488
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,160
I just...

489
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,390
Then why didn't you come to see me

490
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,930
when I was away?

491
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,600
Why did you hold back

492
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,970
when I confessed my love to you?

493
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,100
Tell me why!

494
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,000
It's very late now.

495
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,810
Go home.

496
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,250
Take good care of yourself.

497
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,280
Remember to eat well. Don't make do.

498
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,860
Decline the dinner party invitations
as much as you can.

499

I can't drink on behalf of you anymore.

500
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,120
Go home.

501

Okay.

504

Let me fill your glass.

505
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,310
Let's drink when they're gone.

506
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,080
We're the only ones here.

507
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,450
I think Youyou went to the bathroom.

508
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,520
She should return soon.

509
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,440
Guess she's drunk.

510
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,430
Moyu,

511
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,670
actually I really envy you.

512
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,530
Envy me?

513
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,090
For what?

514
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,240
I envy that you can achieve

515
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,050
whatever you want to do.

516
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,610
I envy that you're
such a great voice actress already,

517
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,360
but you can still turn around

518
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,270
to pursue other dreams without hesitation.

519
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,220
I envy that you're taking control

520
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,860
of your life.

521
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,920
No one can take control

522
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,640
of their life.

523
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,340
Even if someone appears to,
it's just a temporary illusion.

524
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,520
Some people may seem to be taking control,

525
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,560
but they still need to give up something

526
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,550
in some ways.

527
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,460
Give up something?

528
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,380
You mean your boyfriend?

529
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,320
He's only a part of it.

530
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,200
Have you discussed about the future?

531
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,780
We have.

532
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,050
But

533
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,120
we know each other too well.

534
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,250
We didn't make any commitment for the future,

535
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,580
nor did we break up.

536
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,780
Isn't this a kind of escape?

537
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,500
This is not escape.

538
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,900
This is reality.

539
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:28,960
Yu Sheng.

540
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:33,930
Goodbye.

541
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,180
Okay, enough about me.

542
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,310
How about you?

543
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,670
You're working hard for your life, too,
aren't you?

544
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,230
Yeah,

545
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,960
I'm still working hard for my dream.

546
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,120
But it's so close yet so far.

547
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,770
Like it's playing hide-and-seek with me.

548
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,820
Now even I kind of hate myself.
