00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,290
Okay, remember to post it on Weibo.

176
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,780
I got to go now.

177
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,040
I'm out for a dinner.

178
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,560
If you are hungry,

179
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,900
order some takeout yourself.

180
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,670
Come back early.

181
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,490
Okay. Remember to post on Weibo.

182
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,020
Love you.

183
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,120
Hello, Le Tian.

184
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,170
Erduo, where are you now?

185
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,890
Le Tian, I'm sorry.

186
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,250
I can't give you the lesson today.

187
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,700
What's going on?

188
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,730
What happened to you?

189
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Do you need my help?

190
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,790
I'm fine.

191
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,530
I just feel very tired today.

192
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,390
Shall we choose another way?

193
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,400
I'm sorry.

194
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,170
Doesn't matter. Let's meet another day.

195
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,490
Okay. Bye-bye.

196
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,250
Let's have a toast for our cooperation again.

197
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:18,920
Cheers.

198
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,890
Cheers.

199
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,360
Did you watch the first episode?

200
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,880
Yes.

201
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,020
The feedbacks were really good.

202
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,230
We should give the credit to Miss Tang.

203
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,040
Come on,

204
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,490
Miss Tang, a toast to you.

205
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,870
Okay, Mr. Zhang.

206
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,070
Mr. Zhang is right.

207
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,460
But today,

208
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,960
let me propose a toast to you.

209
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,550
It's boring to drink with my assistant.

210
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,540
I'll drink this for her.

211
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,130
I was really happy today.

212
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,260
But Li,

213
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,410
you don't have to drink for me.

214
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,450
I won't get drunk

215
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,050
so easily as before.

216
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,760
But now

217
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,380
I have a hollow leg.

218
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,490
Come on.

219
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,670
I still remember when we were at school,

220
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,600
you were dragged out each time.

221
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,440
You were dragged out.

222
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,030
You get drunk with simply

223
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,440
a bottle cap of wine.

224
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,690
Yeah. It's been so long since we graduated.

225
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,000
I've become a man with a hollow leg

226
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,600
from getting drunk with a bottle cap of wine.

227
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,240
And you.

228
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,540
You, too.

229
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,870
You've grown up from a careless little girl

230
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,690
to today's

231
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,180
capable woman.

232
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,370
But you don't have to look stern.

233
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,430
Really, don't always have a stern look.

234
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,290
Jinzi and the others always say

235
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,080
that you are too harsh

236
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,610
and too strict.

237
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,310
And you look so emotionless

238
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,570
and only care about your job.

239
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,900
Do I?

240
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,630
It indicates that they are not busy enough.

241
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,350
Otherwise, they wouldn't have time to gossip.

242
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,080
But I know you are not.

243
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,200
You are back.

244
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,010
Where were you last night?

245
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,540
You are up.

246
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,600
I worked overtime.

247
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,970
I'm really tired. I'm gonna wash up.

248
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,600
What are you doing?

249
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,610
You worked overnight for a party?

250
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,180
Your clothes are creased,

251
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,060
opening so low in the neck.

252
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,480
The perfume is not the one you usually use.

253
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,540
You have a smell of wine.

254
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,250
And Li,

255
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,560
you've been wearing your lipstick

256
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,090
all night.

257
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,430
It looks still natural and rosy.

258
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,330
Then last night,

259
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,290
who were you working overtime with?

260
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,480
It's of course Mr. Yu,

261
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,480
and other colleagues, too.

262
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,080
You must be very tired.

263
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,150
Then

264
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,860
your office environment

265
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,920
must be particularly pink, right?

266
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,210
You are a girl.

267
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,030
Can you just focus on your personal image?

268
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,020
Have you brushed your teeth yet?

269
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,210
Go brush your teeth. Go now.

270
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,520
I can't bear you. Go.

271
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,840
Li, let me tell you this.

272
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,240
I'm not experienced in love,

273
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,100
but I'm experienced theoretically.

274
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,810
As for comic and fiction books,

275
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,520
I've read eight thousand if not ten thousand.

276
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,130
I know every well about it, Li.

277
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,360
I… I am

278
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,700
Wang Yuyan in love.

279
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,770
Do you know Wang Yuyan, Li?

280
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,940
Okay, okay, stop.

281
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,770
Can you be that smart

282
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,310
on our show.

283
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,570
You're going to piss me off.

284
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,380
But

285
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,480
you know what Ye Shuwei is like.

286
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,720
I've tried my best

287
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,900
to hold it till now.

288
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,160
Let me show you.

289
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,860
No.

290
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,740
No need.

291
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:51,660
No.

292
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,060
Not the same direction.

293
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,250
Okay, okay. You suffered a lot.

294
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,390
Just stand him for your studies abroad.

295
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,890
Okay?

296
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,660
Come on, go brush your teeth.

297
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,060
Just go.

298
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,080
What?

299
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,450
Let me see.

300
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,510
I'm gonna take a shower.

301
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,680
Or I'll be late for the filming.

302
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,320
You got to hurry, too.

303
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,860
Bye.

304
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,680
Hello.

305
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,620
Okay.

306
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,760
Okay, I know.

307
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,160
Okay, I'll tell him.

308
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,610
Boss,

309
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,610
Mr. Yu said the filming schedule has changed

310
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,250
and told you to go film tomorrow.

311
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,350
Boss,

312
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,640
I watched the show.

313
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,920
But I dared not to ask you about it.

314
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,680
Who is that girl?

315
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,860
Why haven't I seen her

316
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,130
or heard you mention her?

317
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,840
Bei Erduo.

318
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,760
The netizens all agree that

319
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,370
you are the best in coupling.

320
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,530
And you are perfect for each other.

321
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,620
Do you have a lot of time lately?

322
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,410
No, no, no.

323
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,230
Hello, everyone. I'm Bei Erduo.

324
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,230
I've been a little busy lately.

325
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,800
But today I'll keep reading to you

326
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.

327
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,430
When Rebecca told what happened,

328
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,360
Uncle Kiri kept coughing

329
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,540
and moving back and forth on the chair.

330
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,940
Would you like to play the role of mother?

331
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,450
Make me one more cup of tea.

332
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,890
Erduo?

333
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,010
Erduo.

334
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,790
Come on.

335
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,500
Dess up and follow me to the mall.

336
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,110
Come on.

337
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,470
I…

338
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,390
Come on.

339
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,830
I'm not going.

340
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,930
What?

341
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,240
I'm aching all over
for riding the bike yesterday.

342
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,200
I just received a notice from Mr. Yu.

343
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,720
We'll film tomorrow ahead of schedule.

344
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,880
You need some new clothes.

345
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,530
But why is it ahead of schedule?

346
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,020
Something is going on about the venue.

347
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,170
Let's go.

348
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,800
Hurry up.

349
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,390
Hurry, little lazy bone.

350
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,510
Hurry up.

351
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,860
It's urgent. Come on.

352
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,860
Have you got everything ready for interviews?

353
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,250
Yes.

354
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,020
I collected a lot of materials

355
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,840
and sorted them out yesterday.

356
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,060
I ticked those with good voices.

357
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,800
But no one is perfect.

358
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,590
It's really hard

359
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,150
to find someone with a perfect pitch.

360
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,220
Okay.

361
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,380
Let's have interviews on time this afternoon.

362
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,960
Okay.

363
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,880
Then I'll do the coloring work
after the interviews.

364
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,490
Boss,

365
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,900
didn't Mr. Yu say

366
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,900
that he had heard the differences.

367
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,560
Let's take a look inside.

368
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,910
Welcome.

369
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,650
What can I do for you?

370
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,590
This one

371
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,890
and the pants of her size,

372
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,200
she will try these on.

373
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,050
Miss, you really have a good taste.

374
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,850
These are new styles in our shop

375
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,560
and just arrived yesterday.

376
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,390
Try these.

377
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,470
Okay.

378
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,330
You may leave.

379
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,210
This way, please.

380
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,300
Next one. No. 5, Chen Chen.

381
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,300
Hello, everybody.

382
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,110
I'm Dr. Chen.

383
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,920
You worked as a recordist
at Weta Audition Studio?

384
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,280
Yes, of course.

385
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,310
I came back from the U.S. early this year.

386
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,220
In fact, the payment there was good

387
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,160
and there were more opportunities.

388
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,230
The boss also decided to promote me

389
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,190
to be the audition director next year.

390
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,660
But anyway,

391
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,110
patriots like me will eventually come back

392
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,720
to serve our motherland.

393
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,400
Okay.

394
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,320
You will hear two pieces of music.

395
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,480
Please put on the earphones.

396
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,620
You need to tell me the differences.

397
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,530
Okay. No problem.

398
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,840
I have a question.

399
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,420
Do all interviewees

400
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,640
hear the same music?

401
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,910
I think I can

402
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,280
listen to something more difficult.

403
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,180
I'll start then.

404
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,690
Good. You look much nicer.

405
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,800
I just feel

406
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,280
this is not my style.

407
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,070
It's more like your style.

408
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,420
No.

409
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,130
You exactly need some clothes of this style.

410
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,160
I think it looks very good on you.

411
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,380
The top is more than two thousand

412
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,740
and the pants are over one thousand.

413
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,180
The clothes look really good on you.

414
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,040
Clothes in our shop are all limited editions.

415
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,190
You don't need to worry about
wearing the same with others.

416
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,600
I'll look at some others.

417
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,410
Erduo even buys clothes here.

418
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,210
Where is your boyfriend?

419
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,810
He has something to do today.

420
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,470
Hello, Miss Zhang.

421
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,500
Some of the latest styles just arrived.

422
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,960
And many will be perfect on you.

423
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,570
The one she's wearing looks good.

424
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,920
Erduo, are you going to buy it?

425
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,170
No.

426
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,660
Right.

427
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,900
It's too expensive to shop at a mall.

428
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,480
It's best to buy the same style on Taobao.

429
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:43,930
Okay.

430
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,460
You've listened to the music.

431
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,130
Please tell us the difference you heard.

432
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,400
Is that all?

433
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,470
The music is so good that I've reveled in it.

434
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,830
In fact, the difference is very subtle.

435
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,160
I think there is a little problem

436
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,530
with the cello playing in the second piece.

437
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,330
According to my professional judgement,

438
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,180
the tuning

439
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,740
was not so accurate.

440
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,280
That caused the imperfect pitch

441
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,940
at the third section.

442
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,700
Of course, the first piece of music

443
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,220
is complete

444
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,860
without any problem.

445
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,230
Also, there seems to be a little problem

446
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,080
with the violin playing in the second piece.

447
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,440
I really reveled in the music

448
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,330
and didn't expect it to be so short.

449
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,260
It's just over before I realized it.

450
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,470
May I try this again?

451
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,410
Every interviewee has only one chance.

452
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,070
You may leave now.

453
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,020
Okay, that's all for your interview.

454
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,740
You may leave.

455
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,900
What are you doing?

456
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,570
Who are you?

457
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,210
Who are you?

458
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,760
I'm an old schoolmate of Erduo.

459
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,500
Erduo doesn't buy the clothes, but I will.

460
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,420
Where does this old schoolmate come from?

461
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,250
Who told you that we won't buy these?

462
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,570
Erduo, who is this?

463
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,330
Zhang Yilu.

464
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,610
Zhang…

465
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,950
Oh, the one on your graduation photo

466
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,510
with small eyes, a collapsed nose,
round chin and thin eyebrows.

467
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,060
Ow!

468
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,780
You must spend a lot on the cosmetic surgery.

469
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,730
My God.

470
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,960
Who are you?

471
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,430
It's none you your business.

472
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,860
Do you buy the clothes for her?

473
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,870
If not, take them off.

474
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,420
Who told you we won't buy?

475
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,130
Excuse me, we take the clothes.

476
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,920
Li, I think

477
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,880
the clothes look not good on me.

478
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,450
Why is it not good?

479
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,560
We can cut and use them as sanitary napkins.

480
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,070
I just like it. Excuse me, we take these.

481
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,080
Okay.

482
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,370
Cut into sanitary napkins.

483
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,430
I have a friend

484
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,320
who is working in Ye Shuwei's studio

485
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,000
and sees him every day.

486
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,500
They said that Ye Shuwei has no girlfriend.

487
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,740
I'm wondering how someone

488
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,030
has become Ye Shuwei's girlfriend.

489
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,000
It's none of your business.

490
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,330
Unless you are his invisible girlfriend.

491
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,740
Otherwise, how could the people around him

492
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,200
doesn't know you.

493
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,200
Bei Erduo,

494
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,780
he will go for a class reunion in a few days

495
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,410
and was asked to take a partner there.

496
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,160
But Ye Shuwei said he would go alone.

497
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,930
You must not know that.

498
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,620
Your boyfriend thinks you're not presentable.

499
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,480
What will make it different
to have an original face?

500
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,340
I'm tired of trying the clothes

501
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,320
and I don't want to talk to you.

502
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,790
Erduo,

503
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,260
stop pretending.

504
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,920
Anyone with a discerning eye can see that.

505
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,710
I'm saying this for your own good.

506
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,170
You are Zhang Yilu, right?

507
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,170
Watch your words.

508
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,320
Ye Shuwei is Erduo's boyfriend.

509
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,130
We all know that.

510
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,690
Erduo just said

511
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,310
she will follow Ye Shuwei to a class reunion.

512
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,290
So, we are here to buy new clothes.

513
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:20,800
What?

514
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,100
Do you have any problem with that?

515
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,820
Really?

516
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,290
