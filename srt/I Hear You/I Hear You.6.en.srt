[Episode 6]

3
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,200
What do you think?

4
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,730
You see how thoughtful I am.

5
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,100
Look,

6
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,540
there is a hairband and a hair ribbon.

7
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,710
Does this look like

8
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,890
we share the bathroom?

9
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,530
Please don't put that hairband there.

10
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,420
Also,

11
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,800
would there be two toothpastes

12
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,000
if we share the bathroom?

13
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,510
Right.

14
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,340
Leave this to me.

15
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,700
Why?

16
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,670
No reason.

17
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,280
Take them away. All of them.

18
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,320
Then I did all these for nothing?

19
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,390
Get me some comic books, several hair ropes

20
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,420
and a pack of sanitary napkins.

21
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,160
Sanitary napkins.

22
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,600
Li said the cameramen will be here soon.

23
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,570
They are waiting for us outside now

24
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,900
and want us to go out to meet them first.

25
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,720
Erduo?

26
00:04:59,410 --> 00:04:59,980
Erduo?

27
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,090
You are here so fast.

28
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,730
Erduo, come on, put this on.

29
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,910
Put it on right now.

30
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,210
What are you doing?

31
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,120
To avoid being seen through,

32
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,810
we must stay connected in real time.

33
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,110
If there is any problem,

34
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,380
we can communicate to solve it in time.

35
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,320
I don't need it.

36
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,480
Just put it on for her.

37
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,570
Li, you make us look like secret agents.

38
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,730
Where did you get this?

39
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,850
They're sending "Detective Conan" here.

40
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,860
We certainly have to do "Mission Impossible".

41
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,730
Let me try the volume.

42
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,870
Hello, hello?

43
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,220
You…

44
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,820
Sorry.

45
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,400
Sorry, sorry. Let me turn it down.

46
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,380
Hello? Hello? What about now?

47
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,650
Okay.

48
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
Erduo, we'll be right outside.

49
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,620
If something goes wrong,

50
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,750
don't worry

51
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,380
and just hang in there, okay?

52
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,660
I'll figure it out.

53
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,350
Okay, we're out now. Bye-bye.

54
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,990
Oh, Li just told me

55
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,620
that we must do this naturally,

56
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,220
like we just got up.

57
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,290
Don't move.

58
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,010
Who would wake up wearing earrings?

59
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,180
It's okay now.

60
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,810
Let's go.

61
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,780
They're here. They're here.

62
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,670
Hello, Ye Shuwei and Bei Erduo.

63
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,620
I'm your follow cameraman today.

64
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,340
Sorry for bothering you.

65
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,000
You may call me Conan.

66
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,820
I'm Xiaowu.

67
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,910
They're dressed quiet like that.

68
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,360
Not just in dress,

69
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,100
I was voted by netizens.

70
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,770
I have a keen eye for detail.

71
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,200
We used to be

72
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,180
followers of you two as a couple.

73
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,780
But with your poor acting,

74
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,810
you fooled us in feeling.

75
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,680
So our mission today

76
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,580
is to follow and film you.

77
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,960
We'll use details to prove

78
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,660
if you are a real couple.

79
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,210
What we want to see

80
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,200
is traces of your real life together.

81
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,110
Come on in.

82
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,520
Let's begin now.

83
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,600
I'm not those cameramen

84

filming for the effects of the show.

85
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,900
I have only one principle,

86
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,410
that is to tell the truth, absolute truth.

87
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,650
After all there is only one truth.

88
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,690
No wonder Li said the cameraman is tough.

89
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,750
Don't let them see this through.

90
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,540
Just mind your own part of this.

91
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,720
I'm crowned as "logic emperor" in the group.

92
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,600
Nothing could escape from my eyes.

93
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,650

96
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,980

97
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,810
Dear friends and netizens,

98
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,360
we are now in their house.

99
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,050
They are sitting on the sofa.

100
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,280
But they have no interaction at all.

101
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,920
Would a real couple be like this?

102
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:00,860
Would they?

103
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,420
Would they?

104
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,740
If you keep talking like this,

105
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,400
we won't have a chance to talk.

106
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,680
There must be something wrong
with the cameraman.

107
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,680
He was selected by netizens.

108
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Would they be seen through?

109
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,340
Don't worry.

110
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,690
It's not the first time for them.

111
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,700
You don't need to feel nervous.

112
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,450
We'll be everywhere.

113

You may take us nonexistent.

114
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,080
And you just do what you usually do.

115

Are you hungry?

116
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,200
Do you want me to cook something?

117
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,970
What do you want to eat?

118
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,430
I'll eat whatever you make.

119
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,360
Okay then.

Yes.

What else do you need?

131
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,440
I can…

132
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,700
Would you get me a potato?

133
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,470
And then stir the eggs

It's usually made with more flour.

166
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,950

What you make is surely full of love.

176
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,890
Really,

177
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,040
there are surprises every day with you.

178
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,290
Shuwei is just like this.

179
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,960
I like to think imaginatively

180
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,030
and make a lot of weird things.

181
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,110
But he would eat them

182
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,640
and say they're delicious.

183
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,980
So sometimes I don't know

184
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,420
if it's really good.

185
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,610
Do you want to have a taste?

186
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,660
Yeah, yeah.

187
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,350
Come on.

188
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,590
You've showed your love enough.

189
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,540
I'm full.

190
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,640
Remember to clean up the kitchen.

191
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,510
I cooked the breakfast.

192
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,060
Why is it me to do the cleaning?

193
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,690
You helped me make breakfast yesterday,

194
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,770
but I washed the dishes.

195
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,290
Didn't we agree to take turns doing this?

196
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,380
Come on.

197
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,330
I'll wash.

198
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,170
Let's go on when Bei Erduo's done cleaning.

199
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,790
Let's take a look around.

200
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,580
They are really good at

201
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,120
turning ill luck into good.

202
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,350
Don't be too optimistic.

203
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,540
What's the matter?

204
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,440
That Conan claimed

205
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,500
he would surely expose them publicly

206
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,430
and prove they are a fake couple.

207
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,010
He wouldn't give up so easily.

208
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,630
How do you know that?

209
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,450
I secretly joined their anti-fan group.

210
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,210
Whether we'll get through this lies in today.

211
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,710
I really don't want to see them

212
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,360
making any troubles.

213
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,170
I don't believe

214
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,640
so many of us can't handle him alone.

215
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,720
[Ye Shuwei]
When will that guy finish this?

216
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,100
Get him out of my house now.

217
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,390
I can't promise that I'll keep doing this.

218
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,940
Guru Ye has lost his patience

219
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,310
and may refuse to cooperate.

220
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,660
No, I have to make a big move for them

221
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,140
to finish this quickly.

222
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,210
Li,

223
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,300
it's all on you now.

224
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,430
Big move.

225
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:42,890
Come on.

226
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,050
Go now.

227
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,150
Excuse me,

228
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,920
is this Ms. Bei Erduo's room?

229
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,200
Yes, that's her room.

230
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,960
You two are a couple.

231
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,220
Is it because the villa is so big that

232
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,630
you sleep in separate rooms?

233
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,000
This is her study room.

234
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,180
Sometimes she needs a quiet place

235
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,460
for recording.

236
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,500
Just like I don't like to be disturbed

237
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,790
when I'm reading.

238
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,300
So, we have our separate rooms.

239
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,770
What about the bed?

240
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,890
Tell them your habit.

241
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,090
Don't be shy.

242
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,580
Just tell them.

243
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,300
My habit is that

244
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,780
I like…

245
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,050
I like to read lying down,

246
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,650
record lying down

247
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,920
and study lying down.

248
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,770
So, there is a big bed in my room.

249
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,220
That's it.

250
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,730
Are you always

251
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,220
dressed up so formally at home?

252
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,460
Our dress?

253
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,820
We are dressed so formally

254
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,240
just because you are here.

255
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
We usually wear home clothes.

256
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,430
Yeah?

257
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,440
Then go change.

258
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,970
We may just take a look at your room.

259
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,180
Our bedroom is right behind you.

260
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,670
Are you going to watch us change clothes?

261
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,730
You go change

262
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,170
and we will be waiting right here.

263
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,670
Be quiet.

264
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,270
What are you doing here?

265
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,070
How did you get up here?

266
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,400
Of course I'm here to help you.

267
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,250
Don't ask too much.

268
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,160
I've arranged it for you.

269
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,950
Go change your clothes.

270
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,810
Hurry.

271
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,990
Come on.

272
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,850
How could my pajamas be here?

273
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,720
My pajamas are certainly in my room.

274
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,200
Not here? Then…

275
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,260
This is okay.

276
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,120
It's okay. Go and put this on.

277
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,490
Come on.

278
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,700
Where do I change?

279
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,160
You…

280
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,000
We can't just look at things superficially.

281
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,850
Without watching them sleep together,

282
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,500
who can be sure about their relationship?

283
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,750
Master,
are we really gonna film them sleeping?

284
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,680
Are you fool?

285
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,100
Are you ready or not?

286
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,600
Bei Erduo, don't you have a pajama?

287
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,100
I… That's how I'm usually dressed.

288
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,610
I feel comfortable to wear this.

289
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,440
And…

290
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,450
And haven't you heard that

291
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,520
man's shirt is

292
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,140
the best pajama for girls?

293
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,930
Haven't you heard of that before?

294
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,640
Xiaowu.

295
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,800
Okay.

296
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,050
Have you seen enough?

297
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:20,590
Let's go.

298
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,240
Now we believe that

299
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,490
you are really a couple.

300
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,510
That's all for today's livestreaming.

301
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,300
Xiaowu, let's call it a day.

302
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,060
This way. This way.

303
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,090
This way, please.

304
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,660
The door. The door is here.

305
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,640
This way. This way.

306
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,500
They are finally leaving.

307
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:06,680
Please…

308
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,230
Erduo.

309
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,150
Le Tian,

310
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,440
why are you here?

311
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:15,970
I'm here to check on you.

312
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,460
Xiaowu, hurry.

313
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,000
Take out the camera.

314
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,860
Master, you said we won't film them sleeping.

315
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,190
Hurry up. Cut the crap.

316
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,800
Erduo, are you okay?

317
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,750
Why do they film you sleeping?

318
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,500
No, no.

319
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,340
Le Tian, it's not what you think.

320
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,820
They are about to leave.

321
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,200
What is that guy doing here?

322
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,740
Who is he?

323
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,790
I'll go drive him away.

324
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,080
You can't go.

325
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,960
If you appear on the image,

326
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,750
netizens would definitely recognize you

327
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,610
and would know this.

328
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,520
But what should we do now?

329
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,700
Let's trust the luck.

330
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,750
Close the door.

331
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,190
No. Le Tian,

332
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,880
it's not what you think.

333
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,280
Who is he?

334
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,900
He cares so much about you.

335
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,530
He is your real boyfriend, isn't he?

336
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,090
No, no.

337
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,600
Absolutely no.

338
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,470
He is one of my students.

339
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,040
Really. He is only a student of mine.

340
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,820
Because today…

341
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,360
Because…

342
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,880
Because

343
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,590
we have a video lesson today.

344
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:24,970
Yes.

345
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,440
I should give him a video lesson.

346
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,420
But I don't have time.

347
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,460
Is that true?

348
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,630
Since it's a video lesson,

349
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,200
why is he coming here?

350
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,180
You must be lying.

351
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,600
I heard that Erduo is sick.

352
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,500
So, I'm here to see her
on behalf of our classmates.

353
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,380
Are you sick?

354
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,080
Yes, I am.

355
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,210
Are you all right?

356
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,140
Weather is changing.

357
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,100
Erduo,

358
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,240
why didn't you tell me

359
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,010
that your classmate would come.

360
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,170
I could have prepared.

361
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,290
Le Tian, I'm busy today.

362
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,290
You may go back first.

363
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:15,900
It's okay.

364
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,030
Since he's here on behalf of your classmates,

365
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,780
we should let him in to sit for a while.

366
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,200
Change your shoes.

367
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:41,500
Come on,

368
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,750
put this on.

369
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:59,380
Have some water.

370
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,610
Drink more water since you're having a cold.

371
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,750
Bei Erduo, why do you have

372
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,770
a student of such age?

373
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,470
We are classmates at a Japanese school.

374
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,190
She speaks Japanese very well.

375
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,910
So, I study with her.

376
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,130
She is very popular at our school.

377
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,180
You are the best.

378
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,040
Therefore, I think only a kind

379
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,980
and upright man deserves her love.

380
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,630
You mean

381
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,960
Ye Shuwei is not good enough

382
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,490
for Bei Erduo.

383
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,230
Do you mean that?

384
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,770
Of course.

385
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,240
Yu Sheng, let's run away.

386
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,780
Le Tian, have some water.

387
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,080
Have some water.

388
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,700
Okay.

389
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,120
So, Ye Shuwei and Bei Erduo

390
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,480
are not really a couple.

391
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,680
They pretend this just for the show.

392
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:20,670
Right?

393
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,350
I… I don't know.

394
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:28,980
You've crossed the line.

395
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,420
Enough is enough.

396
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,760
Fake can't be true and truth can't be faked.

397
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,750
Does he really take himself as her boyfriend?

398
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,780
What did you say? Who are you talking about?

399
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,600
Sorry, sorry.

400
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,540
I'm reading entertainment news.

401
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,630
Some actors think of themselves as boyfriends

402
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,340
after attending some love show.

403
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,240
I was so excited that I forgot you're filming.

404
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,990
There is water on your mouth.

405
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,040
Erduo, I know

406
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,900
your classmate must be angry with me

407
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,210
for taking so much of your time

408
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,560
that you have little time
to give them lessons.

409
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,820
Right?

410
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,420
Yeah. Le Tian,

411
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,820
don't blame Ye… Don't blame Shuwei.

412
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,450
He just has a strong desire to protect me.

413
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,220
He doesn't want me to be so tired.

414
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,040
And I will reschedule my time.

415
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,880
You can rest assured.

416
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,850
All right then. You have some rest.

417
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,740
Thank you for your hospitality.

418
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,720
We're leaving, too.

419
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,720
Call it a day.

420
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,000
Let me walk you out.

421
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,280
This way. This way.

422
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,720
I admit that

423
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,500
we've been making thigs difficult for you.

424
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,340
Now, we've become your followers.

425
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,460
Be happy.

426
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,170
Call it a day.

427
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,290
I really need a good sleep tonight.

428
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,300
My energy is running out.

[Mom]

430
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,900
Son, have you had your breakfast?

431
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,470
Your father and I just packed our bags

432
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,850
and we're on our way to the airport.

433
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,880
To be honest,

434
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,050
Xiamen is really nice.

435
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:53,980
Next time…

436
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,560
Shuwei, that girl…

437
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,320
When will you arrive?

438
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,460
I can go pick you up.

439
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,240
Never mind.

440
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,070
Your father called the driver to pick us up.

441
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,820
Son, when did you make…

442
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,450
Mom, I'm going to the studio.

443
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,780
I'll call you back later.

444
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,390
Wait…

445
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,930
Hello, this is for Ye Shuwei.

446
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,310
Thank you.

447
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,100
Wait a second.

448
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,780
This one is for Bei Erduo.

449
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,520
Is this the address?

450
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,020
Give it to me.

451
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,440
Okay.

452
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,770
Sorry,

453
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,540
is this too loud?

454
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,170
It won't happen next time.

455
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:24,720
It's okay.

456
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,820
This is for you.

457
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,320
Thank you.

That's all for today. Thank you, everyone.

461
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,620
Thank you, teacher.

462
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,840
Bei Erduo,

463
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,150
your interactions with your boyfriend

464
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,940
are really funny.

465
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,730
Is your boyfriend good at cooking?

466
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,780
Do you feel awkward in front of the camera?

467
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,080
Your boyfriend's house is so big.

468
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,260
Go, go, go. Haven't you seen a celebrity?

469
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,430
Ms. Bei, I need your help for a question.

470
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,130
You are good at this.

471
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,840
Ms. Bei, if it goes on like this,

472
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,580
will you enter the entertainment circle?

473
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,150
Or I should say

474
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,030
you've stepped into the entertainment
circle with one foot.

475
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,540
Do you think it's that easy?

476
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,300
I'm not stepping into it with one foot.

477
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,720
At most,

478
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,340
I entered it to take a breath of the air

479
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,510
and then came out.

480
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,770
I don't want to become a celebrity.

481
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,150
You're right. It's tiring to go in and out.

482
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,190
Didn't you read my message?

483
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,060

on the show,

502
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,120
I was shocked.

503
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,160
He is such a boring person.

00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,710
Have some water.

518
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,280
I can start.

519
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,070
From the current situation,

520
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,060
they seem to have more tacit understandings.

521
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,340
But why do I always

522
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,980
feel something wrong?

523
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,260
Isn't it good to have tacit understandings?

524
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,480
Am I dazzled?

525
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,540
I just feel

526
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,340
I could see pink bubbles

527
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,480
around them.

528
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,880
You really helped me today.

529
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,720
Thank you very much.

530
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,230
In particular,

531
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,030
your voice is really nice.

532
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,460
And you got the right feeling.

533
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,620
I'm sure

534
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,110
the promotional video will be approved.

535
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,500
Ye Shuwei,

536
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,720
bring your girlfriend over when you're free.

537
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,190
I hope we'll have an opportunity
to work together.

538
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,510
I'm also happy to have your recognition.

539
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,820
Let's go.

540
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,550
Okay, see you.

541
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,870
Thank you.

542
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:33,840
Okay, see you.

543
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,000
What did you say?

544
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,640
You said you could see

545
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,700
pink bubbles around them?

546
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,230
Really. I…

547
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,560
You do want them to become a true couple.

548
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,280
That's a big thing for Erduo's life.

549
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,720
It's really good.

550
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,650
