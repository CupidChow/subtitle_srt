[I Hear You]

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,460
[Episode 7]

3
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,100
You know what?

4
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,310
It's actually the first time I've come

5
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,210
to such a professional dubbing studio.

6
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,170
Oh yeah?

7
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,070
From your point of view, is there anything

8
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,610
I should pay attention to in the future?

9
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,520
- Rhythm.
- Rhythm.

10
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,640
I agree that rhythm is my weakness.

11
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,140
Perhaps I still lack experience.

12
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,140
Practice more.

13
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,860
It's easy for you to say.

14
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,250
Why don't you give it a try?

15
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,970
Do I need to know how refrigerator works

16
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,830
to make a comment on it?

17
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,060
You think you wouldn't do it?

18
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,680
Are we going home?

19
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,890
Dinner first.

20
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,670
Great! I'm so hungry!

21
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,970
What a fancy dinner!

22
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,810
I'll eat now.

23
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,720
So delicious!

24
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,730
It tastes very good when you eat it this way.

25
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,190
Do you wanna try?

26
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,140
The best way to eat it

27
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,220
is based on experience.

28
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,540
It allows you to taste the best flavor

29
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,420
of every dish.

30
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,920
But innovation is also important.

31
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,940
Otherwise, there wouldn't be any

32
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,920
private home cuisine or new dishes.

33
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,530
I like it this way. That's all it matters.

34
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,360
How I eat it is up to me.

35
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,240
Mr. Ye, I think

36
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,090
you focus on procedures and rules too much,

37
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,530
with whatever you do.

38
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,530
That'll take a lot of fun out of your life.

39
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:08,660
Not really.

40
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,980
I think it's not bad.

41
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,890
Everything should be done in a certain way.

42
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,970
Ordinary players would choose
the standard configuration,

43
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,140
while advanced players the customized.

44
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,230
Seriously. Try it.

45
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,730
Let me make one for you.

46
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,700
No need, Bei Erduo.

47
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,750
Claret is not as tasty as normal red wine.

48
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,880
It's too bitter.

49
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,070
Ye Shuwei, what made you
become a violin maker?

50
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,060
What made you become a voice actress?

51
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,600
I like it.

52
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,130
And I'm good at it.

53
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,740
Your answer is quite straightforward.

54
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,460
Who encouraged you to do it?

55
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,080
My dad.

56
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,750
When I was a kid, I loved

57
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,880
mimicking the voice
of the characters in cartoon.

58
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,710
My dad said I had a gift.

59
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,570
So the next day, I performed

60
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,070
in front of my classmates,

61
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,980
and they all enjoyed it very much.

62
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,620
And because of that,

63
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,420
I became very popular in my class.

64
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,230
That's it?

65
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,640
I like it because I'm good at it.

66
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,080
After I graduated from college,

67
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,200
I wanted to do something I like

68
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,620
and I can do well,

69
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,620
so dubbing was an inevitable choice.

70
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,020
Then I started looking for jobs.

71
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,590
I kept learning and saving money.

72
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,650
I found a school that'll send its students

73
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,300
to Japan next year for dubbing courses.

74
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,930
I want to go there to learn

75
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,430
and improve my skills,

76
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,220
so that I can be more professional.

77
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,870
It's acceptable.

78
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,910
Check, please.

79
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,780
Sir, that'll be 876 yuan.

80
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,630
Here's my card.

81
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,220
Alright.

82
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:44,980
Thanks.

83
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,120
I'll transfer you the money later.

84
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,220
Never mind.

85
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,350
You did my friend a favor today.

86
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,360
But the dinner is very pricy.

87
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,450
I didn't expect the place to be so neat.

88
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,010
It is quite clean.

89
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,720
Yeah.

90
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,190
Erduo.

91
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,790
Hi, I'm Ye Shuwei's father.

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,170
Nice to meet you.

93
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,260
Uncle Ye, nice to meet you.

94
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,320
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

95
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,500
I'm Shuwei's mother.

96
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:22,930
Auntie, nice to meet you.

97
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,840
Bei Erduo,

98
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:26,870
your…

99
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,450
Father. Mother.

100
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,740
I thought your flight was in the afternoon.

101
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,420
Why didn't you go home and rest?

102
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,630
We just got here.

103
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,560
Your mom wanted to bring you
the local specialty.

104
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,340
Red wine is Xiamen's specialty?

105
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,330
Let's sit down.

106
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,690
Well…

107
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,910
Your clothes dropped on the floor.

108
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,140
Well,

109
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,250
Uncle and Auntie, please excuse me
for a moment.

110
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,160
My laundry fell on the floor.

111
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,080
I'll go hang it back up.

112
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,860
Sure. Go ahead.

113
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,440
Sorry.

114
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,240
Go ahead.

115
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,380
Come here, son.

116
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,380
I'll go get you some water.

117
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,280
Son, this place hasn't changed at all.

118
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,440
Aren't you getting tired of it?

119
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,480
No.

120
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,200
Your dad just hired

121
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,760
a new interior designer,

122
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,060
and our house is being remodeled

123
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,220
according to his design.

124
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,030
Alright. Then you can stay there with me.

125
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,860
I'll get the room ready for you.

126
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,480
Tomorrow we'll go to the suburb
and visit Mr. Su.

127
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,020
We won't disturb you.

128
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,540
Uncle and Auntie,

129
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,060
it must have been a while
since you last saw Shuwei.

130
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,330
I'll let you guys catch up.

131
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,780
I'll go to my room to rest.

132
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,670
Erduo, it's okay.
Please sit down and join us.

133
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,250
We rarely come here.

134
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,610
Yeah.

135
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,750
We haven't spoken to kids for a long time.

136
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,170
We have no idea

137
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,190
what kids are into nowadays.

138
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,790
Come on, take a seat.

139
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,390
Shuwei, say something.

140
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,100
Please have a seat.

141
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,800
Alright.

142
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,790
Honestly, I haven't been called a kid

143
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,400
for 10 years at least.

144
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,330
Based on the latest age-judging criteria,

145
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,900
young people in their 20s

146
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,670
are considered minors.

147
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,160
But based on the latest net survey,

148
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,310
in the eyes of the post-millennials,
anyone who's above 20

149
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,980
is considered mid-aged.

150
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,340
You still look young.

151
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,640
Based on the latest international
age-judging criteria,

152
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,170
people in their 60s
are considered late mid-aged.

153
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,550
It's not old age yet.

154
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,330
Then what about the 80-year-olds?

155
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,540
The 80-year-olds

156
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,360
are definitely the elderly.

157
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,350
What's wrong?

158
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,530
In that case,

159
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,220
according to the latest international
age-judging criteria,

160
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,570
you are elderly now,

161
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,670
and I'm still mid-aged.

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,680
You…

163
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,500
You are 80 years old?

164
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,210
To be exact,

165
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,980
I just had my 86th birthday.

166
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,560
Erduo, my father is 36 years older
than my mother.

167
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,000
It's rare.

168
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,370
My son takes after me.

169
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,900
He's also sharp-tongued.

170
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,210
Erduo, just ignore him.

171
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,610
Uncle Ye.

172
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,100
In the future, I'll eat whatever you eat,

173
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,570
drink whatever you drink,

174
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,090
and do whatever you do.

175
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,210
From now on, you'll be my master.

176
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,460
I want to learn the regimen from you

177
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,350
and live as an immortal like you.

178
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,460
Okay.

179
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,830
Erduo, may I take a look at your room?

180
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,680
Sure.

181
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,210
Let's go.

182
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,670
We'll be upstairs.

183
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,260
Okay.

184
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,450
Father,

185
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,380
What kind of… What kind of red wine is it?

186
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,580
What's the clicking rate?

187
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,880
The clicking rate of this week

188
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,970
is increased by 20% compared to the last.

189
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,530
What's the total clicking rateup till now?

190
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,920
It's more than 30 million times now.

191
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,140
That's quite impressive.

192
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,120
I don't think any other peer programs

193
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,200
can beat us.

194
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,610
At this rate,

195
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,080
we'll be the winner of this quarter for sure.

196
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,900
I'm not as positive.

197
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,360
Do you know how many people

198
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,950
want to fight for the top spot of this quarter?

199
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,610
By the way, there's a program
catching up with us.

200
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,380
They've got about 20 million hits, right?

201
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,370
That's right.

202
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,870
What are you afraid of?

203
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,940
When the two of us join hands,

204
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,670
nothing can defeat us, right?

205
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,760
I heard the potted plants are hard to tend.

206
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,840
They require a lot of attention and care.

207
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,160
It's not an easy job

208
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,720
to make them thrive like this.

209
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,490
So pretty. And this one.

210
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,980
It's not that hard actually.

211
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,030
You just need to keep the soil aerated

212
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,840
and water them regularly.

213
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,720
So nice.

214
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,850
You made it yourself?

215
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,940
How artistic!

216
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,160
The succulent jewelry is well made.

217
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,990
I like it a lot.

218
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,490
Auntie, if you like it,

219
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,500
you can have it.

220
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,630
You are such a talented girl,

221
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,910
and so good with your hands.

222
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,850
Are you sure you wanna give it to me?

223
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,870
Of course.

224
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,810
Let me put it on for you.

225
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,840
Okay. Here.

226
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,310
Done.

227
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,200
Let me see.

228
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,050
So exquisite!

229
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,740
Thank you, Erduo.

230
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,120
I love it.

231
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,700
I only made it for fun.

232
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,170
No big deal.

233
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,070
Zhao, is there anything new

234
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,740
about that Erduo and Ye Shuwei?

235
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,620
A netizen just posted something on Weibo.

236
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,470
Right here.

237
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,660
He caught Ye Shuwei driving a luxury car

238
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,340
to pick up Erduo from her Japanese class.

239
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,490
This post has been reposted
more than 8,000 times.

240
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,570
And there are more than 10,000 comments.

241
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
They all say that Ye Shuwei always

242
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,550
keeps a low profile,

243
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,660
but turns out he's rich and handsome.

244
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,660
On our website,

245
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,790
Ye Shuwei's popularity is on par
with Bei Erduo's.

246
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,630
This girl is indeed material.

247
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,980
Guru Ye has so much talent,

248
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,570
but it's never been noticed.

249
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,500
Yet he became legendary as soon
as his luxury car appeared.

250
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,580
I think the luxury car
is only part of the reason.

251
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,480
The fact that Ye Shuwei went
to pick up Bei Erduo

252
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,230
is quite sweet.

253
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,750
He's tall, handsome, and caring.

254
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,170
Of course the girls would go crazy about him.

255
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,320
The stats come first.

256
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,930
Erduo, you are a pleasant girl.

257
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,290
Your personality completes Shuwei's.

258
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,080
He looks serious, reserved,

259
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,140
and sticks to his own rules.

260
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,430
He's nothing like me
and his father on that point.

261
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,120
We'll count on you

262
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,940
to make him break his rules.

263
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,240
Since he's in the art field,

264
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,260
he can't be too rigid,

265
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,180
right?

266
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,480
Yes.

267
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,540
He can be dull sometimes.

268
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,310
Don't always stay at home

269
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,460
when you aren't busy with work.

270
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,630
Try to go out more.

271
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,050
I know, dad. I go out a lot.

272
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,760
Does he chat with you often?

273
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,700
Yes, he does.

274
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,850
Sometimes he'd even give me advice.

275
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,540
Although his words may sound stodgy,
they are quite helpful.

276
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,160
You are such a sweet kid.

277
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,640
Zhao, please keep an eye on the reviews,

278
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,610
in case someone makes
personal attack against our guests.

279
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,510
Let us know if anything happens.

280
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,950
Yeah. My phone is on 24/7.

281
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,200
You can reach me at any time.

282
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,740
Alright.

283
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,810
Personal attack?

284
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,730
I'm not sure if this counts.

285
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,010
This is the IP address.

286
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,050
It keeps sending messages
to our program and Bei Erduo.

287
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,940
It has been

288
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,130
going on for days.

289
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,140
And the comments
towards Bei Erduo are very harsh.

290
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,950
We've been deleting her comments,

291
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,080
but they'd show up again soon after.

292
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,590
It feels like a tug of war now.

293
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,940
Besides, the user of this IP address

294
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,010
has been confessing her love to Ye Shuwei.

295
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,840
It's so weird. It..

296
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,620
It sounds like she sees Ye Shuwei
as her boyfriend.

297
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,380
I have to give Erduo a call

298
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,060
and warn her.

299
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,750
Wait. Not so fast.

300
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,060
I think it's just a clicktivist

301
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,620
who vents her anger through Internet.

302
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,220
It's not that simple.

303
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,780
If she really sees Ye Shuwei

304
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,020
as her boyfriend,

305
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,250
Erduo may highly likely become

306
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,160
her target in real life.

307
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,970
Such crazy fans do exist.

308
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,670
Auntie, excuse me for a sec.

309
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,040
Sure. Go ahead.

310
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,500
Sorry.

311
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,150
Never mind.

312
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:03,920
Hello? Li.

313
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,480
What's up?

314
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,650
Hello? Erduo.

315
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,410
Have you checked Weibo?

316
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,740
I haven't.

317
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,100
Here's the thing.

318
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,300
Someone saw Ye Shuwei pick you up

319
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,530
and took a picture of it.

320
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,200
Ye Shuwei's popularity is increasing now.

321
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,970
You need to work with him

322
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,540
and don't drag him down. Got it?

323
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,410
I drag Ye Shuwei down?

324
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,560
I may trip him, though.

325
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,560
Why… Why are you speaking quietly?

326
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,350
Are you home?

327
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,340
I am. But…

328
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,300
But Ye Shuwei's parents are visiting.

329
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,820
I was chatting with his mom.

330
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,490
Your mother-in-law!

331
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,260
You are already working
on your ties with the in-laws!

332
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,480
Good for you!

333
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,650
Erduo, let's get back to business.

334
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,580
Have you received anything

335
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,500
strange lately?

336
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,820
Sorry, I have to go now.

337
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,500
Hello? Erduo?

338
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,360
It's…

339
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,030
It's one of my good friends.

340
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,060
She's very nice.

341
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,610
But she likes to run her mouth.

342
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,540
It's okay. Come here.

343
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,320
Erduo, come here.

344
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:20,940
Don't worry about it.

345
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,480
Young people nowadays are all adorable.

346
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,200
Adorable.

347
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,630
What's with Erduo?

348
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,350
Ye Shuwei's parents are visiting.

349
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,400
Erduo is nervously chatting
with her mother-in-law right now.

350
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,860
Grandma.

351
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,420
Grandma? What do you mean?

352
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,010
I mean mother-in-law.

353
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,890
What are you excited about?

354
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,210
I… I just…

355
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,120
I just think their relationship

356
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,890
is developing too fast. Don't you think?

357
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,580
Right?

358
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,620
Zhao, anyway, please keep a close eye on it.

359
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,400
I'm leaving.

360
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,290
I'll be waiting for you outside.

361
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:52,850
You…

362
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,780
Thank you, Zhao.

363
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,940
Call me if you need any help.

364
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,690
Okay.

365
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,240
Bye-bye.

366
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,360
Your place hasn't changed a bit.

367
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,660
Aren't you tired of it?

368
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,330
Don't you feel bored?

369
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,160
Nope.

370
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,360
I think it's nice to keep things simple.

371
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,070
A new environment will brighten up your mood.

372
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,600
It's pretty.

373
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,880
So? Isn't it nice?

374
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,650
It is.

375
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,050
Erduo made this herself.

376
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,910
She's so good with her hands.

377
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,180
I like it very much.

378
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,570
She's as skillful as you are.

379
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,220
Look at you.

380
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,020
It's about Erduo, not me.

381
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,220
Stop it.

382
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,060
Uncle and Auntie, you are so sweet.

383
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,780
Sorry, Erduo,

384
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,890
We made a fool of ourselves.

385
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,150
If Shuwei doesn't treat you
well in the future,

386
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,330
just let me know.

387
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,120
He…

388
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,120
He does treat me well, very well.

389
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,480
That's good.

390
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,280
Alright.

391
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:05,890
It's getting late.

392
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,020
We should go back now.

393
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,370
Let them rest early.

394
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:09,710
Okay.

395
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,360
Hold on.

396
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,020
After my house renovation is finished,

397
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,250
please go visit us.

398
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,260
Shuwei,

399
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,080
remember to bring Erduo over.

400
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,090
I will.

401
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:20,870
Okay.

402
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,300
I'll walk you out.

403
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,160
Then we are leaving.

404
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,790
Purse. My Purse.

405
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,780
Oh, right.

406
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
Uncle and Auntie, this way.

407
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,410
- This way.
- Okay.

408
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,780
Be good.

409
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,000
We are here.

410
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,820
Then I'm going in.

411
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:51,930
Wait.

412
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,540
For you.

413
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,660
What is it?

414
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,890
Open it.

415
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,700
Why… Why do you give me this?

416
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,960
You've been working hard.

417
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,720
I'm worried that you don't sleep well.

418
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,970
This can help you sleep better.

419
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,900
If you are burnt out,

420
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,660
what am I gonna do
with the program next week?

421
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,240
You are such a good boss.

422
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,670
Then I'm going.

423
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,050
Drive home safely.

424
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,670
Bye-bye.

425
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,700
Ye Shuwei.

426
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,040
Ye Shuwei?

427
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,780
Are you in there?

428
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,710
Are you okay?

429
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,090
You don't feel well?

430
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,800
I'm coming in.

431
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,190
Here I come.

432
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,830
What's wrong?

433
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,140
You are having a fever!

434
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,700
How did it happen?

435
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,370
Come on. Let's go to the hospital.

436
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,250
I'll call a cab.

437
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,070
No. I just need some sleep.

438
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,250
How's that gonna help?

439
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,480
What if it gets worse?

440
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,450
You are burning up.

441
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,820
Let's go.

442
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,040
Alright. We won't go to the hospital.

443
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,780
How about lying down in your room then?

444
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,900
Can you stand up yourself?

445
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,290
Here. Put your arm around my shoulder.

446
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,270
I'll help you up. Come on.

447
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,320
Hang in there.

448
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,960
Just hang in there.

449
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,730
Then we can go to bed.

450
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,030
I mean, hang in there,

451
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,960
and then I can put you on your bed.

452
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,760
What is it?

453
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,600
It's water mixed with salt and sugar.

454
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,390
You are sick. In case of dehydration,

455
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,830
you need sugar and salt in your body.

456
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,010
It's cold.

457
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,220
Cold?

458
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,750
Miss Bei Erduo,

459
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,460
as the audiobook you recorded made it

460
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,180
to the recommended section repeatedly,

461
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,460
it has been heard more than 200,000 times.

462
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,990
We'd like to invite you to participate
in our Internet Celebrity Festival…

463
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,750
Ye Shuwei.

464
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,350
What's this?

465
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,370
It's plain congee.

466
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,030
You are sick.

467
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,730
You threw up your dinner from last night

468
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,610
and you didn't eat anything today.

469
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,080
Your stomach is empty.

470
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,840
So you can only eat some congee for now.

471
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,560
I don't have any appetite.

472
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Still, you got to eat something.

473
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,710
Your stomach is empty.

474
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,780
You need to regain your strength.

475
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,420
No.

476
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,180
Be good.

477
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,180
Eat it.

478
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,670
Don't throw a tantrum

479
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,250
like a kid.

480
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,360
Come on.

481
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,550
What's this?

482
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,940
Pickles. I preserved them myself.

483
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,010
How is it?

484
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:38,850
Don't get up.

485
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,160
I ordered medicine for you.

486
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,850
I'll feed you the congee later.

487
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,020
I'll go get the medicine first.

488
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,040
Look, our workaholic boss

489
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,220
always comes to work on time.

490
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,970
And now he's too sick to come.

491
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,320
Do you think he's coming down
with something serious?

492
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,930
Didn't he say he was fine on the phone?

493
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,960
As long as it doesn't

494
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,630
affect the upcoming violin performance.

495
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,790
Don't worry.

496
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,570
Makes sense.

497
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,400
What are you doing?

498
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,810
I'm going to the studio.

499
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,740
You are still sick.

500
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,010
I feel fine now.

501
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,320
Do you think you are a robot

502
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,290
that can be restarted with a reset button?

503
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,290
I'm really fine.

504
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,790
Be good.

505
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,880
Come here and sit down.

506
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,040
It's 39 degrees.

507
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,540
You are still having a fever.
See for yourself.

508
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,380
Fine.

509
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,020
I don't have to go.

510
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,240
But I have nothing to do

511
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,170
lying in bed all day.

512
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,960
You are feeling bored, aren't you?

513
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,870
Then let's watch something with me.

514
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,900
The series I follow just released
a new episode today.

515
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,550
Do you want to watch it?

516
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,840
This episode.

517
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,940
You watch it, too?

518
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,910
You woke up?

519
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,000
Do you feel better?

520
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,850
I just cooked dinner.
Would you like to have some?

521
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,230
Yeah.

522
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,940
Here.

523
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,570
Have some congee first.

524
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,160
Thanks.

525
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,110
I think you must've eaten something
that didn't agree with you.

526
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,020
It's a fever caused by acute gastroenteritis.

527
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,200
But it doesn't make any sense.

528
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,170
We ate together yesterday

529
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,790
and we had the same food.

530
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,240
How come nothing happened to me?

531
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,050
You have a powerful digestive system

532
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,930
that's probably immune to food poison.

533
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,220
You are

534
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,140
such an ingrate who bites

535
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,580
the hand that feeds you.

536
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,480
The sharp tongue is back
as soon as you got a little better.

537
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,480
I bought it long time ago
and I've never used it.

538
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,460
Ring it if you need anything, okay?

539
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,350
I'll put it here.

540
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,210
Sleep well.

541
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,710
How is it, work maniac?

542
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,900
Is everything okay with the preparation
of the program next week?

543
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,620
Not bad.

544
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,030
Everything's under control at the moment.

545
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,830
Pass me a packet of sugar.

546
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,360
I thought you didn't like sugar.

547
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,590
I'm in a good mood today.

548
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,010
Boss Yu.

549
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,470
Li, are you working overtime?

550
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,620
Don't work too hard.

551
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,730
You are also here, aren't you?

552
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,180
Here comes another work maniac.

553
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,050
Li, your necklace is so special.

554
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,870
You've got good taste.

555
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,720
So do you.

556
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,000
It's the birthday gift I gave Tang Li.

557
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,420
Really?

558
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,880
Boss Yu, you have an eye for beauty.

559
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,500
Xing Zhen, our company
has exceptional benefits,

560
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,970
and Boss Yu is a generous person.

561
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:52,980
If you work hard,

562
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,610
I'm sure Boss Yu will give you

563
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,850
something better in the future.

564
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,320
Right, Boss Yu?

565
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,550
Is that true, Boss Yu?

566
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,210
Yes.

567
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,600
I'll go back to work.

568
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,060
Boss Yu, will I get a gift from you
on my birthday?

569
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,750
Sure. Sure.

570
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,210
That's all for today.

571
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,240
Goodnight.

572
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,120
Congratulations on
the 100th week of the grogram!

573
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,820
I fall asleep every night hearing your voice.

574
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,080
I'm not saying that your voice
makes me sleepy.

575
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,870
It's just that it has become
a routine of my daily life.

576
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,620
Sometimes, I feel so confused.

577
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,100
I wish I could keep such a voice to myself,

578
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,590
but at the same time, I wish
for more people to hear your works.

579
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,350
It was hard to be a lone supporter,

580
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,310
so I pulled in quite a few fans for you.

581
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,460
No matter what,

582
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,160
I hope your voice can bring comfort
to many more people.

583
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,050
Thank you for your good wishes.

584
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,100
I'll do my best.

585
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,060
Hope you can hear my voice

586
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,240
in other works in the future

587
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,440
other than here.

588
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,960
And I hope you can recognize my voice then.

589
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,960
Miss Bei Erduo,

590
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,070
as the audiobook you recorded made it

591
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,470
to the recommended section repeatedly,

592
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,710
it has been heard more than 200,000 times.

593
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,780
We'd like to invite you to participate
in Internet Celebrity Festival.

594
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,030
You'll have the opportunity
to meet more like-minded friends.

595
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,910
It'll be a great honor to have you

596
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,390
join us.

597
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,180

Thank you for your invitation.

599

I'll be there on time.
