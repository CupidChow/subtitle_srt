[JASON Art Director ZHANG XIAOSONG Chief Director ALLEN Music Director]
I'm the director of this film.

4
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,740
On my left is Allen, the Music Director.

5
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,570
Let's have some communication, huh?

6
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,410
Man, shall we start with you?

7
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,230
Hello, director. Hello, mentors.

8
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,910
I'm Lu Senhang.

9
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,390
I'm honored to come here.

10
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,920
I'll try my best to perform.

11
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,490
Thank you.

12
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,200
Hello, mentors.

13
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,760
I'm Bei Erduo.

14
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,440
I'm a growing dubber.

15
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,410
I dream to become an excellent voice actress

16
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,330
through my efforts

17
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,720
and contribute to

19
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,590
When this team comes out,

20
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,630
pay attention to Bei Erduo.

21
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,300
Keep her out of the camera, understand?

22
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,720
Okay, Yilu.

23
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,390
I recognized her.

24
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,600
She got famous in the love variety show,

25
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,120
right?

26
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,710
I don't know if she's famous.

27
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,160
I didn't have time to watch that boring show.

28
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,150
Okay. Let's get started.

You insane monkey!

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,370
Aren't you scared

31
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,170
of my Magic Fire yet?

32
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:23,700
Hey, hey.

33
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,790
Red boy, don't mess with me.

34
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,700
Do you know who I invited this time?

35
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,440
Avalokitesvara again?

36
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,800
Monkey, you can do nothing

37
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,970
but get helpers.

38
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,660
Stop.

39
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,250
Sorry, director.

40
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,460
The high-frequency section has a distortion.

41
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,790
Have it reset before we continue.

42
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,230
Sorry, we'll reset it now.

43
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,760
Sorry, guys.

44
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,140
During your audition,

45
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,100
the high-frequency section has a distortion.

46
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,790
To be fair

47
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,450
and to hear

48

what's best in you,

49
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,180
please do it again, okay?

50

Tell them to start.

51
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,040
You can start.

Okay.

61

They're out. Hurry.

63
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,860
Please stay.

64
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,170
We have a few questions.

65
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,630
May I have a simple interview?

66
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,100
You were the first team.

67
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,300
Did it make you nervous?

68
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes, more or less.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,830
But pressure is the driving force.

70
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,700
On a scale of one to ten,

71
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,670
how would you rate your performance?

72
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,680
Seven.

73
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,430
Everybody does a good job.

74
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,760
I think there's room for my improvement.

75
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,620
But there was a little accident.

76
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,790
After our first dubbing,

77
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,180
Mr. Allen asked us to do it again.

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,140
But I think

79
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,760
I did better in the first round.

80
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,270
That's right.

81
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,240
And we...

82
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,260
Okay. Thank you for the interview.

83
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,850
Hope you'll get

84
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,920
what you want.

85
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,600

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,690
Let's go check on contestants over there.

87
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,050
I knew Bei Erduo

88
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,760
had a special relationship with the judge.

89
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,260
Or why were we asked to do it again?

90
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,620
In this case,

91
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,320
isn't the result cut and dried?

92
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,920
Which judge are you talking about?

93
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,080
Allen?

94
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,940
Yeah.

95
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,000
The audition you just had?

96
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:45,820
Right.

97
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,980
You just interviewed me, didn't you?

98
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,580
Yeah.

99
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,770
When Bei Erduo walked in,

100
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,830
she exchanged glances with the judge.

101
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,270
They thought others didn't notice.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,880
Excuse me.

103
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
I'm going to the bathroom.

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,580

Erduo.

110
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,280
Bei Erduo,

111
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,950
do you need to pretend to check carefully?

112
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,210
What are you talking about?

113
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,280
Congratulations on being picked.

114
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,580
Now that you pulled strings through Allen,

115
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,180
why do you still pretend to check the list?

116
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,920
Zhang Yilu, why do you

117
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,320
always make a nuisance of yourself?

118
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,710
You'd better not talk nonsense

119
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,770
and try to be nice.

120
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,210
What? Feeling guilty and trying to leave?

121
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,150
Did I say anything wrong?

122
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,670
Due to your lack of ability,
you pulled strings.

123
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,290
Is it fair to everybody else?

124
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,440
Do you answer for what you just said?

125
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,020
What do you mean by pulling strings?

126
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,800
If you were right,

127
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,970
Erduo should have been picked.

128
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,060
But she isn't on the list at all!

129
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,760
Don't fabricate rumors!

130
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,890
First, you made use of Ye Shuwei.

131
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,650
Then you took advantage of Allen

132
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,340
and exchanged glances with him
during the audition.

133
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,420
Does Ye Shuwei know what you did?

134
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,160
I do.

135

Please rest assured.

136
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,760
Our audition is open and transparent.

137
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,100
No one and nothing

138
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,060
will make it unfair.

139
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,690
There's indeed a little mistake

140
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,250
on this list.

141
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,890
We'll have it updated immediately

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,210
about fairness,

145
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,720
welcome to complain.

146
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,750
We should be grateful to Allen.

147
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,320
He identified the problem of our device

148
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,580
in the first place.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,800
To be fair,

150
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,250
we asked the first team to dub it twice.

151
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,740
When Bei Erduo realized the problem,

152
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,110
she changed her voice in time

153
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,810
to make up for the device fault.

154
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,810
She did a great job in it.

155
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,020
It's one of the reasons that she's picked.

156
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,680
You're picked?

157
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,780
She and the judge are a couple.

158
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,740
Is there no problem with it?

159
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,320
Couple?

160
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,130
Yeah. Allen and Bei Erduo.

161
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,460
She's Allen's girlfriend.

162
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,790
If she's Allen's girlfriend,

163
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,810
congratulations, Allen.

164
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,720
You've got such a good girlfriend.

165
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,490
Our principle of selection is

166
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,430
that it's okay to recommend relatives.

167
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,290
If relatives participate in the audition

168
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,500
and none of us can't be picked,

169
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,830
it's also unfair, isn't it?

170
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,290
What do you think, guys?

171
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:47,780
That's right.

172
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,370
And before you revealed it,

173
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,460
we didn't know their relationship.

174
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,220
There's no such thing as an unfair audition.

175
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,820
All right. So much for this.

176
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,700
Thank you, everybody.

177
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,730
You did a good job.

178
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,860
Thank you for coming.

179
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,170
Thank you.

180
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,820
Come on. Don't stand on ceremony.

181
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,800
Why didn't you introduce your girlfriend?

182
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,720
I didn't find a suitable chance yet.

183
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,970
Erduo, why are you leaving so quickly?

184
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,030
Don't you wait for your boyfriend?

185
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,400
No. He's got something else to attend to.

186
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,920
I won't wait for him.

187
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,730
Come on.

188
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,660
I don't want to be the third wheel.

189
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,460
Your boyfriend defended you so bravely.

190
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,380
You should reward him with love.

191
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,040
Bye-bye. I'll leave you alone.

192
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,460
But...

193
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,130
Bei Erduo.

194
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,420
Bei Erduo.

195
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,250
Erduo!

196
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,440
Are you all right?

197
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,510
Yes. Stay back.

198
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,310
Are you really all right?

199
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,560
Yes. Just stay away from me.

200
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,000
Shall I get you up first?

201
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,410
No. I can get up by myself.

202
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,850
What a shame!

203
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,440
Actually,

204
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,210
I didn't see anything.

205
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,070
Do you think I was born yesterday?

206
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm already on the ground.

207
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,800
You think you didn't see anything?

208
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,660
Shall I cover my eyes?

209
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,870
Like this?

210
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,500
Are you done?

211
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,010
I'm going to open my eyes.

212
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,390
Wait. Wait.

213
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,030
What's wrong?

214
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,660
Are you having a nosebleed?

215
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,680
Yes, I guess.

216
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,640
Get your hand off and let me check.

217
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,060
You don't have a nosebleed.

218
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,850
But I felt something...

219
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,930
This shoe is done for.

220
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,890
It's a pair of victory shoes.

221
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,440
I think it can be fixed.

222
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,620
You still want to wear it?

223
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,760
Of course.

224
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,500
Well, you can't wear it anymore.

225
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,460
Ye Shuwei, are you out of your mind?

226
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,880
How can I walk back?

227
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,410
Get on me.

228
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,940
I can walk.

229
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,120
Bei Erduo,

230
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,470
can't you maintain a normal posture

231
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,050
when a girl is carried?

232
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,610
Now, I have to fight against
not only the gravity,

233
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,550
but also the acting force
of being pulled back.

234
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,850
I'll buy you a new pair of shoes.

235
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,330
How's the air up there?

236
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,410
Good.

237
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,330
Wash my handkerchief before you return it.

238
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,010
He's Allen.

239
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,010
He's Allen.

240
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,150
Allen is him.

241
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,250
It's him.

242
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,040
It's him.

243
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,100
It's him.

244
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,660
Allen

245
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,000
is the best composer in the world.

246
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,620
Countless people

247
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,640
asked him to compose.

248
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,440
Is he that perfect?

249
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,390
Maybe you wouldn't say so when you see him.

250
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,860
No way, he's always

251
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,400
perfect for me.

252
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,090
Oh, no.

253
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:26,960
I'm done for.

254
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,760
He must have regarded me as a freak fan.

255
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,920
What do I do?

256
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Bei Duofen.

257
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,200
Bei Duofen.

258
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,660
Are you hungry?

259
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,010
If you are, why do you still run about?

260
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,580
What?

261
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,580
I'm on my way to get some cat food.

262
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,890
Give it to me, then.

263
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,760
Good cat.

264
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,470
Allen looks so lovely
when he plays with the cat.

265
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,100
What's wrong?

266
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,420
Cat food.

267
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,420
Cat food. For Bei Duofen.

268
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,250
It ran away.

269
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,170
So, as I was saying,

270
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,280
[Violin Making-Wood]
the sound of a violin gets better as you play it more.

271
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,870
If you don't play it
for the sake of protecting it,

272
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,300
then you can just throw it into a coffin

273
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,810
and let it rest in peace there.

274
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,050
Remember.

275
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,930
The best maintenance
and the greatest gift for your violin

276
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,860
is practice, every single day.

277
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,050
Oh, no. So many items dropped.

278
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,780
How long will it take me

279
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,790
to pick them up?

280
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,460
Sir,

281
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,280
people care for every living thing.

282
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,070
Don't you help me pick them up?

283
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,480
Miss,

284
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,040
we don't waste our care

285
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,170
on picking up items.

286
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,430
Saving someone's life is
the greatest merit.

287
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,650
It took me more than one hour

288
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,770
to get such items.

289
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,240
They're just like my life.

290
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,130
When you pick them up,

291
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,770
you'll be saving my life.

292
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,570
Cut, cut!

293
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,620
Erduo, don't be shy.

294
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,260
You should have plucked Ye Shuwei's sleeve.

295
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,080
Got it?

296
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,190
When you talk,

297
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,200
talk in a firm voice.

298
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,800
Okay. One more time.

299
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,820
Come on. Let's shoot.

300
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,200
Action.

301
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,940
A promise is a promise.

302
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,080
You must be responsible
for whatever is dropped in your place.

303
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,580
Okay. Cut.

304
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,090
Well done. Switch court.

305
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,800
Bei Erduo,

306
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,120
look at me.

307
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,180
Why?

308
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,480
I... I have to get changed.

309
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,280
Tell me

310
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,610
who I am.

311
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,120
Al...

312
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,070
Ye Shuwei.

313
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,350
I'm Ye Shuwei.

314
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,240
Sorry, I...

315
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,770
Go.

316
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,630
Go get changed.

317
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,630
So, that's it for today.

318
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,650
Thank you for coming.

319
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,930
Thank you.

320
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,570
Thank you for the speech.

321
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,690
Your lecture is very successful.

322
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,030
Thanks.

323
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,570
As you requested,

324
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,000
we'll visit the most famous restaurant here

325
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,870
and taste Chinese roast duck.

326
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,660
This is the schedule. Please check it out.

327
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,670
Darling, relax.

328
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,800
We're shooting a documentary, not a movie.

329
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,090
I'm sorry. I'm a little bit nervous.

330
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,880
Come on. Pretty girls
don't need to be nervous.

331
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,060
Thank you. So...

332
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,040
I...

333
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,740
A friend of mine told me,

334
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,560
“This is a good line to say to a girl

335
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,250
if you admire her.”

336
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,420
But I don't know what it means.

337
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,660
This sentence...

338
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,340
A good young man is wooing,
a fair maiden he loves.

339
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,450
It's from the Book of Poetry.

340
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,640
It means young men always chase

341
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,500
beautiful and kind girls.

342
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,060
It's talking about someone just like you.

343
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,740
Thank you.

344
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,690
You must be hungry, right?

345
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,220
Let's go to the restaurant, okay?

346
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,660
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

347
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,410
Honey!

348
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,210
Honey!

349
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,690
My cousin from the capital city insisted

350
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,840
that I cajoled you with money.

351
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:09,930
Why does she think

352
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,550
I cajoled you with money?

353
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,360
You're just responsible to me.

354
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,380
Am I right, honey?

355
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,350
Yes.

356
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,590
Precisely,

357
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,380
if someone has to do the tough stuff,
let me do it.

358
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,210
PDA.

359
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,200
You... You and I enjoy the gentle breeze.

360
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,140
Hello, everybody. We're PDA.

361
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,440
You're doing PDA,

362
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,370
but you're not PDA, after all.

363
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,190
Sorry, sorry.

364
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:49,930
Come on.

365
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,770
One more time.

366
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,160
You and I enjoy the gentle breeze.

367
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,600
Hello, we're the third couple

368
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,350
of LOVING,

369
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,980
Ye Shuwei and Bei Erduo.

370
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,630
Hope you'll support us.

371
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,270
I hear for this year's competition,

372
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,580
the most potential Italian violin maker Mars

373
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,580
came to China the other day.

374
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,060
But he's shooting a documentary lately.

375
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,000
Mars?

376
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,440
The violin maker Mars

377
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,800
who is a rare genius?

378
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,360
Looks like nobody will win the competition,

379
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,360
except him.

380
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,130
Our boss can be as promising

381
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,420
as him.

382
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,610
But he participated in
last year's competition.

383
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,640
He won't participate this year.

384
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,380
What a pity!

385
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,820
I heard that in last year's competition,

386
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,150
our boss got the same point in the tone

387
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,210
as Mars.

388
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,390
And he got only one point more
in the workmanship.

389
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,970
They're equally matched
in accumulated points.

390
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,900
Hello.

391
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,500
Is Ye Shuwei in?

392
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,330
Who are you?

393
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,500
I'm Mars, Ye Shuwei's old friend.

394
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,900
Mars?

395
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,750
Please wait a moment.

396
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,140
Okay.

397
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,970
Boss, Mr. Mars came for you.

398
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,120
He said he's your old friend.

399
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,950
Get him upstairs.

400
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,000
Okay.

401
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,550
Come this way, please.

402
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,040
Thank you.

403
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,640
Hello, Allen.

404
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,250
Long time no see.

405
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,430
When we stay apart, you get worse.
Is it the saying?

406
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,220
Don't use a proverb
unless you can use it correctly.

407
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,000
So, this is definitely your style, huh?

408
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,430
Don't you wanna know what I'm doing here?

409
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,160
No, I don't.

410
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,390
My god, you never change.

411
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:28,540
What?

412
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,260
Why are you eavesdropping again?

413
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,470
Be careful, or you'll lose
your year-end bonus.

414
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,710
You have no idea.

415
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,040
It's a competition between masters
once in a thousand years.

416
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,590
Okay, I will tell you anyways.

417
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,720
I'm here

418
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,770
cuz I want to invite you to participate
in this year's competition.

419
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,570
Really not interested.

420
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,090
Come on. I'm pretty sure
that this time I can beat you.

421
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,520
Sure.

422
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,460
You know?

423
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,450
The winner's work

424
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,910
will be used in a world tour concert.

425
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,090
Don't you want the next Antonio Stradivari

426
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,030
or Niccolo Paganini

427
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,910
to use your violin?

428
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,030
Your point is?

429
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,010
Oh, gosh. You're really nothing
like your teacher.

430
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,700
How can you not be interested in fame?

431
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,650
Okay.

432
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,160
I hope you can consider it.

433
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,470
I'm working on a new instrument

434
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,880
and I'm pretty confident in it.

435
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,220
All right. Bye, Allen.

436
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,630
This way, please.

437
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,450
Okay. Thank you.

438
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,230
I'll be back.

439
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,960
Okay.

440
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,640
There's a Chinese saying
that little strokes fell great books.

441
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,270
Little strokes fell great book?

442
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,470
It means if we persist,

443
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,100
we'll be successful.

444
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,450
Little strokes fell great oaks, actually.

445
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,930
Ah, yes, yes.

446
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,960
I have one more question.

447
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,440
What word can I use

448
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,190
to describe a pretty girl?

449
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,540
Gorgeous.

450
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,820
Gorged? Thank you.

451
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,760
Gorgeous, not gorged.

452
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,950
Where are you going?

453
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,140
There'll be a lecture by a famous voice actress

454
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,970
in the neighboring city
the day after tomorrow.

455
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,500
I plan to live there tomorrow night

456
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,390
and go to the lecture the day after tomorrow.

457
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,240
Aren't we supposed to have the last episode
the day after tomorrow?

458
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,090
It'll be made tomorrow evening, right?

459
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,810
After the lecture,

460
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,450
it'll take me only two hours to come back.

461
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,830
Don't worry. I won't be late.

462
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,650
Go to bed early.

463
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,590
Good night.

464
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,410
Hello, Moyu.

465
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,020
Again? The day after tomorrow?

466
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,010
It's okay. It's my job, anyway.

467
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,070
Nothing.

468
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,700
See you at the studio the day after tomorrow.

469
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,130
Good night. Go to bed early.

470
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,670
Okay.

471
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:14,840
Bye-bye.

472
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:17,880
Who called?

473
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,700
It's okay. Get to sleep early.

474
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,710
Yes.

475
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,970
The demo she recorded for you...

476
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,320
Email it to me.

477
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,490
As soon as possible.

478
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,080
Hello, Li.

479
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,780
Hello, Erduo. What are you doing?

480
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,380
I'm quite upset.

481
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,250
What happened?

482
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,730
You know what?

483
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,860
I had planned to attend a lecture

484
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,490
of a very famous voice actress
the day after tomorrow.

485
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,510
I was expecting it for quite a long time.

486
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,810
But I was just informed

487
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,980
that the dubbing work had to be remade.

488
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,200
Then I can't go to the lecture.

489
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,350
I'm so upset.

490
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,940
It's a pity.

491
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,400
But you don't have another choice.

492
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,200
That's right.

493
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,700
I have to let nature take its course.

494
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,960
Erduo, I have something to tell you.

495
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,540
According to Mars,

496
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,540
he wants Ye Shuwei
to participate in the competition.

497
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,410
Because in his heart,

498
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,010
no one has the strength to compete with him,

499
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,660
but Ye Shuwei.

500
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,550
Unexpectedly, Ye Shuwei doesn't participate.

501
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,860
Why doesn't he?

502
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,720
I have no idea.

503
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,210
I don't know

504
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:12,970
what he's thinking.

505
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,600
Could you...?

506
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,300
Li,

507
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,340
don't think

508
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm powerful enough

509
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,080
to change his mind.

510
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,040
What? You're sleepless?

511
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,490
No.

512
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,620
I hear

513
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,730
that you'll lend your studio to Li

514
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,530
for the documentary of Mars.

515
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,570
What's up?

516
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,740
Tomorrow is the weekend.

517
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,170
And I have nothing to do.

518
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,830
I haven't seen Li for a long time.

519
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,750
Think about it. Um...

520
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,490
Go with me at one tomorrow afternoon.

521
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,000
Okay. Good idea.

522
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,510
Anything else?

523
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,330
No. Good night.

524
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,460
What would you like to drink?

525
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,720
You sound like there's something else,

526
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,840
but coffee.

527
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,450
There's coconut milk.

528
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,620
Erduo.

529
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,100
There you are.

530
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,430
Mars, this is Erduo,

531
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,520
my best friend.

532
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,860
Erduo, this is Mars.

533
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,380
Nice to meet you.

534
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,170
Gorged, nice to meet you.

535
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,390
I'm Mars, Allen's old friend.

536
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,420
Gorgeous, not gorged.

537
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,560
Guru Ye, which area can we use
for the shooting?

538
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,690
Erduo,

539
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,240
Ye Shuwei is still so indifferent.

540
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,280
When his old friend came,

541
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,240
he only said hello

542
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,590
and then left his friend here alone.

543
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,430
You're shooting the documentary of Mars.

544
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,380
Why would Ye Shuwei accompany you?

545
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,900
He doesn't need to guide Mars.

546
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,560
Besides, he doesn't want to disturb you.

547
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:29,340
He's a powerful rival to Mars.

548
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,190
If he stays aside and stares at Mars,

549
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,130
don't you think

550
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,000
Mars will be stressed out

551
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,170
and be disturbed

552
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,680
so that he can't do a good job
in the shooting?

553
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,960
Come on.

554
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,160
You're already defending him, huh?

555
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,570
What?

556
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,160
He's handsome.

557
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,530
He's handsome and talented.

558
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,150
I think a man like Mars

559
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,620
can be also good.

560
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,170
He's outstanding and energetic.

561
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,370
And look.

562
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,890
Foreign men are said

563
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,630
to be straightforward in love.

564
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,080
They won't keep girls guessing.

565
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,820
Oh, you get it.

566
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,580
Only men work in Ye Shuwei's studio.

567
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,960
Why is there coconut milk?

568
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,190
Why can't men have coconut milk?

569
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,880
I don't want the coffee, then.

570
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,890
I want some coconut milk, too.

571
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,010
Hurry.

572
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,010
You're quite demanding.

573
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,560
Hurry. Go.

574
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,600
What?

575
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,090
There's no more. It's the only bottle.

576
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:50,650
You...

577
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,410
What a coincidence!

578
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,720
You must have lied to me.

579
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,210
Hurry.

580
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,280
Annoying.

581
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,590
Miss Tang, we're done.

582
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,530
Fine. Let's call it a day.

583
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,410
Erduo.

584
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,190
Thank you for lending us the studio.

585
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,000
You had a long day.

586
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,450
What? Are the tools handy?

587
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,310
The tools and the operating environment

588
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,240
can be amazing.

589
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:20,360
I want to invite you to go skating.

590
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,440
What do you think?

591
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,310
Skating?

592
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,350
Yes. It's been many years

593
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,610
since we last had a skating competition.

594
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,340
Shall we compete again?

595
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,740
Oh, you can skate?

596
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,600
He can not only skate,

597
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,660
but he also skates very well.

598
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,850
He's even able to participate
in a skating competition.

599
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,400
Oh, awesome.

600
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,140
You can make violins, compose,

601
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,530
shoot arrows, dance waltz

602
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,510
and even skate.

603
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,750
Quite difficult things.

604
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,790
How many more skills do you have?

605
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,820
So, Allen, would you like to compete?

606
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,420
Not interested.

607
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,090
Maybe next time.

608
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,200
Let's take our leave.

609
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,520
Okay.

610
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,360
Fine.

611
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,240
Even though you never want
to compete against me,

612
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,080
I respect your decision.

613
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,380
Thank you.

614
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,690
Mars, let's go.

615
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,110
Okay.

616
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,140
Thank you, Guru Ye.

617
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,190
What?

618
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,050
Nothing.

619
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,180
If you want to go skating,
I can take you there.

620
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,940
I don't.

621
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,800
I just want to see

622
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,850
how you skate handsomely on the rink

623
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,540
and I want to see how you defeat Mars.

624
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,330
Actually, I'm not omnipotent.

625
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,860
But in my eyes,

626
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,790
there's nothing you can't do.

627
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,370
Why are you suddenly so confident in me?

628
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,000
Didn't you admire

629
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,480
the perfect Allen

630
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,790
who's the best and most handsome?

631
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,090
Exactly.

632
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,020
in my heart,

633
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,480
Allen is super cool and perfect.

634
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,120
Now, you're him.

635
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,830
No one can ever defeat you.

636
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,940
When Boss arrives, you go tell him.

637
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,610
Morning.

638
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,170
Good morning, Boss.

639
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,640
Good morning.

640
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:47,950
Go.

641
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,230
Didn't you see he was in a good mood today?

642
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,650
We should say it when he's in a good mood.

643
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,360
He Yang.

644
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:56,820
Boss.

645
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,610
When is the deadline for signing up?

646
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,260
This year's competition, I mean.

647
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,940
This week.

648
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,970
This week...

649
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,890
Fine. Pay more attention

650
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,910
to the violin orders lately.

651
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,380
So do you.

652
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,240
Okay.

653
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,380
Why?

654
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,570
As we prayed sincerely,

655
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,150
our dream would come true.

656
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,770
What's up?

657
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,290
Don't you invite me in?

658
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,630
Sorry, but we're closed.

659
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,230
I have something important to tell you.

660
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,460
About Bei Erduo.

661
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,330
What is it?

662
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,700
If you go to the show tomorrow,

663
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,200
I'll make this photo public.

664
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,950
Your relationship with Yu Sheng

665
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,130
will be exposed.

666
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,230
What relationship?

667
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,080
You're relatives.

668
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,290
If the audiences know

669
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,900
you won the competition
because of your relationship,

670
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,650
you would all be utterly discredited.

671
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,270
Not to mention the bonus.

672
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,820
Whatever.

673
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,820
[Kugimiya's Way to Animation]

674
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,230
Mr. Ye,

675
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,170
nice to meet you again.

676
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,180
Ms. Kugimiya,

677
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,390
thank you for sparing some time for me

678
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,190
out of your schedule.

679
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,890
You're welcome, Mr. Ye.

680
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,900
We're old friends
who have cooperated many times.

681
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,740
If you need any help,

682
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,740
let me know.

683
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,770
Be seated, please.

684
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,490
Well, Ms. Kugimiya,

685
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,400
here's the thing.

686
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,810
A friend of mine is learning to dub.

687
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,700
You're her idol.

688
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,470
Today,

689
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,150
she's too busy

690
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,590
to come to your lecture.

691
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,450
So, I've bought some of her information

692
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,860
and want to ask you
a few questions about dubbing.

693
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,120
Okay.

694
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,260
Here. Please have a look.

695
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,270
Oh, I see.

696
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,630
You must be the one

697
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,320
who kept recording my lecture today.

698
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,370
I am.

699
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,870
I thought it was a loyal fan of mine.

700
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,050
So, it's you.

701
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,620
Actually, I'm a fan of yours, too.

702
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,600
You are?

703
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,600
I've brought you some of her dubbing works.

704
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,800
Hope you can give her

705
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,080
some guidance and advice.

706
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,200
Okay.

707
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,640
Here.

708
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,460
[Meeting Room]

709
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,060
Thank you for your work.

710
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,190
In celebration of our perfect ending,

711
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,260
I'll invite you to dinner tonight.

712
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,070
Bravo!

713
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,990
Moyu.

714
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,390
I'll take my leave.

715
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,190
Okay.

716
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,880
I'm not going with you tonight.

717
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,100
I've got something else to do.

718
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,620
Remember to eat up

719
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,170
my share.

720
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:25,920
Cutie,

721
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,530
get to your business.

722
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,650
Eat more when we dine together next time.

723
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,800
I'll go get packed, then.

724
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,130
Go ahead.

725
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,500
Bye.

726
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,490
This girl is very lovely.

727
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,730
She speaks standard Japanese, too.

728
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:46,670
Yes.

729
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,860
From her works, I heard her improvement

730
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,730
in the dubbing.

731
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,480
What shall I call her?

732
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,540
Miss Bei.

733
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,810
Her early problems are

734
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,540
that she didn't dub fluently

735
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,440
and she couldn't make pauses perfectly.

736
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,200
Was she professionally trained?

737
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,860
She's a stickler for basic skill training.

738
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,330
Later, she joined a team

739
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,510
and has been working with
professional voice actors and actresses.

740
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,380
Then, Miss Bei is

741
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,150
hardworking and sensitive.

742
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,450
Her monologues sound fabulous.

743
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,610
I love them.

744
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,310
So, Ms. Kugimiya,

745
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,060
do you have any special tips

746
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,960
to instruct her?

747
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,480
I have some experience

748
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,000
in dubbing

749
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,490
that she can use for reference.

750
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,370
Okay. May I record it?

751
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,460
Yes, of course.

752
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:41,840
Thank you.

753
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,350
