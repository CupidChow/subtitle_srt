1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,940

2
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:45,326

3
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:48,416

4
00:00:55,478 --> 00:00:58,558
Qiao Jing, what's wrong? I'll take you to the hospital.

5
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:03,198
I'm fine. I'll just rest for a bit.

6
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:05,178
I will be fine as soon as I take some medicine.

7
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:07,198
Then I'll take you somewhere to rest.

8
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:52,378
Take some medicine.

9
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:12,958
- Thank you. 
 - Rest well.

10
00:02:58,258 --> 00:03:01,198
You're awake. Do you feel better now?

11
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:04,838
I'm already fine now.

12
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:07,318
Thank you for helping me last night.

13
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:10,678
Why are you so polite? I just happened to be passing by.

14
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:13,998
I noticed your car was on the side so I went over to check.

15
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:17,038
Luckily, you noticed me.

16
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:20,658
Your lady's special time is indeed a bit scary.

17
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,458
I almost called 120 (Emergency).

18
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,058
Everyone's condition is different.

19
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:27,798
I'm in the minority.

20
00:03:35,398 --> 00:03:39,918
If you need anything in the future, come find me at any time.

21
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,944

22
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:46,312
Thank you.

23
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:49,358
Hurry, we're running out of time.

24
00:03:57,298 --> 00:03:58,890
What's the matter?

25
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,670
I don't know.

26
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:14,960
Secretary Qiao.

27
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:26,098
- Director Gu. 
 - Director Gu.

28
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:29,520
What is this?

29
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,570
Secretary Qiao, could this be you?

30
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:36,898
You went to a hotel with a man and got photographed?

31
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:38,558
Be more careful next time.

32
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:40,298
It's not like that.

33
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:42,898
Xiang Se Se, get rid of all the photos.

34
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:44,430
Not a single one is to be leaked!

35
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,990
Okay.

36
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:50,558
Do none of you need to work?

37
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,398
Stop looking, stop looking!

38
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:55,218
- Tang Ping, turn it off. 
 - Okay.

39
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:05,464
Tell me.

40
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,698
Yesterday, I got my period and felt extremely uncomfortable.

41
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:11,538
If you were uncomfortable, why did you go out?

42
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,838
Tell me, who is that man?

43
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:15,998
Why were you together?

44
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:20,718
Calm down.

45
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:23,898
I called you many times yesterday, but you did not answer.

46
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:26,378
I didn't answer so you called another guy, right?

47
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:27,998
I did not!

48
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:30,158
How can you prove it?

49
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:34,704
Tell me!

50
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:45,178
I can't prove it.

51
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,738
But no other man has touched me.

52
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:54,658
From the beginning, I have only had you.

53
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:33,038
- Did you get it settled? 
 - It's settled.

54
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:34,978
All of the photos have been deleted.

55
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,558
And all of the people have shut up already.

56
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:39,818
If anyone dares to leak this out again,

57
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:42,438
- there will be no mercy! 
 -  Yes.

58
00:06:42,438 --> 00:06:43,918
This isn't going to get leaked,

59
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,678
but due to this fuss, Secretary Qiao's reputation might be ruined.

60
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:50,338
Listen to your typical male rhetoric!

61
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:52,538
Did Secretary Qiao kill someone or commit arson?

62
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,378
Wasn't she just photographed going to a hotel?

63
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:58,858
How has her reputation gone to ruin?

64
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:01,818
- Well— 
 - That's right. The person whose privacy was violated is Secretary Qiao.

65
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:03,918
She's the victim.

66
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:07,418
All right, all right, I'm wrong.

67
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:18,138
On that day, I left the Gu residence after Qiao Jing did.

68
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:23,698
Since we went the same way, I got the chance to take these interesting photos.

69
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:29,098
You did a great job carrying this out.

70
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:32,000
I just used a little trickery.

71
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,930
Cheers.

72
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:03,318
I've already dealt with all the photos.

73
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:06,998
Nobody in the company will dare to spread rumors about you.

74
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:10,718
I've already fired the employee who released the photos.

75
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:12,658
And I will also pursue legal action against him.

76
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,378
Rest assured.

77
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:17,958
As for Bai Yun, I'll make her apologize to you.

78
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:30,558
Tomorrow is your birthday.

79
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:32,898
I'll make time to be with you.

80
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:35,038
I have something to tell you.

81
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:08,060

82
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,398
- Mom? 
 - Get in the car.

83
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:27,960
Tonight, come with me to have dinner with your Auntie Bai

84
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,870
and discuss your marriage with Xiao Yun.

85
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:32,098
All of a sudden?

86
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,998
Why? Do you have urgent matters?

87
00:10:34,998 --> 00:10:36,396
Yes.

88
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:41,598
No matter how important it is, it can't be as important as your marriage.

89
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:46,238
If you want to sit steadily as Anxia's successor, you still need the Bai family's support.

90
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:48,770
Don't wear a look of unwillingness and dissatisfaction.

91
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,310
If others see, they will be unhappy.

92
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:54,478
Listen to me. Get in the car.

93
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:11,224

94
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:46,118
 You said you would never be absent for any of my birthdays.

95
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:50,938
 But this time, you broke your promise.

96
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,670

97
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:04,920

98
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:17,938
Wishing you

99
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:22,118
a happy birthday.

100
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:36,152

101
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:43,298
I had a last-minute event yesterday evening. Here's your birthday present.

102
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:47,298
Open it and have a look. If you don't like it, I'll buy you another.

103
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:54,858
Gu Yi, I'm here to resign today.

104
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,440

105
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:03,178
Is it just because you're angry I didn't attend your birthday last night?

106
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:07,298
Thank you for your care over the last three years, Director Gu.

107
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:11,178
It's just a birthday.

108
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:13,158
Can't I just make it up to you?

109
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:15,218
We can't get back time that is lost.

110
00:13:15,218 --> 00:13:17,938
When did you become so melodramatic?

111
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:26,558
Fine, I'll take today off then.

112
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:29,438
My whole day's time is yours.

113
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:31,378
It isn't about my birthday.

114
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,878
Then what is it about?

115
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:35,670
I'm tired.

116
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,018
I'm tired and exhausted.

117
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:42,318
I don't want to continue this anymore.

118
00:13:44,738 --> 00:13:46,508
"Tired"?

119
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:52,538
Are you tired, or do you have your eye on another man?

120
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:54,218
Gu Yi,

121
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:56,618
let's break up.

122
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,618
Let us release each other.

123
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:05,436
Qiao Jing!

124
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:10,498
I will turn over the work matters properly.

125
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:25,418
Secretary Qiao, why are you resigning?

126
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:27,358
Is it because of the photos?

127
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:30,738
Don't mind the rumors so much. People will forget them in a few days.

128
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:34,258
Right! And many people don't care about that at all.

129
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:37,238
Everyone is on your side.

130
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:39,538
It's not due to that.

131
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:42,530
I've been working for too long, and I also wish I could "lie flat" (ease off) like you.

132
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,450
That's true.

133
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:49,230
If I had to work 365 days a year without any rest like you do,

134
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,450
I would have quit long ago.

135
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,398
Well, if you're gone, what will become of us?

136
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:57,238
Haven't you always wanted to replace me?

137
00:14:57,238 --> 00:15:00,098
Now that I'm leaving, hasn't your chance arrived?

138
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:02,478
I just said that for fun...

139
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:05,058
for fun, for fun.

140
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,798
All of you have top-notch work abilities.

141
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:11,638
Even without me, you won't be affected much.

142
00:15:11,638 --> 00:15:15,018
Yang Yang, you worked with me since joining the company.

143
00:15:15,018 --> 00:15:17,478
You've grown the fastest of everyone.

144
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:19,198
Do not do everything by yourself in the future.

145
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,398
Be mindful of taking rests. Don't overwork yourself.

146
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:26,998
Tang Ping, if you want to nap, go to the break room.

147
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:30,558
The couch in there is more comfortable than your office chair.

148
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,318
And you, don't always sleep so late.

149
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:40,318
Don't frantically get to work exactly on time daily.

150
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:43,198
If you missed an elevator, wouldn't you be late?

151
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:46,678
No, I can't bear to see you go.

152
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:49,438
Exactly. How about you reconsider?

153
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:52,518
Yes, Secretary Qiao. Give it more thought, all right?

154
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,698
That's enough. Stop trying to persuade me.

155
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:58,498
Come on. Let's celebrate my regained freedom.

156
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:02,050
Come on.

157
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,610
All right.

158
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,578
 To regained freedom.

159
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:13,378
 Now that both families have met and decided the matter,

160
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:15,378
 you're about to get engaged to Bai Yun.

161
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:17,318
 I am finally relieved.

162
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:19,378
 What are your plans for the engagement?

163
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,918
 Have you any ideas for the venue decoration?

164
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:24,238
Mom, just do whatever you think is best.

165
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:26,558
 This is a big life event.

166
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:29,598
 Can't you put in a little more effort?

167
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:32,758
 Hello? Hello?

168
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,980
 Son? I'm talking to you. Can you hear me?

169
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,650
 Hello?

170
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,718
He and I completely ended our relationship.

171
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:18,418
Have you really considered it this time?

172
00:17:21,198 --> 00:17:23,618
Maybe I should have done this sooner.

173
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:35,698
 I have a very important conference call on Wednesday afternoon.

174
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:39,018
The itinerary says the flight is at 1:30 p.m.

175
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:43,258
No, no, the version I gave to Special Assistant Bai wasn't like that.

176
00:17:46,138 --> 00:17:49,718
Then why is this document missing a page?

177
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:53,118
It might have been Tang Ping's oversight.

178
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:55,718
Mr. Gu, the electronic version I sent is complete.

179
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:57,318
You can check it anytime.

180
00:17:57,318 --> 00:18:01,418
So who made this flawed, error-ridden work plan?

181
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,520
I just thought your work was progressing too slowly,

182
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,950
and I wanted to help.

183
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,898
Who gave you permission to interfere with our work?

184
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:17,518
Now Secretary Qiao has left, I wanted to assist you.

185
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:20,460
I don't need it!

186
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,010
Redo it!

187
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:25,836
Let's go. Let's go.

188
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,758
Starting tomorrow, you don't need to come to work.

189
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:36,958
Go home and prepare for the engagement.

190
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,980
Why?

191
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,630
Do you think I'm not as good as her?

192
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:43,638
You're still missing her, aren't you?

193
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:45,318
How could that be possible?

194
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:48,570
She was only a secretary. Why would it be hard to let her go?

195
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,178
Get out.

196
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:52,558
- I— 
 - Get out!

197
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:53,950
 If I don't see you downstairs in three minutes,

198
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,070
 I'll come knock on your door.

199
00:20:18,178 --> 00:20:19,830
Get in the car.

200
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,010
Get in the car!

201
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,638
How did you know I was here?

202
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:35,378
Would I not know all details about you?

203
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:38,590
As long as I want you, no matter where you go,

204
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,710
I will find you.

205
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:44,958
Why did you come find me so late?

206
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:51,118
If there is nothing, I'll return upstairs.

207
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:57,258
How long will you make a fuss?

208
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:58,890
I'm not making a fuss.

209
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,090
I was serious about all that I said.

210
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:03,118
What exactly are you unsatisfied with?

211
00:21:03,118 --> 00:21:05,958
Is it just because I didn't spend your birthday with you?

212
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:11,398
- I'm going upstairs now. 
 - What do you want?

213
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:15,078
I can give you whatever you want as long as you ask.

214
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,598
I don't want any of those things. I want you to get away from me.

215
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:22,518
Impossible.

216
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:27,838
Gu Yi, your mom has already talked to me.

217
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:31,958
You're about to get engaged to Bai Yun. What's the point of doing this now?

218
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:36,878
We are done, and I don't wish to see you ever again.

219
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:03,058
What are you doing so early in the morning?

220
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:05,178
I found a new place; I'm moving out later.

221
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:07,258
When did this happen? Why is it so sudden?

222
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:09,158
I contacted them last night.

223
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:11,358
Tell me the truth. Why are you leaving?

224
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:13,938
Did Gu Yi threaten you so you want to leave?

225
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:15,458
Of course not.

226
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,378
You live-stream daily, turning day into night. Our routines differ.

227
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,858
I will disturb you by living here.

228
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:22,858
I'll be busy only a little while.

229
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,358
It'll be fine in a few days.

230
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,678
Even so, I can't loiter at your place forever.

231
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,058
All right, I'll take good care of myself. Don't worry.

232
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,738
Right. Here's your key. I'm returning it to you.

233
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:37,298
I can't change your mind no matter what I do!

234
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:41,358
But keep the key and come back anytime.

235
00:22:42,218 --> 00:22:43,832
Okay.

236
00:22:50,418 --> 00:22:53,160
Miss Qiao, sorry to bother you.

237
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,020
Our hotel system made a mistake.

238
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,280
This room was already reserved online by another.

239
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
However, we'll compensate you for your loss

240
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,330
and upgrade your room to a presidential suite for free. What do you think?

241
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,550
No need, just give me a comparable room.

242
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,750
Right now, all other rooms in the hotel are full.

243
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,350
Only the presidential suite is still vacant.

244
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:16,658
All right then. Sorry for the trouble.

245
00:23:16,658 --> 00:23:18,978
No problem, it's our duty.

246
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:21,150
Miss Qiao, your room is ahead.

247
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,750
Okay.

248
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:30,978
- Wish you a pleasant stay. 
 - Thank you.

249
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,784
Qiao Jing.

250
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:46,458
Why didn't you tell me you wanted to stay in a hotel?

251
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,958
I could have stayed with you.

252
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,978
Are you bored or something?

253
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:54,518
No, I'm not bored.

254
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,958
How could I get bored?

255
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:02,118
Isn't it nice to occasionally play a game of cat and mouse with you?

256
00:24:03,878 --> 00:24:08,278
I've said it. No matter where you go,

257
00:24:09,158 --> 00:24:11,458
I'll find you.

258
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:14,938
Gu Yi, can you stop being so willful?

259
00:24:14,938 --> 00:24:17,918
Did you consider what I said last night?

260
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:28,778
My engagement to Bai Yun is just for business interests.

261
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:32,238
It's because our Gu family and Anxia need the Bai family.

262
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:36,358
But don't worry.

263
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:39,858
I used to think you had emotional blocks

264
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:41,718
so you lacked empathy and respect for others.

265
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:43,318
I could understand all of that.

266
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:47,858
But now, how could you say such shameless words?

267
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:51,738
Is it I who is shameless?

268
00:25:58,544 --> 00:25:59,640

269
00:26:03,574 --> 00:26:05,473

270
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:17,038
I inconvenienced you tonight. Thank you.

271
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:22,018
Don't be formal. I'm just happy you called me.

272
00:26:22,018 --> 00:26:24,758
It means you trust me as a friend.

273
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:28,918
Where are we going now?

274
00:26:30,518 --> 00:26:32,238
We'll be there soon.

275
00:26:56,238 --> 00:26:58,498
This was a guesthouse I designed before.

276
00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:01,538
I haven't operated it since I went abroad.

277
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:06,858
But an auntie has cared for the plants here all this time.

278
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,758
Although this guesthouse is quaint, it is still fairly clean.

279
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:12,118
You can stay here for now.

280
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:20,518
There's a staircase leading to the second floor here.

281
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:24,378
There are several bedrooms. You can pick any of them.

282
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:26,318
That's the living room.

283
00:27:29,518 --> 00:27:33,298
Mr. Bai, I don't even know how to thank you.

284
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:39,198
No need to say all of this to me.

285
00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:41,898
I know some of your situation.

286
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:44,718
Gu Yi will be engaged to my cousin by the end of the month.

287
00:27:44,718 --> 00:27:48,778
Before then, you should get some proper rest here.

288
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:51,698
Then how will the rent be calculated?

289
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:55,738
For a place so big and nice, there must be costs.

290
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,858
Between us, we don't need to discuss this.

291
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:02,498
Mr. Bai, the rent must be paid.

292
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:03,978
You've helped me so much already.

293
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:07,878
If you don't take rent, I'll have to find another place.

294
00:28:08,718 --> 00:28:12,418
All right, then I'll charge for the most expensive double room.

295
00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:16,398
And help me take care of the plants too.

296
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,458
By the way, you have to agree to one more request.

297
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:23,170
What's the request?

298
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,810
Don't call me Mr. Bai in the future.

299
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:29,278
Call me... Bai Yan.

300
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:32,784
Bai Yan.

301
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,730
Did you find her?

302
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,250
I've been searching all day, and I'm exhausted.

303
00:28:47,898 --> 00:28:50,618
She didn't go to her friend's place.

304
00:28:50,618 --> 00:28:54,978
No trace of her was in hotels, rentals, airports, or train stations.

305
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,878
Keep searching.

306
00:28:57,878 --> 00:29:00,798
I don't believe she can hide forever.

307
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:02,878
Why don't you just forget it?

308
00:29:02,878 --> 00:29:04,698
You already broke up with her.

309
00:29:04,698 --> 00:29:07,858
Besides, you're getting engaged to Xiao Yun.

310
00:29:07,858 --> 00:29:12,298
At this moment, it will affect you negatively to act so blatantly toward another woman.

311
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:15,758
I will let her go, but not now.

312
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:21,458
Anyway, you should decide who is more important, Xiao Yun or Qiao Jing.

313
00:29:24,238 --> 00:29:28,118
All right, I'm going to eat something good.

314
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:30,978
You cover the expenses.

315
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:41,678
Qiao Jing, Qiao Jing, where are you?

316
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:44,678
I bet not many people in South City can enjoy a meal cooked by you, Great Secretary Qiao.

317
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,960
It's not that dramatic. Taste it.

318
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,350
Okay.

319
00:30:57,378 --> 00:31:00,958
These foods appear to be served directly from a five-star restaurant.

320
00:31:01,438 --> 00:31:05,658
I guessed your cooking skills were good, but I didn't expect this delight.

321
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:07,818
I didn't know how to cook before.

322
00:31:07,818 --> 00:31:10,618
It was because Gu Yi was picky that I—

323
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:21,258
Leaving him is good for you.

324
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:29,218
He's not worth your trust, let alone your sorrow.

325
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:32,158
He'll be your cousin-in-law soon.

326
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:34,718
Why don't you defend him?

327
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:39,458
Although Bai Yun and I are cousins, we don't normally interact much.

328
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:44,278
Although everyone says Mr. Gu has good taste, I don't think so.

329
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:46,650
Why?

330
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,980
If his taste was really good,

331
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,150
he wouldn't treat a beautiful jade like mudrock (shale).

332
00:31:58,198 --> 00:32:01,898
Gu Yi doesn't see your worth,

333
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:04,738
but someone can cherish it.

334
00:32:13,518 --> 00:32:15,118
Don't mention him.

335
00:32:15,118 --> 00:32:18,538
The food is getting cold. Let's eat.

336
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:23,780
Okay.

337
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:40,140
Who is that guy?

338
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,950
 It's Bai Yan.

339
00:32:56,358 --> 00:32:57,838
Where is she?

340
00:32:57,838 --> 00:33:00,370
- Who are you referring to? 
 - Qiao Jing!

341
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,470
No comment.

342
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,390
Who do you think you are?

343
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:08,958
How dare you meddle in our affairs? Hand her over.

344
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:11,678
Qiao Jing has broken up with you already.

345
00:33:11,678 --> 00:33:14,778
You and her are no longer "our affairs."

346
00:33:19,918 --> 00:33:22,958
Gu Yi, calm down.

347
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:27,198
How childish. You are unworthy of Qiao Jing.

348
00:33:27,198 --> 00:33:28,598
Get out of here.

349
00:33:28,598 --> 00:33:30,418
Let go!

350
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:57,650

351
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:02,650
"The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

352
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:06,861
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

353
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:15,469
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

354
00:34:15,473 --> 00:34:19,605
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

355
00:34:19,605 --> 00:34:28,269
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

356
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:33,973
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

357
00:34:33,973 --> 00:34:39,537
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

358
00:34:39,549 --> 00:34:45,803
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

359
00:34:45,803 --> 00:34:51,897
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

360
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:55,492
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

361
00:34:55,492 --> 00:34:59,096
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

362
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:05,182
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

363
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:11,487
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

364
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:17,323
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

365
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:21,105
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

366
00:35:21,105 --> 00:35:24,587
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

367
00:35:24,587 --> 00:35:28,231
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

368
00:35:28,231 --> 00:35:35,303
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

369
00:35:35,303 --> 00:35:38,670
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

370
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,477
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

371
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:49,788
♫  This unbearable plot  ♫

372
00:35:49,788 --> 00:35:56,245
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫

373
00:35:56,245 --> 00:36:02,248
♫  Being a guest may be my other destiny  ♫

374
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:09,349
♫  As the one who left, what gives me the right to care?  ♫

375
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:15,584
&lt;♫  After all, you're the one who finally got married, and I'm just a guest  ♫

376
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:21,908
♫  I drained all the memories to celebrate your wedding  ♫

377
00:36:21,908 --> 00:36:27,641
♫  But I never had the courage to bless you  ♫

378
00:36:27,641 --> 00:36:38,209
♫  Thank you for making me finally aware and returning me back to myself  ♫

379
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:48,641
♫  At least I can still be a guest to witness your love  ♫

380
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:52,553
♫  He's so lucky to have met you  ♫

381
00:36:52,553 --> 00:37:03,535
♫  I hope he loves you more than I do  ♫
