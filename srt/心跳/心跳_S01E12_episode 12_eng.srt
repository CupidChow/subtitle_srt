1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:09,990

2
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:46,000

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,379

4
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:00,572
Xiao Yun.

5
00:01:05,964 --> 00:01:08,144
What does this mean?

6
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:11,360
I heard from my mom that you're holding a concert.

7
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
I wish you a successful performance.

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,060
You used to ignore me.

9
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,320
Now there is Su Juan,

10
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,460
you're afraid you can't keep the company

11
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,360
or secure the heir's position;

12
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,760
thus, you're here to kiss up to me?

13
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,920
I, Gu Yi, never rely on women.

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,556
I was the one who wronged you before.

15
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:41,804
No matter what happens, I'll always treat you like my little sister.

16
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,020
We are about to get married!

17
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,360
You just got a brother; now you want one more sister?

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,560
What? Have you a family tradition of seeking more relatives?

19
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,940
I used to think marriage can work without love.

20
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,692
But now,

21
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,120
I have fallen in love with someone.

22
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,900
Xiao Yun, stop wasting your time on me.

23
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,480
You'll meet someone who really loves you.

24
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,080
How come you get to have someone you love,

25
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,300
and I have to give up on the one I love?

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,520
You're too selfish!

27
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:35,744

28
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,480
I thought you weren't feeling well.

29
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Why are you still drinking?

30
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:46,812
A'Juan!

31
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:49,464
Come here.

32
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,940
You go; I'll wait here.

33
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,760
All right, then you wait here.

34
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:08,372
Both of you, this is Su Juan, Chairman Gu's eldest son.

35
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:11,348
So handsome, just like your dad when he was young.

36
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:14,500
- Thank you. 
 - The children of the Gu Family are all outstanding.

37
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm flattered.

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,460
What projects are you two working on these days?

39
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,460
Nothing much.

40
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,420
I told you Bai Yun would definitely come.

41
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,560
Gu Yi publicly cancelled the engagement and totally embarrassed her.

42
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,460
I can't believe she still chased him here.

43
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,360
I wouldn't be here, if I were her.

44
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,820
She pretends to be superior all day long,

45
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,320
but actually, she is just a desperate pushover.

46
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,860
Exactly, it's hilarious.

47
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,292
Secretary Qiao?

48
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,060
It's really you.

49
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,200
Sorry, I'm late. I'll drink to apologize.

50
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,792
Do you not recognize me?

51
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:32,780
We had dinner together last winter.

52
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Forget it, stop drinking.

53
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,340
Come on, I'll take you home.

54
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,748
Director Gu.

55
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,580
Get lost.

56
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,020
Yes, yes.

57
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,580
How did you get so drunk? Where is Su Juan?

58
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,040
Leave me alone.

59
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,660
Come on, I'll take you home.

60
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,020
You don't have to care about what those people think.

61
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,000
Folks like them watch others' every move

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,420
and make fun of other people's matters.

63
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,500
They are right. I am desperate.

64
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,700
There is no Cupid in this world.

65
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:35,008
You see,

66
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:40,960
the king stared at Adeline's statue all his life with no response.

67
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,560
But if he just gazes away and looks around,

68
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,960
he will find someone better.

69
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,580
What is your relationship with Qiao Jing?

70
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,320
She is my junior.

71
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,520
That's an expensive necklace for a junior.

72
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,420
I bought that for you.

73
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,940
I know the Gu Family wants to unite with our family through marriage.

74
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,160
But I don't want to get involved in your power struggle,

75
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,620
and I already like someone.

76
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,060
I really planned to buy it for you as an apology.

77
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,560
I didn't tell you my real name at the resort.

78
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,348
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:42,632
It's okay. I didn't tell you my real name, either.

80
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,520
Then let's call it even.

81
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,960
Mr. Su.

82
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,260
As you say, Miss Bai.

83
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,880
You're back.

84
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,780
I'm back.

85
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,600
Gu Yi.

86
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:38,610
♫  Gazing at the flowers you gave me  ♫

87
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:45,180
♫  Quietly placed in the corner  ♫

88
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,350
♫  Softly humming the songs you sang  ♫

89
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:59,360
♫  The melody still continues  ♫

90
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,270
♫  The hand of time points to the end  ♫

91
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:12,840
♫  But you no longer hold my hand  ♫

92
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:23,150
♫  Then let it be; forget about turning back  ♫

93
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,130
♫  Tell me why  ♫

94
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:39,990
♫  Tell me personally that you really want to leave  ♫

95
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:47,260
♫  Tell me why  ♫

96
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,740
♫  Baby, I don't want to say goodbye  ♫

97
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,510
Gu Yi.

98
00:09:54,510 --> 00:10:00,320
♫  Tell me why  ♫

99
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,040
Gu Yi.

100
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:14,670
♫  Tell me why  ♫

101
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:21,840
♫  Baby, I don't want to say goodbye  ♫

102
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,324
Hello?

103
00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:07,180
Where did you go last night? Why did you not wait for me?

104
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,460
Did you not take me home last night?

105
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,380
You were gone when I got there.

106
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,580
Did something happen?

107
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,340
Nothing. I probably drank too much and came back on my own.

108
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,320
Just rest up today.

109
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,060
- Bye bye. 
  - Bye bye.

110
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,950

111
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,920
Is this Gu Yi's baby?

112
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,220
The doctor said I am weak,

113
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,880
and my emotions fluctuated a lot lately

114
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,580
so the pregnancy is unstable.

115
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,880
That jerk. What a b*stard!

116
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,980
What is your plan?

117
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,160
Keeping this child isn't good for him or me.

118
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,880
- But… 
 - This is a life, and you can't bear to do that.

119
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,720
Babe,

120
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,280
why is everything that has happened to you so dramatic?

121
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,800
Well, if you don't want to keep the baby,

122
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,180
I'll go with you to the hospital.

123
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,840
If you want to keep the baby, I'll be the godmother,

124
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,780
and we will raise the child together.

125
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,960

126
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,720
What are you looking at?

127
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,808
You're here.

128
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:22,456
I scared you, right?

129
00:14:22,456 --> 00:14:24,320
I brought you some fruit.

130
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,740
I'll wash the fruit. You take a seat.

131
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,844
I'm sorry.

132
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:38,640
I didn't expect Gu Yi to come to the auction that day.

133
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:40,660
It's okay.

134
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,580
We were bound to meet each other somewhere.

135
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,660
He gave the necklace to Bai Yun.

136
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,480
Looks like he still wants to save the marriage.

137
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,800
That is good. They're perfect for each other.

138
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,760
What? It's just a swapping of interests.

139
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,060
They put profit before anything else.

140
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,980
They will do anything once something gets in their way.

141
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,980
You should eat, too. Don't worry about me.

142
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,680
Don't worry, I won't let myself suffer.

143
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,420
People are honest when they're drunk.

144
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,280
Secretary Qiao obviously still cares about you!

145
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,000
- But she and Su Juan… 
 - If she still liked Su Juan, they'd be together long ago.

146
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,080
Now neither of them has made a move;

147
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,700
you stand a better chance.

148
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,200
Right, and she's carrying my baby now.

149
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,500
What? What is going on?

150
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,080
 Miss, where are you going?

151
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,960
 Nurse, how is my girlfriend?

152
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,428
 "Your girlfriend"?

153
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:36,560
 The patient who just left, named Qiao Jing.

154
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,060
 Did you not know your girlfriend is pregnant?

155
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,200
 Take good care of her when you go home.

156
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,640
What do you want to do now?

157
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,480
I'll go find her and explain everything!

158
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,300
Wait! Don't rush it.

159
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,600
She is still angry at you.

160
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,760
What you need to do now is show her your feelings.

161
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,936
"My feelings"?

162
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,960
Are you done with Gret's proposal?

163
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,040
We are working on it. Otherwise, no one wants to work overtime.

164
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,760
Everyone, please make three days available without affecting Gret's project.

165
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,140
Director Gu, do you have a new project for us?

166
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,580
I'm going to propose.

167
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,916
"Propose"?

168
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,000
To Secretary Qiao?

169
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,300
Who else? To you?

170
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,400
Did you not propose once before?

171
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,200
That didn't work out.

172
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,824
Right!

173
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,244
So... I want to give her a real proposal.

174
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:10,864
And I'd like to ask you three to do me a favor on this.

175
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,020
It's just a favor.

176
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,560
Triple bonus.

177
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,420
We will give our all!

178
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,160
I'm doing this just for you, and not for anything else.

179
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,450

180
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,160
 What are you looking at? You're so focused.

181
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,020
A'Juan!

182
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,444
A'Juan?

183
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,180
How are you getting along with Bai Yun recently?

184
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,140
Bai Yun is devoted to Gu Yi.

185
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,360
I don't think I have any chance.

186
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,500
That day at the auction,

187
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,860
with Bai Yun present, you shouldn't have brought Qiao Jing.

188
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,120
Uncle Jiang, don't worry.

189
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,580
Even if I can't get Bai Yun,

190
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,460
I'll never let her have any chance with Gu Yi.

191
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,728
Good.

192
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,100
Director Gu, my plan is to take a female perspective,

193
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,120
which will win Miss Qiao's heart perfectly.

194
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,160
For the location, we will consider mysterious, romantic European castles.

195
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,120
Director Gu will ride in on a white horse.

196
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,800
We will use drones to display the proposal question.

197
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,640
The engagement ring will be delivered in a hot air balloon.

198
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,420
Lastly, it will end with a big fireworks show!

199
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,360
That costs too much!

200
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,360
What I mentioned are some of the most popular current proposal methods.

201
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,080
My plan brings them together.

202
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,040
Director Gu, it's okay to spend some money, right?

203
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,560
What a mess. My turn!

204
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,880
To give Director Gu the most accurate proposal plan,

205
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,580
I took an opposite approach

206
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,360
and conducted a wide range of social surveys

207
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,540
to know the most annoying proposals for women today

208
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,040
so you can avoid them.

209
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,380
The first is to fancifully propose in public.

210
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,520
A man makes a surprise proposal in public

211
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,780
and encourages the surrounding crowd to cheer,

212
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,260
making the woman embarrassed.

213
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,380
The second is a moral kidnapping proposal.

214
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,780
A man secretly gets friends and families to be present

215
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,760
and makes a surprise proposal.

216
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,080
If the woman doesn't accept, the man will express his love sincerely

217
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,680
to move everyone emotionally to achieve the goal.

218
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,080
And the third is the pestering proposal.

219
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,100
I think it's the most shameless way.

220
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
The man proposes to the woman,

221
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,280
and if she doesn't accept, he won't let her go.

222
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,860
Of these, I think the most critical reason for failure

223
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,240
is if the relationship is not ready yet,

224
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,680
and one side proposes suddenly, then it's bound to fail.

225
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,760
But Secretary Qiao and Director Gu just had a fight recently.

226
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,440
Director Gu, I wasn't implying anything.

227
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,160
My proposal to Qiao Jing is not to force her to accept me,

228
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,780
but to show her my love, determination and responsibility I should bear.

229
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,060
Exactly. No matter if she accepts or not, you have to do it.

230
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,120
Director Gu, now this is my plan.

231
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,260
My plan is simple and pure, without any fancy stuff.

232
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,280
It's focused on the heart of the one proposing.

233
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,680
Hi, Miss. How far along is your pregnancy?

234
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,320
About a month.

235
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,440
We generally recommend taking folic acid three months before pregnancy until three months after pregnancy.

236
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,420
Folic acid is an indispensable nutrient for pregnant women,

237
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,580
which can prevent congenital heart disease and developmental malformations in babies.

238
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,212
Do you…

239
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:29,140
Miss? Miss!

240
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,300
Do you think you need it?

241
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,244
- Check out, please. 
 - All right.

242
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:51,084
The necklace is here.

243
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:52,860
Who wants his stuff?

244
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,980
Why don't you try it on?

245
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,020
It suits you well.

246
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,164

247
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,320
Miss Bai, this way, please.

248
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,880
Sorry for the wait.

249
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,480
It's worth waiting as long as you're here.

250
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,120
The necklace really suits you well.

251
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,770
If I'd known, I would have competed with Gu Yi.

252
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,200
How do you know I'd wear it if you gave it to me?

253
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,960
You really do love Gu Yi.

254
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,620
But as a friend,

255
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,840
I advise you to give up.

256
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,420
Did you ask me out just to tell me this?

257
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm saying this for your own benefit.

258
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,200
I've heard enough of this.

259
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,140
Qiao Jing is pregnant.

260
00:24:23,432 --> 00:24:24,956
It's Gu Yi's.

261
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,300
Those two already have a baby

262
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,060
so you two can't be together.

263
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,440
I want this to be bigger.

264
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,840
Is this okay?

265
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,680
This is nice.

266
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,160
Director Gu, here is your coffee.

267
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,748
Thank you.

268
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,120
Are you designing the ring yourself, Director Gu?

269
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,940
I want to do every part of this proposal myself.

270
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,464
How is it?

271
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,080
It's unique!

272
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,260
Secretary Qiao will surely like it.

273
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,500
I think so, too.

274
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,320
 Qiao Jing is pregnant.

275
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,380
 It's Gu Yi's.

276
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,900
 Those two already have a baby

277
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,660
 so you two can't be together.

278
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:42,432

279
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,660
Clear your schedule for Xiao Yun's concert.

280
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,440
You called me to the auction last time for Bai Yun also, right?

281
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,240
Mom, it's over between me and her.

282
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,800
Do you know how many people are watching you now?

283
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,520
And how many people are waiting to see you be pulled down by Su Juan?

284
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,600
As long as you please Bai Yun—

285
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,040
Mom, I don't want to rely on the Bai Family.

286
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,400
Even if you don't rely on them,

287
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,640
you can't stress the relationship of the two families either!

288
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,960
Otherwise, Su Juan will take advantage of it.

289
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:23,120
Besides, Xiao Yun is a little sister you grew up with.

290
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,840
No matter what, you should go to her concert.

291
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,020
Here is our work schedule for the Gret Project.

292
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,020

293
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,360
The first is the positioning of the project.

294
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,860
Then it's moving ahead to execute the plan.

295
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,580
Is it possible to knit a hat?

296
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,920
Mine seems similar to yours.

297
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,780
I give up! This is too difficult.

298
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,420
Baby, your godmother tried her best.

299
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,040
I'll buy you a ready-made one when you get out.

300
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,520
When are you planning to tell your mom about this?

301
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,100
Maybe later.

302
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,180
The doctor said it isn't stable yet.

303
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,420
What about Senior Su? Does he know?

304
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,480
If he knew, how upset would he be?

305
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,180
Let me think about how to tell him.

306
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,640
- Leave me alone. 
 - You're already drunk!

307
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,612
Leave me alone!

308
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,240
While you're here feeling sad, he is already preparing for a proposal.

309
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,280
"Proposal"?

310
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,980
Gu Yi will propose to Qiao Jing in a few days.

311
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,480
Everyone in the company is helping.

312
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,120
Why does Qiao Jing have

313
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,280
what I don't have?

314
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,300
I have to tell Auntie Fang.

315
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,780
She will never agree to their marriage!

316
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,428
It won't work.

317
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,100
Fang Pei doesn't accept Qiao Jing,

318
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,660
but she will accept the Gu Family's grandchild.

319
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,080
What am I supposed to do?

320
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,160
Should I just watch them get married?

321
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,432
No.

322
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,540
I can't accept it.

323
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,220
Director Gu, the ring is here.

324
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,480
 She will certainly love it.

325
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:59,990

326
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,160
 "The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

327
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:08,272
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:35,340
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

332
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,906
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

333
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:47,245
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

334
00:31:47,245 --> 00:31:53,100
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

335
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,895
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

336
00:31:56,895 --> 00:32:00,499
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

337
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:06,475
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

338
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:12,932
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

339
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:18,626
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

340
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:22,508
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

341
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:26,090
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

342
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,534
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

343
00:32:29,534 --> 00:32:36,686
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

344
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:39,773
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

345
00:32:39,773 --> 00:32:44,880
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

346
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,291
♫  This unbearable plot  ♫

347
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:57,588
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫

348
00:32:57,588 --> 00:33:03,651
♫  Being a guest may be my other destiny  ♫

349
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:10,816
♫  As the one who left, what gives me the right to care?  ♫

350
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:17,020
♫  After all, you're the one who finally got married, and I'm just a guest  ♫

351
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:23,210
♫  I drained all the memories to celebrate your wedding  ♫

352
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:29,044
♫  But I never had the courage to bless you  ♫

353
00:33:29,044 --> 00:33:39,644
♫  Thank you for making me finally aware and returning me back to myself  ♫

354
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:50,100
♫  At least I can still be a guest to witness your love  ♫

355
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,056
♫  He's so lucky to have met you  ♫

356
00:33:54,056 --> 00:34:04,138
♫  I hope he loves you more than I do  ♫
