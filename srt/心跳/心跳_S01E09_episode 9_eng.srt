1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:10,060

2
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:45,466

3
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:48,160

4
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,520
What did my dad say to you today?

5
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,300
He told me you're not good to me,

6
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,640
and he asked me to leave you promptly.

7
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,160
So what did you think about that?

8
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,460
It's true you didn't treat me well,

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,100
but I've also made my mistakes.

10
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,940
So we have no right to blame each other.

11
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,300
I did indeed treat you badly before, but I won't treat you like that again.

12
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,500
I won't hurt you or disenchant you again.

13
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,800
Can you give me another chance?

14
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,540
Okay?

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,434
All right.

16
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,380
That one-year agreement is void.

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,340
I want to be with you for a lifetime.

18
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,140
Let's give it a try... for a lifetime.

19
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,140
I will never regret it.

20
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:21,870
♫  Gazing at the flowers you gave me  ♫

21
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,368
♫  Quietly placed in the corner  ♫

22
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:35,483
♫  Softly humming the songs you sang  ♫

23
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:41,851
♫  The melody still continues  ♫

24
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:49,446
♫  The hand of time points to the end  ♫

25
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:56,226
♫  But you no longer hold my hand  ♫

26
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:59,925
♫  Then let it be  ♫

27
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:07,042
♫  Forget about turning back  ♫

28
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:16,154
♫  Tell me why  ♫

29
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:22,980
♫  Tell me personally that you really want to leave  ♫

30
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:30,430
♫  Tell me why  ♫

31
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:37,582
♫  Baby, I don't want to say goodbye  ♫

32
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:52,892
Why are you awake early?

33
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:55,172
Go back to bed. You still have a slight fever.

34
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:58,332
I'm making you porridge. Take your medicine after eating.

35
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:03,852
It's okay. I won't die.

36
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,158
You have a call.

37
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:17,752
- Hello? 
 -  Bro, I have some news.

38
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:26,632
I was searching for Li Chang Lin for a long time but found nothing.

39
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:30,412
So I changed my approach.

40
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:35,192
Then I found that Li Chang Lin is not that simple.

41
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:39,992
This Li Chang Lin's name is fake; his real name is Yao Shun De.

42
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:43,252
No wonder I couldn't find anything while searching for him.

43
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:45,392
"Yao Shun De"?

44
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:48,832
What? Is his name familiar?

45
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:56,172
It's true. Maybe your memory has an impression from before the accident. You might find some clues there.

46
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:05,032
It's okay, take your time.

47
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:09,132
There's no rush.

48
00:05:12,452 --> 00:05:14,772
Although I found his real identity,

49
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,492
Yao Shun De's file has been wiped clean.

50
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:19,472
I can't find anything.

51
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:21,952
If you remember anything, let me know.

52
00:05:21,952 --> 00:05:23,572
I'm going now.

53
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:27,686
Wait a minute. Take me home.

54
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:37,802
What are you searching for high and low?

55
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:54,270
I found it.

56
00:05:55,486 --> 00:05:58,638
Yao Shun De was my dad's personal assistant.

57
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:07,728
Yao Shun De rarely appeared in public.

58
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:09,628
That photo is one of the few left.

59
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:12,128
Two weeks ago, he died from an illness. He had no children.

60
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:16,008
The house is being cared for by distant relatives. Nothing in it was touched.

61
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,758
This is the one.

62
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:22,590
Right here.

63
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,442
Let's go.

64
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:41,488
All remains as he left it.

65
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:45,508
I've gotten permission from his family to look around.

66
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,968
Let's search carefully. Maybe we can find something new.

67
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:49,498
Okay.

68
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:37,730

69
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:45,348

70
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:50,508
 Gu Yi.

71
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:53,730
Did you find something?

72
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,168
Nothing. What about you?

73
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:59,308
Have you searched the bookshelf?

74
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:01,114
I'm doing that right now.

75
00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:09,308
Why do you insist on learning about the accident?

76
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:17,534
Four years ago, Su Juan suddenly told me he was going to Mount Xilin.

77
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:19,868
That's when he had the accident.

78
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:25,548
When I got to the hospital, I couldn't even see his body.

79
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:31,458
Later, when I was in the doctor's office,

80
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:36,188
I saw his medical certificate and the heart transplant report.

81
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:41,748
He donated his heart, but why did the body disappear?

82
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:45,788
Something is strange about that accident.

83
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:50,690
He deserves the truth, and I need an answer, too.

84
00:09:00,988 --> 00:09:04,768
We didn't find any clues today. Are you disappointed?

85
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:07,988
Of course not. I've been seeking clues for so long.

86
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:11,608
With your help, there's a breakthrough; I'm happy with that.

87
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:14,928
I'll go upstairs and change. Take the medicine on the table.

88
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:16,574
Okay.

89
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,528

90
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:42,548

91
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,386
 Su Juan?

92
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:58,948
 Where did that b*stard come from?

93
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:29,948
 Hello, Ma'am. Don't worry.

94
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:32,788
 I won't let him meet Chairman Gu.

95
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:56,388
What's wrong? Where does it hurt?

96
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:58,708
Have you a headache? Let me massage you.

97
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,288
Okay.

98
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:17,028
Do you feel any better?

99
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:23,388
You said you want to get justice for Su Juan.

100
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:29,328
But what would you do if the truth shows that the Gu family is involved?

101
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:33,128
Have you remembered something?

102
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:36,388
No.

103
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:38,448
But Yao Shun De was my dad's man.

104
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,308
I worry this might involve the Gu family.

105
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:46,448
Nothing was determined yet; don't overthink it.

106
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:49,108
Besides, you aren't the one involved.

107
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,768
I won't blame you for what others have done.

108
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:54,362
- Really? 
 - Yes.

109
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:57,348
Since we've decided to start over,

110
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,188
we should be honest with each other.

111
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:03,028
As long as you don't lie to me, I'll be there for you.

112
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,240

113
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,750

114
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,380
 But Yao Shun De was my dad's man.

115
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:42,548
 I worry this might involve the Gu family.

116
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,042

117
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,796

118
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,780

119
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,890

120
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,980

121
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:55,986
Go on.

122
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:05,588
I just want to hold you forever and not go anywhere.

123
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:06,988
You still have to work.

124
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:09,988
Many office issues need your attention.

125
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:18,448
Then I'm responsible to make money.

126
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:22,028
You're responsible for being beautiful.

127
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,234
- Go on. 
 - I'm leaving.

128
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:03,148
In that case, Fang Pei must be involved with it.

129
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:06,788
What are you planning to do?

130
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:09,248
Although this has nothing to do with Gu Yi,

131
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,408
it does relate to his parents.

132
00:16:11,408 --> 00:16:14,968
I fear if I dig too deep, it will hurt Gu Yi.

133
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:18,088
Will you give up the truth for Gu Yi's sake?

134
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:23,766
No. I'll tell him what I've discovered.

135
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:27,388
No matter the truth, I want to face it with him.

136
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:30,568
You've investigated for so many years; you shouldn't give up.

137
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:36,710
Before, Gu Yi and I went through so many lies.

138
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,748
This time, I'll face everything with him.

139
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:44,468
I didn't suspend your job and credit cards just to anger you.

140
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:47,608
But you became a hands-off manager.

141
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:50,348
Haven't I returned now?

142
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:54,928
Were you at the hospital recently for a followup checkup?

143
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:58,768
- Your memories after the accident… 
 - I've recalled everything.

144
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:03,888
No wonder you began investigating Yao Shun De.

145
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:09,348
Regardless of what you've learned, stop probing this matter now.

146
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:13,188
Mom, was it you who asked Yao Shun De

147
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:15,968
to stop Su Juan from seeing my father?

148
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,928
So what?

149
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:20,908
Who was I doing all that for?

150
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:23,308
Should I sit and watch that illegitimate child return

151
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,848
and take the family estate from you?

152
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:29,528
There are many ways to stop him from coming back.

153
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,708
Why did you have to be so cruel?

154
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,428
I wasn't!

155
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,088
I just didn't want him to see your dad.

156
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,268
I never thought it would end like this!

157
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:43,328
Things have already come this far.

158
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,368
Whatever you say now is useless.

159
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:48,948
So what will you do now?

160
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:51,608
Will you uncover everything?

161
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:54,688
Are you trying to torment me to death?

162
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:57,068
It's you who's forcing me!

163
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:03,388
Here are all the messages between you and Yao Shun De.

164
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:07,128
How did you get this?

165
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:13,878
Qiao Jing.

166
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,662
Qiao Jing!

167
00:18:17,188 --> 00:18:19,108
Qiao Jing, it's not what you think.

168
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:21,528
Listen, let me explain!

169
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:24,214
Qiao Jing!

170
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:27,028
Qiao Jing, listen to me.

171
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:29,408
What do you want to say?

172
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:33,548
Will you tell me you hid that phone from me all this time?

173
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:36,948
Or will you tell me you led me around like a fool

174
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:38,568
and covered for your mom?

175
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:40,628
No, I just...

176
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:44,368
Gu Yi, what did you promise me?

177
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:47,048
You said you wouldn't lie to me anymore.

178
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:50,928
I really am stupid.

179
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:55,788
How could someone like you possibly change for me?

180
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:00,188
Everything is fake.

181
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:06,228
No matter what you say, your eyes...

182
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:10,168
all you've done... It's not real.

183
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:13,148
No, it's real. Qiao Jing,

184
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:16,128
didn't you say we'd be together a lifetime?

185
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:18,788
N-No, don't leave me. Don't go back on your word.

186
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:22,168
I'm disgusted that you traded lies for a life!

187
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:51,260

188
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,050
  Mom,

189
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,428
  who is this man?

190
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,128
  That's your dad.

191
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:47,968
  Back then, I was with him.

192
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:51,040
  I thought I'd found my life partner.

193
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:56,848
  I didn't expect he'd end up marrying someone else.

194
00:20:58,348 --> 00:21:03,788
  After we broke up, I found out I was pregnant.

195
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:09,288
  I didn't want to bother him anymore.

196
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:13,048
  So I didn't tell him.

197
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:47,610
 My mom urgently needs money for surgery.

198
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:51,868
  Maybe this father could lend me some money.

199
00:21:53,868 --> 00:21:56,288
  Your DNA report has already been given to Chairman Gu.

200
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:59,228
  You can just go in when you get there.

201
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:41,008
  Xiao Juan. Xiao Juan!

202
00:22:47,228 --> 00:22:49,128
  Uncle Jiang.

203
00:22:50,348 --> 00:22:52,128
  What are you doing here?

204
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:54,988
 You had a car accident on Mount Xiling.

205
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:58,368
  I rushed over as soon as I got the news.

206
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,508
  What day is it now?

207
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,408
  You've been in a coma for almost a month.

208
00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:09,588
  You occasionally woke up,

209
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:13,748
  but you were never very coherent.

210
00:23:13,748 --> 00:23:16,428
  Take it easy. Easy.

211
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,688
  What about my mom? How is she?

212
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:30,528
 Her surgery was on the fifteenth. I must go to her.

213
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:32,748
  Xiao Juan! Xiao Juan.

214
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:35,568
  Xiao Juan, are you okay?

215
00:23:35,568 --> 00:23:38,488
 I have to go find my mom. I need to find her!

216
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:40,588
  Listen to me.

217
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,488
  Your mom…

218
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:46,868
  has passed away.

219
00:23:50,286 --> 00:23:51,728
  That's impossible.

220
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:53,308
  They finally found a kidney for her.

221
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,628
 If we have money, she can be saved!

222
00:23:54,628 --> 00:23:55,908
 I need to find my mom!

223
00:23:55,908 --> 00:23:58,248
 She's already dead!

224
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,908
  Before your mom passed away,

225
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:13,788
 you were the one she worried most about.

226
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:19,708
  So now, you must take good care of yourself.

227
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,388
 Then she can rest in peace now.

228
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:24,228
  Do you understand?

229
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:44,148
  I'm to blame.

230
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:47,568
 It's my fault.

231
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:49,328
  It's all my fault.

232
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:51,848
 Don't blame yourself.

233
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:57,568
 That car collision wasn't an accident.

234
00:24:57,568 --> 00:25:00,048
 So you heal and strengthen yourself.

235
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:05,608
 After you recover, you must get justice for your mom.

236
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:49,618
 - How is recovery going? 
 - Not bad.

237
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:51,322
 Take care and rest up.

238
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:18,048
  Dad.

239
00:27:35,228 --> 00:27:40,348
  Father and son... are finally meeting.

240
00:27:51,842 --> 00:27:54,248
 I'm sorry I wasn't there for you two.

241
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:01,408
 You've been through a lot all these years due to me.

242
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:07,440
 It's okay, Dad.

243
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:10,108
  I understand you.

244
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:12,048
  But don't worry.

245
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,094
  From now on, no one will dare treat you badly.

246
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:28,010
That's what happened to me over the last few years.

247
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,708
I originally planned to borrow money from Gu Nan

248
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:33,808
for my mom's surgery.

249
00:28:34,828 --> 00:28:37,528
I didn't expect something like this to happen.

250
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:44,748
After the accident, I feared Fang Pei would find me;

251
00:28:44,748 --> 00:28:46,928
I didn't dare show up.

252
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:53,328
It wasn't until I met Gu Nan that this nightmare ended.

253
00:28:58,148 --> 00:29:01,968
I'm sorry. I didn't handle this well.

254
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:04,848
I-I should have contacted you earlier.

255
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:08,928
It doesn't matter.

256
00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:13,348
As long as you returned safely, nothing else matters.

257
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:29,008
You escaped death...

258
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:33,268
so whose heart does Gu Yi have?

259
00:29:33,268 --> 00:29:35,968
I always thought my heart was from Su Juan.

260
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:37,528
But he didn't die.

261
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:40,968
During your junior year in college, you were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart).

262
00:29:40,968 --> 00:29:43,528
I was looking for a heart donor ever since.

263
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:47,022
Based on urgency rating, you were on a wait list a long time,

264
00:29:47,022 --> 00:29:49,008
and a suitable donor was never found.

265
00:29:49,008 --> 00:29:51,848
But after the car accident, your need became urgent.

266
00:29:51,848 --> 00:29:56,048
When you were about to die, the hospital found you a suitable heart.

267
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:57,848
Thus you were saved.

268
00:29:57,848 --> 00:30:02,888
But I don't know who the donor was.

269
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:07,068
- So my heart had nothing to do with Su Juan? 
 - Nothing.

270
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:53,248
Where are you?

271
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:55,548
Why aren't you home yet?

272
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:57,728
 It's none of your business where I am.

273
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,088
I'm waiting for you at home.

274
00:31:03,088 --> 00:31:05,514
I need to talk to you.

275
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:07,348
 There's nothing to discuss.

276
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:09,928
 Pack your things and leave my home.

277
00:31:09,928 --> 00:31:12,968
I know you're angry at me, but we—

278
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:31,120

279
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:35,488
