1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:09,890

2
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:45,596

3
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:48,456

4
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm so tired.

5
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,560
Why not just let the workers handle these tasks?

6
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,040
How exhausting to oversee it yourself.

7
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,520
Personal involvement makes it meaningful.

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,000
Fine, you're a huge romantic, and we are huge complainers.

9
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,840
You‘re a womanizer. You wouldn't understand love.

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,528
Get to work!

11
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,280
 Get to work.

12
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,528

13
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's done!

14
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,110
Hooray!

15
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:08,880
Hello.

16
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,500
It's me. Don't hang up!

17
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,340
 I have something to say.

18
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,120
Do you still recall your promise on the night you were drunk at the auction?

19
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,400
What was it?

20
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,920
If you want to know, come to the square where we sold flowers.

21
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,260
So what did she promise you that night?

22
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,980
She promised nothing.

23
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,060
I made it up on the spot to get her to come.

24
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,620
Director Gu, will Secretary Qiao come?

25
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,740
Should I arrange a car to pick her up?

26
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,960
She will come.

27
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,860
She will definitely come.

28
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,060
Hello, Secretary Qiao. Director Gu asked me to pick you up.

29
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Secretary Qiao, Director Gu is waiting for you up there.

30
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Why is it you? Where is Gu Yi?

31
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,460
You won't see him today.

32
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,908
How does it feel?

33
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:11,780
Are you delighted seeing him do so much for you?

34
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,840
Does it feel good to have him under your control?

35
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,100
It's none of your business.

36
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,640
How is it none of my business?

37
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,480
If not for you, we would have married already!

38
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,940
He doesn't love you.

39
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,320
Even if it wasn't me, it would be someone else.

40
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,780
Can you get whatever you want and have no fear due to that baby?

41
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,720
Do you think you can marry into the Gu family because of the baby?

42
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,380
This baby is a stain on Gu Yi's reputation.

43
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,060
The Gu family won't recognize him; they won't even let him be born.

44
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,420
Come back here! Stop right there!

45
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,560
Stop right there!

46
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,396
Let me go!

47
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,860
Should I call an ambulance?

48
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,140
Let's leave. Let's run! Let's go.

49
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:25,920
 Hello, Qiao Jing. Hello.

50
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:27,760
 Qiao Jing?

51
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,680
 Qiao Jing, what's wrong?

52
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
What happened? Did you get through?

53
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,980
Her phone is turned off.

54
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,760
Director Gu, I went to look for her, but she isn't at home.

55
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:16,780

56
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,260
Xiao Yun, how come you had time to visit me today?

57
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,112
Auntie.

58
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,940
Xiao Yun, you… What's wrong?

59
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,940
Mrs. Gu, you must help our Xiao Yun.

60
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,460
Babe, you're finally awake.

61
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,404
What about the baby? How is the baby?

62
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,600
Don't tell my parents about this yet,

63
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,440
or they'll worry.

64
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,096
Understood.

65
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:14,700
Don't hold everything in.

66
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,600
Don't keep things to yourself. Cry if you want to.

67
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,540
I'm here for you.

68
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,200
Don't worry.

69
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,060
I'm fine.

70
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:33,056
This child and I...

71
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,000
weren't destined to be together.

72
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,784
Jiang Ling, help me go charge my phone.

73
00:10:56,784 --> 00:10:59,300
But you just woke up.

74
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,136
I'm okay.

75
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,460
Mrs. Gu just wants to say a few words to me.

76
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,040
Excuse me, do you have a charger?

77
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,020
Yes, just a moment, please.

78
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:28,400
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

79
00:11:36,065 --> 00:11:37,860

80
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,860
Hello?

81
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,880
Mrs. Gu, are you here to confirm whether the baby is still alive?

82
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,180
Don't worry, as you all wished...

83
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,880
he's already gone.

84
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,980
This baby was an accident to begin with.

85
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,480
He would be illegitimate even if you gave birth to him.

86
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,140
This result... is perhaps the best one.

87
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,920
You couldn't have used the child to marry into the Gu family.

88
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,700
In your eyes, was this baby just a tool to enter the Gu family?

89
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,860
Wasn't that your plan?

90
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,100
He was my child.

91
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,300
I never thought to use him.

92
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,700
Moreover, I don't care about your Gu family.

93
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,200
No matter what,

94
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
you've suffered.

95
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,980
This is to make it up to you.

96
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:02,516
Get lost.

97
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,760
Okay, pick the models first. I'll choose the plan when I return.

98
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,480
Handle it yourselves for now.

99
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,400
Jiang Ling.

100
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,392
Senior.

101
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm hanging up now. Let's talk later.

102
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,520
Her condition is very weak, but she insists she is fine.

103
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,580
I had no choice but to call you over.

104
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,820
Don't blame her.

105
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,630
She wasn't trying to keep this from you;

106
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,300
she just didn't know how to tell you.

107
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,704
I understand.

108
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,032
I don't blame her.

109
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,180
I only blame myself for not taking care of her and letting her get hurt again.

110
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,040
Spend some quality time with her.

111
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,560
Thank you for calling me.

112
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,660
I'll take care of the rest.

113
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,140
What are you looking at? You're so immersed.

114
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,080
Why are you here?

115
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,460
Jiang Ling called me.

116
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,300
She was quite anxious.

117
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,720
What exactly happened?

118
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,120
You were right.

119
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,200
These people value profit above anything else.

120
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,180
As soon as something gets in their way...

121
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,820
they'll do anything.

122
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,376
My child was a stain on Gu Yi's reputation,

123
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:07,380
which blocked the Gu family climbing higher.

124
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,800
I should leave.

125
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,660
If I had left South City...

126
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,500
none of this would have happened.

127
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,440
It isn't your fault.

128
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,040
- Which room is Qiao Jing in? 
 - The one in the front.

129
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,460
Su Juan!

130
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,380
- Gu Yi, are you crazy? 
 - Am I crazy?

131
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,020
The baby is gone. What are you doing here?

132
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,800
I think you're the one who's crazy!

133
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,508
What does it…

134
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,180
What does it matter to you what I do?

135
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,100
The baby is gone. Isn't that what the Gu family wanted?

136
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,000
I guess that's what you d*mned couple wanted!

137
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,360
Watch your mouth!

138
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,900
Are you fine after this happened?

139
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,580
I'm tired.

140
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,260
Then I'll wait for you outside.

141
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,200
If you need anything, just call me.

142
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,416
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

143
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:23,802
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

144
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:29,120
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

145
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,775
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

146
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:43,447
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

147
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:49,084
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

148
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:55,362
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

149
00:17:55,362 --> 00:18:01,220
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

150
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,956
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

151
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:08,636
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

152
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:14,656
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

153
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:21,252
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

154
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,060
 Were you the one who hurt Qiao Jing?

155
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

156
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,720
 You committed a crime.

157
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,330
If you didn't want me to do this,

158
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,420
you wouldn't have told me in the first place what was happening between them!

159
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,640
Don't contact me again!

160
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,760
I know you're sad,

161
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,840
and it hurts me, too.

162
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,860
That was your baby.

163
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,580
I feel bad about it, too.

164
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,980
But this baby... came at a wrong time.

165
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,264
Mom...

166
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,100
that was my baby.

167
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,340
I never even saw him.

168
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,760
I-I never even saw him once...

169
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,320
and he vanished.

170
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,200
I planned to propose to Qiao Jing.

171
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,140
I wanted to try to be a good husband...

172
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,612
and a decent father.

173
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,552
Could…

174
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:13,312
But…

175
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,980
But Mom...

176
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,860
no one is giving me this chance.

177
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:33,030
♫  Arms crossed on my chest; tears can't stop flowing  ♫

178
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,460
You just don't have that destiny.

179
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:48,240
♫  Now gaze at the blocked road in the distance; where should I go?  ♫

180
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,680
My heart hurts so much.

181
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,720
♫  The withered flower  ♫

182
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,830
♫  Finally falls at the frozen moment  ♫

183
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:04,380
♫  I still remember  ♫

184
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,360
 Auntie,

185
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,980
 I really love Gu Yi so much.

186
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,200
 I heard he's getting engaged to Qiao Jing.

187
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,740
 My heart hurts so much.

188
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:38,200
 Xiao Yun originally just wanted to talk to Qiao Jing, hoping she would leave Director Gu.

189
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,400
 But Qiao Jing refused.

190
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,500
 So Xiao Yun argued with her and accidentally pushed her.

191
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,940
 But we didn't expect she was pregnant.

192
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,200
 Qiao Jing was pregnant?

193
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,660
 So do you mean... the baby is gone?

194
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,908
 - I'm sorry, Auntie. 
 - Sorry, Mrs. Fang.

195
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:07,840
 We really didn't know she was pregnant!

196
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,360
 Xiao Yun didn't do it on purpose.

197
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,540
 She just loves Director Gu so much that…

198
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,648
 I'm sorry, Auntie.

199
00:24:13,648 --> 00:24:15,960
 - I'm so sorry. 
 - We are sorry to the Gu family.

200
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,900
 I'm so sorry, Auntie.

201
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,880
 All right, I understand.

202
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,320
 You go back and rest.

203
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,000
 I'll handle this.

204
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,720
Blood! Blood!

205
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Xiao Yun, what's wrong?

206
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,740
Blood! Blood!

207
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,620
Xiao Yun, there's no blood, look.

208
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,280
It's just regular water. Look.

209
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,780
Don't scare yourself, Xiao Yun. Okay?

210
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,740
Maybe I wasn't supposed to do that.

211
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,580
Calm down.

212
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,420
Calm down, okay?

213
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,100
Were you going to just watch Qiao Jing marry into the Gu family?

214
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,740
Good Girl.

215
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,720
Don't be afraid, okay?

216
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,880
Don't be afraid. Be good.

217
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,068
Don't be afraid.

218
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,000
Maybe I'll stay with you. I can cook for you.

219
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,220
You're so busy with work. Don't let me hold you back.

220
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,680
I'm free these days. I'll stay and take care of you.

221
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,980
I wish to be alone.

222
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,840
It's all right. The doctor said I'm fine.

223
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,240
Don't worry too much about me. Rest assured.

224
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,820
Xiao Yun, the concert is coming soon.

225
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,640
How's the preparation going?

226
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,100
Unfortunately, I have other things to do that day so I can't be there.

227
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,380
It's okay. There will be plenty of opportunities in the future.

228
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,000
I promise I won't be absent next time.

229
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,580
Well, continue practicing. I'm leaving.

230
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,220
You haven't had a good appetite lately. Have some juice.

231
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,080
How's the preparation for Gret's project?

232
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,060
Your dad is asking you about the project.

233
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,760
All the necessary preparations are ready.

234
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,080
You're so listless. What's wrong with you?

235
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:29,588
All right, it's rare that we have a meal together.

236
00:29:29,588 --> 00:29:31,620
Stop it.

237
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,980
You love fish so eat more.

238
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,040
Dad, Auntie Fang.

239
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,540
A'Juan, take a seat.

240
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,080
Why is he here for a family dinner?

241
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,240
He's here precisely because it's a family dinner.

242
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,144
Go get a bowl and chopsticks!

243
00:29:58,724 --> 00:30:00,780
Why did you come so late?

244
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,580
I had work to do at the company so I came late.

245
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,480
You're not looking so good lately, Little Brother.

246
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,420
Do you feel sick?

247
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,580
Dad, Mom, I'm full.

248
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,600
You guys take your time.

249
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,580
What's wrong with him?

250
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,300
Look at that horrible temper!

251
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,400
He's been in a bad mood lately.

252
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,340
What's wrong this time?

253
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,240
Let's eat.

254
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,440
Come on, eat.

255
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,200
I learned a few new soup recipes for postpartum nourishment and energy.

256
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,240
You have to drink it while it's hot.

257
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,760
Postpartum recovery is important.

258
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,700
You can't catch a cold or get sick during these days.

259
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,200
What exactly happened that day?

260
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,700
It was Bai Yun.

261
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,960
Her? She's too bold!

262
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,020
She looks so innocent. How could she do such a thing?

263
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,140
We must expose her real self.

264
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,220
Don't worry, I'll help you.

265
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,420
How dare she still calmly hold a concert?

266
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,880
So arrogant!

267
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,120
"A concert"?

268
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,420
Yes, it's tomorrow.

269
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:56,480

270
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,470
"The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

271
00:32:01,474 --> 00:32:05,576
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

272
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:13,120
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

287
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:34,198
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

288
00:33:34,198 --> 00:33:37,285
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

289
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:42,092
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

290
00:33:42,092 --> 00:33:48,403

♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫
