1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:09,990

2
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:45,557

3
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:48,168

4
00:01:55,675 --> 00:02:00,455
 At noon, let's eat the lunch together I personally made.

5
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:13,755
 In the afternoon, let's go to the amusement park together.

6
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,095
Are you scared?

7
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:32,635
Then you can hold on to me.

8
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:58,459
♫  How many winters have passed after our breakup?  ♫

9
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:01,565
♫  What day is it today?  ♫

10
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:05,353
♫  I occasionally think of you  ♫

11
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:14,518
♫  Your sudden text message catches me off guard  ♫

12
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:18,394
♫  Standing frozen in place  ♫

13
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:25,660
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

14
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,169
♫  Someone has already custom-made a wedding dress for you  ♫

15
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:37,401
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

16
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:43,257
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

17
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:50,601
♫  Holding the wedding invitation and approaching step by step  ♫

18
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:56,745
♫  A pity this scenery belongs to you only; I am just a guest  ♫

19
00:03:56,745 --> 00:03:59,915
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

20
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:01,715
Why are you following me?

21
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:05,415
Because I saw the date list you put on the back of Su Juan's photo frame.

22
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:10,675
Four years ago today was when you planned to confess your love to him.

23
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:16,285
That's right,

24
00:04:18,035 --> 00:04:19,655
but he will never return again.

25
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:23,535
No, he has arrived.

26
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:38,495
Today, Su Juan accompanied you to the library,

27
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:41,135
to have lunch,

28
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:44,455
to play crazily at the amusement park,

29
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:47,895
and to shoot fireworks.

30
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:52,325
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

31
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:55,595
Why?

32
00:04:55,595 --> 00:05:00,635
Because I want to know what it feels like to be deeply loved by you.

33
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:04,765
♫   He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

34
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:11,159
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

35
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,875
You are not him.

36
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:17,528
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

37
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:19,775
But his heart is here.

38
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:23,315
He can accompany you in finishing the unfulfilled wishes from back then.

39
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:30,495
I hope that after tonight, when you wake up tomorrow,

40
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:34,375
you will no longer be the Qiao Jing trapped in the past,

41
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,085
but a brand new you.

42
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:40,605
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

43
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:44,321
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

44
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:50,269
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

45
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:56,649
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

46
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:02,557
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

47
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:06,205
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

48
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:09,821
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

49
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:13,497
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

50
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:18,401
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

51
00:06:50,195 --> 00:06:51,857
Are you awake?

52
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,475
Come on.

53
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:57,475
This is the best I've made so far. You have to try it.

54
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,141
Come on.

55
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:04,435
Director Gu, I don't think eating four eggs for breakfast is healthy.

56
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:07,355
What's wrong with it? Two for you and two for me.

57
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:09,345
Come on. Try it.

58
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:19,581
How is it?

59
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,113
It's good.

60
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:28,555
Do you still think I'm causing trouble for you now?

61
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:30,935
As a grown man, can you stop holding grudges like this?

62
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:33,595
I'm—

63
00:07:33,595 --> 00:07:37,175
I'll go. Sit down. You can't skip a single bite.

64
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:59,015
I haven't seen you in just a few days. How did your cooking get so bad?

65
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:00,635
Who let you eat?

66
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:02,175
Don't be so petty, Director Gu.

67
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:04,675
I was busy all night, and I haven't eaten breakfast.

68
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:08,035
I made this for my… my Qiao Jing.

69
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:13,475
I see. I was wondering why the eggs were shaped like a heart.

70
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:16,895
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

71
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:20,815
What kept you so busy that you couldn't eat?

72
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:24,215
- Quickly save your bankrupt bestie. 
 - What happened?

73
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:28,015
I already sold some of the flowers from the last farm aid while livestreaming.

74
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:31,575
But all who buy flowers know express transport can cause damage

75
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:34,675
so they all want to buy flowers in half-bloom. But I have a batch that already bloomed.

76
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:38,155
If I don't sell those, it's all a waste.

77
00:08:38,155 --> 00:08:39,735
Then you need to sell it now.

78
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:42,055
The longer you delay, the less fresh the flowers get.

79
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:45,415
That's why I came to you.

80
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:48,055
But I don't have much experience.

81
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:51,855
You can even sell houses. What's so hard about selling flowers?

82
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:53,593
Are you able to?

83
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:01,795
I can help you, but you must agree to one request.

84
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:03,035
What request?

85
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:06,055
Director Gu, don't exploit the situation.

86
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:09,495
I'll tell you later. Let's sell the flowers first.

87
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:20,275
- Hello, do you need any fresh flowers? 
 - No, thanks.

88
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:23,115
- Do you need any fresh flowers? 
 - Not needed.

89
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:28,775
I thought Director Gu would have some great ideas, but it was just this.

90
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:31,115
Do you still remember that man who sold sweet potatoes below Anxia?

91
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:33,915
He makes more money than you do.

92
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:37,815
Do you need any fresh flowers?

93
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:40,455
Oh my gosh! Hurry. Our queue number is almost up!

94
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,175
This lakeside restaurant is super hard to queue in!

95
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:45,555
Is it really that delicious?

96
00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:47,653
Director Gu?

97
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:51,615
Director Gu, what are you…

98
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,305
I…

99
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:55,895
Market research.

100
00:09:57,395 --> 00:10:01,533
Secretary Qiao, this flower stall is so cute!

101
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:05,435
We received these from the farmers we aided.

102
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:07,055
The florist's flowers didn't sell well

103
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:11,895
so Director Gu and I are helping them. Everything we sell counts.

104
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:13,993
- Can I take a photo? 
 - Yes.

105
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:17,673
You can take photos, but you can't take them for free.

106
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:21,517
Understood! Understood.

107
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:22,755
Twenty.

108
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,533
So little?

109
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:28,255
I only have twenty in cash, but I can scan the code!

110
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:31,075
You don't need to. Only pay if you really want to buy.

111
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:33,195
We won't force you to buy them.

112
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:36,535
We can't buy too much.

113
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,195
Why don't we help Director Gu and Secretary Qiao sell them?

114
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:40,735
No way.

115
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:43,935
Don't we still have sales targets during the holidays?

116
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,895
Then you should hurry and spend your money. Buy them all!

117
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:49,775
Fine. I'll sell.

118
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,255
Come on, what are you waiting for?

119
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:53,515
Thank you.

120
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:55,655
Here, take it.

121
00:10:57,441 --> 00:11:00,055
Here, this is for you.

122
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:03,635
Do you need any fresh flowers? Do you need any fresh flowers?

123
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:05,995
It's getting dark. They can't even see the color of the flowers clearly.

124
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:08,175
No one is interested anymore.

125
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:12,729
Exactly.

126
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:19,975
You've all worked hard.

127
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:22,335
These flowers won't be fresh tomorrow.

128
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:26,215
If we can't sell them, you can split them and take them home.

129
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:28,135
There are so many left.

130
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:30,235
What a pity.

131
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:34,465
Which one do you want? They are ¥10 ($1.50) each.

132
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:37,015
Everyone! Look over here!

133
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:40,135
Everyone, look at me!

134
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:43,175
My girlfriend said that as long as I sell all these flowers,

135
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:45,235
she will agree to marry me!

136
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:46,435
 Really?

137
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:50,335
Secretary Qiao, when did you get to this point?

138
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,635
Gu Yi, what are you doing?

139
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:56,615
My girlfriend said that if I sell all these flowers,

140
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,375
she will agree to marry me!

141
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,315
Bro, that's brave! Give me a bunch!

142
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:04,635
Come on. Here.

143
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:05,715
Come on.

144
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:07,033
Over here, come.

145
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,135
Scan the code.

146
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:10,055
- Is this okay? 
 - I'll take two bunches.

147
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:11,835
Please scan the code.

148
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:14,095
I'll buy one bunch.

149
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:16,955
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

150
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:19,345
Gu Yi, what are you doing?

151
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:21,695
Selling flowers.

152
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:25,115
Come on, scan the code over here.

153
00:12:25,115 --> 00:12:26,315
Here, this is yours, take it.

154
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:27,235
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

155
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:29,135
- Okay. 
 - Five yuan.

156
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:30,575
Ten yuan, scan the code.

157
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:31,695
A bunch of sunflowers, right?

158
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:33,075
This one, okay.

159
00:12:33,075 --> 00:12:35,915
Ten yuan, scan the code over there.

160
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:38,795
Remember to scan the code.

161
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:41,495
Scan it. Come on, over here.

162
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:42,535
Come on, scan it.

163
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:43,575
Bro, your flowers.

164
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:44,895
When are you going to propose?

165
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:46,315
The flowers are all sold out!

166
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:49,255
We are all waiting!

167
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:51,835
 Yes, that's right.

168
00:12:51,835 --> 00:13:00,630
 Propose!

169
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:19,655
 So romantic.

170
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:21,095
Marry him!

171
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:22,775
Yes, say yes.

172
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:26,775
- Say yes! 
 - Say yes!

173
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,335
 Say yes!

174
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:36,961
- He's so dedicated! 
 - Marry him.

175
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,795
Oh my gosh, am I dreaming?

176
00:13:38,795 --> 00:13:41,855
I actually witnessed Director Gu's proposal with my own eyes!

177
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,555
This overtime work was worth it!

178
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:48,300
Qiao Jing, will you marry me?

179
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:50,675
Accept him!

180
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:58,315
 Marry him!

181
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:13,335
She agreed!

182
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,540

183
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:48,975
Director Gu, Secretary Qiao, most of the things are packed up so we will leave now.

184
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,315
- All right. 
 - You worked hard.

185
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:53,295
Good night, Director Gu and Mrs. Gu.

186
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:56,695
Good night, Director Gu and Mrs. Gu.

187
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:02,695
Secretary Qiao, no, Mrs. Gu.

188
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,277
Are you shy?

189
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,735
Director Gu, you really did everything to sell those flowers.

190
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:10,253
Let's go.

191
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:18,081
Qiao Jing.

192
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:21,181
Look.

193
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:27,595
We worried about selling the flowers on top of the cart but forgot those below.

194
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:02,535
Thank you for today.

195
00:16:06,053 --> 00:16:07,155
Not at all.

196
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:09,835
I did all this because I had a request.

197
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:14,535
You haven't sold all your flowers yet

198
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:17,635
so your request can't be made.

199
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:19,495
I said I could sell them all so I will.

200
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:22,915
I'm going to deliver them to the buyer now.

201
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,757
Hold on tight.

202
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:29,595
It's so late. Who is it?

203
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,250

204
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,210

205
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,710

206
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:17,335
 Qiao Jing, will you marry me?

207
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:27,777
Hello?

208
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:29,435
 Did you really sell all the flowers?

209
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:32,835
I didn't expect that spoiled man would be of use.

210
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:35,175
After all, he is the CEO of Anxia.

211
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:37,395
How could he be so useless?

212
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:40,695
I think he has changed a bit.

213
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:42,315
He used to look down on others.

214
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:45,035
 How could he possibly lower himself to sell flowers?

215
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:48,995
He has changed a bit.

216
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:23,361
Why are you here?

217
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:30,675
The flowers were all sold so I came for my request.

218
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,435
I won't agree to any excessive request.

219
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:39,435
What kind of request would be excessive?

220
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:58,035
It's extreme now.

221
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:08,495
I want a date that belongs solely to Gu Yi and Qiao Jing.

222
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:12,535
I've prepared a date list already.

223
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:15,701
Come on.

224
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:28,775
All that's left is the finishing touch.

225
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:45,575
I didn't expect your request to be a date.

226
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:48,155
You never did anything like that before.

227
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:52,635
That was the past.

228
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,795
I'll etch this in your memory forever.

229
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,110
I'll give you so much joy

230
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:12,435
that annually, you will come on time to every date I arrange.

231
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:42,075
I'll answer the door.

232
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,233
What is it?

233
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,475
Madam asked me to invite you home.

234
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:58,037
Another day.

235
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:02,235
Chairman Gu is back. You must go back.

236
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:09,109
What happened?

237
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:15,075
The old man is back. I have to go.

238
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:18,753
Wait for me at home.

239
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,080

240
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:12,945
Dad.

241
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:19,935
Even I can't make you come home anymore.

242
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:27,601
These days, you didn't go to the company or come home.

243
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:29,435
Where have you been?

244
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,895
Dad, did something happen for you to return so suddenly?

245
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,655
My son fell for a woman,

246
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:40,375
and he left the company.

247
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:44,655
If I didn't return, I fear Anxia would collapse!

248
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:48,215
I didn't control you these past few days.

249
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:50,529
You should be full of enough fun.

250
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:54,015
Listen to your dad. End things with Qiao Jing.

251
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,895
Dad, Mom. I can't end things with Qiao Jing.

252
00:23:06,655 --> 00:23:08,695
No one can change that.

253
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:10,915
I have something else to do. I'm leaving.

254
00:23:10,915 --> 00:23:12,437
Gu Yi!

255
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:18,393
Gu Yi!

256
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:32,569
Hop on.

257
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,635
 I didn't expect you knew how to ride a motorcycle.

258
00:23:50,635 --> 00:23:53,075
 I know many unexpected things.

259
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,575
It was all laid out in your list.

260
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,535
Is anything missing?

261
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,135
It's exactly what I imagined.

262
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:22,055
Didn't I say to wait for me at home?

263
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:24,395
Why did you do this yourself?

264
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,575
I was a little worried so I came to see you.

265
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:32,815
In the past, when you met with Chairman Gu, 80% of the time, you would quarrel.

266
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,315
In these years, you've understood, right?

267
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:38,595
The Gu family is a plate of scattered sand.

268
00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:42,095
Sometimes I really envy you.

269
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:45,695
When you go home, you have a warm meal

270
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:48,035
instead of a cold argument.

271
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,875
No one can choose his own family.

272
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,955
The only thing we can do

273
00:24:55,955 --> 00:25:01,075
is accept it or change.

274
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,915
I can't choose the family who birthed and raised me,

275
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:09,255
but I can choose the right woman

276
00:25:09,255 --> 00:25:12,795
to build a warm home with.

277
00:25:15,235 --> 00:25:18,175
It's hot. The cake will melt.

278
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:20,485
Wait a moment!

279
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,835
If you cut it like that, won't our names be split?

280
00:25:25,015 --> 00:25:26,215
What should we do then?

281
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:28,533
Like this.

282
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,930

283
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:36,535
This way, it doesn't count as a split.

284
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,195
Here. Open up.

285
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:49,755
I hope every year like today,

286
00:25:49,755 --> 00:25:53,395
you will be like this, by my side.

287
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,875
You gab a lot.

288
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,835
Drink less.

289
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:12,735
Do you fear it will harm Su Juan's heart?

290
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:15,435
That's not what I mean.

291
00:26:16,915 --> 00:26:18,609
It's just...

292
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:23,735
Your attitude and your efforts lately...

293
00:26:23,735 --> 00:26:26,635
I am a little unused to them.

294
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:28,635
Why would I be like this?

295
00:26:28,635 --> 00:26:31,095
Do you really not understand at all?

296
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:36,335
I want to heal the traces Su Juan left in your heart,

297
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:39,595
but you don't want to move on from the past at all.

298
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:43,097
I…

299
00:26:47,735 --> 00:26:49,497
I'm sorry.

300
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:53,475
I was wrong from the start.

301
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:57,435
I shouldn't have looked for Su Juan through you,

302
00:26:58,135 --> 00:27:02,655
or treated you as his shadow.

303
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,315
I don't need an apology.

304
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:13,733
Qiao Jing, I ask you.

305
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:18,275
Who is the man in front of you now?

306
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:23,195
Is it Su Juan or Gu Yi?

307
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,545
Gu Yi.

308
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:36,389
You are Gu Yi.

309
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:09,475
I'm sorry.

310
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:12,515
If you don't wish it, I…

311
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,575
Come on, give me one.

312
00:28:42,575 --> 00:28:44,955
Your hand is just to hold me.

313
00:28:57,395 --> 00:28:59,355
- Hello? 
 -  Hello, Secretary Qiao.

314
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:01,575
Is Director Gu beside you?

315
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:03,425
Yes.

316
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:04,575
A partner is here.

317
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:07,335
He wants to see Director Gu, but we…

318
00:29:07,335 --> 00:29:09,395
Okay, I got it.

319
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,995
Director Gu, you've been absent for too long.

320
00:29:15,995 --> 00:29:18,195
It's time to go back to work.

321
00:29:20,735 --> 00:29:23,475
But I still don't want to leave you. What should I do?

322
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:27,035
All right, stop messing around.

323
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:29,475
I'll bring you lunch later.

324
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,255
Okay, I'll wait for you.

325
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:42,995
Mischievous!

326
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:46,375
I'll expect you.

327
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:44,837
- Hello. 
 - You are...

328
00:30:44,837 --> 00:30:48,135
Miss Qiao, Chairman Gu would like to see you.

329
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:56,815
Miss Qiao, please come in. Chairman Gu awaits you here.

330
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:09,155
Miss Qiao, we meet again.

331
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:11,995
Chairman Gu, how's your health lately?

332
00:31:13,235 --> 00:31:16,435
Still the same. Don't worry about me.

333
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,815
Chairman Gu, I have already resigned.

334
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:22,935
Why do you want to see me today?

335
00:31:22,935 --> 00:31:24,565
Please be seated.

336
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:32,155
I didn't call you here for work today.

337
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:37,395
I want to discuss you and Gu Yi.

338
00:31:39,735 --> 00:31:46,195
Gu Yi gave up his marriage with the Bai family for you, and he isn't managing company affairs.

339
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,615
Do you think...

340
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:52,375
he really loves you?

341
00:31:55,295 --> 00:31:58,435
Qiao Jing, didn't you say you'd bring food to me?

342
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:01,075
But you didn't even answer your phone. What exactly are you doing?

343
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:02,813
Qiao Jing.

344
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:23,615
The Gu family has never had affectionate people, but the members pretend they are.

345
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:27,095
When I was young...

346
00:32:28,595 --> 00:32:30,955
I also met someone I liked.

347
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:37,315
But in the end, didn't I still marry my current wife?

348
00:32:38,535 --> 00:32:42,455
Once people calm down, they will realize...

349
00:32:44,335 --> 00:32:48,415
there's no such thing as "nobody but you."

350
00:32:48,415 --> 00:32:51,755
It's just a fleeting impulse.

351
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:55,415
Gu Yi is opposite of you.

352
00:32:55,415 --> 00:32:57,935
He's just like me.

353
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:02,195
He's a Gu family member so he must take on Gu Family's duties.

354
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:05,375
He's a businessman.

355
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:09,175
Sooner or later, he will realize that love

356
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:12,215
is a losing business.

357
00:33:18,255 --> 00:33:22,855
Miss Qiao, you should know where the boundaries are.

358
00:33:27,815 --> 00:33:30,575
Director Gu is here waiting for you outside.

359
00:33:32,835 --> 00:33:35,895
Miss Qiao, it's raining heavily outside.

360
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:40,995
It's remote here. Wait till the rain stops to leave.

361
00:33:40,995 --> 00:33:42,481
This way.

362
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:14,910
- Where's Qiao Jing?  
 - Why so anxious?

363
00:34:14,935 --> 00:34:17,275
I just wanted to chat with her.

364
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:20,015
Look at the state you're in right now!

365
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:22,135
Dad, if you need anything, just ask me.

366
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:23,855
Don't bother her!

367
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,415
You're the one who involved her!

368
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:31,135
If you really cared about her behalf, don't pester her.

369
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:36,115
Gu Yi, wake up!

370
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,535
You're the heir of the Gu family.

371
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,215
Since birth,

372
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:44,975
you possessed what others can't have in a lifetime,

373
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:49,495
but those things didn't just fall from the sky.

374
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:53,555
The more you get, the more you must pay.

375
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:57,815
Marrying a woman of the right background to support the family business

376
00:34:57,815 --> 00:35:02,515
is one of the prices you must pay.

377
00:35:02,515 --> 00:35:05,295
Why must I marry for success? I can do it!

378
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:07,555
I'll work hard to do well in both love and career!

379
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:09,895
One cannot be too greedy!

380
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:13,715
Dad, have you ever loved anyone?

381
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:20,215
What do you mean, have I loved? Love is nothing but living with someone.

382
00:35:21,775 --> 00:35:23,445
Let's go.

383
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:30,433
Dad!

384
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:36,515
Go.

385
00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:10,211
♫  Make an effort, breathe deep, heads up  ♫

386
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:16,725
♫  The night moonlight passes through the window  ♫

387
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:24,796
♫  Holding hands with a little fragility  ♫

388
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:30,942
♫  I can't control my own feelings  ♫

389
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:35,270
Let's go home.

390
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:45,737
♫  Memories also detach with it  ♫

391
00:36:46,897 --> 00:36:53,421
♫  This air smothers me  ♫

392
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:57,057
♫  Arms crossed on my chest  ♫

393
00:36:57,057 --> 00:37:02,077
♫  Tears can't stop flowing  ♫

394
00:37:04,953 --> 00:37:14,649
♫  Maybe we're reaching the end  ♫

395
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,575
He was originally a sharp knife,

396
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:20,815
but now he has become blunt.

397
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:24,075
I can't hand him the company anymore.

398
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:34,630

399
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:39,550
"The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

400
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,753
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

401
00:37:43,753 --> 00:37:50,800
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

402
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:56,597
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

403
00:37:56,597 --> 00:38:04,020
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

404
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,765
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

405
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:16,429
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

406
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:22,795
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

407
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:28,589
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

408
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:32,284
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

409
00:38:32,284 --> 00:38:35,988
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

410
00:38:35,988 --> 00:38:41,974
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

411
00:38:41,974 --> 00:38:48,279
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

412
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,100
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

413
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:57,997
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

414
00:38:57,997 --> 00:39:01,579
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

415
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:05,123
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

416
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:12,395
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

417
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:15,562
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

418
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:20,469
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

419
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:26,680
♫  This unbearable plot  ♫

420
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:33,137
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫

421
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:39,140
♫  Being a guest may be my other destiny  ♫

422
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:46,341
♫  As the one who left, what gives me the right to care?  ♫

423
00:39:46,341 --> 00:39:52,376
♫  After all, you're the one who finally got married, and I'm just a guest  ♫

424
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:58,700
♫  I drained all the memories to celebrate your wedding  ♫

425
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:04,633
♫  But I never had the courage to bless you  ♫

426
00:40:04,633 --> 00:40:14,080
♫  Thank you for making me finally aware and returning me back to myself  ♫

427
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:25,533
♫  At least I can still be a guest to witness your love  ♫

428
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:29,445
♫  He's so lucky to have met you  ♫

429
00:40:29,445 --> 00:40:39,927
♫  I hope he loves you more than I do  ♫
