1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,050

2
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:45,500

3
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,479

4
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,180
Why did you bring me here?

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,820
To show you something.

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,660

7
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,076
Look.

8
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,580
This was the first plaque I hung.

9
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,800
I know.

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,080
Every year after you left,

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,760
I would come and hang a plaque for you.

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,560
Before I left, you said you had something very important to tell me.

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,180
Do you still want to say it now?

14
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,360
I often wonder. If that car accident hadn't happened back then,

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,780
and we hadn't been apart for four years,

16
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,960
what would our future be like?

17
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,860
That future is already gone.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,500
I struggled in the past and refused to accept it.

19
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,600
I even tried to numb myself by using someone else.

20
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,680
But now I've realized that

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,980
sometimes people need to learn to accept the variables in their own lives.

22
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,220
Do you remember the book we read together?

23
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,800
There is a line in it.

24
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,680
"A thing or two that are certain"

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,120
"are enough to withstand all uncertainties in the world."

26
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,048
 I'm back.

27
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,200
As long as my love is certain, we still have a future.

28
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,340
S-Senior Su? Weren't you dead?

29
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,540
No nonsense. Why are you still alive?

30
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,980
Heâ€¦ What's going on here?

31
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,680
All right, calm down.

32
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,936
Well, does it hurt?

33
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:32,360
How can it not hurt?

34
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,720
Am I dreaming now?

35
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,140
You're still the same,

36
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,760
incoherent when you're excited.

37
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,560
Senior Su, where have you been all these years?

38
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,400
Qiao Jing cried for you countless times.

39
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,660
It's a long story.

40
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,420
Most important, he is back safe and sound.

41
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,860
Yes, most important is you're back.

42
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,500
Surviving a great disaster brings good fortune.

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,448
- Housekeeper Li. 
 - Mr. Su.

44
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:07,028
- Let me do it. 
 - Okay.

45
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,200
- Dad. 
 - A'Juan.

46
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,736
It's time to take your medicine.

47
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,540
Didn't I tell you before?

48
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,040
Don't come if you're busy.

49
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,260
It's the weekend. I'm not busy.

50
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,040
Besides, you just changed your medication.

51
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,320
I worry Housekeeper Li might not get it right.

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,820
How's it going at the company?

53
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,920
Any difficulties adapting?

54
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,020
Did that rascal bully you?

55
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,960
No. He takes good care of me.

56
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,400
I still have Uncle Jiang, right? I will ask him if I don't know.

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,580
That's right. When Anxia was at its infancy,

58
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,260
Jiang Sheng contributed a lot to the company.

59
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,760
Now that he's helping you, I'm relieved.

60
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,864
Dad.

61
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,164
Why did you take so long?

62
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,620
I watched him take his medicine, played a game of chess with him,

63
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,300
and waited for him to fall asleep before coming back.

64
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,020
It's important to secure Gu Nan.

65
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,360
However, he can't hold on much longer.

66
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,880
You still need more help.

67
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,780
What do you mean, Uncle Jiang?

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,180
I know Qiao Jing is a good girl.

69
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,420
But she can't help you.

70
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,880
After all, you're not the same as Gu Yi.

71
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,500
Gu Yi can do anything for Qiao Jing

72
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,640
because he has Fang Pei behind him,

73
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,720
as well as her group of supportive relatives and friends.

74
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,584
What about you?

75
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,200
Right. Gu Nan is on your side now,

76
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,820
but what if one day he's not around?

77
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,000
Can you still ensure that people will stand by your side?

78
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,880
I don't mean anything else.

79
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm not asking you to cut off contact with Qiao Jing.

80
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,400
I just want to remind you not to forget your purpose.

81
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,888
Uncle Jiang, I won't forget.

82
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
That's good.

83
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,460
The Gu family has always relied on the Bai family,

84
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,320
which shows the strength of the Bai family.

85
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,340
You have to seize the opportunity.

86
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,980
When Gu Yi broke their engagement, it caused a stir in the city.

87
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,460
Will the Bai family still accept the Gu family?

88
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,280
The Bai and Gu families have countless connections.

89
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,860
They're only dissatisfied with Gu Yi.

90
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,860
How about I stay with you?

91
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,720
This is my first concert in China.

92
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,480
It's very important to me.

93
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,340
I want to practice the piano alone.

94
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,100
For this concert, I invited many good friends to cheer for you.

95
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,380
You really have to prepare well.

96
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,780
All right, I know. When have I ever let you down?

97
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,560
That's right, my good daughter.

98
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,640
Then you must practice hard. I'll pick you up in a few days.

99
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,340
All right, my great agent.

100
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,060
Our Xiao Yun is the best, right?

101
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,740
Why are you alone? Where is Senior Su?

102
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,280
He is on a business trip.

103
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,960
You really know his schedule well.

104
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,100
To be honest, which one do you plan to choose?

105
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,260
I won't choose any.

106
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,820
Why not?

107
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,780
If I have to choose, it would be Senior Su,

108
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,680
the unforgettable man who is gentle and considerate.

109
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,340
Isn't he good?

110
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,380
Or do you not like him anymore?

111
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,440
After all, you held on to him for so many years.

112
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,020
That's true.

113
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,404
But...

114
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,720
it's different now.

115
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,180
That's okay.

116
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,600
Adults can make choices.

117
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,020
Excuse me, excuse me.

118
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,440
How could you bump into me on such a wide road?

119
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,380
This is the only road to Butterfly Valley,

120
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,820
and I rang the bell just now.

121
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,980
What do you mean?

122
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,400
I didn't hear your bell so I deserve to be hit by you?

123
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,520
That's not what I meant.

124
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,920
Why don't you sit down first?

125
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,680
Did you sprain your ankle?

126
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,600
It's fine, not a big deal.

127
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,040
How about I take you to the hospital?

128
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,616
No need.

129
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,356
Just sit here; don't move.

130
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,520
The injury is a bit serious,

131
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,800
but it didn't hurt the bone.

132
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
A little spray should be fine.

133
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,824
Be gentle.

134
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,020
Don't move for now.

135
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,340
My name is Edel. I'm on vacation here.

136
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,520
What about you?

137
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,020
Bi Dina.

138
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,040
Why did you come back so late?

139
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,064
Don't touch me.

140
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,488
I missed you.

141
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,580
Trying to coax me with sweet talk again?

142
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,800
Sorry, I've heard enough.

143
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,440
Then what should I do? Tell me.

144
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,420
I'm willing to do anything.

145
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,280
I know I shouldn't have lied to you.

146
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,900
But my mom's mistake led to Su Juan's accident.

147
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,480
I feared you'll leave me.

148
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,060
Qiao Jing, I've never liked anyone in my life.

149
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,520
You're the first.

150
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,960
I told you we'd be together for a lifetime. I meant it.

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,580
When I make a mistake, hit or scold me.

152
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,100
But please don't leave me, okay?

153
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,760
Please don't give up on me, okay?

154
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,980
Or... or teach me how to change.

155
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,700
I'll listen to you. I'll listen to you on everything, okay?

156
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,520
I believe you like me.

157
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,020
But these aren't reasons for you to deceive me.

158
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,920
Qiao Jing, give me one last chance.

159
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,180
I won't lie to you anymore.

160
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,600
I won't make you sad again, Qiao Jing.

161
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,112
Enough.

162
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,680
Gu Yi, we've broken up.

163
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,000
It doesn't count if I don't agree!

164
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,880
Your pathetic behavior now will only make me look down on you.

165
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,204
Qiao Jing!

166
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,860
Don't come to my house again.

167
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,056
Why is it you?

168
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:29,390
Haven't had breakfast yet?

169
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,970
Here.

170
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,620
Come in.

171
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,160
Is your ankle better?

172
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,208
It's already better.

173
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,140
That's good. Remember to apply medicine on time.

174
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,420
I did learn some piano before.

175
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,720
You should give it a try.

176
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,532
Me?

177
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,080
I haven't played in a long time. I'm rusty.

178
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,140
You go ahead.

179
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,400
- "Ballade pour (for) Adeline." Is it your concert's main piece? 
 - Yes.

180
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:41,720
When I was fifteen, I won my first big award with this piece.

181
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,960
"Ballade pour Adeline" is based on a myth.

182
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,920
It says there was a king who longed for love.

183
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,320
So he sculpted a girl statue named Adelina.

184
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,460
The king looked at the statue daily,

185
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,880
gave all his longing and love to her,

186
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,840
and prayed for the statue to become real.

187
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,870
In the end, the king's devotion touched the goddess of love.

188
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,980
The goddess gave life to the girl,

189
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,880
letting the king and Adelina be together for a lifetime.

190
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,000
Are you Adelina?

191
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,020
I'm the king.

192
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,440
Looking at someone every day and praying for the favor of the love goddess.

193
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,920
But I haven't met a miracle.

194
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,290

195
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,620

196
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,310

197
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:29,230
â™«  How many winters have passed after our breakup?  â™«

198
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,336
â™«  What day is it today?  â™«

199
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:36,024
â™«  I occasionally think of you  â™«

200
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:45,189
â™«  Your sudden text message catches me off guard  â™«

201
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:49,465
â™«  Standing frozen in place  â™«

202
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:56,431
â™«  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  â™«

203
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,300
 Director Gu, my name is Qiao Jing.

204
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,172
â™«  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  â™«

205
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:14,128
â™«  I remind myself constantly not to run away  â™«

206
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:17,872
â™«  Holding the wedding invitation and approaching step by step  â™«

207
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:21,420
â™«  The venue he carefully arranged  â™«

208
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:27,516
â™«  A pity this scenery belongs to you only; I am just a guest  â™«

209
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:33,912
â™«  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  â™«

210
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:39,620
â™«  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  â™«

211
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,456
â™«  After such a long time, you seem a bit distant  â™«

212
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:46,932
â™«  Handshake and greetings are so polite  â™«

213
00:20:46,932 --> 00:20:50,592
â™«  Why intentionally hide in front of him?  â™«

214
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:56,667
â™«  How my world once had you  â™«

215
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:22,770
â™«  The bell rings imperceptibly  â™«

216
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:31,478
â™«  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  â™«

217
00:21:31,478 --> 00:21:35,514
â™«  He gently kneels on one knee  â™«

218
00:21:35,514 --> 00:21:43,130
â™«  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  â™«

219
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:49,882
â™«  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  â™«

220
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:55,446
â™«  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  â™«

221
00:21:55,446 --> 00:22:01,812
â™«  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  â™«

222
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:07,606
â™«  I remind myself constantly not to run away  â™«

223
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:11,401
â™«  You are especially lovely today  â™«

224
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:15,005
â™«  This beauty once was in my arms  â™«

225
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:21,091
â™«  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  â™«

226
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:27,296
â™«  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  â™«

227
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:33,232
â™«  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  â™«

228
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:37,014
â™«  The promised forever has become the past  â™«

229
00:22:37,014 --> 00:22:40,596
â™«  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  â™«

230
00:22:40,596 --> 00:22:43,400
â™«  Please forgive me for being improper  â™«

231
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,900
 Gu Yi, we've broken up.

232
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,640
 Your pathetic behavior now will only make me look down on you.

233
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,240
 Don't come to my house again.

234
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:05,676
â™«  This unbearable plot  â™«

235
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:12,268
â™«  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  â™«

236
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:18,192
â™«  Being a guest may be my other destiny  â™«

237
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,736
You're awake.

238
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,940
Why are you here?

239
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,360
You drank too much last night.

240
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,320
I brought you back.

241
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,424
We...

242
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,704
Yesterday, youâ€¦

243
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,100
 Come out now. The water is cold, Adelina.

244
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,840
 Come over here.

245
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,660
 You're the king... the king.

246
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,000
 Come over here.

247
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,100
 Come over here!

248
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,140
 All right, all right, I'm coming.

249
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,800
 I asked you to come and you just came?

250
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,300
 So obedient?

251
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,240
 You're drunk.

252
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,960
 There's not a single good man among you guys!

253
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,380
 Yes, yes.

254
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,980
 There's not a single good man.

255
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,580
 I hate you. I hate you.

256
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,340
 I know.

257
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,280
 You're drunk. Let me take you home.

258
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,880
 I like you so much.

259
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,140
I'm warning you. You can't tell anyone about this.

260
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,020
Don't worry. This concerns my reputation so I'll definitely keep it a secret.

261
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,980
Your reputation?

262
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,360
I just bit you.

263
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,040
A grown man being so fussy?

264
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,100
Hello, Mom.

265
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,660
Uncle Lin is hosting a charity auction.

266
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,840
You will go with me, right?

267
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,360
- I have to work. 
 - When do you not work?

268
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,540
Tell me. How long has it been since you last spent time with me?

269
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,680
Do you even have me in your heart?

270
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,120
Fine, I'll go with you.

271
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,740
Be careful on the road.

272
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,940
Remember to apply medicine later.

273
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,620
I know.

274
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,920
Can I go to your concert?

275
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,360
Sure, I'll give you a chance to learn.

276
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,500
Who is he?

277
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,760
A fan.

278
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,020
You're back from your business trip.

279
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,900
Do you have time now?

280
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,020
I do. What's up?

281
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,200
Go to a place with me.

282
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,220
Why did you suddenly bring me to pick a dress?

283
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,460
There's a charity auction dinner tonight.

284
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,740
I want you to be my date.

285
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,440

286
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,684
Okay. Great.

287
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,960
Come on. Look at me.

288
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,920
Director Gu, you are here. It's been long since we last met.

289
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,920
He was busy with company matters but specially came today.

290
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,480
Many friends are waiting for you inside.

291
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Director Gu, let's have a good chat later about collaboration with Anxia.

292
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,640
Take a look and see what you like. I will bid for you later.

293
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,540
President Liu, please excuse me.

294
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,800
Let's go and say hello.

295
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,200
Let's go.

296
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,108
This one.

297
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,392
President Bai.

298
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,612
Xiao Yun, I heard there are some nice jewelry pieces today.

299
00:30:01,612 --> 00:30:05,660
If you like any, let Gu Yi bid on them for you.

300
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,620
Our Bai family can afford it.

301
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,960
We can bid for ourselves.

302
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,832
Mom.

303
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,340
Isn't that your eldest son?

304
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,840
This is Qiao Jing.

305
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,700
That is the Gu family's illegitimate son who returned recently.

306
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,020
His last name is Su. He's called Su Juan.

307
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,880
Our Gu family only has one son named Gu Yi.

308
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,880
Mom, I'm going to the restroom.

309
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,120
I have something to tell you.

310
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,540
What a great Edel.

311
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,240
All of you Gu family members are great actors.

312
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,540
To get close to me, you've put up a great performance at the resort.

313
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,620
I really didn't know you were Bai Yun before.

314
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,940
In my eyes, you were just the Bi Dina I accidentally bumped into.

315
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,380
Whether you are Edel or Su Juan, it has nothing to do with me.

316
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,200
Director Gu, the VIPs are seated here. Please take your seat.

317
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,640
Who arranged these seats? So unlucky.

318
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,960
Do you need to change seats?

319
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,520
Look, all the Gu family members are here.

320
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,060
That woman surrounded by the two brothers is not simple either.

321
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:35,960
She used to be Gu Yi's secretary. Now she is Su Juan's date.

322
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,660
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to our charity auction.

323
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,860
This auction is held in cooperation with the Christie's auction house.

324
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,480
All proceeds will be donated to Project Hope.

325
