1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:12,110

2
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:45,435

3
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:48,351

4
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:57,334
I brought you some late-night snacks.

5
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:59,754
Did you get hurt?

6
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:02,634
I bumped into something accidentally. It's nothing.

7
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:06,180
Come in. Let me apply some medicine.

8
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,550
Okay.

9
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,754
Do you know something? As a child, I studied wrestling for a while.

10
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:22,194
I'm quite familiar with this kind of injury.

11
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:26,954
As expected, I can't hide anything from you.

12
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:31,708
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,914
Don't worry, I didn't suffer.

14
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:40,214
It's just a pity I couldn't give him more punches to vent frustration on your behalf.

15
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:44,814
Why are you helping me?

16
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:54,474
Because I want to have an ordinary, warm family.

17
00:01:55,474 --> 00:02:00,354
In my dreams, my ideal wife resonates with me intellectually.

18
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:04,194
And in life, we can depend on one another.

19
00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:06,394
We can laugh together during happy times

20
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:10,954
and hug each other when we're tired.

21
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:19,074
And... you are the embodiment of my dream.

22
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:25,234
That's because you don't know me yet.

23
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:29,160
I'm very different from that person you imagine.

24
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:32,874
I'll get to know you starting now.

25
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:43,534
- Hello? 
  - Director Bai, bad news. You should hurry back.

26
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:46,274
Don't be anxious. I'll come over now.

27
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,534
I need to return to work. Something came up at the company.

28
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:56,260
- Drive safely. 
 - Okay.

29
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,280
 You shouldn't have stopped me. I landed only one punch.

30
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,350
 He got off easy.

31
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:09,954
We were outside. Don't make a scene out there.

32
00:03:09,954 --> 00:03:12,154
How did you handle the matter?

33
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,970
I did everything you said.

34
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,030
After all, he's Bai Yun's cousin.

35
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:20,190
Won't the Bai family be unhappy with how you treated him?

36
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,920
If the Bai family truly cared about him,

37
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,570
he wouldn't be in such a miserable state after all these years.

38
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:28,714
Aren't you afraid Qiao Jing will find out?

39
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:31,154
I want her to find out.

40
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:37,174
 Wow, Qiao, you're something!

41
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:41,434
This place is really nice. No wonder you were so eager to move.

42
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:43,794
Why do you have time today? Aren't you busy with the renovation?

43
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:44,954
Don't even mention it.

44
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:47,854
I hired a design company, but they seem to have recent troubles.

45
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:49,834
Someone competes with them on every project.

46
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:52,334
So they've been swamped lately.

47
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:54,274
- Is it that serious? 
 - Yes.

48
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:57,994
It's that award-winning architecture company, Bamboo Forest Dynasty.

49
00:03:57,994 --> 00:04:01,730
I'm unsure if it's because they were so successful or they offended someone. (Idiom: a tall tree catches the wind)

50
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:05,514
"Bamboo Forest Dynasty"?

51
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:09,074
- Bai Yan? 
 - Yes, do you know him?

52
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:22,394
You came later than I thought you would.

53
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,314
You're behind the problem Bai Yan is having, right?

54
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:37,734
I'm just having a normal business competition with him.

55
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:41,594
Is there a problem with that?

56
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:45,554
He's innocent. Why must you drag him in?

57
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:48,714
He provoked me first. How is he innocent?

58
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:51,114
He brought these consequences upon himself.

59
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:53,180
So what do you want?

60
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,490
Simple.

61
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:04,674
Come back to me.

62
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,180
I made a mistake in the past. But I promise

63
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,450
I'll always treat you well in the future.

64
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:19,054
You're getting married. How will you treat me well?

65
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:24,994
What does that have to do with it? Don't be so stubborn.

66
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:27,134
Besides, I won't be getting married too soon.

67
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:30,654
Before that, you must come back to me.

68
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:35,114
Okay, as long as you let Bai Yan off.

69
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:41,774
For that man, you agreed without any hesitation.

70
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:46,854
I keep my promises; I hope you will as well.

71
00:05:56,674 --> 00:05:59,994
 Director Bai, good news. Anxia has withdrawn from the Guanlan Project.

72
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:03,434
Why? Weren't they still stubbornly clinging to it yesterday?

73
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:06,254
Is there anything suspicious about what's happening today?

74
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:08,520
 - Probably not. I asked the person in charge.

75
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,974
 Anxia indeed withdrew from the project.

76
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:14,154
 And they won't compete for our company's other projects either.

77
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:17,260
Although it is unusual, it's not bad news.

78
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,514
Keep an eye on it for me.

79
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:21,154
 Okay, Director Bai.

80
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:55,754
 Why are you here? I was actually planning to go see you.

81
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:58,050
No wonder Gu Yi suddenly backed off.

82
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,154
You came to an agreement with him?

83
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:04,394
Why? His despicable methods won't work on me at all!

84
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:07,894
- As long as I put in some more time, I will— 
 - I know him very well.

85
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,294
When he sets his mind to something, he is tenacious.

86
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:19,074
It wasn't easy for you to finally leave him.

87
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:21,694
Will you give up halfway?

88
00:07:24,174 --> 00:07:27,474
I've contemplated over the past few days.

89
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:29,814
Hiding from him is not the solution.

90
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:32,820
This time, I can bring all of this to an end.

91
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,434
- But you... 
 - Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

92
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:40,294
Thank you for everything during this time.

93
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:46,534
If you need anything, just let me know.

94
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:47,994
Okay.

95
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:25,714
Did you settle Bai Yan's problems?

96
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:30,510
Don't worry.

97
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,534
I can let go of whatever happened between you and him in the past.

98
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:41,214
But from now on, I don't want to hear his name again.

99
00:08:42,394 --> 00:08:46,354
You will be family to him. Can you avoid him?

100
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:52,774
Don't stir up trouble. I don't want to fight with you.

101
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,734
Come with me.

102
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,840
 It's going to be another hot,

103
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,890
 sunny day today here in southern California. The temperature's 84 degrees for downtown Los Angeles.

104
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,940
 ("La La Land" movie)

105
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,974
Haven't you always wanted to watch this movie?  I'll watch it with you.

106
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:20,734
I've already watched it.

107
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,774
Then you can watch it with me.

108
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,140
 Aren't you very awesome, endowed like these other cats?

109
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,950
 I also have to cut into the...

110
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,154
Do you want to return to the company?

111
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,094
I want to take some time off.

112
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:37,914
All right. I'll find a maid for you.

113
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:41,974
From now on, you don't have to do housework.

114
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,334
Do you want someone to watch me?

115
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,274
I just want to treat you better. Don't purposely twist my words.

116
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,354
Gu Yi, have you intended to marry Bai Yun since the beginning?

117
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:59,874
On my birthday, you said you'd tell me something.

118
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:02,354
You wanted to clearly state it.

119
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:05,154
You just didn't expect I'd break up with you first.

120
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:09,514
You, the haughty young master, just feel unhappy and defiant about it.

121
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:13,014
In the end, you're just not used to this and can't adapt.

122
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,434
Stop labeling yourself as a love expert.

123
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,374
Are you crazy?

124
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:31,574
I agreed to return, but not to pretend with you!

125
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,754
You're looking for me, Director Gu?

126
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,254
Do me a favor and buy this for me.

127
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,294
You are....

128
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:20,694
Miss Qiao, Director Gu hired me to take care of you.

129
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:23,534
Miss Qiao, it's time for lunch.

130
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:26,554
I'm sorry. I have an appointment. I won't be eating at home.

131
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,674
How is it? Does this look good?

132
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,494
Whatever you wear looks great on you.

133
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,890
Is Gu Yi really that busy?

134
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,670
We're about to get engaged,

135
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:04,674
yet he has no time to see me pick a wedding dress.

136
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,834
He's too busy with company matters and can't get away.

137
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:12,114
Besides, his vision is not as sharp as mine.

138
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,134
You do know how to please me.

139
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,194
That little girl who used to cry a lot is about to get married.

140
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,594
So when are you getting married?

141
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,794
What's so good about marriage? I want to have fun some more years.

142
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,274
That gown is nice.

143
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,360
I still think this one looks better. What do you think?

144
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,990
- This one? 
 - This one.

145
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,370
This one?

146
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,410
Se Se.

147
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,970
- Miss Bai. Vice Director Zhou. 
 - What a coincidence.

148
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,094
Are you shopping at this hour?

149
00:13:00,094 --> 00:13:03,914
Oh, work-related shopping. Director Gu asked me to buy it.

150
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,894
Your taste is so good. How about giving me some advice?

151
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:11,494
Okay.

152
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,914
Choose this one. It's my favorite in this series.

153
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:22,014
This design is unique. You can't go wrong with it.

154
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:24,294
Your selection will surely satisfy Director Gu.

155
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:26,060
This one... Wrap it up for me.

156
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,590
Okay.

157
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,950
Pay for it over here.

158
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,350
Sure.

159
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,220
The total is ¥25,000 ($3,400).

160
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,870
Okay, here you go.

161
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,114
All right.

162
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:42,114
Let's go.

163
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:46,394
Aren't you buying anything? Didn't you say you need a necklace to match the dress?

164
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:47,814
It's already been bought.

165
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:50,834
If Brother had her buy it, who else would he give it to?

166
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,510
What's this?

167
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,910
It's for you. Do you like it?

168
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,292
It's beautiful.

169
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,014
Let me put it on for you.

170
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,268
Thank you.

171
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,354
Is that all? Just a "thank you"?

172
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:59,114
Then I'll bring lunch to the office for you tomorrow.

173
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,954
That's more like it.

174
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,714

175
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,580
 Let's go, let's go.

176
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,730
 My lower back hurts.

177
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,034
 Let's go, let's go.

178
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:30,814
 Brother Gang is buying lunch today. What should we eat?

179
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:32,134
- Something simple. 
 - It doesn't matter.

180
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:33,350
Do some exercise.

181
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,634
I've been on a diet lately.

182
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,870
- Come on. 
 - Let's go.

183
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,690
 I'm going to eat vegetables.

184
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,234
 - Dieting again? 
 - Yes, let's have some veggies.

185
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,374
It's already lunchtime. She should be here soon.

186
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,996
Come in.

187
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,014
- Why are you here? 
 - I brought you a lunch box. I made it myself.

188
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:06,694
No need. I don't have much appetite.

189
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:09,254
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

190
00:16:09,254 --> 00:16:11,730
I'm fine. I have important guests coming later.

191
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,470
You should go on back.

192
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,634
Then work hard.

193
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,354
Why are you wearing that necklace?

194
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,714
What? Can't I wear it?

195
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,816
Stop it.

196
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,454
I fried two extra eggs for you.

197
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,440
Who cares about your food?

198
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,190
Get out of here! Get out!

199
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,948
Qiao Jing.

200
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,154
Why does she have that necklace?

201
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,014
You're still in contact with her?

202
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:04,694
The necklace was intended as a gift for her. Is that a problem?

203
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:07,554
We're getting engaged.

204
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,294
Both of us know very well

205
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:16,514
that this marriage is the parents' decision, not mine.

206
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,054
I don't know why she came today.

207
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,494
It's fine. I don't care.

208
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,554
This won't happen again.

209
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,394
Are you still thinking about leaving?

210
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,754
Am I able to leave?

211
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,730
That's right.

212
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:40,050
No matter where you go, I will find you.

213
00:19:09,154 --> 00:19:10,884
Stop drinking.

214
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,320
Why is Gu Yi still thinking about Qiao Jing

215
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,130
when he is about to get engaged to me?

216
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:22,154
Will you still proceed with the engagement?

217
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:25,354
Why not?

218
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:31,334
Gu Yi is mine.

219
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:34,214
He has someone else in his heart.

220
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:43,054
Auntie Fang said that once we're married,

221
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:45,154
he'll surely have a change of heart.

222
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:52,454
He definitely will.

223
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:04,994
You should know that I only regard Bai Yun as a sister.

224
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:07,734
You're the only one I've ever wanted.

225
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:25,354
Marriage is not a transaction.

226
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:32,674
Okay, it's time to go.

227
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:52,196
Wait for me to return.

228
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:20,834
Miss Qiao.

229
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:58,614
Is something on your mind?

230
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:01,220
You should be happy today.

231
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,450
It's nothing.

232
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,410
I don't care how wild you were before,

233
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,010
but once you're engaged, you need to settle down.

234
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,180
 The number you have dialed is powered off.

235
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,160
 The phone you are calling is powered off.

236
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,230
 - Hello. The number you have dialed is powered off. 
 - The phone you are calling is...

237
00:22:30,234 --> 00:22:32,334
- Stop the car. 
  - powered off.

238
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:36,030
- Stop the car! I told you to stop! Are you deaf?

239
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,590
Stop!

240
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:41,694
It's too late. She's already gone.

241
00:22:43,554 --> 00:22:46,274
I sent her away.

242
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:47,454
 Gu Yi watches me closely.

243
00:22:47,454 --> 00:22:50,474
 I could meet you only after taking him lunch.

244
00:22:50,474 --> 00:22:55,254
 Last time, you said if I left him, you'd grant me one request.

245
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:56,514
 Is it still valid?

246
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:59,654
 Of course, it's valid. What do you want?

247
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:02,554
 Money? How much?

248
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:06,674
 No. I need your help to leave Gu Yi.

249
00:23:06,674 --> 00:23:08,954
 As long as you promise he won't bother me again,

250
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,634
 I promise to leave South City forever.

251
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:18,314
Mom, how can take action on your own?

252
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:21,534
Because I'm your mother.

253
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:25,474
Gu Yi, don't hesitate anymore.

254
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:31,014
You must be clear about which woman is most important to you.

255
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:34,554
You are the heir to Anxia Group.

256
00:23:34,554 --> 00:23:38,854
Don't ruin your future for a woman.

257
00:23:50,414 --> 00:23:54,414
Get out of the car. Xiao Yun is waiting for you inside.

258
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:14,034
Son, let's go.

259
00:24:14,034 --> 00:24:18,314
Mom, I won't get engaged.

260
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:19,394
What do you mean?

261
00:24:19,394 --> 00:24:22,394
- Get out of the car! 
 - Gu Yi!

262
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,534
Director Gu!  Director Gu!

263
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:25,894
 - Gu Yi! Gu Yi! 
 - Director Gu!

264
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:28,134
Gu Yi!

265
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,774
 - Gu Yi! 
 - Director Gu!

266
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:33,154
-  Gu Yi, open the door! Gu Yi!  
 - Director Gu!

267
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:43,994
 Old Qiao. Close the doors.

268
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:45,714
 Okay.

269
00:24:55,254 --> 00:24:57,340
Dad.

270
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,070
Jing Jing.

271
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:03,794
- Why have you come back? 
 - Why have you come back?

272
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,834
Didn't you say you wouldn't have time off for 6 months?

273
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:09,870
What's wrong?

274
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,190
Mom, I quit my job.

275
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,620
It's okay.

276
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,390
You're tired, right?  If you're tired, come home.

277
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,514
Jing Jing, you haven't eaten, have you?

278
00:25:25,014 --> 00:25:29,314
Come home. Let your mom make your favorite noodles.

279
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:42,554
Here you go. Eat it.

280
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:44,334
Thank you, Mom.

281
00:25:45,094 --> 00:25:46,734
Didn't you eat dinner already?

282
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:48,934
This is for your sister.

283
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:52,170
Have some.

284
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,550
Sister is always good to me.

285
00:25:55,694 --> 00:25:58,674
Jing Jing has been working in South City by herself.

286
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:01,434
She can't come home even once a year.

287
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,634
It's good that she quit her job.

288
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:06,194
Yes. With a job like yours that hardly gives a couple days off a year,

289
00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:09,334
it's no wonder your marriage gets delayed.

290
00:26:15,014 --> 00:26:18,614
Have you dated anyone there, Jing Jing?

291
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:20,814
Do you have a boyfriend?

292
00:26:21,434 --> 00:26:22,434
No.

293
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:25,654
Mom, what do you mean by "dating"?

294
00:26:31,654 --> 00:26:36,674
Jing Jing, do you remember that guy who used to live upstairs, Brother Xiao Li?

295
00:26:36,674 --> 00:26:38,880
He used to play with you when you were children.

296
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,490
That's right.

297
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,494
He's really successful now.

298
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:45,954
He has a car and a house.

299
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:47,674
And his savings are…

300
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:50,354
Okay, okay, enough. Money is secondary.

301
00:26:50,354 --> 00:26:53,074
The main thing is if they get along.

302
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:55,994
How is money not important? Then what else is more crucial?

303
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:57,854
Without money, our daughter will starve with him.

304
00:26:57,854 --> 00:26:59,554
- Mom. 
 - His character.

305
00:26:59,554 --> 00:27:01,714
All I want to do now is rest.

306
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:05,174
Let's discuss other things later.

307
00:27:05,174 --> 00:27:10,294
Okay, okay, let our daughter eat first.

308
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:11,894
- Eat it. 
 - Here, have another bite.

309
00:27:11,894 --> 00:27:15,014
Thank you, Sis. Delicious.

310
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:20,374
- Eat more. 
 - All you do is eat.

311
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:27,354
Now you're home, just take time to rest and relax.

312
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:17,474
Everything is finished.

313
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:43,970
♫  Make an effort, breathe deep, heads up  ♫

314
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,654
 Director Gu, my name is Qiao Jing.

315
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:58,554
♫  Holding hands with a little fragility  ♫

316
00:28:58,554 --> 00:29:00,780
 Director Gu, it's time for your medicine.

317
00:29:06,323 --> 00:29:13,371
♫  The air suddenly becomes wispy  ♫

318
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:20,447
♫  Memories also detach with it  ♫

319
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:26,971
♫  This air smothers me  ♫

320
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:30,700
♫  Arms crossed on my chest  ♫

321
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,129
♫  Tears can't stop flowing  ♫

322
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,310
♫  Maybe we're reaching the end  ♫

323
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,958
♫  I, who crawled out of it  ♫

What are you doing here?

332
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,954
What? Am I not welcome?

333
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:14,094
 Jing Jing, who's here?

334
00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:18,114
He's my friend, Bai Yan.

335
00:31:18,114 --> 00:31:22,654
Hello, Auntie. I'm sorry for coming without notice; it's impolite.

336
00:31:22,654 --> 00:31:25,434
This is a token of apology.

337
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:27,234
You're too formal.

338
00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:29,794
You're here now. Why bring so many gifts just for a visit?

339
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:31,434
Here, come in and sit down.

340
00:31:31,434 --> 00:31:32,734
Have you had breakfast yet?

341
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:34,034
- Not yet. 
 - Come in. Hurry.

342
00:31:34,034 --> 00:31:36,190
Let's have breakfast together. Quickly.

343
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,570

344
00:31:47,484 --> 00:31:49,172
Thank you.

345
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:02,174
He's tall and handsome.

346
00:32:03,514 --> 00:32:04,874
He looks talented.

347
00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:08,154
He's a great match for our Jing Jing.

348
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:13,854
Jing Jing said they're friends. Don't imagine something else.

349
00:32:13,854 --> 00:32:16,954
What kind of friend would come to our house?

350
00:32:16,954 --> 00:32:20,074
Just open your eyes and look.

351
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:21,994
Just friends?

352
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:29,734
- Thank you. 
 - Look how thoughtful he is!

353
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:32,794
-  Close the door.  
 - I know what happened between you and Gu Yi.

354
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:35,514
I was worried so I came to see you.

355
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:38,174
How did you know where I live?

356
00:32:39,054 --> 00:32:43,214
When we signed the lease, I saw your ID information.

357
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,834
♪ Looking relaxed, I dance generally with carefree, natural movements ♪

358
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:50,274
Qiao Zhi, come here.

359
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:53,154
This is my little brother, Qiao Zhi. Say hello.

360
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:55,080
Hello, Uncle.

361
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,390
Call him "Brother."

362
00:32:59,074 --> 00:33:01,034
You're tall. Which grade are you in?

363
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:02,894
I'll be in fifth grade soon.

364
00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:05,054
That's when you lay the foundation.

365
00:33:05,054 --> 00:33:07,274
I have a friend who runs a supplementary school.

366
00:33:07,274 --> 00:33:09,434
Do you want me to send you some tutoring books?

367
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:13,554
I just finished my homework, and you want me to study more?

368
00:33:13,554 --> 00:33:17,754
Can't I rest for a while, Uncle?

369
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:19,890
Where are you going?

370
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,650
To poop.

371
00:33:22,854 --> 00:33:25,074
What's wrong with this child?

372
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:26,914
So disrespectful.

373
00:33:26,914 --> 00:33:29,774
Xiao Bai, don't mind him.

374
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:30,994
He's cute.

375
00:33:30,994 --> 00:33:33,174
He's okay.

376
00:33:33,174 --> 00:33:36,534
What do you do, Xiao Bai?

377
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:38,314
I'm an architect.

378
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:40,034
"An architect"? That's great.

379
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:41,794
He has a bright future.

380
00:33:41,794 --> 00:33:44,034
What about your parents? What do they do?

381
00:33:44,034 --> 00:33:45,834
Where is your hometown? Where did you buy your house?

382
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:49,334
Mom, are you conducting a census?

383
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:51,054
It's my duty to ask.

384
00:33:51,054 --> 00:33:52,834
Honey, look at the time.

385
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:54,314
Shouldn't we open the shop?

386
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:56,514
I forgot about that.

387
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:59,854
Well, then... I haven't even picked the vegetables today. You go, Old Qiao.

388
00:33:59,854 --> 00:34:03,234
I can't. I still have to prepare the soup base. I don't have time.

389
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:05,134
- Then… 
 - I have time. I'll go.

390
00:34:05,134 --> 00:34:07,654
How can that be? You're a guest.

391
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:09,574
We can't trouble you.

392
00:34:09,574 --> 00:34:11,514
It's no trouble. It's my pleasure.

393
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:14,694
Look, Jing Jing. Xiao Bai doesn't know the way.

394
00:34:14,694 --> 00:34:17,814
You should go with him.

395
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:21,234
All right, let's go. Help me out.

396
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:24,820
Let's go.

397
00:34:33,394 --> 00:34:38,414
The solution you mentioned was to leave Gu Yi and hide in your hometown?

398
00:34:39,154 --> 00:34:42,434
I just wanted to come home to see my parents.

399
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:45,994
Then... will you go back?

400
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:57,134
No matter what, I'll keep that guesthouse for you.

401
00:34:57,134 --> 00:34:59,454
You can stay there anytime.

402
00:34:59,454 --> 00:35:01,434
Thank you.

403
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:39,534
You went to so much trouble to leave me just for this man?

404
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:42,230
Didn't you go to the engagement?

405
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,050
I called it off.

406
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:52,354
Do you know what you're doing?

407
00:35:52,354 --> 00:35:56,234
I know. I've weighed it thoroughly.

408
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:57,734
Don't you want my wholehearted devotion?

409
00:35:57,734 --> 00:35:59,474
Fine, I voided the engagement for you.

410
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:01,614
Are you satisfied now?

411
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:07,254
For me? Because of me?

412
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:10,054
I keep yielding for you. What else do you want?

413
00:36:10,054 --> 00:36:11,854
I know you like me; you love me.

414
00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:14,754
You're with this man just to spite me!

415
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:18,550
Gu Yi, can you stop being so self-righteous?

416
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,930
Let's go.

417
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:33,370

418
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:38,270
