1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:10,060

2
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:45,552

3
00:00:45,552 --> 00:00:48,337

4
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,260
How could you transfer your son to the construction site?

5
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,380
It's the company's decision. Stop fussing.

6
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,380
You say it so slickly. Isn't it something you can decide?

7
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,140
He just lost a project. Is it really necessary?

8
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,840
Or do you have a plan to kick my son out

9
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,500
to make room for your eldest son?

10
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,740
It's he who's good-for-nothing.

11
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,660
He's like this now because you've been spoiling him.

12
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,760
Because of me?

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,380
You're the one who shows favoritism.

14
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,060
If I don't protect him, I don't know what you would do to hurt him!

15
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,460
Nobody wants to hurt him!

16
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,680
All these years, you've been acting like this!

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,960
Aren't you tired?

18
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,620
If you weren't that paranoid, how would that car accident have happened?

19
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,820
If you didn't have that old lover,

20
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,560
if you didn't have that illegitimate child,

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,480
would I be that paranoid?

22
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,040
Director Gu was still in the office yesterday, and today Director Su is in it.

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,500
The world has changed dramatically.

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Secretary Qiao has left.

25
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,120
Director Gu has also left. My heart has left with them too.

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,776
Don't be like that.

27
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,520
It's so competitive now.

28
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,140
Do you know how many people are trying to get into Anxia but can't?

29
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,880
Listen to me. No matter how the world changes,

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,620
we have to keep our jobs.

31
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,540
Director Gu said not to be lazy even if he's not here,

32
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,680
and I'm sure he'll come back.

33
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,020
Get to work.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,340
Se Se, what are you looking at?

35
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,348
 Come in.

36
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,044
A'Juan.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,780
What brings you here?

38
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,400
I made you soup. Have a taste.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,340
 Thank you, Aunt.

40
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,640
 We're family. There's no need to be that polite.

41
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,092
Try it.

42
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,080
A'Juan, you fit in here.

43
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,560
Thank you for your support all along.

44
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,960
I'm just a woman so I can't help you much.

45
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,020
But your uncle thinks you're working hard and wants to help you.

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,680
Previously, it was because Gu Yi thought your uncle was too serious and responsible

47
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,780
so he made a big deal out of a small matter.

48
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:09,840
Aunt, if Uncle wants to help me, of course, I'm happy.

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,660
But if I let Uncle be reinstated as soon as I take office,

50
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,440
I'm afraid it will spark rumors.

51
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm not asking you to let him be reinstated in office.

52
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,900
If you could just give him a chanceâ€¦

53
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:38,440
All right, Aunt. I'll make arrangements for my uncle.

54
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,900
A'Juan, you're so considerate.

55
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,980
Drink it while it's hot. There's more.

56
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,880
 Jiahe is also interested in cooperating with Anxia.

57
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,640
 Once they win the bid, the two companies will work together on this project.

58
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,100
This is really the safest thing to do right now.

59
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,140
What is your plan now? Are you really going to the construction site?

60
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,260
What can I do? The transfer order was issued.

61
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,100
I'm telling you, Su Juan arranged for it just to see you suffer.

62
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,780
You might as well leave the company directly.

63
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Why do you have to suffer?

64
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,440
Before the Gret project is finalized, I won't leave.

65
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,360
And someone must be behind Chen Lan's leak.

66
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,660
 Help me get him to talk.

67
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,300
Okay, don't worry. I understand.

68
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,820
You have not fully recovered yet. You should take more time off to rest.

69
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,040
I'm almost fine.

70
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,960
If I miss work due to a lingering injury, I'll be laughed at.

71
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,860
Just let them laugh. Your body is the most important.

72
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,632
Qiao Jing.

73
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,040
I have nothing now.

74
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Do you despise me?

75
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:04,236
Yes.

76
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:06,900
So you can't give up or be discouraged.

77
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,140
Director Gu can't be defeated by such a small pitfall.

78
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,180
Will you stay with me?

79
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,800
I am Guan Hui, the person in charge of the construction of the property.

80
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,660
From now on, we are colleagues.

81
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,000
We have to take care of each other.

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,580
This is the office area.

83
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,180
That is the living area.

84
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:53,470
Further down is the construction site.

85
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,520

86
00:06:56,288 --> 00:06:58,360
Director Gu.

87
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,940
No, Junior Gu.

88
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,060
No, Coordinator Gu.

89
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:08,388
Supervisor Zhang.

90
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:11,112
Do you know each other?

91
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:12,920
You still don't know Director Gu, right?

92
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,560
Director Gu used to work in the office at the top floor.

93
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,500
I'm so sorry that you are transferred here.

94
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:25,820
I'm just a project coordinator here.

95
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,360
I never thought I could work with Coordinator Gu.

96
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,200
I am the project supervisor appointed by Director Su himself

97
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,000
and responsible for the overall project.

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,320
I will arrange all your work,

99
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,440
and you have to report to me.

100
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,000
It's getting late. Let's go to the construction site.

101
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,400
Xiao Yi, you just joined us.

102
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,980
I don't have anything suitable for you yet.

103
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,940
But I am your uncle. We are family both in public and in private.

104
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,640
I have to give you something to do.

105
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,500
We're short of hands to manage the construction waste.

106
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,740
How about you be a waste coordinator?

107
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,040
Yong Quan, Da Qiang, Xiao Wei, come over.

108
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,652
All right.

109
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,260
This is the new Coordinator Gu.

110
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,000
From now on, you are under his management.

111
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,240
Does such a small amount of work require a coordinator to oversee things?

112
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,900
Coordinator Gu is very experienced in management.

113
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,300
But I don't know what Coordinator Gu can do on the construction site.

114
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,320
What exactly am I responsible for?

115
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
You work with the waste recycling company

116
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,820
to collect and deliver all construction waste in the North District.

117
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,660
By the way, you have to make sure the area is clean and organized.

118
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
The construction site is messy and dirty

119
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,780
so it's inconvenient for you to be in a suit.

120
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,940
I see, Supervisor Zhang.

121
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,840
Lin Yong, how much waste does the North District process in one day?

122
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,600
The North District has a little more, about five or six tons a day.

123
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,640
The waste recycling company comes to pick it up every other day.

124
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,140
The waste has to be sorted before recycling.

125
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,460
And with such a large volume, why don't they sort it before sending it over?

126
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,260
This way, we can avoid wastage and save our time as well.

127
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,260
Don't dream about it.

128
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,240
We have to do this work ourselves.

129
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,304
My son.

130
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:20,800
Mom, why are you here?

131
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,840
You haven't recovered yet.

132
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,340
How can you pick waste here?

133
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,660
Come on, go back with me.

134
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,124
Mom, it's okay. This is my job.

135
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:30,220
Youâ€¦

136
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,300
Even if you are not Director Gu now,

137
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,920
you are still a top graduate from an elite school.

138
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,380
How can you pick waste here?

139
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,260
Su Juan is so evil.

140
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,860
He must have done this on purpose.

141
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,980
- Let's go look for him. 
 - Mom, calm down.

142
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,080
I have been an executive of Anxia since I graduated.

143
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,960
Coming here now to gain experience is also a great learning opportunity.

144
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,480
Look, the sun is shining so bright.

145
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,360
And it is so messy and dirty here. Iâ€¦

146
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,620
Gu Gong (Worker), people from the waste recycling company are here.

147
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,096
Got it.

148
00:10:58,096 --> 00:10:59,560
Mom, I have to get to work.

149
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,750
It is so messy here. Don't come over again.

150
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,580
Don't worry about me.

151
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,740
He has really changed a lot.

152
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,280
He does all this for you.

153
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,400
It's my fault.

154
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,160
I've always hoped that Gu Yi would find someone of equal stature.

155
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,676
I never thought he would plummet for love.

156
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,540
Qiao Jing,

157
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,900
I can't stop him from loving you.

158
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,520
Now I just hope

159
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,320
that his efforts can be rewarded,

160
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,860
and his earnestness can result in your sincerity.

161
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,220
Let me help you.

162
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,120
Y-You've put it on?

163
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:57,780
Does it look good?

164
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,880
Do you know what it means to put it on?

165
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,680
I do.

166
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
After you put it on,

167
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,820
you're not allowed to take it off again.

168
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,140
I don't want to.

169
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,680
You've had a hard time.

170
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,720
Brothers, it's time.

171
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,324
- Let's go, time to eat. 
 - Let's go to eat.

172
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,920
Gu Gong, let's go and eat.

173
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,000
You guys go first. I'll take a break.

174
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,344
All right.

175
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,020
A'Juan. No, Director Su.

176
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,440
The construction site is so messy, and it's the middle of the day.

177
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,940
Why did you personally come over?

178
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,060
Let's go and eat.

179
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,572
It's fine.

180
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:40,740
I just came by to check.

181
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,000
You're on track, right?

182
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,800
Yes, don't worry.

183
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,580
We're fast.

184
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,460
How are you getting used to the job?

185
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,400
What's with his attitude?

186
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,660
It's normal for complaints of such a big difference in working environment.

187
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,540
During his time on the construction site, I did not treat him badly.

188
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,650

189
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,900
Who put the bricks here?

190
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,760
Coordinator Gu, the regulation states

191
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,220
that glass waste should be separated from other waste.

192
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,000
Why are the glass shards and bricks still piled up together here?

193
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,180
I don't know about this regulation.

194
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,900
The notice has been issued.

195
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,660
Don't you know? If you don't know, it is your negligence.

196
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,240
There's probably still time to fix it. I'll call the workers to clear it up.

197
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,408
No. You're in charge of this area

198
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:59,080
so you should fix it.

199
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,880
You have to clean it up before we return this afternoon.

200
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,620
Director Gu, let me help you.

201
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,180
Secretary Yang, I'm training him.

202
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,940
If you help him, he won't learn

203
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,020
and will make the same mistake again.

204
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,740
Yang Yang,

205
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,500
if you get all dusty, how will you go to the meeting with me later?

206
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,820
Take it slow.

207
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,084
I thought you weren't used to a roadside food stall.

208
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:09,040
I've never eaten in a place like this before,

209
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,340
but now I find the taste of food in these places

210
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,960
is no worse than a five-star restaurant.

211
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:17,052
Really?

212
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,300
Thank you, Honey.

213
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,580
What are you calling me? Have we gotten our marriage certificate?

214
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,260
If you say yes, we'll go register our marriage immediately.

215
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,300
Stop this nonsense. Just eat.

216
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,640
You are hungry, right?

217
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,440
Let me taste yours.

218
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,460
We ordered the same food.

219
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,920
Yours is different.

220
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,380
How can we remove all these waste during the day?

221
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,420
Waste removal is usually done at night.

222
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,960
Do they want us to remove all these by hand now?

223
00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:14,880
What's wrong?

224
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,680
- Gu Gong. 
 - Gu Gong.

225
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,280
There's a notice saying that we must remove the waste during the day today.

226
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,740
I have no ideas, too.

227
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,180
Must we remove all these waste during daytime today?

228
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,180
These waste have been here for a day.

229
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,240
Director Zhang requires its removal by today.

230
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,480
But waste trucks aren't allowed on the road now.

231
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:39,516
I'll handle it.

232
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,920
- Mr. Zheng. 
  - What's wrong?

233
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,880
The waste piled up for a day and wasn't moved.

234
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,600
I was wondering if you could help us remove some.

235
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,780
Mr. Zheng. Mr. Zheng.

236
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,600
There's a regulation stating that

237
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,680
large trucks can only travel roads at 10 p.m.

238
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,880
Wait till tonight.

239
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,180
Are any small trucks available for the road now?

240
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,680
Mr. Zheng. Mr. Zheng.

241
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,220
Mr. Zheng.

242
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,660
Gu Gong, today's waste will pile too.

243
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,320
We have to get these out of here.

244
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,720
Large trucks can't go on the road.

245
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,080
We can only remove bit by bit via small trucks.

246
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,640
It will be slow, but it's better than nothing.

247
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,160
Gu Gong, you can set off now.

248
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,560
Okay.

249
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Come on.

250
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,160
It's been a long day. Let's drink.

251
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,060
- Thank you for the hard work. 
 - Thank you, all.

252
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:19,964
We've all worked hard.

253
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,180
Is it Gu Gong?

254
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:37,628
Come on.

255
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,040
Gu Gong, come on.

256
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,448
Take a seat.

257
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,960
Gu Gong, I think we have just a little left.

258
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,180
Let the big truck take all the rest.

259
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,400
There are about two truckloads left.

260
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,620
Yes, Gu Gong. It's been a long day.

261
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,680
- If not for you, we wouldn't have finished it today, right? 
 - Yes.

262
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,120
Well, I, A'Qiang, will toast you first.

263
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,080
Come on, cheers.

264
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,180
It's good to drink after work.

265
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,900
It seems to be hard getting that down, Gu Gong.

266
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,880
No, I don't usually drink.

267
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,660
These drinks cost Â¥10 ($1.40) a bottle.

268
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,520
We usually can't afford it.

269
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,480
We just drink cheap liquor to get by.

270
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,260
I've spent my whole life building houses for others.

271
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,680
I also want to save money to build my own house.

272
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,792
Come, let's toast your future home in advance.

273
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,480
- All right, come on. 
 - Here's a toast to you.

274
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,540
Here's a toast to you, too, Brother Qiang.

275
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,520
 Come on, come.

276
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,400
Gu Gong, I have work later

277
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,700
so I'll drink water instead of alcohol.

278
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,120
My daughter is calling me.

279
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,880
I'll take it.

280
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,200
Hello, Girl.

281
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,560
 Dad, I got first place in the exam.

282
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,900
My girl got first place again.

283
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,200
That's amazing,

284
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,140
 Dad, when will you get home?

285
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,660
 I miss you so much.

286
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,120
I miss you, too,

287
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,880
but I still have work to do here.

288
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,900
When I'm done, I will come see you.

289
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,480
-  Bye, Dad.  
 - Be good.

290
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,840
My daughter.

291
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,960
Brother Qiang, your daughter is really amazing.

292
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,600
She will surely get into a good university in the future.

293
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,580
Yes, she will certainly be a white-collar worker,

294
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,800
sitting in the office with air-conditioning earning big money.

295
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,620
Being a white-collar worker in an office is not necessarily good.

296
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,380
See those office buildings across from us.

297
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,420
The lights are on every night.

298
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,640
They must be working overtime all night.

299
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,780
But it's better than getting dusty on the construction site, right?

300
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,860
Office workers' lives are not any better than yours.

301
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,520
It seems you are not the same as us.

302
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,080
Why are you working on a construction site?

303
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,460
Construction work isn't so bad.

304
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,644
We can also make money for a wife and raise a child, right?

305
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:57,868
That's true.

306
00:22:57,868 --> 00:23:00,140
Are you married yet?

307
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,980
Not yet, but I will be soon.

308
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,320
We should cheer you in advance.

309
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,660
Right, right. We must celebrate.

310
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,860
Gu Gong, come on, may you have a child soon.

311
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,100
We must congratulate you. Come on.

312
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,240
What took you so long? I've been waiting for you.

313
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,220
I just got held up.

314
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,880
With you dressed in this way,

315
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,600
who can recognize the suave, mighty Director Gu if you walk on the streets?

316
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,040
Cut the crap and take me home.

317
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,080
You're covered in mud. This is my newly bought car.

318
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,820
You despise me, don't you?

319
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,100
I'm telling you,

320
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,720
this is the symbol of labor workers.

321
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,860
From now on, don't call me Director Gu.

322
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,000
Please call me Gu Gong.

323
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
All right, Director Gu.

324
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,800
How's Chen Lan doing? He still won't talk?

325
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,900
That guy is really challenging me. He's very stubborn.

326
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,200
Do you think it's possible that he really did it unwittingly?

327
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,200
This whole thing is a trap.

328
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,760
Chen Lan is just a part of it.

329
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,160
He wouldn't have the guts to reveal my project.

330
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,840
He is someone's tool,

331
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,420
and it's very likely Su Juan.

332
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,000
It's possible.

333
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,960
Why are you still up so late?

334
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,160
What are you studying?

335
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,604
Come on.

336
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,100
I scrutinized the waste recycling company that the contractor found.

337
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,040
Although they have professional equipment and technology,

338
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,100
their recycling rate isn't high, just less than 10%.

339
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,800
Also, a huge amount of available resources are incinerated in landfills.

340
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,340
The problem is unsolved at the root.

341
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,520
It wastes human, financial and material resources,

342
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,360
and it's not environmentally friendly.

343
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,480
I found there's a new technology to crush construction waste

344
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,280
into something truly reusable.

345
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,820
Do you seek technical research on this?

346
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,840
Exactly.

347
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,040
But to be precise,

348
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,316
I want to start a business and leave Anxia.

349
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,060
From childhood to adulthood, no matter where I go

350
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,700
and what achievements I make,

351
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,380
I've always carried the Gu family and Anxia's glory with me.

352
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,140
I've been contemplating a lot.

353
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,200
I think it's time for me to explore

354
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,620
and see what I'm capable of.

355
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,620
Do you think it's impulsive?

356
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,760
I knew it.

357
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,240
Gu Yi can't be defeated by a small pitfall.

358
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,400
Even if he stepped into the soil, he can still bloom.

359
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,560
But right now, I only have this idea.

360
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,640
To turn it into reality, it will certainly be arduous.

361
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,800
Your concept is a most important step.

362
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,680
Starting from scratch is indeed tough,

363
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,740
but the country implemented many favorable policies

364
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,740
to support innovation and enterprise.

365
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,760
I think this is a great prospect.

366
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,920
With your skills, there's no drawback.

367
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,880
Secretary Qiao, are you willing to assist me?

368
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,760
Can you afford me?

369
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,100
You're already the boss' wife, but you want even more.

370
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,832
I want it all.

371
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,400
Brother Qiang! Brother Qiang!

372
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,340
Who is it? What's wrong?

373
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,180
Something big has happened. Brother Quan got hurt.

374
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,300
How's the injured worker?

375
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,400
His life is not in danger, but he is still unconscious.

376
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,800
We have repeatedly emphasized the importance of personal safety. Why did this happen?

377
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,000
The driver said it was due to debris on the road

378
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,180
that caused the vehicle to overturn accidentally.

379
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,380
"Debris"?

380
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,600
There was a big rock.

381
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,820
Probably after the workers cleaned up the site,

382
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,440
Gu Yi did not do a good job of inspection.

383
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,800
Do you mean it's Gu Yi's negligence?

384
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,600
He's in charge of that area.

385
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,580
We checked the surveillance; there was a bump on the road back then.

386
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,180
Gu Yi caused such a big accident!

387
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,880
He must take responsibility!

388
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:25,100
Director Su, it's not proven yet so don't jump to conclusions.

389
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,240
Since it happened in the area that Gu Yi manages,

390
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,140
as a supervisor, he is responsible for it.

391
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,300
The most important thing now is the injured worker's condition.

392
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,640
Yang Yang, inform relevant department heads to meet at the company immediately.

393
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,020
Yes.

394
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,180
If you leave us,

395
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,140
how will we live?

396
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,480
What did the doctor say?

397
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,980
He had a shattered left leg, joint damage, and a concussion.

398
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,940
It's all my fault.

399
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,240
I should have stayed and dealt with it with them.

400
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,280
Didn't you check everything before you left?

401
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,780
How could something like this happen?

402
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,840
You weren't that careless.

403
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,080
The results still need to be investigated.

404
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,200
Don't blame yourself now.

405
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,060

406
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,580
As decided by the company,

407
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,280
due to poor supervision and management, Project Manager Guo Wen

408
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,920
has been dismissed.

409
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,600
In addition, Safety Director Wang Bin, Production Supervisor Xu Rong,

410
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,960
and area person in charge, Gu Yi, Coordinator Gu,

411
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,520
are suspended for serious dereliction of duty!

412
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,300
Once Lin Yong Quan wakes up,

413
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,380
we will pursue further responsibility!

414
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,560
Someone got injured. It's a production safety issue.

415
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,640
Why are you punishing me?

416
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,920
Such a big accident happened.

417
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,000
Do you think you have no responsibility?

418
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,200
Now you are here complaining. What were you doing earlier?

419
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,980
What does this have to do with Gu Gong?

420
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,800
If broken bricks weren't on the ground, would Lin Yong Quan get in an accident?

421
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,820
People like him who pull strings should have left long ago.

422
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,080
He knows nothing but to make trouble here.

423
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,780
Lin Yong Quan has a family to support.

424
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,760
He made them suffer.

425
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,300
I heard he's here because he got into trouble.

426
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,340
Stop talking nonsense here.

427
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,040
There's no construction site without accidents.

428
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,380
Right.

429
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,960
Gu Gong works seriously. We all see it with our eyes.

430
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,880
All right, quiet.

431
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,900
Everyone, pull yourselves together.

432
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,400
Follow the rules at all times

433
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,560
and keep in mind safety first!

434
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,700
 On the construction site, safety is top priority.

435
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,960
 How did this happen?

436
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,540
I'm sorry, Dad. It's my negligence.

437
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,440
It's no use apologizing to me.

438
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,820
Go apologize to the injured and his family.

439
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,800
We'll take care of his family,

440
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,380
apologize and compensate.

441
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,200
This time, was it Gu Yi's fault again?

442
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,580
I've already suspended him.

443
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,600
But we must wait for the worker to awake before we decide what to do next.

444
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,340
When did Gu Yi become so careless?

445
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,060
Situations always happen at the construction site.

446
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,200
Negligence is common.

447
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,000
I don't want to see such matters happening again.

448
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,760
Understood.

449
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:49,040

450
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,970
