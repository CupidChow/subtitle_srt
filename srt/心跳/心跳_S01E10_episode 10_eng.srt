1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:09,000

2
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:45,392

3
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:48,367

4
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,340
Is it Gu Yi?

5
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,112
Ignore him.

6
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,720
For the past three years, you've been hurt by him for my sake.

7
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,424
I promise,

8
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:19,480
I will never let you suffer any grievances anymore.

9
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,496
It's all in the past.

10
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,720
- Second Brother. 
 - Second Brother.

11
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,180
Sister-in-law.

12
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,560
Isn't this Mr. Gu? Long time no see.

13
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,100
Recently, I always see you appear in the gossip news.

14
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,360
Don't the media just love making up stories?

15
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,540
Instead of worrying about this,

16
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,900
you should worry more about your husband.

17
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,980
He's still idle at home, right?

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,380
He's getting older. It's time for him to rest.

19
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,100
Thanks to Yi for giving him a break.

20
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,360
That's not a break.

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,080
Director Gu is so selfless.

22
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,180
He can spend a fortune for a beauty,

23
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,500
but always kicks his own family out.

24
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:36,300
Son, she's your aunt, an elder.

25
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,060
The company is in your hands; you have the final say in everything.

26
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,240
Your aunt and uncle have had a hard time.

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,350
Your uncle is still unemployed and owns no property.

28
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,960
Their whole family depends on you for food.

29
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,720
Be more understanding of them.

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,172
All right, Mom, I understand.

31
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:58,600
Sister, hasn't Brother been recuperating on Xilin Mountain all this time?

32
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,100
Did he suddenly return because his condition improved?

33
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,380
It's still the same.

34
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,320
At his age, conservative care is better for him than aggressive treatment.

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,480
So the responsibility of this company will fall on Yi's shoulders in the future.

36
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,020
That is not necessarily the case.

37
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,040
"Not necessarily"? What do you mean?

38
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,520
Will you manage this company?

39
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,780
I don't have that ability, but someone does.

40
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,160
It's time. Let's go eat.

41
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,140
Son, go and call your dad.

42
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,240
I'm sorry for being late; I had a walk around.

43
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,360
Who is this?

44
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:51,160
He is my son from Su Nian.

45
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,380
He used to live outside; now he's finally back home.

46
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,200
You two just reunited as father and son;

47
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,580
I'm sure you have endless conversations.

48
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,700
It's normal to chat more.

49
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,360
Second Uncle, Aunt, Uncle-in-law, Auntie Fang,

50
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,296
my name is Su Juan.

51
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,700
Juan, sit down.

52
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,360
If everyone came to find their father here,

53
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,840
we would run out of seats here.

54
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,460
Sister-in-law, that's not right.

55
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,920
Brother and Juan have already done a paternity test.

56
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,960
He is indeed a member of the Gu family.

57
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
His last name is Su, not Gu.

58
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,620
How is he a member of the Gu family?

59
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,200
No matter what his last name is, doesn't he still have Gu family blood in him?

60
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,972
Exactly.

61
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,748
I don't recognize this illegitimate child of unknown origin.

62
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,020
If you recognize him or not doesn't matter!

63
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,280
Dad, don't be angry. I was inconsiderate.

64
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
I will change my last name later.

65
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,520
No need.

66
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,500
Just keep your mother's last name. There is no need to change.

67
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,880
By the way, Juan is a year older than Gu Yi.

68
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,960
As the younger brother, you should toast your older brother.

69
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,540
There is no need for formalities between brothers.

70
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,840
Here, let me toast you.

71
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,100
I don't have a brother.

72
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,040
I can't eat this meal anymore.

73
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,040
Gu Yi, stop!

74
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,960
Brother, look at him.

75
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,040
It's bad enough that he's like this at the company,

76
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,440
but now he's like this at home too.

77
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,980
He's absolutely out of control. You're not even important in his eyes.

78
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,660
That's right!

79
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,900
Aunt, Uncle, you can't blame him.

80
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,720
If I suddenly had an older brother, I wouldn't be used to it, either.

81
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,640
A'Juan, you're too considerate of others.

82
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,100
You cannot be so easygoing, especially at the company.

83
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:35,840
What are you saying?

84
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,400
Is he joining Anxia?

85
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,560
Yes, starting tomorrow.

86
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,350
A'Juan will join the company as the Project Development Manager.

87
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,740
Gu Yi can't manage the company alone so Juan will help him.

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,800
I can't eat this, either.

89
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,900
Dad, I am inexperienced.

90
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,220
I may not be qualified for such a high position.

91
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,500
Besides, I didn't come to join the company.

92
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,900
I want to spend more time with you.

93
00:08:20,704 --> 00:08:22,640
You don't have to be too modest.

94
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,520
I know your abilities.

95
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,400
That's right. You need to work hard.

96
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,480
We will definitely help you.

97
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,440
Definitely help you.

98
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,560
Come on, let's not worry about them. Let's start eating.

99
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,700
- Okay. 
 - Come on.

100
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,400
You came just in time. Take your things away.

101
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,120
What is it?

102
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,292
I will put the stuff back.

103
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,712
Give it to me.

104
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:12,900
Give it to me!

105
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,160
I told you to give it to me!

106
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,160
Qiao Jing.

107
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,144
Let go.

108
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:25,960
- No. 
  - Let go.

109
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,032
Let go!

110
00:09:39,168 --> 00:09:43,340
Qiao Jing, don't drive me away. I don't want to leave.

111
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,840
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!

112
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,748
Leave!

113
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:55,640
Get out!

114
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,980
Get out!

115
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,620
What on Earth have you been up to?

116
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,880
What's with this appearance?

117
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Do you know your dad actually wants Su Juan to join the company?

118
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,080
Isn't his grand return just for this?

119
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,720
But Anxia does not keep idle people.

120
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,620
He may not stay even if he gets in.

121
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,280
Son, you can't underestimate him.

122
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,480
Su Juan is not simple.

123
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,000
Even your dad, that old fox, is completely fooled by him.

124
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,140
- Let me tell you— 
 - Mom.

125
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,940
I want to be alone.

126
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,480
Gu Yi, why are you here?

127
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:16,552
Why are you here?

128
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,600
I missed you and wanted to see you.

129
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,432
Have you been drinking?

130
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,672
Come in quickly.

131
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,900
Why did you drink so much?

132
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,600
Did you have a social engagement tonight?

133
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,200
I went to the Gu family to meet relatives today.

134
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,560
I drank a little too much in excitement.

135
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,360
Are you really happy?

136
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,000
It doesn't matter if I'm happy.

137
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,520
What matters is whether the Gu family is happy.

138
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,780
If you're not happy,

139
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,500
why don't you stay away from them?

140
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,200
I have Gu family blood in me.

141
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,888
There's no choice.

142
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:26,100
And for the sake of my mom, I can't back down.

143
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,300
Stay here, your stomach is not good in the first place.

144
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,680
I'll make you some honey water.

145
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,890

146
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,920
Everyone in the president's office, listen up.

147
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,640
Notify all middle and senior-level employees in the company

148
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,120
that they must attend Mr. Su's induction ceremony tomorrow at 9 a.m.

149
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,280
"Mr. Su"? Who is he?

150
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,700
The new Project Development Manager appointed by Senior Gu.

151
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,180
I heard Mr. Su is Senior Gu's illegitimate son.

152
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,620
He has only recently come to the Gu family.

153
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,140
How dare he be so public?

154
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,140
He surely wants to seize Director Gu's power.

155
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,940
This company was built and prospered by Director Gu.

156
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,292
How could a paratrooper possibly take away Director Gu's power?

157
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:10,180
That's right.

158
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,880
We must resist who parachutes in

159
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,200
and defend the world's best president.

160
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,500
A'Juan, don't worry.

161
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,220
It is your first day at the company. We must hold a proper ceremony.

162
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,820
I have already arranged it for you.

163
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,800
All the company's mid-and-upper-level employees will be here.

164
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,560
Actually, there's no need for such a big fuss.

165
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,460
How can that be? You are the young master of Anxia.

166
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,880
You can't lose face (dignity).

167
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,840
Where are they?

168
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,440
Where are the decorations I asked for?

169
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,960
It's outrageous.

170
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,140
Do they still have any regard for us at all?

171
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,880
Aunt, it's fine.

172
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,460
Everyone might be busy with work.

173
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,740
It's normal for them not to have time.

174
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,340
How is it possible that everyone has no time?

175
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,600
Didn't I say to attend Mr. Su's induction ceremony at nine?

176
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,520
Where did everyone go?

177
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,820
Director Gu called a meeting of all executives on short notice.

178
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,900
Everyone is in the meeting room right now.

179
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,200
- I knew it. Let's go. 
 - Aunt.

180
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,040
Miss Jian. Your design is useless.

181
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,480
That's why the property can't sell.

182
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,540
There were no problems during the assessment of these blueprints. Now there are problems?

183
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,040
There were no problems with the assessment.

184
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,700
The property is not selling due to a problem with your design.

185
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,540
Enough!

186
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,640
I want solutions,

187
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,140
not debates over blaming.

188
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,100
Have you any solutions?

189
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,680
Director Gu, you summoned everyone

190
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,980
and prevented them from attending Mr. Su's induction ceremony.

191
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,220
What do you mean by that?

192
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,900
Yang, please ask unrelated personnel to leave.

193
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,780
"Unrelated personnel"?

194
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,380
He's the project development manager personally appointed by Senior Gu.

195
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,160
Is he unrelated personnel?

196
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,560
What does it matter if Senior Gu personally appoints him?

197
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,640
Anxia prioritizes capability over messy relationships.

198
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,260
Aunt.

199
00:17:10,884 --> 00:17:12,440
Director Gu is right.

200
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,520
We should rely on our abilities in the company.

201
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,900
Everyone here is my senior.

202
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,300
Please give me guidance in the future.

203
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,740
Everyone seems to be discussingt the unsold property in the new district.

204
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,720
I have some humble opinions here.

205
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,320
I don't know if my opinions can help everyone.

206
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,400
Senior Gu had previously shown me information on the new district property.

207
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,800
In terms of design, there are indeed some problems,

208
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,200
but since it's an existing property, it can't be adjusted at the moment.

209
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,440
If we sell it at a discount, it's not cost-effective and will damage Anxia's reputation.

210
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,140
So in order to maximize profits,

211
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,640
I believe we should convert these properties into apartments

212
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,300
only available for rent and not for sale.

213
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,440
Mr. Su, you have a poor understanding of the market.

214
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,100
The profit from renting is not as high as selling.

215
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,100
In the short term, that's true.

216
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,600
But this property is located in the new development zone of Changming City.

217
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,960
The local government is vigorously supporting and reforming rental policies.

218
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,840
Due to the low short-term profits, only a few real estate companies have responded.

219
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,200
If Anxia can set an example at this juncture,

220
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,980
not only can we get the first wave of policy benefits, but also improve Anxia's reputation.

221
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,140
Anxia can enter the Changming market quickly

222
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,500
by responding to policy calls and benefiting people.

223
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,840
Why not trade temporary losses for long-term benefits?

224
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,000
Director Gu, this plan seems feasible at the moment.

225
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,200
Mr. Su is not bad.

226
00:18:52,136 --> 00:18:56,400
In that case, you will be in charge of this project.

227
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,160
I need to see the project's implementation plan within three days.

228
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,380
How does it feel to suddenly have an older brother?

229
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,216
- Do you want it? 
 - No, I can't afford that.

230
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,720
Su Juan is quite capable.

231
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,220
He demonstrated his abilities on his first day at the company.

232
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,560
He's not stupid, indeed.

233
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,420
So you've accepted him?

234
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,320
I thought you couldn't wait to tear him apart.

235
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,140
For the company, he is a competent employee who can bring profit to the company.

236
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,620
I have no reason not to accept him.

237
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,420
What about personally?

238
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,180
Let's not mention that.

239
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,240
My friend, I'm here to drink with you.

240
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,600
Let's be happy, all right?

241
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,800
Drink it.

242
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,000
She threw away the stuff I bought for her.

243
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,620
She doesn't even want me anymore.

244
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,284
I tell you,

245
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,520
she is so cruel!

246
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,100
Even if I die, I won't go back.

247
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,980
You have a moral backbone.

248
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,900
Here, bottoms up.

249
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,800
How come you're here?

250
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,480
Why can't I be here?

251
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,460
What is going on between her and me has nothing to do with you.

252
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,040
Director Gu, don't take yourself too seriously.

253
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,240
I am sure you are well aware that you are just my substitute.

254
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,600
If it weren't for me, Qiao Jing wouldn't even look at you.

255
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,530
That was before.

256
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,340
Now, she cares about me.

257
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,700
What makes you think that?

258
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,600
Just because you called off your engagement once for her?

259
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:08,700
Did you forget how you treated her for the last three years?

260
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,860
Do you think a few sweet words or a few insignificant little things will make her forgive you?

261
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,864
I am telling you,

262
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,720
it is impossible.

263
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,600
You and your mother ruined my family,

264
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,000
separating me and Qiao Jing for four years.

265
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,940
Now that the real is back,

266
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,480
it's time for you to step down.

267
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,032
My brother.

268
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,768
Su Juan,

269
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,004
are you all right?

270
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,800
Are you so worried about him?

271
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
What are you doing here again?

272
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,600
Now he's back, do you not want to see me anymore?

273
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,260
Qiao Jing, do not forget how you cried and begged me

274
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,260
for three years just to get my attention.

275
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,620
Now he is back, you must be happy and want to be rid of me, right?

276
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,160
Qiao Jing, I tell you, it's impossible!

277
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,120
Didn't you promise to be with me forever?

278
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,760
You cannot break your promise no matter what.

279
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,180
We got like this because of you.

280
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,060
A liar who played me has no right to mention promises!

281
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,960
Qiao Jing.

282
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,560
Stop entrapping.

283
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,264
Let go.

284
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,660
Move your hand!

285
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,400
Come in.

286
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,460
Director Gu, this document needs your signature.

287
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,900
Anything else?

288
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,780
Director Gu, this…

289
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,880

290
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,740
Reprint it.

291
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,260
Okay.

292
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,780
Jin Lin, thank you for organizing a welcome party for me.

293
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,200
It's what we're supposed to do.

294
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,092
Director Gu, we'd like to have a welcome party for Mr. Su.

295
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:39,860
- If you're free, join us for some fun. 
 - I don't have time.

296
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,080
All who can eat with Director Gu are well-known in their fields

297
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,860
so it must be awkward for him to be with us.

298
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,656
Don't make it hard for him.

299
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,840
Who says I am going to be awkward?

300
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,360
Today, everyone from the president's office is going.

301
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:18,540
I can resurface fully no matter how tired I am from work if I can eat hot pot.

302
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,960
This restaurant is hard to book.

303
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,140
Eat more, or you won't know when you'll get another chance here.

304
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,360
Excuse me for a moment.

305
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,340
Our restaurant recently launched a spicy food challenge.

306
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,120
The more chilies you eat within ten minutes, the higher the reward.

307
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,960
If you can fully complete the challenge, you can get a three-month free voucher for our restaurant.

308
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,200
I wonder if you're interested in taking the challenge.

309
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,580
With three months of free vouchers, eating hot pot daily is no longer a pipe dream.

310
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,270
Why don't we have a competition?

311
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,880
Mr. Su, what do you think?

312
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,840
You guys go ahead.

313
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,040
I prefer lighter flavors and can't eat spicy food.

314
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,360
I'll join.

315
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,060
Some people are not light-tasting; they are simply terrified.

316
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,780
The spiciness of the chili peppers in front of you increases from left to right.

317
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,240
For safety's sake, please start the challenge with the lowest spiciness.

318
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,080
Ready, three, two, one, begin.

319
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,256
Why is it so hot?

320
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:52,400
I didn't notice that.

321
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,700
Go. Director Gu, go.

322
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,680
Mr. Su, go.

323
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,920
Director Gu, go.

324
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,320
Go, go!

325
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,200
Director Gu, go.

326
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,060
Go!

327
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,300
Go on!

328
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,480
Mr. Su, Mr. Su, go!

329
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,220
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Almost there!

330
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,300
You're almost winning, Mr. Su.

331
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,620
Mr. Su, keep it up!

332
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,560
Director Gu, are you all right?

333
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,388
Yes.

334
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,360
Mr. Su, come on, come on, come on.

335
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,680
Mr. Su, keep going, you can do it.

336
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,916
You're about to win, Mr. Su!

337
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:50,236
- There's a smaller one over there. 
 - Come on, victory is in sight.

338
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:51,692
Come on.

339
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,340
- Mr. Su. 
 - Mr. Su, go, go, go.

340
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,660
Director Gu, keep it up.

341
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,504
You can do it.

342
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,490
It's okay, it's okay.

343
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,840
Drink some water.

344
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,260
Yes, take a break.

345
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,780
Yes, yes.

346
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,410
So capable!

347
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,760
So amazing.

348
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:25,664

349
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,640
Send the other female colleagues home first.

350
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,732
It's already arranged. Director Gu, are you all right? I have stomach medicine in my bag.

351
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:33,660
No need, you go first.

352
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,100
Are you really okay?

353
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,500
Of course, I'm fine. Just go.

354
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,760
All right, take care then.

355
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,860
What's wrong? Is your stomach hurting?

356
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,880
It's fine. I ate something spicy.

357
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,960
Why would you eat so much spicy foods? Come, I'll take you home.

358
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,604
Qiao Jing, I'm uncomfortable, too.

359
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,920
If you're uncomfortable, see a doctor. Why look for me?

360
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:54,010

361
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,330
 "The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

362
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:15,532
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

363
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:22,390
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

364
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,276
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

365
00:31:28,276 --> 00:31:35,610
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

366
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,544
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

367
00:31:42,544 --> 00:31:48,108
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

368
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:54,574
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

369
00:31:54,574 --> 00:32:00,368
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

370
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:04,063
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

371
00:32:04,063 --> 00:32:07,667
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

372
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:13,753
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

373
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:20,058
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

374
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:25,894
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

375
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:29,676
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

376
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:33,258
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

377
00:32:33,258 --> 00:32:36,902
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

378
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:43,070
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

379
00:32:43,954 --> 00:32:47,241
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

380
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:52,148
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

381
00:32:52,148 --> 00:32:58,459
♫  This unbearable plot  ♫

382
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:04,916
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫

383
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:10,919
♫  Being a guest may be my other destiny  ♫

384
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:18,120
♫  As the one who left, what gives me the right to care?  ♫

385
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:24,155
♫  After all, you're the one who finally got married, and I'm just a guest  ♫

386
00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:30,479
♫  I drained all the memories to celebrate your wedding  ♫

387
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:36,312
♫  But I never had the courage to bless you  ♫

388
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:46,880
♫  Thank you for making me finally aware and returning me back to myself  ♫

389
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:57,312
♫  At least I can still be a guest to witness your love  ♫

390
00:33:57,312 --> 00:34:01,224
♫  He's so lucky to have met you  ♫

391
00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:12,306
♫  I hope he loves you more than I do  ♫
