1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,020

2
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,524

3
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:48,555

4
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,200
When you're onstage, just concentrate on your performance.

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,420
Don't think about anything else. Understand?

6
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,772
Good Girl.

7
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,400
- Mrs. Gu. 
 - Xiao Yun.

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,080
Auntie.

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,440
Why have you come?

10
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,900
This is your first concert performance in China.

11
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,280
How could we not attend?

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,180
I wish you success in your performance.

13
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:43,412
Thank you.

14
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,080
It's time; you should go onstage.

15
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,192
Good luck.

16
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,976
Don't be nervous.

17
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,580
Believe in yourself.

18
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:28,492

19
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,736
  How does it feel?

20
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:40,840
 Are you delighted seeing him do so much for you?

21
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,720
 Does it feel good to have him under your control?

22
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,460
What's going on?

23
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,540
 - How is it none of my business?  
 - Hurry and stop this!

24
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,100
- Quick, turn it off. 
 -  If not for you,

25
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,880
 we would have married already!

26
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,700
 Can you get whatever you want and have no fear due to that baby?

27
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,620
 Do you think you can marry into the Gu family because of this baby?

28
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,876
 Let me go!

29
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:10,600
 This baby is a stain on Gu Yi's reputation.

30
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,200
 The Gu family won't recognize him; they won't even let him be born.

31
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,580
 Come back here! Stop right there!

32
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,960
 Stop right there! Stop right there!

33
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,340
 Let's leave.

34
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,220
How could you have a recording?

35
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,580
That recording is fake!

36
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,220
 - Should I call an ambulance?  
 - She's deceiving you!

37
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,920
 This isn't the right road, is it?

38
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,720
 Where are we going exactly?

39
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,400
  Miss Qiao, this is the correct route.

40
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,160
 We'll arrive soon.

41
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,300

42
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,750

43
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,400
You must accept the results of your actions.

44
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,100
- Who do you think you are? You're a crazy woman! 
 - Xiao Yun.

45
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,920
Security! Security! Kick her out!

46
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,444
Get away!

47
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,200
- Xiao Yun! 
 - Bai Yun, what is going on?

48
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,592
- It wasn't me; it wasn't me. 
 - Xiao Yun!

49
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:45,280
Are you okay, Xiao Yun?

50
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,680
- Xiao Yun, are you okay? 
 - It wasn't me.

51
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,380
- It really wasn't me. 
 - Xiao Yun!

52
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,580
She's framing me.

53
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,580
- Gu Yi. 
 - Xiao Yun!

54
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,600
Don't you know exactly what's going on?

55
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,980
Are you really unaware of what she's done?

56
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,848
Xiao Yun!

57
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:00,040
I really don't know.

58
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,188
Quick. Get up.

59
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,796
Xiao Yun.

60
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,480
Enough, I've called the police.

61
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,760
Explain it to the police.

62
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,400
Xiao Yun, quickly get up.

63
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,900
Get up quickly. Listen to me. I'm here.

64
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,400
- Bai Yun, exactly what's going on with all this? 
 - It wasn't me.

65
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,760
Xiao Yun, it's okay, it's okay. Xiao Yun!

66
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,140

67
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:51,368

68
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,460
These people know nothing and are just making stuff up.

69
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,080
Hurry and find a way to clear it up.

70
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,480
Now that the recording has become public,

71
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,580
there's no way to fix the mess.

72
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,000
Then what should we do?

73
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,240
Do we let them slander Xiao Yun?

74
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,180
Auntie, where's Xiao Yun?

75
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,940
Since returning from the concert,

76
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,840
she shut herself in her room and won't come out.

77
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,980
Have you come to lecture me, too?

78
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,560
Why did you do it?

79
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,040
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

80
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,180
I don't know.

81
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,340
I'd already decided to give up on Gu Yi.

82
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,660
I decided not to think of him anymore.

83
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,860
But when I heard that Qiao Jing was pregnant,

84
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,400
I truly couldn't bear it.

85
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,500
Zhou Rui,

86
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,460
have I ruined my life?

87
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,120
No. Trust me.

88
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,720
You didn't.

89
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,200
Hello, we're looking for Bai Yun.

90
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,060
She is involved in an intentional injury case.

91
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,280
The police are summoning her according to the law.

92
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,580
Not long ago, you knelt before me

93
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,140
and said how sincere your feelings were toward Qiao Jing.

94
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,700
But what's happened?

95
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,700
You couldn't even protect your own baby!

96
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,280
This can't be entirely blamed on him.

97
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,160
You should have told me earlier

98
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,280
about such an important matter!

99
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,260
The baby was already gone by the time I found out.

100
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,620
At first, I thought that even though Bai Yun has a bad temper,

101
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,380
she is still basically innocent.

102
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,432
I didn't expect her to even scheme against me.

103
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:53,180
In the end, it was still Gu Family's flesh and blood.

104
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,440
From now on, we're cutting ties with the Bai family.

105
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,040
It's a pity about the baby.

106
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,280
Xiao Yun was taken away by the police.

107
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,140
She deserves it.

108
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,560
Xiao Yun just acted on impulse in the moment.

109
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,280
She... she knows she did wrong.

110
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,700
Can you convince Qiao Jing to resolve this privately?

111
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,080
The Gu family baby is gone.

112
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,760
How can the Bai family settle this privately?

113
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,400
Do you really want to watch Xiao Yun go to jail?

114
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,500
She did all this for you!

115
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,820
She's an adult; she should be responsible for her actions.

116
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,060
I know you've never loved Xiao Yun.

117
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,100
But we all grew up together.

118
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,300
Don't you care about all those years of friendship?

119
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,680
She shouldn't have laid hands on Qiao Jing, let alone my baby.

120
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,260
So you want to pursue this until the end?

121
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,100
You haven't fully recovered. You can't drink anymore.

122
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,280
Qiao Jing!

123
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,160
The baby is gone.

124
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,060
Why should I care?

125
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,620
Bai Yun was taken in for questioning by the police.

126
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,180
You fulfilled your responsibility to the baby.

127
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,640
The baby is gone.

128
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,280
So what difference does it make?

129
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,120
Qiao Jing, I'm sorry.

130
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,820
You're awake.

131
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,420
You drank quite a bit last night. Do you have a headache?

132
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,180
Do you need more sleep?

133
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,660
It's fine.

134
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,000
I've imposed on you all night. I'll go home now.

135
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,320
I'll see you home.

136
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,480
No need.

137
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,000
I can go on my own.

138
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,300
Miss Qiao, can we come in and sit down for a while?

139
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,920
Miss Qiao, we harmed you.

140
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,300
Xiao Yun was not in her right mind

141
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,700
and did such a terrible thing.

142
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,620
As her mother, I was the one who didn't educate her properly.

143
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,320
She is young and immature.

144
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,640
When faced with a problem, she is prone to extremes.

145
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,360
But she now knows she was wrong.

146
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,520
Miss Qiao, could you please give her a chance?

147
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,140
No matter how young or immature she is,

148
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,700
what does that have to do with me?

149
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,540
Why should my baby's life be sacrificed to compensate for her mistakes?

150
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,580
Qiao Jing, the baby is already gone.

151
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,420
However much you pursue Xiao Yun, the baby can't return.

152
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,240
As long as you write a letter of understanding,

153
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,480
we'll compensate you however you want.

154
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,200
Unless I'm dying, I won't write such a letter of understanding in my lifetime.

155
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,860
Miss Qiao, I have only this one daughter.

156
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,120
Her father passed away early. I've raised her alone since she was young.

157
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,200
I did spoil her. That's all my fault.

158
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,900
But she's my only hope.

159
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,580
I cannot... live without her, Miss Qiao.

160
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,140
Since you care so much about your daughter,

161
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,160
then you should realize how I feel.

162
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,720
If you were the one who lost a child today,

163
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,680
would you choose to forgive?

164
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,920
Miss Qiao, I'm sorry!

165
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,660
But I'm begging you!

166
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,400
It's all my fault.

167
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,120
I was the one who spoiled her!

168
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,620
Give her a chance.

169
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,760
Whatever compensation you want,

170
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,580
I will give it to you. Okay?

171
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,980
Miss Qiao.

172
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,460
Auntie. Auntie, let's go.

173
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,020
Miss Qiao, sorry for disturbing you.

174
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,180
It appears that reconciliation with Qiao Jing isn't possible.

175
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,860
What will happen to Xiao Yun?

176
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
Auntie, don't worry.

177
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,780
We'll think of some other way.

178
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,740
Lawyer Wang says that Xiao Yun has confessed to everything.

179
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,840
Du Huan is also involved in this.

180
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,488
"Du Huan"?

181
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,180
I just knew Xiao Yun didn't have such a scheming mind.

182
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,500
How could such a thing happen?

183
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,140
It must have been Du Huan who provoked her.

184
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,860
If something happens to Xiao Yun,

185
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,020
I won't let Du Huan off.

186
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,680
I won't let anything happen to Xiao Yun.

187
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,840
Miss Du, where are you going?

188
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,320
You're Xiao Yun's manager.

189
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,120
She just got into trouble, and you're planning to flee?

190
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,776
Of course not.

191
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:33,400
Xiao Yun has some overseas business to terminate.

192
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,920
I'm just going to take care of that.

193
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,220
You're not going to leave and never return, are you?

194
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,140
Xiao Yun and I worked together so many years.

195
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,160
I see her as a younger sister.

196
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,320
How could I abandon her?

197
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,300
"Younger sister"?

198
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,900
But what sister would encourage her younger sister to do wrong?

199
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,500
You taught Xiao Yun to do those things to Qiao Jing, right?

200
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,820
I have no grudges against Qiao Jing.

201
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,880
Why would I instigate Xiao Yun to harm her?

202
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,320
You don't have any grudges.

203
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,900
But every time you come up with ideas for Xiao Yun, you get some benefits.

204
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,020
Since you like money so much, why not do me a favor?

205
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,648
What favor?

206
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,840

207
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:26,780

208
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,420
Why can't it be done?

209
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,620
Hasn't Du Huan already admitted that she did this all on her own?

210
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,200
Miss Bai confessed voluntarily, and the evidence is conclusive.

211
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,300
The police already investigated everything.

212
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,320
It doesn't matter how hard Du Huan tries.

213
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,380
The only way now is to get a letter of understanding

214
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,920
and petition for leniency.

215
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,860
But Qiao Jing... refuses to sign a letter of understanding.

216
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,900
Boss, she's awake.

217
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,820
All right, time to get to work.

218
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,600
What are you guys doing?

219
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,480
Our job is to get something from you.

220
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:55,860

221
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,460
Did the Bai family send you?

222
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,980
Don't worry about that.

223
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,960
I'm just taking money from the wealthy to fix their trouble.

224
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,620
Give up your plan. I won't sign.

225
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,180
Won't you sign?

226
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,860
If you refuse to sign, your lovely face will have a few scars.

227
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,440
How can I sign when I'm tied up?

228
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,440
Don't try any tricks.

229
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,520
Quick, get up.

230
00:27:00,644 --> 00:27:03,380
- Will you sign or not? 
 - I won't sign!

231
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,200
Gu Yi!

232
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:13,984
Qiao Jing!

233
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,520
Let her go! I've already called the police!

234
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,660
Gu Yi! Get out of here, Gu Yi!

235
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,260
Here comes someone else looking to die.

236
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,880
Gu Yi, watch out!

237
00:27:43,748 --> 00:27:45,372
Gu Yi!

238
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,700
Don't move! Put down your weapon!

239
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,060
Gu Yi! Gu Yi!

240
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:16,156
Gu Yi!

241
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,024
Gu Yi!

242
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,680
Stop! Don't run!

243
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,560
- Get in! Get in! 
 - What are you doing?

244
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,700
Gu Yi! Gu Yi!

245
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,700
 Gu Yi! Gu Yi, let me out!

246
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,960
Now, it's my turn to protect you.

247
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:42,760
 Gu Yi!

248
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,520
Run! Start running again.

249
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,740
 - Gu Yi!  
 - Get him!

250
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,084
Gu Yi!

251
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,580
 Gu Yi!

252
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,800
 Gu Yi! Gu Yi!

253
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,040
Break the car window!

254
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,140
Get her out!
