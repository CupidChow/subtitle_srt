1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,070

2
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:45,552

3
00:00:45,552 --> 00:00:48,404

4
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,200
Now, please welcome the new CEO, Su Juan.

5
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,576

6
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,780
To everyone at Anxia, a lot happens in the group during this time.

7
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,780
However, we can't let them stop us.

8
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,760
We can't fail Senior Gu.

9
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,040
We must keep up the good work.

10
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,780
 As a precaution, I record a video as evidence.

11
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,060
 My property and savings

12
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,240
 are owned jointly by me and my spouse, Fang Pei.

13
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,220
 As for my part, it will be divided equally among the rest of my family.

14
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,800
 As for the 80% of the shares in Anxia,

15
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,760
 Gu Yi inherits 50%,

16
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,020
 Su Juan 10%,

17
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,220
 Gu Yu 10%, and Gu Ying 10%.

18
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,772
 Gu Yi, the company is now in your hands.

19
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:12,760
 As a CEO,

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,120
 I hope you'll run the company well.

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,100
 As your father,

22
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,900
 I may not have been a good father.

23
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,632
 Over the years,

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,500
 I've always been proud of you.

25
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,540
 Watching you make the company better and better,

26
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,960
 I am proud but also scared.

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,480
 You've had a smooth journey;

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,380
 I fear you haven't learned to deal with failure.

29
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,080
 I also don't have time to teach you

30
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,720
 so I transferred you to the construction site

31
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,840
 to give you a trial.

32
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,360
 Fortunately, you didn't fail me.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,240
 During that time, you didn't fuss or complain.

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,140
 Instead, you found future inspiration.

35
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,320
 I believe, soon you'll build your own company.

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,860
 You're a lot like me, but also very unique.

37
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,500
 You're a responsible man.

38
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:48,036
 In my life, I've failed two people:

39
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,400
 one is your mother,

40
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,380
 and the other is Su Nian.

41
00:03:58,148 --> 00:04:02,870
 Su Juan, I know you've always blamed me.

42
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,500
 I'm sorry to you and your mother.

43
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,460
 I would do anything to make amends.

44
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,420
 The company is the effort of many people.

45
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,720
 I hope you'll assist Gu Yi to manage the company.

46
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,232
Su Juan!

47
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,420
I've cleaned everything up.

48
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,400
Where did you find the video?

49
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,760
You thought to control everything, but got cheated by yourself.

50
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,120
You overacted.

51
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,960
Is it that painting?

52
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,440
 Miss Qiao, what are you doing?

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,840
 I know this is wrong, and it's crossing the line,

54
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,320
 but we need the truth.

55
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,000
 Yang Yang, do you trust Director Gu?

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,840
 Do you trust me?

57
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,710
This chip was hidden in the scroll of the painting,

58
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,700
which held the video left by Senior Gu.

59
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,460
At this point, what do you want to explain?

60
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,940
A'Juan, what's going on?

61
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,640
Su Juan, you failed me!

62
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,180
How dare you tamper with the will?

63
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,540
Why wouldn't I?

64
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,572
-  Director Su. 
 - Lawyer Zhao.

65
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:00,052
 Thanks (for the water.)

66
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,500
 My dad suddenly wanted to change his will today

67
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,020
 and asked you to bring the original copy,

68
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,420
 but he's been in a coma since he took the medicine,

69
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,600
 and I don't know when he'll wake up.

70
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,240
 It's okay. Call me anytime when he needs me.

71
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,500
 Thank you, Lawyer Zhao.

72
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,260
 Director Su, you are welcome.

73
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,940
 Lawyer Zhao, are you okay?

74
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,496
 I'm fine.

75
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:40,000
 I must have eaten something bad at noon.

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,600
 How could you suddenly throw up like this?

77
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,460
What has Gu family ever done to you?

78
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,300
How dared you do such a thing?

79
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,780
Dad felt guilty toward you

80
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,640
and tried to make it up to you,

81
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,520
but he couldn't stop your crazy ambition.

82
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,480
You schemed against him every second you were around him.

83
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,200
Who is scheming exactly?

84
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,900
You don't deserve to be here.

85
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
Get out of Anxia!

86
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,820
I didn't expect we still overlooked it.

87
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,880
Gu Nan was really cunning.

88
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,260
 A'Juan, I really like the painting you bought.

89
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,580
 We're all family. This is what I should do.

90
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,260
 Good things like this should be well-preserved.

91
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,916
 Keep it safe.

92
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,900
What use was tampering with the will in advance?

93
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,260
What's the use of turning the safe upside down?

94
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,900
I didn't expect

95
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,480
he would tamper with the painting I gave him.

96
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,460
Su Juan.

97
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
What a father-and-son love.

98
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,296
 Fang Pei,

99
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,660
 all these years,

100
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,780
 I've been regretting.

101
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,860
 For the company, for work,

102
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,460
 I've neglected you

103
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,900
 and failed Su Nian.

104
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,000
 You were with me so many years,

105
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,080
 and I've rarely seen you smile.

106
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,640
 Although we always quarrel,

107
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,900
 I know, in your heart,

108
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
 there's only me.

109
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,940
 Thank you.

110
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,580
 You are returning to Anxia tomorrow.

111
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,060
What do you plan to do with the new company?

112
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,380
I'll keep developing the new company.

113
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,400
It's now part of Anxia's industrial chain.

114
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,760
My dad was right.

115
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,480
Over the years, under the Gu family's protection,

116
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,660
I haven't suffered or failed.

117
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,340
 Now, everyone advocates for environmental protection.

118
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,680
 I believe the new company will grow together with Anxia.

119
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,440
All right, I'll be with you.

120
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,200
 He was a sharp knife

121
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,340
 but now he's blunt.

122
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,820
 I can't hand over the company to him.

123
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,780
Gu Yi is a blunt knife,

124
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,280
and I'm his whetstone (grinder).

125
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,768
CEO Gu.

126
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:39,328
CEO Gu, you need to go over the new project.

127
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:40,360
 CEO Gu, hello.

128
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,080
- Send it to my office later. 
 - All right.

129
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,740
Su Juan's tampering with the will has been filed for investigation.

130
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,280
Jiang Sheng, as accomplice, will also be legally responsible.

131
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,640
The results will be out soon.

132
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,228
Su Juan will fully lose his inheritance.

133
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:56,000
I just returned. I'll change some company personnel.

134
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
CEO Gu, what is it?

135
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,160
I'll start an environmental company,

136
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,460
and I need a director in the PR department and a manager in the project department.

137
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,680
I wonder if any of you would like to apply.

138
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,120
The salary may not be as much as Anxia's,

139
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,300
but there are stock options and bonuses.

140
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,000
CEO Gu, do you think I look like a PR director?

141
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,600
Exactly like you.

142
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
CEO Gu, I want to ask

143
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,340
how many hours a day the project manager works?

144
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,980
What time does he get off work? And are statutory holidays and weekends guaranteed?

145
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,220
Here is the most important one:

146
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,600
how are bonuses calculated?

147
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,140
The project department is the company's core.

148
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,360
During the company's initial stage, it might be a bit tough.

149
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:52,920
All right. From now on, I change my name to "Tang Work Hard."

150
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,140
CEO Gu, what about me?

151
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,412
Are there any new positions over there?

152
00:14:57,412 --> 00:14:58,560
No.

153
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,440
He did mention only two.

154
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,240
But Anxia still needs a

155
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,940
serious, responsible general secretary to assist the new CEO.

156
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,360
New CEO?

157
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,520
The new company will use a lot of my energy.

158
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,880
I need someone to help me lead Anxia.

159
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,520
So I asked my second uncle, Gu Yu, to be the new CEO of Anxia.

160
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,480
He will run Anxia with me.

161
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,560
Congratulations, Brother Yang, you're promoted.

162
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,380
- You have to treat us a meal. 
 - Yes.

163
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,800
Okay!

164
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,580
CEO Gu, thank you.

165
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,620
Su Juan, we should go.

166
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,496
Su Juan.

167
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,184
Su Juan.

168
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,700
CEO Gu, aren't you leaving yet?

169
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,104
I'm waiting for someone.

170
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,200
Must be Miss Qiao.

171
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,480
Well, then we won't be the third wheel.

172
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,000
There are still two minutes; we are leaving.

173
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,040
You guys go for dinner;

174
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
- I'll pay the bill. 
 -  Wow!

175
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,080
CEO Gu, thank you!

176
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,340
- Let's go. 
 - Thank you, CEO Gu.

177
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,050

178
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,160
Hello.

179
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:59,644
Su Juan.

180
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,700
Gu Yi, you won.

181
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,140
At this point, no one wins.

182
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,380
You have everything.

183
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,400
Of course, you can say nice words.

184
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,720
Even if Dad gave you the company,

185
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,880
my attitude would still be the same.

186
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,800
You are his favorite son,

187
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,160
and I'm just your stepping stone!

188
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,720
How could he possibly give me the company?

189
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,400
Dad never played favorites with anyone.

190
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,340
He had been caring for you.

191
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,240
But you did too much wrong so he was disappointed in you!

192
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:41,756
Gu Yi.

193
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:44,240
Where is he?

194
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,440
Didn't we agree to have dinner tonight?

195
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,460
 Mom, Su Juan asked me to meet him on the rooftop.

196
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,920
 Just wait for me in the office.

197
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,260
If he had cared about me,

198
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,680
where was he when my mom was sick?

199
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,860
At family reunions, did he ever think of me and my mom?

200
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,820
You won the company and Qiao Jing!

201
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,800
You won everything!

202
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:20,560
Why?

203
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
Why should I be the one to lose?

204
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,220
You brought this all on yourself!

205
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,220
You failed Dad by lying.

206
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,720
You didn't fulfill Qiao Jing's hopes and love.

207
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,240
You used Zhou Rui, Bai Yun, and many innocent people.

208
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,000
How dare you still ask why?

209
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,160
Then how dared you kill my mom?

210
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,480
After you pay with your blood, come reason with me then!

211
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,840
Son!

212
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,680
Don't come here!

213
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,460
Su Juan, calm down!

214
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,040
I was calm for so many years,

215
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,440
and endured so long just to avenge my mom!

216
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,120
Now it's my time.

217
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,740
Why should I calm down?

218
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,840
Su Juan,

219
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,280
if you want revenge, come at me.

220
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,340
Don't hurt Gu Yi.

221
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,200
It was my fault.

222
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,420
I was the one who did wrong!

223
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,160
I feared that your arrival would threaten Gu Yi

224
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,000
so I asked Yao Shun De to stop you from meeting Gu Nan.

225
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,540
I never meant to hurt you.

226
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,900
I didn't know Yao Shun De would tamper with your car,

227
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,660
nor did I know that your mom was so seriously ill.

228
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,920
Do you think I'm stupid?

229
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,060
No!

230
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,540
You don't have to believe me,

231
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,860
but Gu Yi is innocent.

232
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,500
He saved you when your car failed.

233
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,440
If he didn't block your car,

234
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,320
you would already be dead.

235
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,040
If the hospital didn't find a good match for his heart,

236
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,200
he would long have died, too.

237
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,600
You are still making up stories.

238
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,640
It's true.

239
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,920
Gu Yi did have a heart transplant.

240
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,200
Back then I approached him

241
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,176
because I thought his heart... was donated from you.

242
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,180
I've been trying to hide it from Gu Yi,

243
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,612
but…

244
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:58,540
So I kept it a secret.

245
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,760
But I swear,

246
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,140
every word I said today is true.

247
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,140
You can check or verify.

248
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,320
I can get you all the information you need.

249
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,920
I've lost half my life just like you have.

250
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,000
You didn't do anything wrong.

251
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,420
You didn't, either.

252
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,600
What about me?

253
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,440
Whom should I take revenge on for my mom's death?

254
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,400
Who's responsible for my mom's death? You tell me!

255
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,960
I'll take responsibility. Su Juan.

256
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,210
If you want a life for a life, then take mine.

257
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,750
Don't hurt my son.

258
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,900
I beg you. Don't hurt my son.

259
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,544
Mom!

260
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,720
Too late. The truth comes too late.

261
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,540
Su Juan, are you crazy?

262
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:07,300
Yes, I'm insane.

263
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,820
Because I don't understand,

264
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,680
why does the world turn against me?

265
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,640
Why did the person I love leave me?

266
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,140
What were these years of revenge for?

267
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,140
You give me a reason to live.

268
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,628
Let go. Let go of the knife.

269
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,040
It's easy to just die.

270
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,780
You're so selfish.

271
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,480
You said you care about your mom!

272
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,170
Is this what you can do?

273
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,260
To the people who were hurt and used by you,

274
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,600
won't you take any responsibility?

275
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,880
I don't want to lose any more family members.

276
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,660
Brother!

277
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,960
Mr. Sun and Mr. Wu are back in the country.

278
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,800
They're witnesses to your father's will.

279
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,380
Before, Su Juan forged a fake will and deliberately sent them abroad.

280
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,260
Now they got the message and returned.

281
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,760
They want to know what you will do about it.

282
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,200
Maybe we should drop the charges.

283
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:33,020
What Su Juan did is in the past, and we know why.

284
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,700
Besides, your dad always wanted us to be a family.

285
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,400
Let's not hurt our feelings over the will.

286
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,480
I've already dropped the charges.

287
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,968
But he chose to confess his crime.

288
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,000
I respect his decision.

289
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,936
When he comes back, we'll start over as a family.

290
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,080
I often go to visit Xiao Yun.

291
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,140
She went from being scared then sad, to remorse then resolved.

292
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,200
She seems to have grown up.

293
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,780
It's good that she can change.

294
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:47,080
She's moved on from the past, while I'm still stuck in the same place.

295
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,220
I thought you kidnapped Qiao Jing and forced her to sign the letter of understanding, right?

296
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,200
Yes.

297
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,140
I'm going to confess my crime.

298
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:14,568
You're right. There's always a price to pay for what we do.

299
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,420
Believe it or not, in my heart,

300
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,220
you've always been my best friend.

309
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,520
Our company's self-automated construction waste sorting

310
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,880
production line has been put into some pilot projects.

311
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,280
According to user feedback, this processing system

312
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,000
can separate and screen various types of materials at the initial stage of waste generation.

313
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,680
Of course, this can avoid the waste of resources and greatly save effort and labor costs.

314
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,260
Qiang, your construction site was the first to use it. What do you think?

315
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,600
- We have only one comment: awesome! 
 - Right.

316
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,500
We have implemented industry-leading transportation and processing services.

317
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,960
We dismantle and transport concrete blocks, brick tiles, and other construction waste for primary classification,

318
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,400
then send them to the factory in sealed containers.

319
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,120
Building aggregate is produced after crushing and processing.

320
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,120
These aggregates can replace the exploitation of natural stone and use of natural sand.

321
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,460
For the problem of weak compressive resistance and poor durability of recycled aggregates,

322
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,980
our company, Yi Jing, has developed

323
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,200
a key patented technology for the recycling of concrete.

324
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,880
This technology makes the rigidity of the concrete

325
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,080
and various quality indicators no different from original concrete,

326
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,360
and even reduces the cost.

327
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,600
Since this system was used, we not only save time, effort, and workers,

328
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,740
- but it's also much easier than before, right? 
 - Yes.

329
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,560
The workers from the construction site next door keep saying they want to use it, too.

330
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,600
Right, right.

331
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,720
Resource recycling has become the future of waste disposal.

332
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,280
And our independently-developed project has achieved results.

333
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,160
Yi Jing is creating miracles.

334
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,000
In recent years, the country encourages people to start a business and innovate.

335
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,620
As long as we try, there must be a miracle.

336
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,052
Good.

337
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,640
Mom, I'm in a meeting.

338
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,800
 What? Something big is happening! Come out now!

339
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,256
What?

340
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,568
Mom.

341
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,796

342
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,200
 CEO Gu, Miss Qiao, are you getting married today?

343
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,760
Mom, is this the something big you meant?

344
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,640
Isn't it epic?

345
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,360
You two work every day, no time for anything.

346
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,500
Do you know how many times Li Jing called to urge me?

347
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,000
Gu Gong. So you two aren't married yet. I thought you are already.

348
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,680
Bro, you need to hurry.

349
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,400
Miss Qiao is such a good girl; you couldn't get another if you let her go.

350
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,100
Correct.

351
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,480
I reckon today is the best day to get a marriage certificate.

352
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,980
I brought you everything you need to get one.

353
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,380
- Auntie. 
 - Stop with the "Auntie."

354
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,720
Starting today, you must call me "Mom."

355
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,180
But we have work to do today.

356
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,148
Everyone, take the day off!

357
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,620
Today is perfect to get married!

358
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:40,030
💝 Thank you to all our viewers. May you find your happily ever after!

359
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:47,020

 "The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

361
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,476
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

362
00:31:58,476 --> 00:32:05,350
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

363
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:11,220
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

364
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:18,540
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

365
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:25,488
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

366
00:32:25,488 --> 00:32:31,052
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

367
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:37,518
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

368
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:43,212
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

369
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:47,007
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

370
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,611
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

371
00:32:50,611 --> 00:32:56,697
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

372
00:32:56,697 --> 00:33:02,902
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

373
00:33:02,902 --> 00:33:08,838
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

374
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:12,620
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

375
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,202
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

376
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:19,746
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

377
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:25,898
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

378
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,185
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

379
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:34,992
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

380
00:33:34,992 --> 00:33:41,403
♫  This unbearable plot  ♫

381
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:47,860
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫

382
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:53,863
♫  Being a guest may be my other destiny  ♫

383
00:33:53,863 --> 00:34:01,064
♫  As the one who left, what gives me the right to care?  ♫

384
00:34:01,064 --> 00:34:07,099
♫  After all, you're the one who finally got married, and I'm just a guest  ♫

385
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:13,323
♫  I drained all the memories to celebrate your wedding  ♫

386
00:34:13,323 --> 00:34:19,256
♫  But I never had the courage to bless you  ♫

387
00:34:19,256 --> 00:34:29,824
♫  Thank you for making me finally aware and returning me back to myself  ♫

388
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:40,256
♫  At least I can still be a guest to witness your love  ♫

389
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,168
♫  He's so lucky to have met you  ♫

390
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:55,250
♫  I hope he loves you more than I do  ♫
