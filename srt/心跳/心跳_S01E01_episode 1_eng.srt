1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:13,020

2
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:45,433

3
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:48,048

4
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:03,318
Director Gu.

5
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,920

6
00:01:15,218 --> 00:01:19,018
Director Gu, it's the time... time to go.

7
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,840

8
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:32,038
- President Zhao has arrived. 
 - Jiahe hasn't heard anything about tonight's meeting, right?

9
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:34,420
This is a secret trip. No one knows.

10
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,010
President Zhao.

11
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:38,558
Director Gu, it's been a long time.

12
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:41,238
This is my secretary, Qiao Jing.

13
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:45,838
I've long heard that Secretary Qiao is smart and capable.

14
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:49,138
She really lives up to her reputation.

15
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:50,858
You flatter me, President Zhao.

16
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:52,898
Let's sit down and talk.

17
00:01:57,598 --> 00:01:59,618
Sorry to keep you waiting.

18
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:01,258
It's okay.

19
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:05,838
Jiahe's men are here.

20
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:08,818
Delay them. I need ten minutes.

21
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:13,158
President Zhao, I need to use the restroom.

22
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:19,998
- This way. 
 - We've arrived.

23
00:02:19,998 --> 00:02:23,418
- Sorry for being late. 
 - What took you guys so long?

24
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:26,218
Sorry, I'll clean it for you.

25
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,204

26
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,250
Anxia is a leading enterprise in the industry,

27
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,710
and I look forward to working with Director Gu.

28
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:45,298
But this time, Jiahe's proposal is more in line with my requirements.

29
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:50,138
As long as there's a better proposal, all requirements are subject to change.

30
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:53,638

31
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:56,138
My old mansion was passed down from the family.

32
00:02:56,138 --> 00:03:00,038
It's all wooden and endured a hundred years of wind and rain.

33
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:02,978
I spend much money on maintenance annually.

34
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:06,998
Jiahe advised me to demolish it, build a hotel,

35
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:10,138
and take advantage of the surrounding scenery to increase income.

36
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:12,058
The hotel will bring only temporary benefits.

37
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:15,518
In 10-20 years, it will be eliminated by the times sooner or later.

38
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:19,598
By then, would you want to tear it down and start over?

39
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:25,598
What will never be eliminated is history.

40
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,210
The old mansion has vital historical value, traditional heritage,

41
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,630
and is an attraction in itself.

42
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:51,218
Half of my old mansion is falling apart, and it's not big.

43
00:03:51,218 --> 00:03:54,978
Even if I turn it into an attraction, who would come to visit?

44
00:03:54,978 --> 00:04:00,418
It's not enough on its own, but we will build a special ancient-style town around it.

45
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:01,596

46
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:06,938
- President Chen, what a coincidence. 
 - Miss Qiao.

47
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:11,018
If you're here, Director Gu must be here, too.

48
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,538
Director Gu is not here. I'm here on my own.

49
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:16,138
President Chen, would you like to have a drink with me?

50
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:17,738
I'm busy, maybe next time.

51
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,478
- President Chenâ€” 
 - I said next time.

52
00:04:31,118 --> 00:04:34,438
Director Gu, your proposal is great,

53
00:04:34,438 --> 00:04:39,138
but you aim too high, surely way out of my budget.

54
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:42,358
Let's cooperate next time.

55
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:57,278
I have to go now.

56
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,698
- After cleaning, send it to the T1 private room. 
 - Okay.

57
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:19,738
- And wait for me by the door. 
 - Okay.

58
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:30,438
Miss, your clothes!

59
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,358
President Chen, you're going the wrong way.

60
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:33,878
The lobby is over there.

61
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:35,418
I am going the right way!

62
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,498
President Chen, there's nothing over there.

63
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,218
Aren't guests booked for this room?

64
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,798
This room has not been booked yet.

65
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,618
President Chen, I told you that you went the wrong way.

66
00:06:03,258 --> 00:06:06,798
President Chen, nice to see you.

67
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,198

68
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:28,118
I confirmed the schedule with President Zhao. He'll come to the company to discuss the contract.

69
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:30,618
President Zhao was interested in Jiahe. How did you persuade him?

70
00:06:30,618 --> 00:06:33,418
He was satisfied with Jiahe, but I promised him as long as we cooperate,

71
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:36,098
we will bear upkeep costs of the quaint town.

72
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:40,158
What Anxia can offer is certainly the best design yet highest yield.

73
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:42,578
He naturally understands which to choose.

74
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:45,598
It went well, but there was a small incident.

75
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:49,538
Now it's time to settle accounts.

76
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:51,998
Our project is the key one of this year.

77
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:55,298
- Let's work together to achieve good results. 
 - Yes.

78
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:57,298
Director Gu, Secretary Qiao.

79
00:06:57,298 --> 00:07:00,038
Let's begin. We have won the Zhao's Old Mansion project.

80
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:01,638
It will promote traditional culture,

81
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:04,598
and become first in domestic tourism for antique towns.

82
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,478
The client was interested in Jiahe.

83
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,358
In order to fight for this project, we arranged a secret meeting.

84
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:11,018
Very few people knew of this trip,

85
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:15,078
but Jiahe's people still knew about it.

86
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:19,918
- How could it have happened? 
 - Manager Zhang, whom do you think leaked it?

87
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,878
Who? Who dares to betray Anxia?

88
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,778
South A02262,

89
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:28,838
it's your license plate number, right?

90
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:32,338
 Director Gu, President Zhao will be at T61 in an hour.

91
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:43,458
I was in the underground parking lot at that time.

92
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:47,498
But I have nothing to do with Jiahe's people.

93
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:52,778
During the meeting, our people observed Chen Jia just in case.

94
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:56,558
These are the photos they took.

95
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:01,598
Yes, I did meet with Chen Jia last night,

96
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:03,838
but it was just a casual dinner party.

97
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:05,738
Others were there, too.

98
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:08,838
Xiao Yi, we are family.

99
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:13,178
How could your uncle possibly reveal the company's secrets to outsiders, right?

100
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:17,618
You love to spout things when drunk. I'm afraid you did so again.

101
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:20,658
Secretary Qiao, don't slander me.

102
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:22,038
Where did you hear that from?

103
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,458
At last night's dinner party were also several other partners.

104
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,778
Someone heard you.

105
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:29,258
Shall I call President Chen directly?

106
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,798
Let's see if you're ashamed or not.

107
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:35,658
Xiao Yi, I did drink a bit too much there

108
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:40,898
and reveal it, but I didn't mean to.

109
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:47,958
Xiao Yi, I promise to change for the better.

110
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,278
I'll definitely improve!

111
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,038
This is not the first time.

112
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:57,158
Last time, the new district project was ruined by you. I let it go that time.

113
00:08:57,158 --> 00:09:01,018
But now, I can't let it go.

114
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:04,998
Starting today, don't come to Anxia anymore.

115
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:06,938
You like to drink, right?

116
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:09,578
Now, you can drink without worry.

117
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:11,398
Do you want to fire me?

118
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:14,158
How can you? Everyone makes mistakes!

119
00:09:14,158 --> 00:09:17,558
You don't make mistakes but act stupidly.

120
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:21,018
Xiao (Little) Yi! Xiao... Xiao Yi.

121
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:25,178
Secretary Qiao, I was just confused!

122
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:26,578
Director Gu values your words the most.

123
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:28,478
Please plead for me.

124
00:09:28,478 --> 00:09:32,658
Manager Zhang, don't forget to go to the eighth floor for the resignation process.

125
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:52,818
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

126
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:56,658
Director Gu finally fired Manager Zhang.

127
00:09:56,658 --> 00:09:58,038
Finally, no one delays us.

128
00:09:58,038 --> 00:10:01,698
The sooner, the better. We've put so much effort into this project.

129
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:05,178
He just sold us out after having some drinks.

130
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:07,950
If not for the great synergy between Director Gu and Secretary Qiao,

131
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,150
our efforts would have gone to waste.

132
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:13,470
If not for Director Gu's quick thinking and keen perception,

133
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,610
we would have been ruined by Manager Zhang.

134
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,918
This time, Director Gu saved us again.

135
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:23,038
He even fired his uncle, Manager Zhang.

136
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:27,578
Secretary Qiao and Director Gu really worked well together.

137
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:33,718
This tacit understanding cannot be achieved between a boss and a secretary.

138
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:37,318
Something must be going on between them!

139
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:45,978
I heard Director Gu and Secretary Qiao have been together a long time but just didn't make it public.

140
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,358
- Really? 
 - Yes.

141
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,458
Have you finished your work?

142
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,538
Secretary Qiao.

143
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:13,098
You're really amazing!

144
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:15,938
You're all over the pages of South City's finance news now.

145
00:11:15,938 --> 00:11:20,178
In just three short years, Director Gu has more than doubled Anxia's market value.

146
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:24,098
I'm sure it'll be a pleasure working with you both.

147
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:26,298
I'm just working idly at Anxia.

148
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:28,938
The one steering the ship is our Director Gu.

149
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,498
I will let everyone know choosing Anxia

150
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:36,118
will never go wrong.

151
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:38,640
Come in.

152
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:47,478
Director Gu, Vice Director Zhou, President Zhao, here's your coffee.

153
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:51,218
Thank you.

154
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,830
Director Gu, I really envy you.

155
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,450
You have such a beautiful and thoughtful secretary.

156
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,938
Office lover.

157
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:26,274
Such a rigid, inflexible woman is useful only at work.

158
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:47,126
Director Gu, you're drunk.

159
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:49,146
Stop talking.

160
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:51,166
It's time for your medication.

161
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,146
How boring.

162
00:12:56,166 --> 00:13:00,846
Ever since you had that car accident four years ago, you've not only lost your memory,

163
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,890
but also got that bipolar disorder.

164
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,620
You have mood swings of highs and lows,

165
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,860
and can't control your emotions, as a machine out of control.

166
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,186
How are you doing now?

167
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:15,840
Are you still taking medication?

168
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,020
Yes, and the doctor says I'm doing much better now.

169
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:24,466
Yesterday, you said Secretary Qiao is useless.

170
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:27,686
I think she takes good care of you.

171
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:31,726
Zhou Rui.

172
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:35,046
You've been dating for three years, right?

173
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:37,686
Will you just keep hiding it like this, not making it public?

174
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:41,606
Dating is a matter between two people. Why should I make it public?

175
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:46,806
I remind you that if you keep hiding it like this,

176
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:51,526
Qiao Jing will eventually go to someone else.

177
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:55,426
Don't worry. She won't.

178
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:32,059

179
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,320
Hello, President Chen.

180
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,800
Is that Secretary Qiao?

181
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,620
 Where are you?

182
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,800
Secretary Qiao is truly Director Gu's right-hand woman.

183
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,050
I was running around and almost broke my legs, yet Anxia got ahead of us.

184
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,360
Anxia is not as experienced as Jiahe

185
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,540
so we must work harder to get a share from Jiahe.

186
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,900
You're modest.

187
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,340
It's Jiahe who should get a share from Anxia.

188
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,040
Anxia still needs Jiahe's support. We should cooperate more.

189
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,450
â™ª Hear a voice say she loves me â™ª

190
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,770
â™ª Close my eyes and follow her â™ª

191
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,860
â™ª Following her is pursuing hope â™ª

192
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,520
Director Gu.

193
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,760
â™ª She must have danced joyfully here before â™ª

194
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,130
â™ª The wind that blows enchants me, that dancing silhouette â™ª

195
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,900
â™ª Like the bright, clear sun, those boys call over again â™ª

196
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,200
 - Outside. 
 - The exact location.

197
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,160
â™ª Danced joyfully here before, the wind that blows enchants me â™ª

198
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,780
Director Gu is so cool.

199
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,340
It's the first time I saw him up close.

200
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,460
Let's have a drink.

201
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,260
Something seems off with Secretary Qiao.

202
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:27,400
Secretary Qiao, you're pretty and capable.

203
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,480
Have you considered changing your work environment?

204
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,880
- President Chen. 
 - As long as you ask,

205
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,620
I can promise you everything.

206
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,324
 President Chen.

207
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,590
You're really generous.

208
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,060
Director Gu.

209
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,340
President Chen, why didn't you come to greet me?

210
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,180
I had no chance to thank you for letting us win the latest project.

211
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,240
It was you who did great.

212
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,700
There's no need to thank me.

213
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,480
President Chen, you're welcomed.

214
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,920
Tonight, we won't leave until we're drunk.

215
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,740
Waiter, serve the wine!

216
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,080
Director Gu, I have something to do later.

217
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,940
You guys drink. I'm leaving now.

218
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,320
President Chen, Director Gu wants to treat you.

219
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,160
Come on, let's not leave until we're drunk tonight.

220
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,500
You misunderstood. I have nothing going on with President Chen.

221
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,300
"Nothing"? Then why did you go see him?

222
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,520
- That was due to the projectâ€” 
 - Enough!

223
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,020
Qiao Jing.

224
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,580
Dress well and go somewhere with me.

225
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,856
All right.

226
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,320
I used to go hiking with your dad all the time.

227
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,220
Now he is not well so he asked me to hike with you.

228
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,840
Your dad is really not well now.

229
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,740
Anxia will have to rely on you in the future.

230
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,780
I'm inexperienced and still need help of expert seniors like you.

231
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,120
This time, you are developing tourism. I hopeâ€¦

232
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,300
This matter is still up in the air.

233
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,840
Go on, let's continue.

234
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,120
Secretary Qiao, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

235
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,680
- What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell? 
 - I'm fine.

236
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,040
Then let's go down the mountain.

237
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,680
- Uncle Yangâ€” 
 - Let's discuss it next time.

238
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,720
- Let's go. 
 - All right.

239
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,828
Uncle Yang!

240
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,240
Uncle Yang, mind your step.

241
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,240
 As long as he's here, all is fine.

242
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,840
"Famous, beautiful pianist Bai Yun returns to China."

243
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,500
That's a fairly good picture.

244
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,440
She's young, pretty and talented.

245
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,320
What a winner in life.

246
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,900
Sorry that you work overtime on a Saturday.

247
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,300
Come, have some food.

248
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,480
- Thank you, Secretary Qiao. 
 - Thank you.

249
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,380
Secretary Qiao, you don't look well.

250
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,180
Are you sick?

251
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,760
Why don't you go and rest? We'll handle this.

252
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,200
I'll do it with you. Let's try to get you all home early.

253
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,856
Here you are.

254
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,460
Brother Yi, have you been waiting long?

255
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,320
It's worth waiting for you no matter how long it takes.

256
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,520
Here, sit.

257
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,480
You were abroad for two years.

258
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,040
It seems you didn't miss home at all.

259
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,720
Don't you miss me and Zhou Rui?

260
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,960
Of course, especially you.

261
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,920
I'm not leaving anymore.

262
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,340
"Not leaving"?

263
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,700
What about your piano dream?

264
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,620
I reached my piano dream.

265
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,780
Now I'm ready for the next stage of my life.

266
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,960
Who will you ask to start it with you?

267
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,780
You must have many admirers abroad over the years.

268
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,900
They're no match to you.

269
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,660
Welcome home.

270
00:25:45,872 --> 00:25:49,200
Hello?

271
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,400
 Bring me some hangover medicine. I sent you the address.

272
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,940
What's wrong? Are you feeling tipsy?

273
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,440
Secretary Qiao, what's wrong?

274
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,620
I have an emergency.

275
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,860
Please do the rest of the work. I'll treat you to dinner later.

276
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,540
Hang in there. The medicine will be here soon.

277
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,640
Gu Yi, are you drunk?

278
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,940
What took you so long? Medicine.

279
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,220
Brother, who is she?

280
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,880
My secretary.

281
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,060
Here's the medicine. You can go home.

282
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:54,400
It's so late, and you're drunk. I'll take you home.

283
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,050
It's none of your business.

284
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,740
Xiao Yun, I'll take you home. Come on.

285
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,380
Secretary Qiao, this suit is specially tailored for Director Gu.

286
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,540
It's nice, but it seems to miss something.

287
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,660
Sir, I had my eye on it first.

288
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,120
Hello, have you any more of this brooch?

289
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,300
This is the last one in the store.

290
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,620
This brooch is the work of a designer I really like.

291
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,120
I came specifically for it.

292
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,740
Miss, can you give it to me?

293
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,600
Of course, you can buy a different brooch, and I'll pay for it.

294
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,220
Sir, it's so kind of you.

295
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,700
But only this matches.

296
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,020
This brooch design is too fancy to suit your temperament.

297
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,720
I can recommend one that suits you.

298
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,360
What event do you need it for?

299
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,060
A business banquet.

300
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,610
Try this one.

301
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,040
Okay.

302
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,140
This brooch really suits you.

303
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,720
You have good taste.

304
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,980
Are you a designer or a buyer?

305
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,700
Neither. You have the aura to make this suit look good.

306
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,960
You went to the trouble of styling me. How can I thank you?

307
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,020
You already have.

308
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,040
Thanks for the brooch.

309
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,660
Chen Jia was taken aback (shocked) that night.

310
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,900
He was scared to death by that load of wine.

311
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,240
How dare he touch my woman?

312
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,560
He should pay the penalty.

313
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,040
But we misjudged Secretary Qiao.

314
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,540
Chen Jia did want Secretary Qiao.

315
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,960
But he wanted to poach her talent.

316
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,560
I hope you weren't nasty to her when you got home.

317
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,000
What do you mean?

318
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,920
That's how we've been for years.

319
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,720
After all, she is your girlfriend.

320
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,580
Why are you so ruthless to her?

321
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,280
Is that merciless?

322
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,580
So what would be good?

323
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,080
It's not your fault. You are ill after all.

324
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,920
But I don't see you depressed.

325
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,800
Why are you easily upset and irritable?

326
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,820
It's hard for you to even have a relationship right now.

327
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,620
Shut up if you can't talk properly.

328
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,360
I know how to have a relationship.

329
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,760
You're used to treating her like this.

330
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,320
I remind you, even a rabbit will bite when it's cornered.

331
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,380
If you keep treating her like this, she might flee.

332
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,720
Don't regret it then.

333
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,660
If she can't take it, she can ask to break up.

334
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,640
You're awesome! You're amazing!

335
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,720
Come on, move your stick aside.

336
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,560
Secretary Qiao, what a coincidence.

337
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,508
Miss Bai.

338
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,600
Secretary Qiao, you even kindly bought clothes personally for Brother Gu Yi.

339
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,760
It's in my job.

340
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,980
Is that part of a secretary's job?

341
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,400
I didn't know that.

342
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,180
Or Secretary Qiao, did you cross the line?

343
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,760
Thank you. I'll take it.

344
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,060
Director Gu's things can't be taken by anyone.

345
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,580
Sorry, Miss Bai.

346
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,520
I am Gu Yi's fiancÃ©e.

347
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,900
Don't you know that?

348
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Miss Bai, do you know that

349
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,940
I am not only his secretary, but also his girlfriend?

350
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,580
Many people like Gu Yi and pursue him.

351
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,020
Miss Bai, I didn't expect that you are one of them.

352
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,360
Who are you to touch me? Let go!

353
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,880
Miss Bai, my tolerance is for only Gu Yi.

354
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,880
With others, I don't have a good temper.

355
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,200
Miss Bai, remember this!

356
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,260
Qiao Jing!

357
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:20,590

358
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,520
 "The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

359
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,622
â™«  The bell rings imperceptibly  â™«

360
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:36,950
â™«  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  â™«

361
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,366
â™«  He gently kneels on one knee  â™«

362
00:33:42,366 --> 00:33:49,840
â™«  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  â™«

363
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:56,834
â™«  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  â™«

364
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:02,298
â™«  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  â™«

365
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:08,764
â™«  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  â™«

367
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:18,353
â™«  You are especially lovely today  â™«

368
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:21,857
â™«  This beauty once was in my arms  â™«

369
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:27,943
â™«  A pity this wedding is for you and him, I am just a guest  â™«

370
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:34,248
â™«  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  â™«

371
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:40,084
â™«  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  â™«

372
00:34:40,084 --> 00:34:43,966
â™«  The promised forever has become the past  â™«

373
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:47,548
â™«  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  â™«

374
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:51,092
â™«  Please forgive me for being improper  â™«

375
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:58,144
â™«  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  â™«

376
00:34:58,144 --> 00:35:01,331
â™«  It's not a drama  â™«

377
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:06,238
â™«  Why am I so into it?  â™«

378
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:12,649
â™«  This unbearable plot  â™«

379
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:19,106
â™«  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  â™«

380
00:35:19,106 --> 00:35:25,009
â™«  Being a guest may be my other destiny  â™«

381
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:32,310
â™«  As the one who left, what gives me the right to care?  â™«

382
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:38,345
â™«  After all, you're the one who finally got married, and I'm just a guest  â™«

383
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:44,669
â™«  I drained all the memories to celebrate your wedding  â™«

384
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:50,502
â™«  But I never had the courage to bless you  â™«

385
00:35:50,502 --> 00:36:00,970
â™«  Thank you for making me finally aware and returning me back to myself  â™«

386
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:11,502
â™«  At least I can still be a guest to witness your love  â™«

387
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,414
â™«  He's so lucky to have met you  â™«

388
00:36:15,414 --> 00:36:25,896
â™«  I hope he loves you more than I do  â™«
