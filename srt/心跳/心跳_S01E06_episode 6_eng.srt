1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:10,020

2
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:45,403

3
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:48,433

4
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,110
 Miss Qiao.

5
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,140
 The person I asked you to investigate, have you any news?

6
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:54,706
 This person is very strange.

7
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:57,206
 We've been searching for months, but we still can't find him.

8
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:59,666
 Maybe you can gather more clues.

9
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,546
 Things are not simple.

10
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:05,966
 Back then, we only found out that it might be Mr. Gu who got Mr. Su's heart.

11
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:09,866
 But when we tried to dig deeper, there were no more clues.

12
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:13,286
All right, I got it.

13
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:22,746
Sister, where did Brother Gu Yi go? I want to buy him my favorite ice cream.

14
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:23,906
He left.

15
00:01:23,906 --> 00:01:25,626
What? He left?

16
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:28,166
Why didn't he tell me?

17
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,066
He had an emergency.

18
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:32,446
Qiao Zhi, have you finished your homework?

19
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:33,506
No.

20
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:36,386
Stop dawdling and do it quickly.

21
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,886
 Look at the fine son you've raised.

22
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:56,766
 After causing such a scene, he has completely tarnished the reputation of our Gu family.

23
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,726
What's the point of yelling at me?

24
00:01:58,726 --> 00:02:01,926
If you're so capable, you should come back and take care of your son yourself!

25
00:02:10,986 --> 00:02:12,306
Do you still dare to return?

26
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:14,646
Do you know how much trouble you've caused?

27
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:17,366
Now the whole of South City is laughing at us.

28
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:20,106
How am I supposed to explain this to the Bai family?

29
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,386
I'm talking to you.

30
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:23,686
I sent people to find you, but you didn't even care.

31
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:28,286
Now you're back. Do you not want your family and company anymore?

32
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:31,226
I'm talking to you! Are you mute now?

33
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:34,586
Mom, I'll handle the situation.

34
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:36,826
"Handle"? How will you handle it?

35
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:39,946
- By continuing to have an ambiguous relationship with Qiao Jing? 
 - Don't mention her name in front of me!

36
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:52,766
Mom, I'm sorry.

37
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:22,846
 The other party in the accident was Su Juan.

38
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:28,906
 The heart you received was his.

39
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:33,406
 What you see as a coincidence

40
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:36,606
 is actually someone's careful planning.

41
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:43,246
 Every year, the birthday I asked you to celebrate with me

42
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:47,026
 was actually his.

43
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,186
Qiao Jing.

44
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:29,246
My madam, you...

45
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:32,206
What's wrong with you this early in the morning?

46
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,766
I pondered it all night, and I couldn't figure it out.

47
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:35,966
What's there to figure out?

48
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,646
- Xiao Bai is just a friend. 
 - Yes.

49
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:42,166
- Xiao Gu is… just a colleague. 
 - That's right.

50
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,066
- Isn't there anyone more than that? 
 - All right, all right.

51
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,486
Fine, fine.

52
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:48,306
I think you're just crazy about finding a son-in-law.

53
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,046
- I'm crazy! I'm crazy! I'm just crazy! 
 - Lower your voice.

54
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:51,286
People are sleeping.

55
00:04:51,286 --> 00:04:53,646
How old is Jing Jing now? How old is she?

56
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:55,026
If we wait a few more years, she will be…

57
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:58,806
She will be… be an elderly primipara (first pregnancy).

58
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:03,006
She won't be a w-woman of childbearing age anymore.

59
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,606
It has been so many years since Su Juan passed away.

60
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,626
Imagine how miserable it must have been for her.

61
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:10,546
I just want her to meet a man

62
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:12,506
and have a happy relationship.

63
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:14,466
Then she will be able to move on.

64
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:15,966
Right, right.

65
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:18,646
What we want is useless.

66
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:21,066
She has to figure it out on her own.

67
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:23,126
We shouldn't interfere too much.

68
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:25,406
 We have to trust our daughter.

69
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:26,986
 - I understand. 
 - You

70
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:29,526
 don't worry so much all the time.

71
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:31,546
Look…

72
00:05:32,826 --> 00:05:35,326
Mom, what are we having for breakfast?

73
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:39,706
Your mom is chopping some ground meat to make minced meat for noodles.

74
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,326
I love that. Add more chili, please.

75
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:45,146
All right, all right. Add more chili.

76
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:47,806
Easy, easy.

77
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:01,826
Are you trying to shorten your life by drinking like this?

78
00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:07,746
If I didn't know better, I would think you were the one who got dumped.

79
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,966
What you did this time was really not cool.

80
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:12,706
If you didn't want to get engaged, you should have said so earlier.

81
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,726
Running away at the last minute? What's that about?

82
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:16,926
How should Xiao Yun deal with this?

83
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:20,166
- I'll make it up to her. 
 - "Make it up"? How?

84
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,066
She's still waiting for you with hope!

85
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,986
You left everything behind to find Qiao Jing.

86
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:33,386
But what happened? You still couldn't keep her.

87
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:35,926
If I can't keep her, then so be it.

88
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:39,506
She really thinks too highly of herself. Who does she think she is?

89
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:43,888
Look.

90
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:53,886
Since everyone is here, let's drink together.

91
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:05,746
Director Gu, don't drink so fast. You'll get drunk easily.

92
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,926
D-Director Gu.

93
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:16,466
Everyone can leave except her.

94
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:18,348
Leave!

95
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:25,266
Don't go too far.

96
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:27,224
Come, let's go, let's go.

97
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:31,606
Director Gu, can you please let go of me first?

98
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:40,726
I want to ask you a question.

99
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:43,626
Do you like me?

100
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:52,146
- Speak up! 
 - Y-Yes, I like you.

101
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:59,156
How much do you like me?

102
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:04,306
I've liked you since the first time I saw you.

103
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:08,566
Because I like you, I came to your side.

104
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,726
You're lying. You approached me only because of Su Juan!

105
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:12,406
Why is it you?

106
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:14,546
Shouldn't it be me?

107
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:20,886
You still owe me an explanation.

108
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:23,306
You don't plan to come to me so I must come for it myself.

109
00:09:23,306 --> 00:09:26,686
Sorry, I've been busy lately.

110
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:30,226
Busy doing what? Busy looking for Qiao Jing?

111
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:35,386
You made me a laughingstock because of her.

112
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:39,826
Gu Yi, what did I do wrong to you?

113
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,086
It's me who wronged you.

114
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:46,146
Whatever compensation you want, if it can be done,

115
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:47,866
I can give it to you.

116
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:54,086
I want you to marry me.

117
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:59,466
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

118
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:11,608

119
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:16,226
This Gu Yi is really unpredictable.

120
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:17,926
He's so stubborn, even with the engagement.

121
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:19,866
Did he come to find you?

122
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:22,706
But he's already gone back.

123
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,486
He really came. What did he mean by this?

124
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:26,866
He wanted to reconcile with you?

125
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:30,066
"Reconcile"? We weren't meant to be together from the start.

126
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:33,026
He couldn't have really fallen for you, could he?

127
00:10:33,026 --> 00:10:35,046
How is that possible?

128
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:38,946
He just feels he has lost his sense of control over me because I suddenly left.

129
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:42,006
You approached Gu Yi in the first place to investigate what happened to Su Juan.

130
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:45,566
I never expected both of you to end up like this.

131
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,086
Are you planning to stay at home and not go back to South City?

132
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:53,826
My assistant is on leave to visit her family a few days, and I'm too busy to handle things by myself.

133
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:56,406
Why don't you come and help me?

134
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:00,726
Give yourself something to do so you won't overthink.

135
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,926
I don't feel like going back.

136
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:07,626
Fine, fine. You can rest at home then.

137
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:13,328
Cheers.

138
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:35,526
Xiao Yun.

139
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:38,604
Auntie…

140
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:42,746
She's been crying in there all this time.

141
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:45,546
Can you help me persuade her?

142
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:11,786
If you keep crying like this, Auntie will worry.

143
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:16,446
Why do you all care about me,

144
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,746
but he doesn't?

145
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:29,446
What do I have to do for him to like me?

146
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:35,346
You're already doing great.

147
00:12:35,346 --> 00:12:36,906
Don't cry, okay?

148
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:39,646
In terms of family background, appearance, and my love for him,

149
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:42,946
how am I inferior to Qiao Jing?

150
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:46,826
Why does he only have eyes for her?

151
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:51,246
Why?

152
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:53,546
Don't cry anymore, don't cry.

153
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:56,306
Why?

154
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:12,220
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

155
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,120
♫  Waiting for him to come closer  ♫

156
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,210
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

157
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:29,960
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

158
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:37,830
♫  When everyone is happy for you  ♫

159
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:44,406
 He couldn't have really fallen for you, could he?

160
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:56,961

161
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:00,506
- Hello? 
 - Hello? Something happened to Gu Yi.

162
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,606
You need to come back now!

163
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:03,726
What do you mean?

164
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:07,346
Don't ask! Just come here quickly!

165
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:25,406
Gu Yi.

166
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:29,648
Gu Yi.

167
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,816
Gu Yi!

168
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,906
Gu Yi!

169
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:45,906
Gu Yi! Gu Yi!

170
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:49,260
Gu Yi! Gu Yi! Gu Yi!

171
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,786
Is it another dream?

172
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:05,260
What are you doing? Get up.

173
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,106
Get up.

174
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:29,116
Don't go.

175
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:31,826
You drank so much alcohol, and you soaked yourself in such cold water.

176
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:33,506
Are you trying to end your life?

177
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:35,806
Are you worried about me,

178
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:38,306
or are you worried about my heart?

179
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:47,686
Gu Yi, why bother?

180
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:50,686
If his heart wasn't inside my body,

181
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:55,106
even if I die, you wouldn't spare me a glance, would you?

182
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:00,586
You seem fine. I will just go now.

183
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:09,686
His heart is inside my body, isn't it?

184
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:11,186
Are you willing to leave me?

185
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:13,606
Are you willing to leave the heart inside me?

186
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:21,806
The two of you...

187
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:25,346
have always been different.

188
00:16:25,346 --> 00:16:27,986
We have always been different,

189
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,026
but can you differentiate us?

190
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:32,666
Have you ever had me in your heart?

191
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:40,186
You are indeed not him

192
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:45,006
so you should cherish your life even more

193
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,686
and cherish the heart he gave you.

194
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:40,760

195
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,880
 The number you dialed is currently unavailable.

196
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,210
 The number you dialed is currently unavailable.

197
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,130
 The number you dialed is currently unavailable.

198
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,900
 The number you dialed is currently unavailable.

199
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:33,366
Don't bother calling a number that won't go through.

200
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:36,786
Mom, give me the phone!

201
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:40,666
I haven't made things clear with her yet.

202
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:44,526
There are so many things I haven't said.

203
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:48,810
You're not going to work and not taking care of household matters.

204
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,260
You've made yourself neither a human nor a ghost.

205
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:53,306
I think you've gone crazy!

206
00:18:56,806 --> 00:18:59,266
Since you can't forget her yourself,

207
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:02,206
Mom will help you!

208
00:20:07,137 --> 00:20:08,610

209
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,990

210
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:50,606
We finally got it done. If it wasn't for you,

211
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:53,966
I don't know when I would finish these data.

212
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:57,886
Before your assistant comes back, I'll be your helper.

213
00:20:57,886 --> 00:20:59,906
You didn't want to come back a few days ago.

214
00:20:59,906 --> 00:21:01,986
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

215
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:06,746
Let me guess. Gu Yi?

216
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:10,346
Zhou Rui told me he was in trouble and tricked me into coming back.

217
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:12,666
You were easily fooled with a few words.

218
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,546
I think you're confused because you care.

219
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:19,986
But when it comes to whom this concern is directed at, it's hard to say.

220
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:23,746
He knows about Su Juan.

221
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:26,586
He must be furious.

222
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:31,526
It's good that he knows because I couldn't keep it from him forever.

223
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:41,146
For the past three years, I've been reminiscing about every little detail with Su Juan

224
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:45,406
while also being painfully aware that he's no longer here.

225
00:21:45,406 --> 00:21:51,266
The man who holds my hand, hugs me, and kisses me is Gu Yi,

226
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,826
but I can't bring myself to leave him.

227
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:59,506
Gu Yi didn't come to celebrate Su Juan's birthday this year,

228
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:01,546
and I felt relieved instead.

229
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:03,706
I should thank him.

230
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:07,466
I used him as medication to numb my longing for Su Juan.

231
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:10,726
Without him, I really couldn't make it.

232
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:15,226
Such a karmic relationship.

233
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:37,906
Madam, Director Gu still won't eat.

234
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:55,446
Is it because the food doesn't suit your taste?

235
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:59,246
What do you want to eat? Mom will arrange it for you.

236
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:02,792
I can't eat.

237
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:13,406
You're not eating. Don't you care about your body anymore?

238
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:23,486
I don't care.

239
00:23:24,246 --> 00:23:26,146
Anyway, it's not mine.

240
00:23:26,146 --> 00:23:28,566
How could you say such a thing?

241
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:31,566
Are you being fair to me?

242
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:33,726
I didn't bring you into this world

243
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:37,726
for you to degrade yourself like this over a woman.

244
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:52,106
My son, what's wrong with you?

245
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:58,028
Mom,

246
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:03,026
I don't want to be like this, either.

247
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:07,006
But my heart is in love with her,

248
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,306
and I can't control it.

249
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:49,906
Ask the doctor to administer intravenous nutrition to him.

250
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,986
Yes, Madam.

251
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:43,326
I saw your light on.

252
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:45,040
Come in.

253
00:25:52,206 --> 00:25:54,506
Why did you suddenly return?

254
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:04,826
Because of Gu Yi again?

255
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:13,486
There won't be a next time.

256
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:19,866
- Qiao Jing, do you really want to leave him? 
 - Yes.

257
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:27,046
My company plans to open a branch in France.

258
00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:30,986
If you want, you can go with me.

259
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:37,366
This is too sudden.

260
00:26:38,486 --> 00:26:42,766
It is a bit abrupt, but it's the best solution.

261
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:46,406
If you go abroad with me, he won't bother you anymore.

262
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:52,286
Take your time to consider.

263
00:26:52,286 --> 00:26:54,506
You don't have to answer me right away.

264
00:26:58,106 --> 00:27:01,026
I hope to hear the answer I want.

265
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:26,906
Rest for a while. You're not in a good state now.

266
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:28,306
I don't need to.

267
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:30,726
Do you really want to give up on Gu Yi?

268
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:33,324
Or what?

269
00:27:34,306 --> 00:27:36,246
Everyone is laughing at me.

270
00:27:36,246 --> 00:27:39,486
Do I still have to put on a fake smile and stick by his side?

271
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:05,366
Doctor, it's been several days since Director Gu ate or drank anything.

272
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:08,946
- Could you please give him a thorough checkup later? 
 - Okay.

273
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:16,766
Director Gu? Director Gu?

274
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:27,026
Chase him.

275
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:15,906
How do you feel, my son?

276
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:17,786
Mom.

277
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:19,926
Don't talk now.

278
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,966
Drink some water first.

279
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:33,546
Are you trying to scare me to death?

280
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:35,406
Do you know how dangerous that was?

281
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,566
It's all because you haven't been eating lately.

282
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:41,306
Your immune system is weak, and you are in very poor condition.

283
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:44,486
The doctor said your affective (mood) disorder has improved,

284
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:46,186
and it's basically under control now.

285
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:48,346
Why did you still act so impulsively?

286
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:50,606
Don't think about anything now.

287
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:55,026
You must stay in the hospital for a few days for observation

288
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,666
so I can be at ease.

289
00:29:57,666 --> 00:30:01,746
Mom, I'm hungry.

290
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:06,186
Great, I will go and prepare something for you.

291
00:30:10,546 --> 00:30:14,486
You be a good boy and rest in bed, all right?

292
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,246
 Qiao Jing is in the courtyard.

293
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:55,046
I'm sorry.

294
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:57,086
What are you doing here?

295
00:30:57,086 --> 00:31:04,426
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

296
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:10,050
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

297
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:17,206
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

298
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:24,342
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

299
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:30,073
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

300
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:36,325
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

301
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:42,071
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

302
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:45,762
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

303
00:31:45,762 --> 00:31:49,495
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

304
00:31:49,495 --> 00:31:55,560
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

305
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:01,684
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

306
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:07,668
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

307
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:11,548
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

308
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:15,106
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

309
00:32:15,106 --> 00:32:18,651
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

310
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:24,448
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

311
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,006
Qiao Jing!

312
00:32:28,965 --> 00:32:33,952
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

313
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:39,867
♫  This unbearable plot  ♫

314
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:46,733
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫

315
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:52,687
♫  Being a guest may be my other destiny  ♫

316
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:56,351
♫  As the one who left  ♫

317
00:32:57,706 --> 00:33:02,406
Q-Qiao Jing, I surrender.

318
00:33:05,406 --> 00:33:08,026
I don't know if it's me who can't leave you,

319
00:33:08,026 --> 00:33:10,846
or if it's my heart that can't leave you.

320
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:13,406
All I know is I can't bear life without you.

321
00:33:16,086 --> 00:33:19,806
Gu Yi, you're having a delusion.

322
00:33:19,806 --> 00:33:22,266
You know about my past with Su Juan,

323
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,586
and you mistakenly believe you currently have feelings for me.

324
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,786
When you wake up, you'll find out

325
00:33:26,786 --> 00:33:29,926
all of this is simply your self-suggestion!

326
00:33:33,326 --> 00:33:36,206
How much longer until I wake up?

327
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:44,946
One year,

328
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:49,106
give me one more year.

329
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:53,826
Give me another 365 days.

330
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,846
We shouldn't repeat the same mistakes.

331
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:09,656
In this year, if you don't want to do something,

332
00:34:09,656 --> 00:34:11,666
I won't force you.

333
00:34:12,346 --> 00:34:14,446
I'll respect you.

334
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,246
Haven't you always wanted to investigate the truth behind Su Juan's accident?

335
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:29,946
I can help you.

336
00:34:42,486 --> 00:34:45,126
You're still running a fever. I'll take you to the hospital first.

337
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,086
Promise me!

338
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,276
Go to the hospital.

339
00:34:49,276 --> 00:34:51,272
Promise me.

340
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:53,866
Go to the hospital.

341
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:55,666
Promise me.

342
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,340
Gu Yi! Gu Yi!

343
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,907

344
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,526
What did you promise me previously?

345
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:12,426
You said you wouldn't appear in South City ever again.

346
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:14,006
You didn't keep your part of the promise, either.

347
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:15,906
He still managed to find me.

348
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,286
If anything happens to my son,

349
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:21,586
I'll come after you.

350
00:35:30,446 --> 00:35:32,646
He's out of danger for now.

351
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:35,646
But he had a heart transplant before, and his body can't tolerate much stress.

352
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:38,386
Your family must be more attentive and cautious.

353
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,286
Yes, I will.

354
00:35:57,646 --> 00:35:59,306
 This person is very strange.

355
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:01,706
 We've been searching for months, but we still can't find him.

356
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:04,366
 Maybe you can gather more clues.

357
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:07,446
 We're really out of options here.

358
00:36:18,206 --> 00:36:20,286
 Give me one more year.

359
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:25,306
 Give me another 365 days.

360
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,286
Are you feeling better?

361
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,046
You're here.

362
00:37:02,046 --> 00:37:04,006
Have you made up your mind?

363
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,726
Or if you have other requests, feel free to tell me.

364
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,386
What is this?

365
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,986
These clues I've found over the years.

366
00:37:26,406 --> 00:37:28,186
So you agreed?

367
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,126
I hope you keep your promise.

368
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:43,040

369
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:59,592
 "The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

370
00:37:59,592 --> 00:38:03,600
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

371
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:10,930
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

372
00:38:12,404 --> 00:38:16,436
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

373
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:24,231
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

374
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:30,834
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

375
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:36,473
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

376
00:38:36,473 --> 00:38:42,823
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

377
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:48,627
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

378
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:52,413
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

379
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:56,018
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

380
00:38:56,018 --> 00:39:02,060
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

381
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:08,354
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

382
00:39:08,354 --> 00:39:14,236
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

383
00:39:14,236 --> 00:39:18,018
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

384
00:39:18,018 --> 00:39:21,562
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

385
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:25,134
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

386
00:39:25,134 --> 00:39:32,101
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

387
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:35,508
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

388
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:40,350
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

389
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:46,810
♫  This unbearable plot  ♫

390
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:53,179
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫

391
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:59,144
♫  Being a guest may be my other destiny  ♫

392
00:39:59,144 --> 00:40:06,439
♫  As the one who left, what gives me the right to care?  ♫

393
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:12,438
♫  After all, you're the one who finally got married, and I'm just a guest  ♫

394
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:18,772
♫  I drained all the memories to celebrate your wedding  ♫

395
00:40:18,772 --> 00:40:24,540
♫  But I never had the courage to bless you  ♫

396
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:35,101
♫  Thank you for making me finally aware and returning me back to myself  ♫

397
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:45,628
♫  At least I can still be a guest to witness your love  ♫

398
00:40:45,628 --> 00:40:49,484
 ♫ He's so lucky to have met you ♫

399
00:40:49,484 --> 00:40:59,766
♫  I hope he loves you more than I do  ♫
