1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:09,090

2
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:45,460

3
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,660

4
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,260
 That traitor! You've been so nice to him,

5
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,080
yet he still has the audacity to do this!

6
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,200
No, I'll talk to him right now. I'll ask how our family has ever harmed him.

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,660
Mom.

8
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,220
People change. We can't foresee or prevent it.

9
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,060
Zhou Rui and I have been on different paths for a long time now.

10
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,480
But we can't just let it go like this!

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,780
There's already been a significant breakthrough with Chen Lan's testimony.

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,420
Anxia withdrew the lawsuit.

13
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,112
How can that be?

14
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:34,580
Yang Yang said the president's office just received the lawyer's reply.

15
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,400
Su Juan and the others wanted Chen Lan to bear sole responsibility.

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,400
But because Chen Lan confessed to everything, Zhou Rui will be liable with him.

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,980
Anxia is dropping the lawsuit now for Zhou Rui's sake.

18
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,060
It helps them completely cut ties with this matter.

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,000
Su Juan is now running wild in the company!

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,360
Come on, let's go find your dad right now.

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,820
I want to see if anyone can deal with him!

22
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,200
Mom, sit down.

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,440
Dad needs to rest right now.

24
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,900
It's best not to disturb him.

25
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,300
I will handle this matter myself.

26
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,140
Why did you withdraw the lawsuit?

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,120
I am done cleaning up the mess the former director made.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,480
Besides, Anxia's reputation must be preserved.

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,440
Fox, you stopped since you can't hide your tail anymore.

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,520
I tell you, this is about the company's interests.

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,800
You can't do this!

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,816
Su Juan!

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,420
Can't I do this?

34
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,080
From what position are you speaking to me right now?

35
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,500
As the supervisor or as my younger brother?

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,204
Did you get Dad's advice before withdrawing the lawsuit? Did he agree to this?

37
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:55,380
He has one foot in the grave (dying) and no energy for these things.

38
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,420
He's your father, too!

39
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,620
I'm just stating the facts.

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,980
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving,

41
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,472
Little Brother.

42
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,376
What are you doing?

43
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,640
If you're going to drink, I can't stop you. But I can accompany you.

44
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,360
I'll drink two bottles for every one you drink.

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,900
Drinking like this, don't you care about your health?

46
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,220
What about you? Don't you care about your health?

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,200
Don't endanger your health simply because you're upset.

48
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,284
I get your point.

49
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:16,220
Tomorrow, I'll talk to other shareholders at the company.

50
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,160
I don't believe everyone will sit back and do nothing.

51
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:26,476
Hello, Mom.

52
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:29,720
 Gu Yi, your dad won't make it.

53
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,640
How's my father?

54
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,740
We've done our best.

55
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,832
Please accept our condolences.

56
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:31,944
Big Brother!

57
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,924
Big Brother.

58
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,520
My dad has been training me to be Anxia's successor since I was a child.

59
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,540
He directed my every move.

60
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,804
I never listened; I always argued with him.

61
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,940
After I got old enough to understand, I realized he caused my mother's fury.

62
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,880
So I became more and more resentful of him.

63
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,300
I didn't even bother to visit him...

64
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,480
when he was sick.

65
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:47,940
I assumed if I didn't see him,

66
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,720
I'd see him next time.

67
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:56,192
If we couldn't agree,

68
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,020
we'd talk again next time.

69
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:07,292
But now,

70
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:11,420
he's gone.

71
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,440
There is no "next time."

72
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,584
Qiao Jing,

73
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,860
I don't have a dad anymore.

74
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,000
If I'd seen him that day, I'd feel so much better.

75
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,540
Although he was angry with me, at least I'd see him one last time.

76
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,060
You still have me.

77
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,000
 Everyone, this document is the will left by Chairman Gu before his death.

78
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,180
I will read it to everyone.

79
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:32,160
I, Gu Nan, in order to prevent disputes over inheritance, have made this will as follows:

80
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,080
First, all my properties and savings are shared between me and my spouse, Fang Pei.

81
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,680
From my part, I allocate ¥1 million ($139,000) as a startup fund for Gu Yi.

82
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,440
The remainder will be joined into the Gu Family Trust Fund.

83
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,100
Each member of the Gu family will receive ¥100,000 ($14,000) per month as living expenses.

84
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,000
Second, I hold 80% of the shares in Anxia Group Holdings Co. Ltd.

85
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,460
Ten percent will be given to my second oldest brother, Gu Yu.

86
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,700
Ten percent will be given to the third oldest, my sister, Gu Ying.

87
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,800
Ten percent will be given to Gu Yi.

88
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,520
The remaining 50% will be inherited by my eldest son, Su Juan.

89
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:24,220
Finally, Su Juan will now serve as Anxia Group's chairman.

90
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,500
That's all the contents of the will.

91
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,640
Impossible.

92
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,160
Gu Nan couldn't have left the company to him!

93
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,800
What's impossible about that?

94
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,000
Your son was already kicked out of the company.

95
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,520
Would he still leave it to him?

96
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,810
There must be something wrong with this will.

97
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,100

98
00:10:46,056 --> 00:10:47,512
This can't be.

99
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:49,840
This will was definitely forged.

100
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,260
This is the original will that Chairman Gu handed to me personally before his death.

101
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,600
When your husband passed away, you didn't shed a single tear.

102
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,200
Now that you have the original will, you are still skeptical of its authenticity.

103
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,960
My big brother was extremely unlucky to have married a woman like you.

104
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,840
Enough!

105
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,460
I'm just stating the facts.

106
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,800
Fake!

107
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,900
This must have been forged by Su Juan!

108
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,920
Fake!

109
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,520
Mom, I respect Dad's decision.

110
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,800
Let's go.

111
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,640
This is impossible!

112
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,176
Let go! Let go!

113
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,500
That will must have been forged by Su Juan.

114
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,620
He's been preparing for a long time to take away all that belongs to you.

115
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,200
Lawyer Zhao served Dad more than 20 years.

116
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,020
He's always diligent and responsible. How could he  forge the will?

117
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,160
But I can't figure it out.

118
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,520
How could your dad possibly have left the company to him?

119
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,860
The company is yours.

120
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,060
Dad may have been disappointed in me.

121
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,700
Son, don't think such nonsense.

122
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,960
- Your dad, he just— 
 - It's okay, Mom.

123
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,620
No matter what decision Dad made, I accept it.

124
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,380
Mrs. Gu, Director Gu, Chairman Gu left some belongings in the study.

125
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,320
What would you like to do with them?

126
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,820
Look at your dad.

127
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,000
He didn't love me.

128
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,440
Yet why did he keep my photo,

129
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,460
carrying it in his wallet everywhere?

130
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,060
When I met your father,

131
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,900
he was just the head of a small company.

132
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,280
He had no money and no connections.

133
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,620
He relied on his persuasiveness

134
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,300
to charm me completely.

135
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,660
I must have been out of my mind to insist on marrying him.

136
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,496
And the result?

137
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,480
His business grew bigger and bigger,

138
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,364
but things got... colder and colder between us.

139
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,120
We fought and argued our entire lives.

140
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,000
How could he leave just like that?

141
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,120
Mom.

142
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,660
You still have me.

143
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,340
Are you hungry? I'll cook noodles for you.

144
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,180
I'm not hungry. Don't worry about it. Just rest.

145
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,660
What's this?

146
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,680
This is a birthday gift my dad gave me.

147
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,980
It was the first time he played building blocks with me.

148
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,192
I wouldn't have dreamed... it was also the last time.

149
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,560
Once, I had a fight with him, and I smashed it in anger.

150
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,560
I can't believe my dad picked up all the pieces and kept them all this time.

151
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,780
Actually, Chairman Gu has always cared about you.

152
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,270
Qiao Jing, let's build it together, okay?

153
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,356
Okay.

154
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,220
Lawyer Zhao, we don't doubt you.

155
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,560
But as for that will, I pondered it all night and still don't understand.

156
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,100
I was unaware of Chairman Gu's arrangements in advance.

157
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,000
He wasn't optimistic about his recovery at the time.

158
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,400
When I got there,

159
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,280
he just gave me a sealed document and told me it was his will.

160
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,320
He told me to keep it safe and open it only after he died.

161
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,100
Was Su Juan there at the time?

162
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,360
It was just Chairman Gu and me throughout the process.

163
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,120
This will must be based on his personal wishes.

164
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,640
I know you both have doubts about Su Juan.

165
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,900
But the fact is, Chairman Gu passed away due to illness,

166
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,840
and it has nothing to do with anyone else.

167
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,160
To be honest, I also found Chairman Gu's arrangements a bit strange,

168
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,040
but who knows what Chairman Gu was thinking?

169
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,300
What are you doing here?

170
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,140
I just went to see Xiao Yun. This is from her.

171
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,540

172
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,460
 I should have told you a long time ago,

173
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,520
 but I was too cowardly at that time.

174
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,340

175
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,880

176
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,980

177
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,380

178
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,310

179
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,110

180
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,020
 How could you win Gu Yi's love?

181
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,500
  Only now do I understand...

182
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,740

183
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,352

184
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:40,940
Xiao Yun was sentenced to two years for intentional injury.

185
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,120
She has truly let go.

186
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,960
You must be happy to see her like this now, right?

187
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,560
Even she has moved on; how much longer will you wallow in self-pity?

188
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,360
Gu Yi truly sees you as a brother.

189
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,420
He is the last person you should hurt.

190
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,040
What do you know about our relationship?

191
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,600
It's true I don't understand, but I still have to tell you this.

192
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,220
Don't hurt the people who really love you in the name of love.

193
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,420
The handover ceremony will happen soon. We can't let our guard down yet.

194
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,620
Is anything going on with Gu Yi these days?

195
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,020
They went to see Zhao Ming.

196
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,220
What's the use of talking to Zhao Ming?

197
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,300
I was either with Gu Nan before he died, or someone watched him for me.

198
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,380
Even if they had contact with him, there is only one will.

199
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,480
And the distribution of the inheritance is already set in stone.

200
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,040
What tricks can they play?

201
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,712
It's here.

202
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,760
Director Su, I've brought all of Chairman Gu's important papers, certificates, and his safes to you.

203
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,240
Thank you, Manager Lu.

204
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,060
Where does this piece go? I can't find it in the blueprints.

205
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,520

206
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,560
When Dad and I built this, I recall

207
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,680
there wasn't a single piece left over.

208
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,100
And the main colors of this castle are gray and beige.

209
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,200
This leftover red piece doesn't seem to belong with these.

210
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,120
Was there only one extra piece?

211
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,040
Isn't it normal for this type of toy to have a few extra pieces?

212
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,260
Are you two reading too much into this?

213
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,740
Mom, did anyone go through Dad's things after he died?

214
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,520
Since he got very sick, I was the only one who went into his room to clean it.

215
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,260
Only your dad had access to that cabinet.

216
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,240
Oh, that's right. The maid told me that he did

217
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,860
go through the old things in that cabinet a couple weeks ago.

218
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,160
My father never did anything without a purpose.

219
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,740
This extra piece must have important information.

220
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,820
Chairman Gu always had his reasons.

221
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,740
The number on this puzzle piece is 0407.

222
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,000
Do you know what it means?

223
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,560
"Zero, four, zero, seven"?

224
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,100
That is our wedding anniversary.

225
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,060
This is more evidence that this extra piece isn't a coincidence.

226
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,300
Your dad used to like to play riddles all the time.

227
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,420
How about this? Let's go back now

228
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,660
and look for your dad's safes to see if these numbers are a passcode.

229
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,176
All right.

230
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,160
Manager Lu, who gave you the authority

231
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,080
to take all the files and the safes to Su Juan?

232
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,320
Madam, now that Director Su has taken full control of Anxia,

233
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,640
it's appropriate to hand them over to him.

234
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,480
- You... 
 - Mom.

235
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Manager Lu, you can go back to work. Thank you.

236
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:24,476
Mom.

237
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,020
This won't do. I must find Su Juan and get everything returned here.

238
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,680
Mom, it won't be easy to retrieve those things from Su Juan.

239
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,740
If we pay special attention to the safes, he'll become suspicious.

240
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,520
 It's our honor to collaborate with Anxia.

241
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,240
 I'm also looking forward to this collaboration.

242
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,720
 Mrs. Gu, you can't go in. President Su is in a meeting.

243
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,548
President Su, I'm sorry; I couldn't stop her.

244
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:53,980
Su Juan, does the Mingyue Lake Resort villa I bought with Gu Nan ten years ago

245
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,760
count as marital property?

246
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,240
He promised me that the first three houses would be mine.

247
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,200
Where are the property ownership certificates now?

248
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,440
Mom, why are you making a scene here?

249
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,220
How embarrassing. We don't want it anymore.

250
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,640
"Don't want it"? Do you like being taken advantage of?

251
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,960
You don't want this or that anymore. You're not even concerned that the company's been stolen from you.

252
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,440
- Now you don't even want the house— 
 - Mrs. Fang, I have a guest right now.

253
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,820
Can we discuss these things later?

254
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,060
"Later"?

255
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,920
Should I wait till you secretly transfer the house to your name?

256
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,340
I'm telling you, if you don't give me the property ownership certificate,

257
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,140
I'll sue you for embezzling property!

258
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,880
Mom, let's just go.

259
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,360
Go where?

260
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,160
If I can't get the property ownership certificate today,

261
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,120
I'm not going anywhere!

262
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,960
Director Su, I see you have other matters to deal with right now.

263
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,700
Why don't we reschedule this meeting?

264
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,816
Please take care.

265
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,880
Su Juan, the property ownership certificate?

266
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,800
Auntie Fang, I'll give you what you want,

267
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,220
but I hope you can resolve everything this time.

268
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,080
If there's anything like this in the future, don't make a scene at the company.

269
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,840
Father's things are all here.

270
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,520
Auntie Fang, do you remember which safe it was in?

271
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,860
It's been too long; I don't remember.

272
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,530
I only remember

273
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,520
it was in an old and rather large safe.

274
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,356
It's this one.

275
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,440
This one has many confidential files from the company.

276
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,360
I have limited time.

277
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,560
And I still have a lot of work to do.

278
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,892
These are Anxia's financial records for the past ten years.

279
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:49,460
I've checked. There's nothing else.

280
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,840
It must be this one then.

281
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,890

282
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,640
This one contains the company seals.

283
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,840
Auntie Fang, you'd better think carefully.

284
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,960
Exactly where is it?

285
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,160
Mom, could it be the safe with the number 0407?

286
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,460
I remember Dad saying that it contained all the gifts he gave you.

287
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,120
That's right, it must be that one.

288
00:25:48,608 --> 00:25:50,332
Are you sure?

289
00:25:51,428 --> 00:25:53,248
I am sure.

290
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,640
It seems I don't have what you two are looking for.

291
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,220
Please leave.

292
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,072
Let's go.

293
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,940
Don't forget to take your bag.

294
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,120
At first, I thought 0407 was a passcode.

295
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,640
But then I realized it wasn't a passcode.

296
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,112
It was the number on the safe.

297
00:26:43,112 --> 00:26:44,800
True.

298
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,040
That safe was one we saw on a trip your father and I took.

299
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,240
When we saw that its serial number matched our anniversary,

300
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,780
we thought it was fate. So we bought it.

301
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,120
I can't believe that after all your dad went through to leave a clue,

302
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,680
it was just an empty safe.

303
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,960
Dad would never do something so meaningless.

304
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,500
Maybe someone already took whatever was inside.

305
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:20,604
I'll go.

306
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,320
- Lawyer Zhao? 
 - Director Gu, is Mrs. Gu here?

307
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,724
She is.

308
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:32,420
Mrs. Gu.

309
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,480
Lawyer Zhao.

310
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,120
After you left the other day,

311
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,920
I double checked Chairman Gu's will.

312
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,680
I was surprised to discover a problem with it.

313
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,240
  Lawyer Zhao, the will is inside.

314
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,040
  No one should open it until after I'm gone.

315
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,520
When Chairman Gu gave the will to me,

316
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,300
the string on the sealed envelope was slightly yellowed.

317
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,180
But the string on the will's current sealed envelope

318
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,400
is clearly brand new.

319
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,980
I didn't pay attention to it at the time.

320
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,760
The more I pondered, the more suspicious I became.

321
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,140
I suspect the will has been switched.

322
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,360
The one who would do this is surely Su Juan.

323
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,920
But this is all speculation.

324
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,340
We have no solid evidence to prove he tampered with the will.

325
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,980
Also, the clue Father left was useless.

326
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,520
Lawyer Zhao, weren't you the one who always managed

327
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,440
Gu Nan's safes and files?

328
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,820
Not entirely.

329
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,740
I was only in charge of his art collection and artifacts.

330
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,000
Do you have any recollection of a safe with the number 0407?

331
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,320
Chairman Gu used that safe to store something not long before his death.

332
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,340
He stored a painting.

333
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,420
"A painting"?

334
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,760
Working overtime every day, staying up late every night...

335
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,180
When will this ever end?

336
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,320
Don't slack off.

337
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,040
President Su's inauguration ceremony is soon.

338
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,280
There's still lots to do.

339
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,600
Our poor Director Gu

340
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,780
has been completely defeated this time.

341
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,520
Isn't Director Gu starting a new business?

342
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,520
Why don't we switch to his company?

343
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,740
That's right. Maybe we can be the first employees he hires.

344
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,580
We could even get some dividends.

345
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,760
True.

346
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,120
- Secretary Qiao! 
 - Secretary Qiao!

347
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
What brings you here?

348
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,400
I happened to be in the area so I stopped by to say hello.

349
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,860
And I brought you some afternoon tea.

350
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,840
Thank you, Secretary Qiao.

351
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,540
- Thank you, Secretary Qiao. 
 - Thank you, Secretary Qiao.

352
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,568
Pass it around.

353
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:11,500
Secretary Qiao, we were just mentioning you.

354
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,600
We heard that you and Director Gu are starting a new business.

355
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,240
Do you still need people?

356
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,260
If you're willing to come, I'll surely hire you.

357
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,040
What did I say? Thank you again.

358
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:31,324
Hello?

359
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,640
We'll be there in five minutes.

360
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,396
Another project meeting?

361
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,660
Secretary Qiao, we have to go now.

362
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,840
How long will you be gone? Maybe I can wait for you.

363
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,940
About half an hour.

364
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,480
Wait for us then.

365
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,400
Okay. I'll wait for you.

366
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,300
- Okay, let's go. 
 - Let's go.

367
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,520
- Go ahead. 
 - We'll go now.

368
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:58,830

369
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,600
"The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

370
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:09,804
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

371
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:16,512
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

372
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:22,512
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

373
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:29,840
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

374
00:32:31,143 --> 00:32:36,866
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

375
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:42,480
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

376
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,846
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

377
00:32:48,846 --> 00:32:54,740
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

378
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,335
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

379
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:01,939
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

380
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:05,325
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him  ♫

381
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,915
♫  I am just a guest  ♫

382
00:33:07,915 --> 00:33:14,272
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

383
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:20,166
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

384
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:24,048
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

385
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:27,530
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

386
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,174
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

387
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:38,046
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

388
00:33:38,046 --> 00:33:41,513
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

389
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:46,220
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

390
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:52,731
♫  This unbearable plot  ♫

391
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:59,188
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫

392
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:05,191
♫  Being a guest may be my other destiny  ♫

393
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:12,456
♫  As the one who left, what gives me the right to care?  ♫

394
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:18,360
♫  After all, you're the one who finally got married, and I'm just a guest  ♫

395
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:24,651
♫  I drained all the memories to celebrate your wedding  ♫

396
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:30,584
♫  But I never had the courage to bless you  ♫

397
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:41,213
♫  Thank you for making me finally aware and returning me back to myself  ♫

398
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:51,640
♫  At least I can still be a guest to witness your love  ♫

399
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,496
♫  He's so lucky to have met you  ♫

400
00:34:55,496 --> 00:35:05,578
♫  I hope he loves you more than I do  ♫
