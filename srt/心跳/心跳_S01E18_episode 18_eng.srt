1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:10,040

2
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:45,496

3
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:48,360

4
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,648
How is it?

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,800
With this great smell and color,

6
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,700
it is clear these chilies are real Nanchong Erjingtiao chilies,

7
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,020
which are both fragrant and shiny.

8
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,660
The fish is smooth and its meat is soft

9
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,600
so it must be a big black fish that was recently caught.

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,280
Our Jing Jing excels most at eating.

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,860
It is because you cook so well that your daughter can be picky.

12
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,480
Even five-star chefs cannot beat Auntie's cooking.

13
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,876
That's right.

14
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:27,920
Stop flattering me.

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,000
Your family is so rich. Isn't it embarrassing

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,120
living on our food? Do you intend to freeload?

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,976
Mom.

18
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,480
His family recently faced a little trouble

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,520
so he stays with me temporarily.

20
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:43,608
I see.

21
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,900
Did that illegitimate child return to claim an inheritance?

22
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,180
Then were you unable to get a single yuan?

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,880
You should at least find a job.

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,500
I'm preparing to start a business right now.

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,000
"Starting a business"?

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,660
That isn't easy at all.

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,520
You won't know where your next meal will come from.

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,120
You can't let her suffer with you!

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,036
Mom, Gu Yi and I are planning to start a business together.

30
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:12,520
We are partners.

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,120
And what we plan to do benefits the country and people.

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
It has great prospects, and I'm sure we will succeed.

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
That's right, Auntie.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,360
With widespread enterprise and innovation, the country strongly supports new business ventures.

35
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,160
We will certainly succeed with support from national policies

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,000
plus our own hard work.

37
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,320
You can rest assured.

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,000
Though it's difficult to start a business,

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,180
I won't let Qiao Jing suffer.

40
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,280
You speak with such confidence

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,420
and clarity. What business will you start?

42
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,560
We plan to do resource recycling.

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,800
It's about crushing construction waste then—

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,740
Is it picking up trash?

45
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,760
The yard is so big,

46
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,320
yet she just plants pretty but useless flowers and shrubs.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,160
What a waste.

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,060
Let's plant some Chinese cabbage here,

49
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,640
a few garlic sprouts, and some green onions.

50
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,136
Coming.

51
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,600
X-Xiao Su?

52
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:34,220
Auntie Li.

53
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,200
- It's really you! 
 - It's me.

54
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,044
Come in, come in.

55
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,220
Auntie, is Qiao Jing here?

56
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,340
She went out to run errands.

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,380
It seems I'm not lucky.

58
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,120
Auntie, long time no see.

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,820
- How about having a meal together? 
 - Sure.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,520
Y-You and Gu Yi are brothers?

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,920
So are you that illegitimate child?

62
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,100
My mom told me before she died.

63
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,860
You and your mom both have unfortunate lives.

64
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,180
Gu Nan is really heartless!

65
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,420
Did they bully you after you went back to the Gu family?

66
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,600
My dad and relatives have been very nice to me.

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,920
That's good. That's good.

68
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,440
I am overjoyed to see you again.

69
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,048
Come on.

70
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,760
Come on.

71
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,420
You have no idea how heartbroken our Jing Jing was

72
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,720
when the accident happened.

73
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:46,464
Auntie.

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,760
It was my fault for not contacting her sooner,

75
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,980
which caused her concern for so long.

76
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:59,620
Auntie, how has her health been lately?

77
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,960
The doctor advised her to look after herself after she was discharged.

78
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,120
"Discharged"?

79
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,340
When was she admitted to the hospital?

80
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,820
Didn't you know?

81
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,620
Today, I handed over my work to the new supervisor.

82
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,520
Now I officially leave the company.

83
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,560
Then tomorrow will be the first day of our entrepreneurship.

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,400
What flowers does your mom like?

85
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:36,780
Pig trotters. (Play on words)

86
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,880
Mom, Gu Yi bought you the pig trotters you love to eat.

87
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,820
Mom, what's wrong? Who...

88
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:50,504

89
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,360
What's going on?

90
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,660
Auntie, let me explain, we...

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,440
How long did you plan to hide it?

92
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:08,620
Mom, I didn't want to hide it from you.

93
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,320
I was just afraid you'd worry.

94
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,980
Would hiding it not make us worry?

95
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,380
Auntie, it was all my fault.

96
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,920
I didn't protect her and the baby well.

97
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,500
Is it because you couldn't protect the baby,

98
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,520
or your family didn't want the baby and refused responsibility?

99
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,120
No, the Gu family also feels sorry about the baby.

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,100
I'm the father. How could I have hurt him?

101
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:37,660
Mom. Mom.

102
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,280
We lost our baby, and we are also heartbroken.

103
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,828
Mom.

104
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,520
Mom, don't be angry.

105
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,500
I-I didn't mean to hide it from you.

106
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,560
I just didn't know how to tell you.

107
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,480
I'm your mom;

108
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,520
what can't you tell me?

109
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,320
Since you were little, you've always had your own opinions,

110
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,580
and you always knew what you wanted.

111
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,080
Your dad and I always let you do whatever you wanted.

112
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,960
Mom, no matter what happens in the future,

113
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,320
I'll tell you, okay?

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,840
Don't be upset anymore.

115
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,376
Were you hurting all alone?

116
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,240
No.

117
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,280
You went to the hospital by yourself with no one to accompany you.

118
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,220
There was someone.

119
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,580
And you had no one to care for you.

120
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,700
Friends took care of me, Mom.

121
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,460
It breaks my heart just thinking about it.

122
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,560
Mom, don't feel hurt.

123
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,820
So many people took care of me.

124
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,300
I'm not in pain.

125
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm doing well, Mom.

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,840
Don't cry anymore.

127
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,360
Stop crying, stop crying.

128
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,500
Many friends were there for me.

129
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,472
Mom.

130
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,860
I'm really fine.

131
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,020
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,920
I shouldn't have made you worry.

133
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,820
 Don't cry anymore.

134
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,000
 I'm really fine.

135
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,560
Gu Nan was transferred to a new hospital.

136
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,520
The doctor started using a new treatment,

137
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,760
but the effect is not very ideal.

138
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,900
How much time do you think Gu Nan has?

139
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:06,060
We must plan ahead for some things.

140
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,280
Miscarriage is a major concern for women.

141
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,920
You're young and don't understand.

142
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,460
You must replenish your body, understand?

143
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,480
Mom, it's been quite some time.

144
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,760
My body fully recovered long ago.

145
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,420
And during this time, Gu Yi takes care of me nonstop.

146
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,220
He is an adult man who couldn't even protect his own child.

147
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,940
How is he still taking care of you?

148
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,260
Mom, another did it to me with ill intentions,

149
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,040
and it was so fast that he couldn't save it.

150
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,860
What? Why defend him so firmly?

151
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,480
You haven't even married him yet,

152
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,760
but you keep defending him.

153
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,180
Li Jing would find out about Qiao Jing's pregnancy sooner or later.

154
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,840
Paper can't cover up a fire.

155
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,560
Auntie is still angry.

156
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,900
I know it was my fault,

157
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,500
but in this, her impression of me worsened.

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,400
Mom, I really can't think of any other way.

159
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,700
I can only ask for your help.

160
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,440
How can I help?

161
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,384
I don't understand.

162
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,220
Help me propose.

163
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,360
No way, absolutely not!

164
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,720
- What are you doing? 
 - Auntie!

165
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,920
We have something to ask you.

166
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,736
Put it here.

167
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,740
We brought you some small gifts.

168
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,880
I'm not sure if you have seen them before.

169
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,020
No need to thank us.

170
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,860
Who needs your gifts? Take them away.

171
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,740
Mom, aren't they guests the moment they walk in the door?

172
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,900
How can you rush them out?

173
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,560
Sit down.

174
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,560
I came here today not to argue with you,

175
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,140
but to discuss something.

176
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,360
Let me be blunt about this.

177
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,820
My son and your daughter have been on and off for so long

178
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,980
that it is time to settle down.

179
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,680
As for the date, I have already calculated it.

180
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,420
The eighth day of next month is auspicious.

181
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,400
You two should go and register your marriage.

182
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,920
Register what marriage?

183
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,620
Who agreed to let you register your marriage?

184
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,400
Auntie, I've considered this for a long time.

185
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,040
I brought my mom here today to prove my sincerity.

186
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm serious about Qiao Jing.

187
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,728
I want to marry her.

188
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,860
Can you marry her just like that? Why should we agree?

189
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,420
For young people, as long as they have consent, they can marry freely.

190
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,660
Do you think you could stop them?

191
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,080
Besides, when it comes to family background and appearance,

192
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,780
in what way is my son not good enough for your daughter?

193
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,200
Countless girls wish to marry into our Gu family as daughters-in-law.

194
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,880
One who wishes to marry him may do so.

195
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,600
Anyway, our modest family can go on without it.

196
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,820
Mom, this cannot be resolved with just a couple of sentences.

197
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,520
Why don't you eat first?

198
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,160
No. Don't interrupt.

199
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,560
Isn't it meaningless to eat without drinking?

200
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,480
Being such a wealthy woman,

201
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,920
would drinking just a few sips of wine make you collapse?

202
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,720
What a joke. Me? Afraid of drinking?

203
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll drink this first.

204
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,120
Sorry, I drank it first.

205
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,148
Mom.

206
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,500
Mom, Mom.

207
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,120
Let go.

208
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,540
I drank first again.

209
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,980
I…

210
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,180
I'll drink all of this.

211
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,260
- Mom! 
 - Auntie!

212
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,160
- Don't interfere! 
 - Don't interfere!

213
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,920
Do you not agree?

214
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,660
I'm not willing, either.

215
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,960
I've always wanted to find a well-matched

216
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,420
and noble wife for Gu Yi.

217
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,240
But my son likes only your daughter.

218
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,320
How can I stop them?

219
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,880
No matter what I do, I can't separate them.

220
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,020
Tell me, what should I do?

221
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,900
I can only go along with him.

222
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,200
As long as my son is happy...

223
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,420
I'm willing to do anything.

224
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,320
You want your son to be happy.

225
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,560
I-I also want my daughter to be happy.

226
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,520
I don't need her to be rich or powerful.

227
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,900
All I ask is to find a man who adores her, loves her,

228
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,300
and prioritizes her.

229
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,520
Cheers.

230
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,860
Let me tell you.

231
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,100
If we talk only of loving Qiao Jing,

232
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,460
if my son were ranked number two,

233
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,720
no man would dare claim the first place!

234
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,960
You have no idea.

235
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,100
For your daughter, my son

236
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,100
is even willing to give up his own life.

237
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,456
Come on.

238
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:18,220
Drink up.

239
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,720
Li Jing.

240
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,160
Tell me.

241
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,400
How did you raise such a beautiful daughter?

242
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,040
She is really exquisite and kindhearted.

243
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,920
But one thing isn't good.

244
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,852
A weakness,

245
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:45,620
it's definitely a weakness.

246
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,240
She's too powerful.

247
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,200
I fear my Gu Yi will be bullied by her.

248
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,540
She got it from me.

249
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,300
The good and the bad, she got it all from me.

250
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:21,200
My son's mother-in-law, if your daughter could marry into our family,

251
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,960
I'll surely treat her very well.

252
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,500
I am telling you, once that time comes...

253
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,140
we will go on vacations when we aren't busy,

254
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,020
and babysit our grandsons while we are at it.

255
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,840
They won't fight, will they?

256
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,180
They are beside each other so not likely.

257
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,960
Can't it be a granddaughter?

258
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,780
Fine. Grandson, granddaughter, either is fine.

259
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,380
The best would be two or more.

260
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,780
Let's have a happy cooperation.

261
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,000
Just talking properly is enough.

262
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:32,924
Auntie.

263
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,980
Come here.

264
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,560
Have you taken your mom home?

265
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,840
She was drunk today. If she said something contrary,

266
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,040
don't take it to heart, Auntie.

267
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,336
I know that she's doing it for you.

268
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,720
Although my mom is very dominant,

269
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,080
she has indeed suffered greatly for me.

270
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,140
Gu Yi...

271
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,080
I'm really not trying to be tough on you.

272
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,880
I have my own worries.

273
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,660
Back when I made you sweep, cook, and do all sorts of things,

274
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,580
it wasn't to turn you into a househusband.

275
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,540
I just wanted to find out

276
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,300
how far you would go for our Qiao Jing.

277
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,800
What I care about isn't your family background.

278
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:44,620
I care whether you will continue to treat her so well after marriage.

279
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,700
Auntie, I understand your concerns.

280
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,760
Before meeting Qiao Jing, I got bipolar disorder.

281
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,420
I was a very selfish, shallow person,

282
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,080
and I made regrettable mistakes.

283
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,680
But Qiao Jing never gave up on me.

284
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,360
She inspired my changes.

285
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,100
She helped me fathom love and responsibility.

286
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,460
For me, she isn't just someone I cherish;

287
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,080
she taught me how to grow

288
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,580
and to overcome obstacles.

289
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,140
Auntie, it's okay if you don't accept me now.

290
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,560
Time will prove my heart.

291
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:33,330
I hope you will forever remember what you said today.

292
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,232
Rest early.

293
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:44,620
- Goodnight, Auntie. 
 - Goodnight.

294
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,940
 Mrs. Gu, you can't go in.

295
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,740
 Chairman Gu is currently unable to see visitors.

296
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,520
 I am Gu Nan's wife.

297
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,200
I have the right to know my husband's current condition!

298
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,560
Mrs. Gu, Mrs. Gu.

299
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,180
Chairman Gu is still in a coma. His condition isn't optimistic at all. He needs to rest.

300
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,540
How could this happen?

301
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,220
Chairman Gu's cancer cells have spread severely.

302
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,620
We can only use conservative treatment now.

303
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,500
We hope that can help him through this tough challenge.

304
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,060
When will he wake up?

305
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,740
It's hard to say. It depends on the situation.

306
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,640
Here you go. Stop eating dry food and drink some milk.

307
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,880
Thank you, Mom.

308
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,488
Here you go.

309
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:44,348
Thank you, Mom.

310
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,644
Whom are you calling "Mom"?

311
00:22:47,644 --> 00:22:49,980
You will be my mom sooner or later.

312
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,860
If you want to call me "Mom" rightfully,

313
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,800
you must first register your marriage.

314
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,364
We definitely will.

315
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,680
I've been here for several days.

316
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,280
I'm worried your father has already ruined the shop's business.

317
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,940
I have to go back.

318
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,540
Mom, stay a few more days.

319
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,120
I'll take you to South City on a tour.

320
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,380
You and Gu Yi are busy picking up trash. I'll no longer bother you.

321
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,580
Don't neglect your health.

322
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,740
Take good care of yourself.

323
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,920
After a miscarriage, you must focus on your health.

324
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,480
If not for A'Juan, I wouldn't have known about it.

325
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,100
- Mom, did you meet him? 
 - Yes.

326
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,660
He came to see you when you were out.

327
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,360
Don't blame him. He was just concerned about you.

328
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,360
It isn't easy for one so young to have suffered so much hardship.

329
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,480
I made sugar-coated fruit for him. Take it to him later.

330
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,420
Eat up.

331
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,800
I came late; I was a little busy at work.

332
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,840
You didn't wait long, did you?

333
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,780
My mom said you love sugar-coated fruit so she made it for you.

334
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,260
Apart from my mom, only Auntie remembers my preferences.

335
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,580
If you still cared about my mom at all,

336
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,600
you shouldn't have involved her in our matters.

337
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,460
Weren't you the one who told her of my pregnancy?

338
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,920
Were you planning to never tell her?

339
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,080
It's my decision if and when I tell her.

340
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,580
Don't interfere in my life anymore.

341
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,280
Why did you talk to him for so long?

342
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,744
Are you jealous?

343
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:12,140
Of course not.

344
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,720
I'm the Qiao Family son-in-law, approved by your mom.

345
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,580
No one can topple my position.

346
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,060
 Director Gu! Director Gu! You have to help me.

347
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,920
I-I really have nowhere to turn.

348
00:25:41,828 --> 00:25:44,780
 Wait a moment. I made a new version by Director Gu's request.

349
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,540
 Publish this.

350
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,480
 Really? Why didn't the secretary's office send me an email by procedure?

351
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,160
 In a matter of life and death, why worry about procedure?

352
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,240
 Hurry, quickly!

353
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,500
 Now things have exploded, I can't bear the responsibility.

354
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,940
 It was you gave me the USB drive.

355
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,420
 I'll tell Director Gu!

356
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,500
 Stop.

357
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,400
 What proof do you have?

358
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,580
 Do you think he will believe you or me?

359
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,040
 Don't worry.

360
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,540
 If you accept the blame, I promise to treat you well.

361
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,000
 Here's ¥500,000 ($70,000). Take it first.

362
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,660
 I'll handle the rest for you, then I'll send you abroad.

363
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,660
 But if you report me, we will both be implicated.

364
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,180
 What do you mean there's no way?

365
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,860
 Anxia rejected the out-of-court settlement.

366
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,480
 - They're determined to sue you. 
 - How is that possible?

367
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,520
 Someone at Anxia will surely help me!

368
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,800
 The court date is soon. Who can help you now?

369
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,700
 Where are you? Why haven't you shown up?

370
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,630

371
00:27:25,408 --> 00:27:30,264
Director Gu, I was stupid and blind.

372
00:27:30,264 --> 00:27:32,480
So I fell in Zhou Rui's trap.

373
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,700
I really don't want to go to jail.

374
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,980
I finally escaped. You have to save me.

375
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,668
Get up.

376
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,800
Don't worry. I will investigate the matter fully.

377
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,380
All you can do now is tell the police the truth of what happened.

378
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,740
It will help both you and Anxia.

379
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,840
I understand.

380
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,680
Then I'll go.

381
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,900
Thank you, Director Gu.

382
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,644
I'll walk you out.

383
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,760
Chen Lan's trial approaches. How is the preparation?

384
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,260
The case is clear; evidence is sufficient.

385
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,600
There's no problem at all.

386
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,160
Good.

387
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:19,380
Thank you for the trouble, Lawyer Wang.

388
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,544
It's my duty.

389
00:28:20,544 --> 00:28:21,820
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

390
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,500
All right, you've worked hard.

391
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,760
Director Zhou, Chen Lan escaped.

392
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,980
How did you let that happen?

393
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,740
- How long was he gone? 
 - About two hours.

394
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,660
Let's go!

395
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,100
- You can leave for now. 
 - Yes.

396
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,160
I treated you like a brother, and you stabbed me in the back.

397
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,216
"Brother"?

398
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,080
Do we count as brothers?

399
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,700
From childhood to adulthood,

400
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,460
I've always obeyed you and flattered you.

401
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,780
Whatever you said, I instantly complied obediently!

402
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,940
Whatever you wanted, I had to give it to you.

403
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,800
From candies as children, to cars when older,

404
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,540
to projects I liked, and even the woman I fell in love with.

405
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,500
Did you do all this for Bai Yun?

406
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,760
Didn't you know?

407
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,760
I've liked Xiao Yun a long time.

408
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,900
I never wanted to be her so-called brother.

409
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,200
She has only you in her heart.

410
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,840
It's okay. I can accept that.

411
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,980
If she's happy, I can accept it.

412
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,280
But for that Qiao Jing,

413
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,300
a despicable woman, you repeatedly hurt Bai Yun!

414
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,620
Yes, she did something wrong.

415
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,140
But how could you be so heartless?

416
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,540
Now things have come to this...

417
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,340
you got what you wanted.

418
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,300
You and that Qiao Jing have a happy life together.

419
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,220
But have you ever thought of Xiao Yun?

420
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,320
Have you considered her situation?

421
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,960
Her life is ruined!

422
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,160
Why didn't you say it sooner?

423
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,380
Why didn't you openly tell Bai Yun what you wanted?

424
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,980
Why?

425
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,260
I never took anything from childhood to adulthood!

426
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,260
Your complaints only show you're a coward who can't even express your true feelings!

427
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,740
Bai Yun's downfall is entirely of her own doing

428
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,260
and isn't anyone else's fault.

429
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:21,848
In all these years, I never knew your true colors.

430
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,680
It is because you never took me seriously.

431
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:12,970

432
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:18,750
