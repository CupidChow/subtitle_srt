1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,980

2
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:45,692

3
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:48,456

4
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,680
Come on, Gu Gong, have some water.

5
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,192
Qiang.

6
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,880
About this matter, Gu Gong can't take all the blame.

7
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,200
That Supervisor Zhang is clearly trying to shift the blame, right?

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,880
What happened that night?

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,620
After you left that night, we finished sorting the waste.

10
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,140
Quan told us to go back, and he would finish up.

11
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,132
But I didn't expect…

12
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,180
Is there a surveillance camera at that place?

13
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,040
Yes, but only one

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,200
and the angle is very tricky.

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,440
I saw the truck on top of that rock,

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,760
then the truck flipped over.

17
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,000
Which truck was involved?

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,864
Who was the driver?

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,180
Master Zheng Yao Jun.

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,580
Are you here to visit him on Gu Yi's behalf?

21
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,452
He is still unconscious.

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,620
You wait for me at the elevator.

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,328
Will do, Director Su.

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,980
This is not also your doing, is it?

25
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,400
In your eyes, am I already that ruthless?

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,540
You can forgive Gu Yi; why can't you try to understand me?

27
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,280
They are the ones who pushed me step by step to this point.

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,000
It's the Gu Family who wronged my mom!

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,980
They are the sinners.

30
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,000
I know it's not my place to say be gracious about things,

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,320
but I really can't understand you.

32
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,160
Master Zheng is also under investigation

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,840
so this vehicle won't operate for a while.

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,436
What are you doing?

35
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:29,244
What are you looking at?

36
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,560
Master Zheng, when did you change your tires?

37
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,940
Half a month ago.

38
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,600
What is wrong? Is there a problem?

39
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:41,852
Nothing.

40
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,080
You're suspended and still hanging around here.

41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,140
- Why are you being so rude? 
 - Brother Qiang!

42
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,120
Are you looking for a beating?

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,440
Brother Qiang, calm down. Let's go back.

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,900
I suspect the trucks from the recycling company have been overloading their trucks.

45
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,060
There's a problem with Zheng Yao Jun's truck and tires.

46
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,660
It's impossible for new tires changed half a month ago

47
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,560
to wear and deform so badly.

48
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,880
We worked so hard to sort out the construction waste,

49
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,020
and they just mixed it all up!

50
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,980
They tried to save some work

51
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,440
so they mixed it all up.

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,020
Then we did it for nothing!

53
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,880
The rocks on the road,

54
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,480
I suspect are also related to the trucks being overloaded.

55
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,100
The top of the truck is supposed to be sealed.

56
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,640
But they wanted to carry more so they didn't seal it properly.

57
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,280
That's why the cover plate got loose and rocks fell out.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,120
Overloading the trucks is an extremely serious matter,

59
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,040
but that is just our guess at the moment.

60
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,880
We still need professionals to do the tests.

61
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,180
We can just report it to the leaders and let them look into it, right?

62
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,760
Whom do we report to?

63
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,620
Zhang Chen or Guan Hui?

64
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,000
Maybe they are complicit!

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,800
What should we do then?

66
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,564
Lao (Old) Lin!

67
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:12,740
Lao Lin, you're awake!

68
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,520
Hold on, I'll go get the doctor for you.

69
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,740
Lin Gong (Worker) woke up? Just in time for us to see him.

70
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,156
Mrs. Lin, we have a few questions for Lin Gong.

71
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:26,420
Could you let us…

72
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,120
He just woke up. I need to get a doctor to check him out.

73
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,320
I'm fine.

74
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,400
Let Supervisor Zhang come in.

75
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,080
Thank you!

76
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,260
Lin Gong, how are you feeling?

77
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,780
Today, our customers' needs

78
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,360
have changed from basic environment and engineering quality to privacy and…

79
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,720
Sorry to interrupt.

80
00:05:57,856 --> 00:06:00,780
Director Su, those people are at the door asking for you to come out.

81
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
What should we do?

82
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,460
I'm in a meeting.

83
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,400
Just tell them to wait.

84
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,888
Okay.

85
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,540
He told us to wait here. How long must we wait?

86
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,880
Yes, who knows what they discuss?

87
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,600
It's been two hours, right? We have work to do later.

88
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,108
Yes.

89
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:22,160
- Right, Gu Gong? 
 - Gu Gong?

90
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,440
Let's not waste time on them.

91
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,100
How is the progress of the development zone in North City?

92
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,580
Although there was an accident,

93
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,240
it definitely won't affect the progress.

94
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,100
We are on schedule and on target every day.

95
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,616
- The injured worker… 
 - Su Juan!

96
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,260
- Director Gu... 
 - Director Gu.

97
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,032
I'm in a meeting right now, please leave.

98
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,080
Since you're discussing the development zone in North City,

99
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,740
I happen to have a few questions.

100
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,820
Once I get answers, I'll leave.

101
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,940
Over 100 tons of construction waste is made daily in North City's development zone.

102
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,100
Per regulations, ten extra-tall trucks that can carry over ten-ton loads each must clear those out,

103
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,820
but only five trucks are onsite.

104
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,660
And they only remove debris every other day.

105
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,500
So Supervisor Zhang, how can five trucks remove more than 200 tons of waste?

106
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,860
The contractor found a professional waste recycling company to deal with it.

107
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,460
They have their own arrangements and plans!

108
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,900
You're already suspended. Stop stirring up trouble here!

109
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,660
You're Anxia's assigned supervisor,

110
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,580
and it's your job to supervise the contractor.

111
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,300
How could you agree to such an unreasonable arrangement?

112
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,700
Is it true what they said?

113
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,460
No, definitely not.

114
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,100
You can find out easily if you look into it!

115
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,340
He says nonsense to escape responsibility for Lin Yong Quan's injury!

116
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,180
Don't believe him, everyone!

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,200
Gu Gong is right.

118
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,580
Lin Yong Quan, think carefully before you speak.

119
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,960
I'm really sorry.

120
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,800
I should have told you this sooner.

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,660
But I feared Supervisor Zhang

122
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,000
so I kept it a secret for him.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,800
I got what I deserved for what happened.

124
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,280
That night, only two trucks came to carry debris.

125
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,720
Each truck was overloaded by 40%.

126
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
When they left,

127
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,980
the bricks from the first truck fell off and hit the second truck.

128
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,960
The second truck was too heavy

129
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,180
so it flipped over.

130
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,340
So the real cause of this incident is overloading trucks!

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,900
This is what you gave me yesterday.

132
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,720
I don't want your dirty money!

133
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,080
I told him to get lost before!

134
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,200
How dare you still use him?

135
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,300
Everyone,

136
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,740
I apologize on behalf of Anxia.

137
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,176
I will get to the bottom of this.

138
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:13,880
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,900
You useless thing!

140
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,560
You have made me lose face (respect).

141
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,600
I was cheated by the contractor, too.

142
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,660
A'Juan, he's just a useless loser.

143
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,740
I never should have let you give him a chance,

144
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,420
but he is your uncle after all.

145
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,260
He got cheated carelessly this time.

146
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,360
Yes, I was also fooled by the contractor.

147
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:03,816
Aunt, I wanted to handle it lightly.

148
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,680
But Gu Yi came with the workers this time.

149
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,480
Everyone in the company saw it clearly.

150
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,400
If I don't handle it impartially, I can't convince the crowd.

151
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,880
Why are you watering flowers at noon?

152
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,920
People usually do it in the morning or evening,

153
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,900
but you do it at noon.

154
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,520
I like watering flowers at noon.

155
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,800
I'm watering the flowers, and I'll water you too!

156
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,676
Gu Yi!

157
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,380
Gu Yi!

158
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,960
How dare you spray me?

159
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,740
Stop it!

160
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,840
Stop it!

161
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,200
Mom.

162
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,960
What are you two doing?

163
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,720
Mom, try the food I made with Qiao Jing.

164
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,960
This is the first time you peeled shrimp for me.

165
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,000
He made all these dishes.

166
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,500
You never even went in the kitchen before,

167
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,540
and why do you…

168
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,620
I hardly recognize you.

169
00:12:24,864 --> 00:12:29,780
Mom, people should always improve.

170
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,020
Moreover, now I've met someone worth it.

171
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,700
Let's eat.

172
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,020
Su Juan has already suspended Zhang Chen and started an investigation.

173
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,760
Your aunt is furious.

174
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,800
He deserves it.

175
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,124
What about you?

176
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,460
What is your plan?

177
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,440
Do you plan to keep picking trash on the construction site?

178
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:21,260
Mom, I want to leave Anxia.

179
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,760
"Leave"?

180
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,700
Where are you going?

181
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,340
I want to start a business with Qiao Jing to develop equipment that recycles construction waste.

182
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,300
This field is currently a blue ocean (low competition) with huge market potential.

183
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,800
Okay.

184
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,940
With such ambition, I'll surely support you.

185
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,360
My son can make it big without relying on the Gu Family.

186
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,244
Thank you, Mom.

187
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,620
 Madam, something happened to Chairman Gu!

188
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,820
I just used a new target drug which effectively curbs the spread of cancer cells.

189
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,440
How is it?

190
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
This disease has been with me for years.

191
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,740
Don't worry.

192
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,340
Chairman Gu's cancer cells have spread again.

193
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,100
We just tried a new target drug that's effective.

194
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,904
Who are you?

195
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,260
Auntie Fang, this is the new expert I hired.

196
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,820
He will develop a new treatment plan for dad's condition.

197
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,800
Dr. Han, thank you.

198
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,300
The expert you hired?

199
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,040
I think we should stick with the doctor we are familiar with.

200
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,100
If the previous one could cure me, I would have been cured long ago.

201
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,600
It's all right to use a new doctor.

202
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,180
Don't you want to go in and see him?

203
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,304
No.

204
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:52,580
He will only be more upset to see me anyway.

205
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,240
Chairman Gu is just like you. He always says things he doesn't mean.

206
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,220
He must want to see you again.

207
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,300
Go.

208
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,000
Dad, have some water.

209
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,900
Did you solve Zhang Chen's matter?

210
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,400
 He colluded with the contractor to take kickbacks.

211
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,620
 I removed him from his post.

212
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,020
He is a useless loser, yet so bold.

213
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,740
I don't know what your aunt sees in him.

214
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,980
It's my fault for trusting him too much

215
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,180
and getting Younger Brother in trouble.

216
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,740
I asked him to return to the office, but he said he didn't want to.

217
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,490
"He didn't want to"?

218
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,420
So what will he do?

219
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,400
He said he wants to start a business.

220
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,100
He overestimates his abilities. Starting a business isn't easy.

221
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,420
Leave him alone. Let him do it.

222
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,760
Let's see what he can do.

223
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,500
A'Juan, take me back.

224
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,156
All right, Dad.

225
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,340
 Turn left at the road ahead.

226
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,320
Hello.

227
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,200
Hello, who are you looking for?

228
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,520
Is Qiao Jing living here?

229
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,000
Qiao Jing lives here.

230
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,440
Great, let's go in. Thank you.

231
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,520
Excuse me, who are you?

232
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm Gu Yi's mother. My name is Fang Pei.

233
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,340
Gu Yi's mom...

234
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,340
Gu Yi's mom?

235
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,100
Why are you at my daughter's house?

236
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,520
Did you not say you are colleagues?

237
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,400
When did you get together?

238
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,160
It would be fine if he was from an ordinary family, but I heard he's the son of Anxia's boss.

239
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,460
So many scandals are in his family!

240
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,360
It's all over the news.

241
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,100
We can't afford it.

242
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,950
I didn't look down on your humble family,

243
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,620
but now you're getting on a high horse (arrogant)?

244
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,240
Our humble family won't suddenly have an illegitimate child.

245
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,220
I heard Gu Yi had a fiancee before,

246
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,180
but he ended the engagement for some woman.

247
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,880
What a mess.

248
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,400
Mom, I'm that woman.

249
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,600
Right, I don't know whom he did it for.

250
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,460
He is so obsessed.

251
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,000
Mom, talk nicely.

252
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,370
What?

253
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,380
I can tell you right now;

254
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,600
I absolutely don't agree with you two being together.

255
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,480
Mom!

256
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,900
Don't be fooled by them.

257
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,090
Now they say a bunch of nice things to coax you and fool you,

258
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,620
but they have some wicked ideas.

259
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,940
Our son didn't coax her; it's your daughter who won't let him go!

260
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,200
Mom, I pursued Qiao Jing first.

261
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,608
You!

262
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,490
I don't know who eagerly came to me back then.

263
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,260
I never took you seriously at all.

264
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,080
I will never agree.

265
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,660
Just give up.

266
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,080
You!

267
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,280
Auntie, my mom has something to do. I'll take her home first.

268
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,144
Bye.

269
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,300
Let's go.

270
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:04,840
- Mom! 
 -  What? What? What?

271
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,400
Do you want to get married that badly?

272
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,728
I…

273
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,960
Stop pushing me!

274
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,100
Whose son are you?

275
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,300
I'm so angry!

276
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,040
I can't believe you were there with her to embarrass me.

277
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,080
But it's true that I pursued Qiao Jing.

278
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,500
How dare you say that?

279
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,040
You loser!

280
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,080
It appears Li Jing is determined to disapprove of you two.

281
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,110
Auntie Li is biased against our family,

282
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,320
but I'll prove myself through my actions.

283
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,500
You can convince me, but maybe not Li Jing.

284
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,620
Mom, you have to trust me.

285
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,308
I definitely can.

286
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,720
All right, you don't need to see me off. Head back in.

287
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,100
- I'm leaving. 
 - Okay.

288
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,820
When did you get together with him?

289
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,840
A lot has happened.

290
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,260
I didn't get a chance to tell you yet.

291
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,960
Mom, calm down.

292
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,900
Babe, you can't marry this man.

293
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,360
His family is wealthy indeed,

294
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,060
but so many rich people are out there. Why find one with scandals?

295
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,940
That's his dad's issue.

296
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,600
Gu Yi won't do that.

297
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,900
Like father, like son. Do you not understand it?

298
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,680
Mom, Gu Yi was indeed immature before,

299
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,540
but I was wrong, too.

300
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,380
Now we have both changed.

301
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,580
You should get to know him.

302
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,672
Auntie.

303
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,780
Right!

304
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,168
All right, then I'll stay here a few more days

305
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:20,900
and get to know Young Master Gu.

306
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,840
Young Master Gu.

307
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,204
Welcome.

308
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,440
This is delicious. Who made it?

309
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,960
Qiao Jing made it.

310
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,800
- Eat. 
 - Mom.

311
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,840
Eat up.

312
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,040
Mom, you have some.

313
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,630
 The prince from the fairy tale. That prince is under a curse (in Korean).

314
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,880
 So what?

315
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,280
 A kiss.

316
00:24:54,972 --> 00:24:57,664
♫  It's too quiet  ♫

317
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:02,972
♫  You're always silent  ♫

318
00:25:02,972 --> 00:25:05,914
♫  The sweetness of the past  ♫

319
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:09,216
♫  Is not even worth mentioning  ♫

320
00:25:11,352 --> 00:25:14,397
♫  The view of your back as you walk away  ♫

321
00:25:14,397 --> 00:25:19,484
♫  Is so strange yet familiar  ♫

322
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,464
♫  The cruelty of a memory  ♫

323
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:27,580
♫  Refuses to stop in the moment of happiness   ♫

324
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,953
♫  I turn to watch your back as you leave  ♫

325
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:34,697
♫  It's a vision or a dream  ♫

326
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:41,790
♫  Late at night, it's acting out a play with me  ♫

327
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:47,520
♫  Even if you really pass by  ♫

328
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,292
♫  I don't care, either  ♫

329
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:53,792
♫  Get a little closer  ♫

330
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:55,940
♫  Just a bit more  ♫

331
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,440
Do you also like watching this?

332
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,960
Great, let's watch it together.

333
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,480
Naughty.

334
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,100
Auntie, I'm sorry. I went to the wrong place.

335
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,360
Auntie.

336
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,080
This is when good men get up early to cook;

337
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,800
only lazy men are still in bed.

338
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,660
One, two, three, get up!

339
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,020
Go make breakfast.

340
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,460
All right.

341
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
Auntie, please enjoy.

342
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,700
I wonder if it suits your taste.

343
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,640
The buns are too small,

344
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,860
and the steamed breads are too dry.

345
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,752
The fried dumplings are too oily,

346
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,580
and the porridge is too watery.

347
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,584
The soy milk is tasteless.

348
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,820
Fried donuts are unhealthy.

349
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,100
You look like you've never done any housework before.

350
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,920
Kneel on the ground so you can scrub harder, okay?

351
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,800
Exactly.

352
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,840
What are you doing so early in the morning?

353
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,440
What? To be our family's son-in-law,

354
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,460
he has to work hard just like your dad. Understand?

355
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,480
Then we can do it together.

356
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,660
Why make him do it alone?

357
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,240
Isn't it natural for a man to cherish a woman?

358
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,880
Such a tall man is supposed to do housework!

359
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,140
Yes, you are right.

360
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,900
Mom, I want to eat the boiled fish you make.

361
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,640
I've been craving it for so long.

362
00:29:07,072 --> 00:29:08,760
Really?

363
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,960
All right, I'll go buy a fish for you.

364
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,140
Work hard!

365
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,200
All right. Bye, Auntie!

366
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,540
Get up! Get up!

367
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,012
Get up!

368
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,400
Are you tired?

369
00:29:38,656 --> 00:29:41,620
You know what? Your mom got me up at 5:30 a.m.

370
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,260
I've been working until now. It's back breaking.

371
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,260
Then take a break, and I'll give you a massage.

372
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,240
 Jing Jing, where is my wallet?

373
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,680
Here it is.

374
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,340
Good job.

375
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,540
Work hard! I'll check when I get back.

376
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,228
All right.

377
00:30:01,228 --> 00:30:04,760
Eat sunflower seeds. Sit down and eat.

378
00:30:06,192 --> 00:30:08,640
- I'm leaving! 
 - Auntie, bye bye.

379
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,200
Get up.

380
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,780
Forget it, let's just clean up first.

381
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,720
We still have such a big area...

382
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,552
I'll help you.

383
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,180
No, you take a rest.

384
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,620
Two is better than one.

385
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,920
But my mom really went too far this time.

386
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,440
It's fine. She is just testing me.

387
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,880
Pleasing the mother-in-law is required for a qualified son-in-law.

388
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,432
Let's clean.

389
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:59,400

390
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,090
"The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

391
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:12,208
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

392
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:20,810
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

393
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:25,040
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

394
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:33,639
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

395
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:39,176
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

396
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:44,888
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

397
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:51,142
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

398
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:57,136
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

399
00:31:57,136 --> 00:32:00,831
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

400
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:04,035
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

401
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:10,421
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

402
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:16,826
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

403
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:22,762
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

404
00:32:22,762 --> 00:32:26,444
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

405
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:30,026
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

406
00:32:30,026 --> 00:32:33,570
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

407
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:39,222
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

408
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:44,009
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

409
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:48,716
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

410
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:55,127
♫  This unbearable plot  ♫

411
00:32:55,127 --> 00:33:01,624
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫

412
00:33:01,624 --> 00:33:07,487
♫  Being a guest may be my other destiny  ♫

413
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:14,888
♫  As the one who left, what gives me the right to care?  ♫

414
00:33:14,888 --> 00:33:20,747
♫  After all, you're the one who finally got married, and I'm just a guest  ♫

415
00:33:20,747 --> 00:33:27,146
♫  I drained all the memories to celebrate your wedding  ♫

416
00:33:27,146 --> 00:33:33,180
♫  But I never had the courage to bless you  ♫

417
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:43,548
♫  Thank you for making me finally aware and returning me back to myself  ♫

418
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:54,036
♫  At least I can still be a guest to witness your love  ♫

419
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:57,992
♫  He's so lucky to have met you  ♫

420
00:33:57,992 --> 00:34:08,074
♫  I hope he loves you more than I do  ♫
