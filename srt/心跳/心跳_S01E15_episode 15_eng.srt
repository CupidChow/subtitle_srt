1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:10,020

2
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:45,560

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,428

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,240
Move aside, please!

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,920
Gu Yi!

6
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,600
Move aside! Move aside!

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,620
Gu Yi!

8
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,180
Family members are not allowed to enter.

9
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,080
Please wait outside.

10
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:21,024

11
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,680
What exactly happened?

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,260
I also only rushed over after receiving Gu Yi's call.

13
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,080
Ask the police the exact details of what happened.

14
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,740
Mrs. Gu,

15
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,620
Gu Yi got hurt while trying to save me.

16
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,064
Mrs. Gu,

17
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,700
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,040
How did my son end up with

19
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,240
a person like you who brings misfortune?

20
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,440
 Son, you're finally awake.

21
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Qiao…

22
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,280
Qiao Jing,

23
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:18,056
where is she?

24
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,536
I need to see her.

25
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:25,140
Don't worry; she is fine.

26
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,300
You were hurt so badly for her, yet you still ask for her.

27
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm glad she is fine,

28
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,580
that she is okay.

29
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,700
I've always been the one who owes her.

30
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,000
I am willing... to give her anything,

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,940
no matter how much.

32
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,760
You're a fool.

33
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,928
You're awake.

34
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,940
How did you end up sleeping here?

35
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,840
How's the wound on your hand?

36
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,564
It's fine.

37
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,260
How did you find me?

38
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,212
 Our phones are set so we can find each other.

39
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:34,340
 That day, I saw you motionless in a factory far away.

40
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,720
 Since your dilemma with Bai Yun is now in the spotlight,

41
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,820
 I suspected danger and went there.

42
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,020
And on my way, I called the police.

43
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,200
Thankfully, you're fine.

44
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,680
Lie down; don't move around.

45
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,920
The doctor said the injury wasn't in a vital spot,

46
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,720
and the wounds aren't too deep,

47
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,880
but you must rest during this time.

48
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,336
This time…

49
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,280
Thank you.

50
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,880
What I want is not thanks.

51
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,480
If possible,

52
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,840
I want a chance to explain.

53
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,200
I really didn't know about what Bai Yun did.

54
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,200
The Gu family has never disliked this child.

55
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,540
When I heard you had a miscarriage, I sped to the hospital.

56
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,000
I saw you were with Su Juan.

57
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,320
I jumped to conclusions impulsively.

58
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,540
I said those words mindlessly

59
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,640
because I thought you didn't care for our child.

60
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,540
Qiao Jing, I was wrong.

61
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,200
I should have realized that

62
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,380
losing our child hurt you more

63
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,600
than it hurt me.

64
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:17,540
What was your plan

65
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,860
when you asked me out that day?

66
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,616
That day

67
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,040
I would propose to you.

68
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,280
This ring

69
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,000
was meant for your hand.

70
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,960
I'm not forcing you to agree.

71
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,200
Give me another chance;

72
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,700
that is enough.

73
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,420
I'm back.

74
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,292
- How is it? 
 - Yes, how is it?

75
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:36,760
Miss Qiao is fine.

76
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,500
Director Gu must stay in hospital a few days.

77
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,520
Mr. Gu is really pitiful.

78
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,320
Director Gu said the Gret leader has arrived in South City.

79
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,920
The plan must be finalized within a week.

80
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,380
All work hard so Director Gu can rest assured.

81
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,280
- Fine, let's do it, come on. 
 - All right, let's do it.

82
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,880
This matter must be related to the Bai family.

83
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,160
Bai Yun has been arrested;

84
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,120
why are they still fiercely causing trouble?

85
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,300
We must not spare her!

86
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,680
The police still seek who is behind all of this.

87
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,040
Now it's all just speculation.

88
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,460
How is Gu Yi doing?

89
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,320
I heard he was stabbed in the waist.

90
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,160
The doctor said it's not a peril,

91
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,520
but he still must rest a while.

92
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,200
He risked his life for you this time.

93
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,380
So it appears he has no connection with Bai Yun.

94
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,480
I misjudged him.

95
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,920
Have you softened up on him?

96
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,300
If you still like each other so much,

97
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,140
why not use this chance to reunite?

98
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,360
Because too many unresolved issues are between us.

99
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,180
However, now I want to give him another chance.

100
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,860
Who can be certain in matters of love?

101
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,700
But if you follow your heart, you can't go wrong.

102
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,600
The police have provided a case update.

103
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,320
Forcing Qiao Jing on the settlement letter

104
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,280
wasn't the Bai family.

105
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Those thugs also know nothing.

106
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,520
If it's not the Bai family,

107
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,920
who could it be?

108
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,000
How do you feel now? Any better?

109
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,436
I will be fine after rest and healing.

110
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:24,492
Auntie Fang.

111
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:26,920
I will leave you two alone. I'll get your medication.

112
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,736
Okay.

113
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:30,456
Take it easy, Auntie Fang.

114
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,000
Tell me, what's going on?

115
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,320
What could be going on with me?

116
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,580
I came to see if your waist is okay.

117
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,560
It's better than yours.

118
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,300
You are extremely brave to fight an enemy gang and still win.

119
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,700
Have you no fear of dying?

120
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,600
I am afraid.

121
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,120
Back then, all I could focus on was protecting her.

122
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,240
Awesome. I respect you.

123
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,660
Are you here to plead for Bai Yun again?

124
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,620
Who could change what you decide?

125
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,900
Also, Xiao Yun is willing to be responsible for all her actions

126
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,380
so what can others do? Right?

127
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,680
I came to inform you that

128
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,680
Senior Gu has fully handed over Gret's project to Su Juan.

129
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,560
How is that possible?

130
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,280
I toiled on this project for a year; how could Dad give it to him?

131
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,120
Since you're hurt in the hospital, Su Juan surely went after this project.

132
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,800

133
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,780
How is Director Gu doing?

134
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,980
It is a pity he had to drop out of this project now.

135
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,160
Director Gu needs to rest

136
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,560
so I will be lead this project until he is better.

137
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,024
Okay.

138
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,480
Please.

139
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,448
Director Ren.

140
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:10,068
Director Gu.

141
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,020
Anxia's proposal is the best I've seen so far.

142
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,280
We won't let Gret down.

143
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,220
This bidding will be super competitive,

144
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,440
and the bidding companies are industry leaders.

145
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,860
Don't underestimate your competitors.

146
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,160
I am sure you can trust Anxia's strength.

147
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,780
Everyone can see your talent, and I believe in you.

148
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,440
I wish you success in the bidding.

149
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,880
Sure. I'll take my leave.

150
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,080
How are you?

151
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,520
The wound was a bit torn. It's now restitched.

152
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,740
Then I will leave first.

153
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,320
Thank you.

154
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,900
You've been too reckless.

155
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,420
If I didn't go, what about the project?

156
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,960
It's everyone's hard work.

157
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,900
I can't let them down.

158
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,840
If you're really worried,

159
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,980
stay with me and take care of me.

160
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,440
You never listen to me anyway so why should I stay?

161
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,800
Of course, I will listen to you.

162
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,820
I'll listen to all you say.

163
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,160
Then rest well at home. I'll watch the project for you.

164
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,628
All right.

165
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,120
He is tangled up in the Bai Yun situation.

166
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,240
Don't mind it.

167
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,380
What about you? What do you think?

168
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,640
Bai Yun made a mistake,

169
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,540
and she must bear the consequences.

170
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,860
But one thing always seemed strange to me.

171
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,240
Bai Yun stated to police that Su Juan told her about your pregnancy.

172
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:21,840
How is that possible?

173
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,640
I've never told him I was pregnant.

174
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,000
But Su Juan was around you all this time.

175
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,840
Maybe he saw some clues.

176
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,840
Though why would he tell her?

177
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,180
First, he used Bai Yun to sow discord between us.

178
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,020
Then when I was in hospital, he took over Gret's project.

179
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,760
From what we can see, he stands to gain the most from all of this.

180
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,520
H-He's not that kind of person.

181
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:58,784
Qiao Jing, people do change.

182
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,560
If you view him logically,

183
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,440
you will notice he isn't that simple.

184
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,980
As expected, Gu Yi won't surrender this project.

185
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,740
The Bai family is no longer usable.

186
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,120
If we want to suppress him,

187
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,740
we must put in more effort.

188
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:29,900
Uncle Jiang, don't worry.

189
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,400
All is going according to plan.

190
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,240

191
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,572
What's up?

192
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,880
I just wanted to get out of bed

193
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,160
so I could change, but I fell.

194
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,440
Can you help me up?

195
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,940
M-My wound hurts.

196
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,280
Okay, I'll help you.

197
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,960
What are you doing?

198
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,720
Don't be uncharitable.

199
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,660
Let me hold you a while.

200
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:08,660
This ring was made specifically for you.

201
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,040
I know you're not ready yet.

202
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,980
If you accept me or not, it is yours.

203
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,700
It belongs to only you.

204
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,380
Let me place it on you.

205
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,756
You're here.

206
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,500
I have something to ask you.

207
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,580
Can we talk later?

208
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,040
I want you to go somewhere with me.

209
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:36,960
Where?

210
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,100
Today is my mom's death anniversary.

211
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,760
Director Gu, those are all the plan's contents.

212
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,780
Does anything need to be adjusted?

213
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,440
Good job. You all worked hard for a year.

214
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,800
Tomorrow we submit our plan.

215
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,520
I believe the final victory will surely be Anxia's.

216
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,300
 Put your bid for Gret's project online or live with the consequences.

217
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,120
Who are you?

218
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,510
 Director Gu, I give you only thirty minutes.

219
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,520
 Sorry the number you dialed is not in service.

220
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,280
She's not at home either.

221
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,320
What's going on? Was she kidnapped again?

222
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,060
Notify the police instantly to track the anonymous call.

223
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,320
First, investigate the bidding competitors.

224
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,892
Yes.

225
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,840
Could the culprit have pre-recorded this in order to deceive us?

226
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,800
I just put this necklace on her last night.

227
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,500
What do we do?

228
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,260
I cannot risk her life.

229
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,900
First, publish the project per the request.

230
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,060
No way!

231
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,060
We prepared for Gret's project for so long.

232
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,980
Publishing the plan is equal to yielding the bid directly.

233
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,640
The whole company's hard work will be wasted!

234
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,540
Of course, I won't just hand over the project. I have arrangements.

235
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,700
Call a meeting.

236
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,800
It's an emergency.

237
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,500
We must swiftly merge our eliminated versions into a new plan.

238
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,040
Hide all doubts we highlighted. Make it partly true and part illusory.

239
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,680
Don't let the other party see any flaws.

240
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,340
Director Gu, time is really too tight. It's impossible to attain.

241
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,680
It must be done!

242
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,000
Tang Ping, put aside all your work. Fully support the design department.

243
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,856
Okay.

244
00:20:37,856 --> 00:20:39,560
Director Gu, we will complete the task promptly.

245
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,120
Xiang Se Se, make several PR plans right away.

246
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,480
Release the news as soon as Qiao Jing is found. Minimize the impact.

247
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,564
Okay.

248
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:49,600
Time is pressing. Get moving fast!

249
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:26,096

250
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,940
Auntie Su, I'm sorry.

251
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm just coming to see you now.

252
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,840
My mom really liked you.

253
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,260
It's just a pity. At her end, she couldn't see you.

254
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,500
The Gu family held her back all her life.

255
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,588
- Director Gu. 
 - Have you checked?

256
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:18,160
It's all done per your instructions, no problem.

257
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,320
Hurry and publish it.

258
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,916
Okay.

259
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,920
Have you been with Gu Yi these days?

260
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,540
He was injured for me.

261
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,840
I should certainly take care of him.

262
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,460
Is it simply taking care?

263
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,060
What exactly do you mean?

264
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,960
Gratitude isn't love.

265
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,940
I fear you confuse the two.

266
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,160
I am very grateful to him.

267
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:59,252
But actually, before your return, I already fell for him.

268
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,256
That is why you never replied to me.

269
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,340
How do I lose to him when I knew you so long and he only three years?

270
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,320
Time cannot quantify love.

271
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,240
We both missed out on far too much.

272
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,540
Why did we miss out?

273
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,360
Isn't it due to the Gu family and Gu Yi?

274
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,240
How could you fall in love with him?

275
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,504
So

276
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,540
I'm just a pawn for your revenge on Gu Yi. Right?

277
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,600
I never thought of using you.

278
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,360
Did you know about my pregnancy?

279
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,884
Yes.

280
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,800
I saw you didn't want to say it so I didn't make you.

281
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,680
What about Bai Yun?

282
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,160
Bai Yun was also provoked by you, right?

283
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,792
No.

284
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,920
Yes, I admit it was a slip of the tongue.

285
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,840
I really didn't expect her to do such a thing.

286
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,040
Do you believe such a clumsy explanation?

287
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,440
You would rather believe Gu Yi than believe me, right?

288
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,700
The Su Juan I liked

289
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,920
is gone forever.

290
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,800
Oh my gosh. Tang Ping, come here quickly.

291
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,500
Xiao Ru, Yang Yang, take a look.

292
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,560

293
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,088
This is bad.

294
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,228
Go in!

295
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,080
It's him!

296
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,600
He took the wrong USB drive and published our true plan!

297
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,040
What's going on?

298
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,104
Director Gu, w-with so many m-modified plans,

299
00:25:34,104 --> 00:25:36,660
I accidentally published the true plan.

300
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,000
Did you withdraw it?

301
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,400
It's being withdrawn. But it's likely too late.

302
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,240
I always stressed double-checking!

303
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,920
Why did it still go wrong?

304
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,760
I'm sorry, Director Gu. I'm sorry.

305
00:25:52,288 --> 00:25:53,740
Dad.

306
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:58,292
Dad.

307
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,080
Don't hit him anymore! Don't hit him!

308
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,640
He's still injured.

309
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,080
The project leak was an accident. I will take all the responsibility.

310
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
But, Dad, Qiao Jing is still missing!

311
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,200
I need to ensure her safety.

312
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,540
Is Qiao Jing important?

313
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,540
What do the thousands of company employees mean to you?

314
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,880
Due to your mistake, all their hard work went down the drain!

315
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,540
What will you use to bear it?

316
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,580
Xiao Yi, this time you really acted too rashly.

317
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,900
You should never, ever sell the company for a woman.

318
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,720
Yes. Anxia is not just yours.

319
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,080
Do you even care about us at all?

320
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:56,724
Dad.

321
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,500
Where were you when you weren't at the company today?

322
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,380
Today is Mom's death anniversary.

323
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,280
I went to see her.

324
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:19,060
Gu Yi, what's the deal with the plan being leaked?

325
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,940
He heard that Qiao Jing was kidnapped

326
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,340
so he sold the project to save her.

327
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,980
That doesn't make sense. Qiao Jing went with me to the tomb.

328
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,300
She should be at home now.

329
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,600
If she was with you, why couldn't we reach her on her phone?

330
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,680
The cemetery is on the mountain. Maybe there's a bad signal.

331
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,600
Xiao Yi, you are completely befuddled.

332
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:51,560
Wait. If it was such a big deal, why didn't you tell me first?

333
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,640
You could derail the entire company's project simply

334
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,480
for not reaching Qiao Jing for a short time.

335
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,360
If something happens to her, you'd bury the entire Gu family with her.

336
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,140
Starting tomorrow, you don't need to go to the company!

337
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,728
It's fine as long as you're okay.

338
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:54,240
I'm sorry.

339
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,300
I initially wanted to talk to Su Juan today,

340
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,364
but I didn't expect…

341
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,856
Let's go home first.

342
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:06,100
Let's go.

343
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,480
Today, Su Juan took me to the cemetery on a whim.

344
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,440
No one else knew.

345
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,610
And from this photo's distance and angle,

346
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,320
it's impossible to take by far sneak shots.

347
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,200
You said you called me several times then, but my phone did not ring.

348
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,200
The signal must have been blocked.

349
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,120
Su Juan is ruthless, even using his mother's death memorial for his scheme.

350
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,040
I think he is connected to Chen Lan, who published the true plan.

351
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,260
I'm so sorry.

352
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,880
I should have told you my whereabouts.

353
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,480
Neither of us was wrong.

354
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,260
If I had to redo it, I would still make the same choice,

355
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:15,044
as long as you're fine.

356
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,680
The bidding starts tomorrow.

357
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,300
Will we really give up Gret's project this way?

358
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,720
Wasn't there an earlier version of the plan?

359
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,620
Why not let the employees work overtime and adjust it?

360
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,340
Or we can ask Gret's people to give us a few more days.

361
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,092
- Then we can... 
 - Enough.

362
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:43,436
A'Juan, what do you think?

363
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,600
I believe what has happened to this point is irreversible.

364
00:30:57,032 --> 00:31:00,780
But we can consider collaborating with the company that eventually wins the bid.

365
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,860
Gret's is not a small project.

366
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,340
Besides us, the most likely contender is Jiahe.

367
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,500
This is feasible.

368
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,100
Although our proposal was leaked, but our experience is richer than Jiahe's.

369
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,560
I suppose they wouldn't refuse.

370
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,840
Yes.

371
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,960
Young people have a sharp mind.

372
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,480
This way, at least we get a share of the profits and minimize company losses.

373
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,168
Here's the deal.

374
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,300
A'Juan, you will take Gu Yi's position and keep this project moving forward.

375
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,776
Dad.

376
00:31:56,576 --> 00:31:59,488

377
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,140
After more than a year of hard work, we're back to square one.

378
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,300
Could it have been a malicious competition by Jiahe yesterday?

379
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,740
They knew Miss Qiao's whereabouts ahead of time, then took the photo and duped us.

380
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,320
I don't think so.

381
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,540
I feel it might not be an outsider.

382
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,600
It depends on who benefits the most.

383
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,300
- Director Gu. 
 - Director Gu.

384
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,400
Notify the design and project departments for a meeting.

385
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,800
We can't lose Gret's project yet.

386
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:41,280
Director Gu.

387
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,260
Are you sure about the meeting?

388
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,912
What do you mean?

389
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,360
Su Juan, why are you sitting here?

390
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,920
You came just in time.

391
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,740
Your transfer order is received.

392
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,260
The Wanyuan District project is almost done. Dad wants you to be on it.

393
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,040
I already tried to dissuade him.

394
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,100
He's been angry lately.

395
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,160
So in this period, you must make do.

396
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,020
I can't leave before Gret's project is resolved.

397
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,340
That project was handed to me.

398
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,320
Don't worry, I won't let everyone's hard work go to waste.

399
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,024
Also,

400
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,520
take your photo with you.

401
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:42,040
Since I was hospitalized, you set up traps.

402
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,300
I underestimated you.

403
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,240
I don't understand what you're saying.

404
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,220
Since you like this position so much, I'll give it to you.

405
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,060
But I hope you hold onto it; don't fall too quickly.

406
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:17,760
Su Juan, did you feel guilty in front of Aunt Su yesterday?

407
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,620
Why should I feel guilty?

408
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,460
I took the girl she used to like to see her.

409
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,920
You used her to trick me!

410
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,000
I didn't deceive you.

411
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,440
Yesterday was her death memorial.

412
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,580
Then you shouldn't have done this.

413
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:43,240
No matter how you take revenge on Gu Family, Aunt Su shouldn't be your pawn!

414
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:11,600

415
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,610
 "The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

416
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:20,812
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

417

432
00:36:42,082 --> 00:36:49,234
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

433
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:52,521
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

434
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:57,328
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

435
00:36:57,328 --> 00:37:02,939

00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,364
