1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:09,190

2
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:45,512

3
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:48,317

4
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:57,390
Prepare a formal dress. Come to a charity dinner with me tonight.

5
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,950
Okay.

6
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,730
What happened?

7
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,294
It's fine. I accidentally scratched it.

8
00:01:06,294 --> 00:01:09,054
I don't want to bring a companion with a scratched face with me tonight.

9
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:11,074
You take care of it.

10
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:09,674
Director Gu, you're finally here.

11
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:11,140
We've waited for you a long time.

12
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,150
Secretary Qiao, you're getting more beautiful.

13
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,730
Hello, Director Gu.

14
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:18,374
Big Brother, why are you so late?

15
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:20,414
I'm with Zhou Rui and a few old classmates over there.

16
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:21,650
I'll take you there.

17
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,230
Okay.

18
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:34,100
Director Gu's companion is Secretary Qiao, right?

19
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,854
How could Bai Yun just cut in like that?

20
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:37,674
So what?

21
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,574
The Gu and Bai families are going to unite by marriage.

22
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:45,194
The future Mrs. Gu might be Bai Yun.

23
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:48,854
Bai Yun just returned to the country;

24
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:51,234
how do you know so many details?

25
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:54,994
Little Boy, you don't understand.

26
00:02:54,994 --> 00:03:00,174
A dinner party like this is like a big news relay station.

27
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:03,814
If Director Gu gets married,

28
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:06,834
can we get a couple of days off work?

29
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:11,774
If Director Gu really marries Bai Yun,

30
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,870
what about Secretary Qiao?

31
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,730
She isn't even worried.

32
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,750
Just mind your own business.

33
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,014
Secretary Qiao, why do you seem to be everywhere?

34
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:33,954
In public, I'm his secretary. In private, I'm his girlfriend.

35
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:37,594
Is it a problem to accompany him to such an event?

36
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:42,774
You keep saying you're his girlfriend. Has he admitted to that?

37
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:48,014
You're nothing more than a handy tool for him.

38
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:50,714
Do you think he really cares about you?

39
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:56,774
Miss Bai, if you don't want to embarrass yourself in public, just leave.

40
00:03:56,774 --> 00:04:00,114
You know I have a bad temper.

41
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:07,094
Fine, I hope you can say the same thing in front of Big Brother.

42
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:12,654
What happened? What is going on?

43
00:04:12,654 --> 00:04:14,474
The wine spilled on the dress.

44
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:20,890
What is wrong?

45
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,234
I wanted to make you a hangover tea,

46
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:27,774
but Secretary Qiao said you drink only tea that she makes.

47
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:30,094
I tried to get a glass, and she pushed me.

48
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:31,934
It spilled all over me.

49
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:34,334
This is my favorite pair of shoes.

50
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:38,254
Qiao Jing, when did you become so unreasonable?

51
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:42,844
I didn't.

52
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:49,014
Forget it. I don't think Secretary Qiao meant to do it.

53
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:53,614
As long as Secretary Qiao helps me wipe my shoes,

54
00:04:53,614 --> 00:04:57,154
I'll let it go. Okay?

55
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:03,654
Help her wipe the shoes.

56
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:17,834
Forget it.

57
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,794
You can't clean it just by wiping.

58
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:39,594
If you really like this pair of shoes,

59
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:43,014
why don't you take it to the cleaners now? Maybe you can still salvage the shoes.

60
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:46,694
Cousin, Grandma gave them to me, and she dirtied them.

61
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:49,454
Should I not ask her to help wipe them clean?

62
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:51,894
Accidents are inevitable at dinner parties;

63
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,080
why are you being so hostile?

64
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:56,700
Who are you?

65
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:06,314
Director Gu, I've heard many great things about you. My name is Bai Yan.

66
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:15,894
It's better not to interfere when I discipline my own people.

67
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,490
She's my friend.

68
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,790
I can't watch and do nothing.

69
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:24,334
Whether you clean it or buy a new pair,

70
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:26,414
I'll cover the expenses.

71
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:30,228
Let's go.

72
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:50,494
I'll get you some medicine for the burn.

73
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:54,094
It's nothing. The water wasn't that hot.

74
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:57,620
The burn might leave a scar.

75
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,330
Thank you.

76
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:07,690
I didn't expect to meet you here.

77
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,410
It's quite a coincidence.

78
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:15,020
My name is Bai Yan. I'm a part-time designer,

79
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,570
and you?

80
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:19,060
Qiao Jing.

81
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:24,394
I saw what really happened back there.

82
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:29,134
Bai Yun likes Gu Yi so she made you her imaginary enemy.

83
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:38,174
You helped me put this outfit together.

84
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:43,574
But I didn't expect to see Gu Yi wearing that brooch.

85
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:53,374
What exactly is your relationship with him?

86
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:58,690
Mr. Bai, thank you for helping me out today.

87
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,570
I should leave now.

88
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:20,240
Things were going well, but it ended up like this.

89
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,774
Everyone will laugh at me.

90
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:24,654
No one dares to laugh at you.

91
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,914
Just now, who is Bai Yan to you?

92
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:30,694
He is my distant cousin, who usually lives abroad.

93
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:33,794
He returned recently. My family isn't really close to him.

94
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:37,074
Big Brother, why did you bring Qiao Jing with you?

95
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:39,014
Everyone says you two have a special relationship

96
00:08:39,014 --> 00:08:41,374
so she dared to do this to me.

97
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:43,534
Are you two dating?

98
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,590
I'll buy you another pair of shoes.

99
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,170
We are at your house. Go home.

100
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:58,040
Okay. Be careful on your way back.

101
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,510
Okay.

102
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,124
Bye bye.

103
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:32,912
 Let's go.

104
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,550
 Director Gu!

105
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,020
 Secretary Qiao, do you want to be with me?

106
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:49,874
 Don't reject me.

107
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:59,574
Have you taken care of the burn?

108
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:08,874
Since you knew I was hurt, why did you force me to clean Bai Yun's shoes?

109
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,414
It doesn't matter to me who is right or wrong.

110
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:16,154
What matters is that you can't cause me any trouble at that occasion.

111
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:17,860
What do you mean?

112
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,710
I didn't do anything wrong!

113
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,950
Why did you force me to apologize?

114
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:28,114
Qiao Jing, you're not the immature type.

115
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:34,574
Have I not been sensible and mature enough?

116
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,430
I have been waitingâ€¦

117
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,634
waiting for you to tell me

118
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:49,034
you're going to marry Bai Yun.

119
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:54,494
Who told you that?

120
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:59,974
Don't listen to those rumors and become paranoid.

121
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:03,014
What is the rush for something that is still undecided?

122
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,574
So what is your relationship with Bai Yun?

123
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:15,954
She is just my little sister.

124
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:29,437

125
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:32,034
- Good morning. 
 - Morning. 
 - You're here.

126
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:35,010
Secretary Qiao has been with Director Gu so many years.

127
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,780
All she did was dirty some shoes.

128
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,854
He reacted so harshly and told her to wipe Bai Yun's shoes.

129
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:42,774
As expected, capitalists are ruthless.

130
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:44,894
What?

131
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:47,174
Based on my ten years of reading online literature,

132
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:50,274
Bai Yun definitely spilled it on purpose.

133
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:51,974
Don't say it if you don't know exact truth.

134
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:53,654
What do you mean?

135
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:56,514
What I saw with these eyes is the truth.

136
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:58,514
 - Secretary Qiao, good morning.  
 - Were you all right yesterday?

137
00:11:58,514 --> 00:11:59,554
- Secretary Qiao. 
 - Good morning.

138
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:02,414
Secretary Qiao, let me handle such things in the future.

139
00:12:02,414 --> 00:12:04,734
I'm sure I can fix that angelic b*tch.

140
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:05,914
What?

141
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:07,474
Bai Yun is nothing but aâ€”

142
00:12:07,474 --> 00:12:09,794
Director Gu, good morning.

143
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:12,640
What are you talking about? Starting from today,

144
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,350
Miss Bai will join Anxia as my special assistant.

145
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:19,214
Hi, everyone. I'm Bai Yun.

146
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,914
Why is she here?

147
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:28,254
Do I need to report everything to Secretary Qiao?

148
00:12:28,254 --> 00:12:30,274
This is the company.

149
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:33,054
I know what I'm doing.

150
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:36,554
Bai Yun is here in name only. She doesn't have to do anything else.

151
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:38,730
Just keep her happy.

152
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,330
You can leave now.

153
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:43,860
Yes, Sir.

154
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:55,474
Why didn't you warn me?

155
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,494
I did, and you talked back.

156
00:12:59,814 --> 00:13:02,114
Miss Bai, do you need help?

157
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,954
I'm new here and happy to be colleagues with you all.

158
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:06,814
I got a little something for everyone.

159
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:08,874
This one is for you.

160
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:11,994
Tang Ping, this is for you.

161
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:13,154
Thank you.

162
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:15,514
- This one is for you, Yang Yang. 
 - Thank you.

163
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:17,914
- This one is for you. 
 - Thank you, Miss Bai.

164
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:19,074
This is for you guys.

165
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:21,014
 - Thank you.   
 - You're welcome.

166
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:23,574
Miss Bai, this scarf is too expensive.

167
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:24,614
Do you really want to give it to me?

168
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:27,474
It suits you well. I'm glad you like it.

169
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:35,114
Secretary Qiao, this is for you.

170
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,274
I picked it out carefully.

171
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:43,114
A Sevres (in France) porcelain is Madame de Pompadour's favorite decoration.

172
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:45,614
It suits you well.

173
00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:47,254
Miss Bai is so thoughtful.

174
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:50,734
I'm not Madame Pompadour, and I never will be.

175
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:52,014
It's just a small gift.

176
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:54,714
Secretary Qiao, don't think too much about it.

177
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:05,294
Who is that Madame Pompa?

178
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:08,590
She was the mistress of King Louis XV of France,

179
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,910
a famous mistress of medieval Europe.

180
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:32,194
Xiao Yun has never had any hardship in her life.

181
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:34,334
I asked her to be your assistant.

182
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:37,720
You can't bully her, you hear me?

183
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,270
Mom, if you're worried she will suffer,

184
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,950
don't put her in the company.

185
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:46,174
I did so just to cultivate a relationship between you two.

186
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:51,594
Yun is back so it's time you two get married.

187
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:55,114
How can you take a childhood-arranged betrothal seriously?

188
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:56,974
What is wrong with child betrothals?

189
00:14:56,974 --> 00:15:00,394
Although the Bai family began to engage in art in the past two generations,

190
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:05,274
when the Bai family was rich, your grandfather was still building walls for the Bai family.

191
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:09,034
We are the ones marrying up in this arrangement.

192
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,914
Then we shouldn't do it if it's such a mismatch.

193
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:15,440
Keep your bad temper to yourself.

194
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,750
I don't care whom you date,

195
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,570
but your marriage is about the Gu and Bai families.

196
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:22,014
It's about Anxia.

197
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:24,014
You can't do whatever you want.

198
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:26,534
Here, try the coffee I made!

199
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:29,474
Xiao Yun, you don't have to do these menial tasks.

200
00:15:29,474 --> 00:15:32,274
There are no menial tasks when it comes to Big Brother.

201
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:34,754
When you're here, don't call me "Big Brother."

202
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:37,054
All right, Director Gu.

203
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:38,674
In the company, he is Director Gu.

204
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:41,254
In private, he is still your Brother Gu Yi.

205
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:43,474
Auntie, you love me the most.

206
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:54,514
Three, two, one!

207
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:55,714
And we are done!

208
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:56,814
Let's go. Let's go eat!

209
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:58,054
What are we eating today?

210
00:15:58,054 --> 00:15:59,894
There is a new spicy hot pot downstairs.

211
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:01,774
Secretary Qiao, join us.

212
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:05,714
I'm not going. I have a contract to check. You all go ahead.

213
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,514
You can check that anytime!

214
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:10,154
- Do it later. 
 - I'm not going; I really can't.

215
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:12,454
- Special Helper Bai, are you going? 
 - Let's go.

216
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:15,614
The spicy hot pot is too greasy. I'm not used to it.

217
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:17,234
You guys go. Thank you.

218
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:18,894
Just the four of us then.

219
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,400
Secretary Qiao, I rarely treat you. Will you do me a favor and join us?

220
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,450
Exactly.

221
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:27,514
All right, I'll go with you.

222
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,044
Let's go.

223
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,834
 Are you not the perfect secretary?

224
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:43,694
 Let's see how you can keep being perfect.

225
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:16,054
I can't pay for dinner everyday.

226
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:17,954
Feel bad for my wallet.

227
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:22,254
- But you said, "Your treat." 
 - It was tasty.

228
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:29,614
Eating and drinking well makes me drowsy.

229
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:34,614
I must take a good rest to work.

230
00:17:34,614 --> 00:17:37,014
I'm going to take a nap.

231
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,154
Lunch break has passed yet you're laying down?

232
00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:42,054
I finished all my work for the day.

233
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:46,954
Secretary Tang is really great.

234
00:17:46,954 --> 00:17:50,314
Would you like to help your good friend, Secretary Xiang,

235
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:53,694
to finish the rest of the presentation as well?

236
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:06,854
Secretary Qiao, what are you looking for?

237
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,794
The contract is gone.

238
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:12,214
You just left it here.

239
00:18:12,214 --> 00:18:14,594
Did you not put it here?

240
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,134
Did you look in all the drawers?

241
00:18:16,134 --> 00:18:18,074
I have checked.

242
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,814
Looks like it fell off the clothes.

243
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:46,854
During lunch, did you move the contract in my drawer?

244
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:49,914
I just had lunch. I don't know what you're talking about, sorry.

245
00:18:49,914 --> 00:18:51,234
That contract is very important.

246
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:54,200
Since it's important, you should keep it safe,

247
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,230
instead of losing it and questioning unrelated people!

248
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:00,694
It's an emergency. I need to check your station.

249
00:19:00,694 --> 00:19:03,294
How dare you? Have you any evidence?

250
00:19:03,294 --> 00:19:05,174
What qualifications do you have to search my station?

251
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:06,974
Why are you fighting during work hours?

252
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:12,834
Director Gu, Secretary Qiao lost something

253
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:16,994
and insisted that I took it. She wanted to search my station.

254
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,114
During the lunch break, I put the contract in the drawer.

255
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:23,134
When I returned, it was gone.

256
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,610
If you hadn't touched my drawer,

257
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,290
how did your sequin end up next to my drawer?

258
00:19:32,014 --> 00:19:35,194
It's just a sequin; it could have fallen anywhere.

259
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:37,694
Who knows where you picked it up from?

260
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:39,820
Are you sure she took it?

261
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,530
Then search.

262
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:45,094
Big Brother!

263
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:48,654
Be good.

264
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,674
It can also prove your innocence.

265
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,574
Did you find it?

266
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:04,074
I told you I didn't take it.

267
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:06,294
You didn't believe me, either.

268
00:20:07,094 --> 00:20:09,054
When did you get so careless?

269
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:12,334
I need the contract by the end of the day.

270
00:20:23,214 --> 00:20:25,080
What should we do now?

271
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,330
Check the surveillance.

272
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:26,974
Let me see if you find the lost files.

273
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,400
From the surveillance at 12:14 p.m.,

274
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,770
Bai Yun took a folder into the restroom

275
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,074
and came out with nothing in her hands.

276
00:21:57,074 --> 00:21:59,434
Later, the cleaning lady went in to clean.

277
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:02,774
Why can't we just show Director Gu the surveillance video?

278
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:06,614
It's obvious that Bai Yun did it! Why must we suffer here?

279
00:22:06,614 --> 00:22:09,514
Director Gu cares only about the result, not the process.

280
00:22:09,514 --> 00:22:11,514
He wants this contract by the end of the day.

281
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:13,394
It doesn't matter how the contract was lost.

282
00:22:13,394 --> 00:22:16,294
All the company trash is here. Let's find it quickly.

283
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:21,754
I was wrong about the contract.

284
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:24,974
After our meeting at the branch office, I'll treat you to a meal to make amends.

285
00:22:24,974 --> 00:22:26,474
I'm not angry.

286
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:28,774
I just feel wronged that you didn't believe me.

287
00:22:28,774 --> 00:22:32,034
I promise it won't happen again.

288
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:38,014
Director Gu, we found the contract.

289
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:40,414
What is that smell on you guys?

290
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:43,114
Seriously, can you still use this contract?

291
00:22:44,454 --> 00:22:45,774
You're late.

292
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:49,054
I asked the other company to prepare the contract again and send it over.

293
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:51,454
Just throw this away.

294
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,234
You guys are not new here.

295
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:56,014
Do I need to stress how important contracts are?

296
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:58,994
This is a dereliction of duty (neglect).

297
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,834
Director Gu, it was my fault alone.

298
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:05,494
If you want to punish people, then I'll take the penalty.

299
00:23:05,494 --> 00:23:09,574
Instead of being brave now, you shouldn't make a mistake in the first place.

300
00:23:09,574 --> 00:23:12,194
Director Gu, the branch manager is waiting for us to have a meeting.

301
00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:13,894
Let's hurry up.

302
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:20,474
Secretary Qiao, are you okay?

303
00:23:21,894 --> 00:23:24,754
I'm fine. It's been a tough day for everyone.

304
00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:26,494
Go home and change your clothes.

305
00:23:26,494 --> 00:23:28,734
Next week's afternoon tea is on me.

306
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:53,694
Big Brother, have you ever thought about getting a new secretary?

307
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,070
Why?

308
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,220
Secretary Qiao is not good at her job,

309
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,730
and she made such a big mistake this time.

310
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,554
You should take this opportunity to replace her.

311
00:24:06,974 --> 00:24:08,554
And the others in the office...

312
00:24:08,554 --> 00:24:10,754
Tang Ping always slacks off.

313
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:12,494
Xiang Se Se loves only gossiping.

314
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:16,394
And that Yang Yang hangs around Qiao Jing all day!

315
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:18,994
I don't know how these guys got into Anxia.

316
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:22,234
I picked every single one of them personally.

317
00:24:22,234 --> 00:24:25,994
Tang Ping works extremely efficiently at making tables or presentations.

318
00:24:25,994 --> 00:24:28,434
 He has triple the speed and quality of a normal person.

319
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:31,134
 What others can do in a day, he does in an hour.

320
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:34,254
 Xiang Se Se is good at PR and managing information.

321
00:24:34,254 --> 00:24:38,074
 She handled several of our public relations crises successfully.

322
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:40,894
 And Yang Yang graduated from an Ivy League school.

323
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:45,214
 He's smart, meticulous and good at summarizing and coordination.

324
00:24:45,214 --> 00:24:48,954
 He's a rare all-around talent nurtured by Qiao Jing.

325
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:53,214
Anxia doesn't keep useless people. They can't get in without skills.

326
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:57,054
I see.

327
00:24:57,054 --> 00:24:59,294
I'm new and short-sighted.

328
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:01,454
I can't see things as clearly as you.

329
00:25:01,454 --> 00:25:03,634
All right, I won't say that again.

330
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:06,314
Come on, try this.

331
00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:11,034
It smells good.

332
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:23,252
Milk for you.

333
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:35,854
Why did you not eat anything?

334
00:25:35,854 --> 00:25:39,834
Big Brother seems to be cold to her, but he protects her.

335
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:43,254
And Qiao Jing keeps saying she is his girlfriend.

336
00:25:43,254 --> 00:25:47,294
But every time I ask Big Brother, he never gives a straight answer.

337
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:51,374
He didn't deny it. That means he is admitting it.

338
00:25:51,374 --> 00:25:52,774
Are you joking?

339
00:25:52,774 --> 00:25:55,814
We are about to get engaged; how can he have a girlfriend?

340
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:59,734
Whether it's true or not, I'll break them up.

341
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:02,474
Calm down.

342
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:04,994
You and Gu Yi are not engaged yet.

343
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:08,494
And you're a girl; don't do everything yourself.

344
00:26:08,494 --> 00:26:09,774
It doesn't look good.

345
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:11,814
So what do you suggest?

346
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:18,814
Since this is the Gu family's matter, it should be handled by the Gu Family.

347
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,194
Okay, I'll find Aunty Fang (Mrs. Gu) right now.

348
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:24,714
You sit down!

349
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:26,594
Drink the milk!

350
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:30,294
I just told you not to get involved in everything yourself.

351
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:34,574
You know what? I'll go find Mrs. Gu for you.

352
00:26:34,574 --> 00:26:36,854
But you have to practice the piano well.

353
00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:40,474
You can't slack off for the concert in two months.

354
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:43,894
All right, I'll listen to my manager.

355
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:54,974
Lao Qiao!

356
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:58,534
I've been so busy lately,

357
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,534
I almost forgot what my baby looks like. I hope you don't blame me.

358
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:07,654
How could I? I'm just happy our busy, famous live streamer can find time to see me.

359
00:27:07,654 --> 00:27:09,334
- Do you want some? 
 - No!

360
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:12,514
It's so hot. Why do you still drink tea?

361
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:14,814
My period is coming soon so I can't drink cold drinks.

362
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:17,534
Right, every time you get your period, it hurts like crazy.

363
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:19,654
You should be careful.

364
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:26,654
I heard your Director Gu will get engaged to Miss Bai. Is it true?

365
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:30,934
That is what everyone says. I don't know, either.

366
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:33,954
What will you do if it's true?

367
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,654
Baby, look at you.

368
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:40,074
You've been with Gu Yi for three years, but he's getting engaged to another.

369
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:42,974
How can he make up for the three years you invested?

370
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:44,234
You know

371
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:46,454
that's not why I'm with him.

372
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:48,894
I know. Of course, I know!

373
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:50,634
That's why I regret it.

374
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:53,414
I shouldn't have let you guys do this stupid thing.

375
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:58,734
But if I could do it all over again, I'd still jump into this firepit.

376
00:27:58,734 --> 00:28:01,594
It's been long enough. It's time to move on.

377
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:05,214
Now may be the best time.

378
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:16,914
Mr. Gu, you're successful in both love and business.

379
00:28:16,914 --> 00:28:20,594
I heard from Auntie Fang that you and Xiao Yun are getting engaged.

380
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:24,034
That is what the families want to do, but they haven't set a date yet.

381
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:26,634
You are dating Qiao Jing, right?

382
00:28:26,634 --> 00:28:28,694
Why are you still getting married?

383
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:32,154
Will you break up with Qiao Jing?

384
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:37,074
I don't want to let her go just yet.

385
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:41,594
What do you mean? Won't you get engaged?

386
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:44,014
This marriage is not up to me.

387
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,334
The Gu and Bai families need more close ties together.

388
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:49,914
Bai Yun and I are just tools for that.

389
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:54,514
I don't care. Xiao Yun is like my sister.

390
00:28:54,514 --> 00:28:56,834
Don't make her sad.

391
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:03,534
I know I can't talk you out of it,

392
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:07,194
but remember not to get too involved. It's not worth it.

393
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:09,454
All right, you should go now.

394
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:12,534
You are going to be late for the next livestream.

395
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:15,994
It's so late already! I have to go now. See you.

396
00:29:27,354 --> 00:29:28,950
Mrs. Gu.

397
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,970
 I want to see you.

398
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:43,976
This way.

399
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:53,574
Miss Qiao, Mrs. Gu is waiting for you in here.

400
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,154
Mrs. Gu, you wanted to see me?

401
00:29:59,154 --> 00:30:00,960
Please have a seat.

402
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:22,134
I have been wanting to thank you.

403
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:24,654
After Gu Yi's car accident,

404
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:26,534
he suffered an emotional disorder.

405
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:29,334
Thank you for being there for him

406
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:31,794
so he can recover quickly.

407
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:36,894
I'll drink a toast to you.

408
00:30:44,294 --> 00:30:50,574
Secretary Qiao, this glass is to express my gratitude.

409
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:04,794
Secretary Qiao, you're a straightforward girl

410
00:31:04,794 --> 00:31:06,974
so I won't waste words.

411
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:09,394
Gu Yi is about to get engaged.

412
00:31:09,394 --> 00:31:14,654
I hope you can end the relationship between you two promptly.

413
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:18,014
That is between Gu Yi and me.

414
00:31:18,014 --> 00:31:20,594
You don't have to worry about it, Mrs. Gu.

415
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:24,870
Gu Yi is different from you.

416
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,040
He will inherit Anxia,

417
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,230
and he needs a wife like Bai Yun.

418
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:33,334
If you think you will suffer losses,

419
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:37,434
just name your price. I will make it up to you.

420
00:31:37,434 --> 00:31:40,114
I'm not with Gu Yi for the money.

421
00:31:40,114 --> 00:31:44,294
So you don't want to let him go?

422
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:53,034
What is the point of your insistence?

423
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:55,794
Gu Yi will break up with you sooner or later.

424
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:58,614
If you bring it up now,

425
00:31:58,614 --> 00:32:01,394
you can still save some face (dignity).

426
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:06,294
If Gu Yi wants to break up with me, let him talk to me in person.

427
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:09,354
I have something to do. Mrs. Gu, please enjoy.

428
00:32:09,354 --> 00:32:11,234
Qiao Jing.

429
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,280
If you agree to leave him,

430
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,190
I can grant you a request.

431
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:34,354
That Secretary Qiao is quite a character.

432
00:32:36,094 --> 00:32:37,854
You can tell Xiao Yun not to worry.

433
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:40,894
I will handle this matter well.

434
00:32:40,894 --> 00:32:42,434
I'm sorry, Mrs. Gu.

435
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:44,874
It's not for me to step in,

436
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:49,954
but these days, Xiao Yun has been very upset about this.

437
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:52,494
I had no other choice.

438
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:56,114
It's okay. I should take care of this.

439
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,600

440
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:43,920

441
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,390
  Hi, the number you have dialed cannot be reached right now.

442
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,960
 Please dial again later.

443
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:53,630
