1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:12,020

2
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,481

3
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:48,339

4
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:56,219
How is it? The trick to get her sympathy worked well, right?

5
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,219
My friend, I can only help you this far.

6
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:02,419
She still cares about me after all.

7
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:05,919
That means you still have a place in her heart.

8
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:08,339
Come, take a look at this.

9
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,839
This was captured on the road where I had the car accident by a birdwatcher's camera.

10
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:26,179
Su Juan's car had already spun out of control before crashing into me.

11
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:30,179
Qiao Jing suspects that someone tampered with his car.

12
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:32,879
- Does she have any suspects? 
 - Yes, a guy named Li Chang Lin,

13
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,559
but she's been investigating for a long time and hasn't found any information.

14
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:42,879
Okay, leave it to me.

15
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,465
Thanks.

16
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,239
Take care of yourself; that's the best way to thank me.

17
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,669
I'm leaving.

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,243

19
00:02:02,643 --> 00:02:05,903

20
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,903

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,669
Mom.

22
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,683
Come along with me to Bai Yun's house tonight.

23
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:22,223
I can go,

24
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:25,423
but I have to call off my marriage to Bai Yun.

25
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,521
Are you sure?

26
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:34,029
I'm sure.

27
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,583
My mother terminated my employment, cancelled my credit cards and kicked me out of the house.

28
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,463
Now, I'm penniless and homeless.

29
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,603
You must look after me.

30
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,363
Eight hundred meters (1/2 mile) to the left of here is a five-star hotel;

31
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:25,105
you can stay there.

32
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:27,123
My credit card was suspended. I've no money.

33
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,223
I'll pay for you.

34
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:31,203
I'm not used to living in a hotel.

35
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,663
Then go live at Zhou Rui's house.

36
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:37,703
I can't get along with Zhou Rui as his personal life is so chaotic.

37
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:41,623
You two are as close as if you wear the same pair of pants, yet you say this?

38
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,123
Anyway, I don't care.

39
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,383
Since you promised to be with me, I have to live in your house.

40
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:47,963
Before, you lived at my house, and now, I'll live at yours.

41
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,703
Is that not fair?

42
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,143
How long do you plan to stay?

43
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:56,283
I'll leave when my mother has calmed down.

44
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,129
What is the matter? We lived together before.

45
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,463
I just don't want to serve you anymore.

46
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:15,183
Do I need you to serve me?

47
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,923
I've been serving you for the past three years.

48
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:24,443
Don't worry. This time it's my turn... to serve you.

49
00:04:25,503 --> 00:04:27,303
You?

50
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,263
Am I going to stay here?

51
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:44,183
If you're not happy, find a place to stay on your own.

52
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,941
I'm very happy.

53
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,203
It's great. Tatami mats (Japanese mats) are my favorite place to sleep.

54
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:58,803
 At least get me a quilt!

55
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,483
Step one, done.

56
00:05:31,883 --> 00:05:35,003
 I have to go out for a while. The key is on the table.

57
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:34,463
It's perfect.

58
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:57,201
Let's do this.

59
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,210
 Just remember this rhyme.

60
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,860
 The pork belly from the market; fry both sides to a golden crisp.

61
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,083
"Both sides. Pork belly."

62
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:10,485
Forget it.

63
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,890
 Scallions, ginger, garlic and dried chili.

64
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,660
 Add some eggs and braise together.

65
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:28,963
D-Dried chili.

66
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,640
 Light and dark soy sauce together.

67
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,260
 Throw in salt and rock sugar.

68
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,143
"Light and dark soy sauce."

69
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,700
 Add in oyster sauce, bean paste, then a spice packet.

70
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,740
 Add water when it's thickened.

71
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,410
 It's best to add the water in one go.

72
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,170
 Cook on low for one hour.

73
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,480
 Cut in small pieces for presentation.

74
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:08,403
Perfect.

75
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,843
Why is she not back yet?

76
00:08:19,203 --> 00:08:20,763
This is A5 Wagyu beef,

77
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:22,703
aged with butter for forty days.

78
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,423
It tastes great.

79
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:25,723
Thank you.

80
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:27,223
Give it a try.

81
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:37,663
Have you thought about the matter I mentioned last time?

82
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,177
I'm sorry.

83
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,623
I still have too many things I can't let go of.

84
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:51,823
I can't be that carefree.

85
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,743
Actually, I already knew that you wouldn't leave with me.

86
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:02,043
But I can't help but persist and ask you again.

87
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:06,243
When are you leaving?

88
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:07,553
Tomorrow.

89
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:09,403
So soon?

90
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,903
I wish you a prosperous future.

91
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,429
Thank you.

92
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:20,783
And I wish you happiness and joy.

93
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,163
Why isn't she back yet?

94
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,003
Qiao Jing, come here.

95
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:41,143
Where did you go today? Why didn't you answer my calls all day long?

96
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,683
My phone is on silent mode in my bag.

97
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:46,321
What is the matter?

98
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:51,043
I made braised pork rice for you. It's cold now.

99
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,883
Whose clothes are these?

100
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:06,463
Yours. I washed them for you.

101
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:12,003
- I guess I should be thanking you... 
 - You're welcome.

102
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:24,383
Is this how you serve me?

103
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,783
Is there a problem? Is this not enough?

104
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:28,483
I don't expect you to help me.

105
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:31,363
But can you please stop making trouble for me?

106
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:35,223
I worked hard all day, and all I'm doing is causing trouble?

107
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:42,483
Whose jacket is it? It's clearly a man's jacket.

108
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:44,663
Who gave it to you?

109
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:49,463
I know, it's that pretty boy again. Bai Yan, right?

110
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,170
Why did you see him again? Tell me!

111
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,883
We are friends. Why can't we meet?

112
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:56,223
"Friends"? I know exactly what he's thinking.

113
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,963
Men understand men best.

114
00:10:57,963 --> 00:10:59,923
I already said we are friends.

115
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:03,643
Why are you being suspicious and making a fuss?

116
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:06,323
Am I suspicious? Am I fussing over nothing?

117
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:07,743
You have no right to tell me what to do.

118
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:11,083
I do! Don't forget, you're still mine.

119
00:11:19,203 --> 00:11:21,663
Qiao Jing, are you crazy?

120
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,583
Get out!

121
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:33,083
Qiao Jing, you… Open the door.

122
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:45,363
 - It's all because of the project. 
 - Enough!

123
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:52,103
 Was she very sad at the time?

124
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:54,443
 If I had listened to her explanation properly,

125
00:11:54,443 --> 00:11:57,283
 I wouldn't be suffering now.

126
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,983
Hello?

127
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:25,245
 Hello, Babe. I need help!

128
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,363
What is wrong?

129
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:30,343
 You know that charity event I organized? It's to help farmers sell flowers.

130
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:33,903
 The flowers have arrived, but I can't make it there.

131
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:36,703
 Can you help me pick them up?

132
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:39,190
Okay, I'll be right there.

133
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:23,823
Well, Mr. Gu is awake! What is going on here?

134
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:27,303
Sleeping on the streets? This is a rare sight.

135
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:29,183
Stop taking photos. Untie me!

136
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,343
Don't rush. Come on, let's take a selfie.

137
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,013
Untie me!

138
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,143
All right, all right.

139
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:37,663
Come on, Mr. Gu!

140
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,163
Mr. Gu, you're so heavy.

141
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:42,843
Qiao Jing is really something.

142
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:46,043
She really has you fully under her control.

143
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:49,163
I indulged her, or how could she be my match?

144
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:52,703
Come on. If she hadn't sent me a message this morning,

145
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:54,403
you would be out on the street all day.

146
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:57,083
Look, she even left the door open for you.

147
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:09,023
This place is not bad!

148
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:11,903
Your mother used money and the company to pressure you to comply,

149
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:15,203
but I didn't expect you to live so comfortably.

150
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:18,660
My mom said those things out of anger.

151
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,561
Actually, the hardest person to deal with is... Qiao Jing.

152
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:29,103
I already degraded myself by doing her laundry, cooking and dishwashing.

153
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:32,203
- She— 
 - You know how to do those things?

154
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:35,143
I think you shouldn't be called Gu Yi.

155
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:38,103
Change your name to Gu Jia ("cares for the home").

156
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:50,743
Am I not doing enough? I've given so much effort, and she doesn't appreciate it.

157
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:55,197
She even... She even got involved with another man.

158
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:57,183
It's driving me crazy.

159
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,903
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

160
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:02,763
Isn't this how you used to treat Qiao Jing?

161
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:09,063
Besides, you two will break up after a year.

162
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:11,663
Don't take it so seriously.

163
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:14,023
No way.

164
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:18,203
Within a year, I must make her completely fall in love with me.

165
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:22,883
Are you serious?

166
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,743
I was horribly wrong before,

167
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,203
ignoring her feelings and forcing her to stay by my side.

168
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:33,943
But this time, I want to use practical actions

169
00:15:33,943 --> 00:15:36,723
to make her want to be with me.

170
00:15:41,003 --> 00:15:46,483
Do you have any tips for pursuing girls?

171
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:49,823
I don't have any tips! Just cater to her preferences.

172
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,263
"C-Cater to her preferences"?

173
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:57,803
Cater to her preferences...

174
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,503
I found it. Brother Gu Yi, this is my sister's collection.

175
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:07,703
I won't tell just anyone, you know.

176
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:16,983
Children shouldn't see this kind of stuff.

177
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,383
How did you get involved with Gu Yi again?

178
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:35,823
This on-and-off relationship is so melodramatic.

179
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:37,503
I need his help with something.

180
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:39,203
What is the matter between you two?

181
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:41,403
Is he forcing you again?

182
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:45,703
He is helping me investigate the cause of Su Juan's death.

183
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:48,083
He is helping the woman he likes investigate her Prince Charming?

184
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,503
Keep your eyes on the road!

185
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:53,583
Mr. Gu's generosity has bloomed suddenly.

186
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:02,423
Yang Yang, what is wrong?

187
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:04,503
 Miss Qiao, where are you?

188
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,903
I'm on my way home.

189
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:09,203
 That's great! We wanted to see you

190
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:11,423
 and ask you a few work-related questions.

191
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,690
 Oh, yes! We are almost at your doorstep.

192
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,253
Welcome home.

193
00:18:24,765 --> 00:18:28,143
Welcome home. Welcome home.

194
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:33,103
Welcome home. Welcome home.

195
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:40,163
Welcome home.

196
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:42,883
Mr. Bunny welcomes you home.

197
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:47,663
I've gotten used to the domineering CEO persona.

198
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:51,203
It's quite unsettling for me when things suddenly change like this.

199
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:54,243
Why has she not returned yet?

200
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:59,523
 Yang Yang and the others are coming. Hide.

201
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:04,983
Why should I? It's not like I'm unpresentable.

202
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:07,823
 Come in.

203
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:15,983
 Wow! It's so beautiful!

204
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,223
There is even a small pavilion here.

205
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:26,023
This place is like my dream courtyard!

206
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:28,583
The rent must not be cheap, right?

207
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,723
Not really, a friend rented it to me.

208
00:19:31,723 --> 00:19:33,663
He gave me a reasonable price.

209
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:38,283
Does your friend have any other properties available? I want to move, too.

210
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:40,563
Yes, me, too. I want one.

211
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:43,783
All right, all right. Stop messing around; we still have work to do.

212
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,449
Come in.

213
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:59,243
So cute.

214
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:03,303
Miss Qiao, is there an event that you decorated like this for?

215
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,623
The house is empty, but the candles are still burning.

216
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:08,303
It's very dangerous, as they could easily cause a fire.

217
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:11,503
I didn't have time to clean after some friends came over last night.

218
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,543
You're right, I'll be more careful next time.

219
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:16,903
Have a seat. I'll clean up first.

220
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:19,423
Isn't this a surprise that Mr. Gu prepared for you?

221
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:21,123
Hurry and clean.

222
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:24,083
Have a seat. Jiang Ling, get them some water.

223
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,621
Okay.

224
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:28,183
There is even a green room here.

225
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,243
 Xiang Se Se, where are the documents?

226
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:46,943
They are in my bag.

227
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:48,821
 I can't find them!

228
00:20:57,621 --> 00:20:59,973
Here, this is it.

229
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:12,663
Isn't this Mr. Gu's watch?

230
00:21:15,823 --> 00:21:17,323
No, no, no!

231
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:21,583
My friend accidentally left this here when he came over yesterday.

232
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,441
It's not Mr. Gu's.

233
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:25,283
But I remember this watch is limited edition

234
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:28,783
and each one is unique.

235
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:32,043
Did you say there was a problem with that report?

236
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:34,023
Let's check it.

237
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:39,123
The data here doesn't match the data over there.

238
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:57,203
It's roughly like this. I've marked the problematic areas for you.

239
00:21:58,783 --> 00:21:59,983
You guys continue, I'll leave first.

240
00:21:59,983 --> 00:22:02,363
It's a bit cold outside. I'll go to your room and get a coat.

241
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,363
Go ahead. Turn left to the innermost room.

242
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:06,003
Okay.

243
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:14,863

244
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:20,343

245
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,153

246
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:28,943
♪ Where's the coat? Where's the coat? ♪

247
00:22:28,943 --> 00:22:32,243
♪ The coat is in Qiao Jing's room ♪

248
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:36,923
♪ There are bathrobes here, and there are pajamas ♪

249
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:40,803
Where is the coat?

250
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:53,223
Why is this door stuck so tightly?

251
00:23:09,343 --> 00:23:12,543
This door has been broken for a long time; don't bother with it.

252
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:14,293
 Wear this.

253
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:26,603
I will leave first, Babe.

254
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:29,803
We are about done here, too. We will leave and stop bothering you.

255
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:32,343
- Miss Qiao... 
 - Grateful heart.

256
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:34,623
Thank you for helping us.

257
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,083
I am not going to keep you then.

258
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,977
It's fine.

259
00:23:46,243 --> 00:23:49,663
This place is not safe. I should go.

260
00:24:20,563 --> 00:24:22,163
What are you looking at?

261
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:23,885
Get out of the way.

262
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:34,143
Did my eyes play tricks on me?

263
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:37,163
Was that Director Gu?

264
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:39,383
Can I watch this for free?

265
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:41,681
I didn't see anything. I'll leave first.

266
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:42,923
Wait for me, wait for me!

267
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:45,103
I didn't see anything.

268
00:24:46,283 --> 00:24:48,283
Go and coax your Mr. Rabbit; I'm leaving.

269
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:49,433
I'm leaving.

270
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:11,703
How come you're suddenly shy?

271
00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:14,143
Who is shy?

272
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:19,683
Yesterday you were a family cook, and today you are Mr. Rabbit.

273
00:25:19,683 --> 00:25:22,203
What on Earth do you want to do?

274
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:24,823
How could you bring them back without saying a word?

275
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,743
Did I not tell you?

276
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:29,243
Who knew you were going to pull off such a stunt?

277
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:32,803
I saw the little cards you collected at your house.

278
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:35,743
Zhi said this is your favorite.

279
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:39,963
That was when I was younger.

280
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:44,290
I know you are doing these things to make me happy, but it's not necessary.

281
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,720
We are just taking what we need from each other. You don't need to do this.

282
00:26:08,463 --> 00:26:10,243
 I'll be at Jiang Ling's house tonight for a project

283
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:12,543
 so I won't be home for dinner.

284
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:15,643
She isn't home all day long,

285
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:17,823
and she managed to waste another two of the 365 days.

286
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:21,143
She wasted 1/182 of the time.

287
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:29,323
Young Yan, we have a deal where you can get two items for ¥19.90 ($3).

288
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:34,193
I'll take it.

289
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:55,521
- Sir. 
 - I don't need a credit card.

290
00:26:55,521 --> 00:26:56,703
No, Sir!

291
00:26:56,703 --> 00:26:58,623
We are promoting a couple's app.

292
00:26:58,623 --> 00:27:02,043
This app allows you to be together in real time, no matter how far apart you are.

293
00:27:02,043 --> 00:27:05,583
In this app, you can listen to music, watch movies, chat and video call together.

294
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,023
You can also see each other's locations.

295
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:11,323
You can set up your exclusive home to achieve your relationship goals.

296
00:27:11,323 --> 00:27:14,463
Sign up today, and you'll get these dolls.

297
00:27:35,677 --> 00:27:37,265
Sit.

298
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:42,103
Sit down.

299
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:47,283
Put this on. I just bought it.

300
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:08,243
I'll put it on myself.

301
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,343
Why are you following me?

302
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,449
Give me your phone.

303
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:30,465
Give it to me!

304
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:33,563
- What are you doing? 
 - I'm downloading something for you.

305
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:35,823
Don't download any weird apps for me.

306
00:28:35,823 --> 00:28:41,603
It's not a weird app. It's a relationship app for long-distance couples.

307
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:46,623
Is it considered long-distance when our rooms are only two steps apart?

308
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:47,943
You go out early and return late daily.

309
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:50,143
Our time together is like a long-distance relationship.

310
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:51,363
You have to download it.

311
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:55,643
We must work together in love achievements and become the happiest couple on the list.

312
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,649
You're really boring.

313
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,165
What are you doing?

314
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,220

315
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,390

316
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,283
Look, this is our home.

317
00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:24,643
We can even hang our photo in it.

318
00:29:24,643 --> 00:29:26,517
Delete it.

319
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:29,443
No way, it's so sweet.

320
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,603
I don't want to be hung on the wall at such a young age (usually hang up deceased relatives).

321
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,053
How childish.

322
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,743
I'm not childish at all.

323
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,490

324
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,600

325
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,640

326
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,110

327
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:42,610

328
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,110

329
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:52,883
 I bought a lifetime membership.

330
00:30:52,883 --> 00:30:55,223
 You can decorate our home however you want.

331
00:30:55,223 --> 00:30:57,843
 Just buy anything you like in the shop.

332
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,880

333
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,603
Why are you video calling when we are so close?

334
00:31:21,603 --> 00:31:23,843
I miss you!

335
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,063
 Listening to songs together can unlock the "Heartbeat Melody" achievement.

336
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:29,352
♫  Looking up at the flowers you gave me  ♫

337
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:35,834
♫  Quietly placed in the corner  ♫

338
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:42,921
♫  Softly humming the songs you sang  ♫

339
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:50,018
♫  Melody still continues  ♫

340
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:57,072
♫  The hand of time points to the end  ♫

341
00:32:57,072 --> 00:33:03,693
♫  But you no longer hold my hand  ♫

342
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:07,553
♫  Then let it be  ♫

343
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:13,905
♫  Forget about turning back  ♫

344
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,349
♫  Tell me why  ♫

345
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:27,129
♫  Tell me personally that you really want to leave  ♫

346
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,203
It's been a long time since I've had breakfast made by you.

347
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,063
This is not for you.

348
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,263
Wh-What do you mean?

349
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:03,323
Yours is in the fridge.

350
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:05,903
I'm off to take care of some things.

351
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,963
Who else could that be for besides me?

352
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,403
Pretty Boy?

353
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,943
Is she meeting Pretty Boy at a place like this?

354
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:14,753

355
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:39,397

356
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,510

357
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:08,670

358
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,550
"The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

359
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,777
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

360
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:24,813
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

361
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,553
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

362
00:36:30,553 --> 00:36:37,905
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

363
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:44,749
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

364
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:50,357
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

365
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:56,736
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

366
00:36:56,736 --> 00:37:02,525
♫  I remind myself constantly not to run away  ♫

367
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:06,357
♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

368
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,946
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

369
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:16,008
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

370
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:22,253
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

371
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:28,185
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

372
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:31,957
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

373
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:35,513
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

374
00:37:35,513 --> 00:37:39,129
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

375
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:46,289
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

376
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:49,489
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

377
00:37:49,489 --> 00:37:54,389
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

378
00:37:54,389 --> 00:38:00,721
♫  This unbearable plot  ♫

379
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:07,197
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫

380
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:13,124
♫  Being a guest may be my other destiny  ♫

381
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:20,389
♫  As the one who left, what gives me the right to care?  ♫

382
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:26,419
♫  After all, you're the one who finally got married, and I'm just a guest  ♫

383
00:38:26,419 --> 00:38:32,721
♫  I drained all the memories to celebrate your wedding  ♫

384
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:38,545
♫  But I never had the courage to bless you  ♫

385
00:38:38,545 --> 00:38:49,089
♫  Thank you for making me finally aware and returning me back to myself  ♫

386
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:59,553
♫  At least I can still be a guest to witness your love  ♫

387
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:03,485
♫  He's so lucky to have met you  ♫

388
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:14,765
♫  I hope he loves you more than I do  ♫
