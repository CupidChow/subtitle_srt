1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,990

2
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:45,502

3
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:48,912

4
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:50,294
Let's go.

5
00:00:54,394 --> 00:00:57,774
Let her go! Who are you?

6
00:00:57,774 --> 00:00:59,994
Who are you? How dare you trouble my daughter?

7
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:01,714
I have something to talk to Qiao Jing about.

8
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,554
Why are you here again? What do you want?

9
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:04,794
Where did this brat come from?

10
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:06,794
- It is none of your business. 
 - I–

11
00:01:06,794 --> 00:01:10,894
Mom, don't bother entangling with him. Let's go.

12
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:28,798

13
00:01:33,154 --> 00:01:34,474
Who was that guy just now?

14
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:36,534
He was pulling and tugging on you.

15
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:39,794
A colleague from work, we had some unpleasantness before.

16
00:01:40,994 --> 00:01:43,614
Auntie, don't bother with such people.

17
00:01:43,614 --> 00:01:46,434
He looks okay, but his words are just too much.

18
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:49,514
- Mom, I'll wash the vegetables in the kitchen. 
 - Let me help you.

19
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:52,174
No need, no need. Xiao Bai, come sit down and rest.

20
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:54,814
Come, sit, sit.

21
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,074
- Sit down. 
 - Okay.

22
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:04,394
Jing Jing, tell me the truth,

23
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:07,574
is that guy there your boyfriend?

24
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:10,174
Mom, he's just a good friend of mine.

25
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:13,514
He came to see me after he heard I quit my job.

26
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:15,614
Don't think too much.

27
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:19,234
You just came home today.

28
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:21,034
Your friend came to visit first.

29
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:22,314
Then shortly, your colleague arrived, too.

30
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:25,794
They all rushed to our doorstep to find you.

31
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,434
When did another one come?

32
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:32,914
Uncle, Auntie, is there anything I can help with?

33
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:38,634
This is all kitchen work like cutting vegetables and pouring ingredients. It's not easy.

34
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:42,014
- You're our guest. How can we let you do it? 
 - Yes, yes.

35
00:02:42,014 --> 00:02:43,874
I used to work part-time in a French restaurant.

36
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:46,054
I know how to do these things.

37
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:48,514
How can we let you do that?

38
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:12,734
Wife, this young man's knife skills are quite good.

39
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,974
Yes.

40
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:18,134
Whichever girl finds Xiao Bai as her husband, won't she be extremely happy?

41
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:20,434
Isn't that right, Jing Jing?

42
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:29,954
♪ A new storm has appeared ♪

43
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:33,094

46
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,694
Mr. Gu, please come back with us.

47
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:50,154
Now is not the time.

48
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:53,214
I will return when I finish my business.

49
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:56,534
- Let go. 
 - Director Gu, don't make it difficult for me.

50
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:58,974
Let him go.

51
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:02,354
This is what the madam wants, Director Gu.

52
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:04,414
Don't make it difficult for us.

53
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:05,814
How dare you lay your hand on him?

54
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:07,634
Transform!

55
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:12,564
Watch out!

56
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:20,480
- Run with me. 
 - Chase them!

57
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,910
Yes.

58
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:30,728
Follow me.

59
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:40,812
It's okay now. You can go.

60
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:42,380

61
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:45,834
May I ask your name, please?

62
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:49,934
I'm Qiao Zhi, but I never leave my name for good deeds.

63
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:53,474
How can I repay you then?

64
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:55,474
I take pleasure in helping others, no need to repay.

65
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:58,314
No, you saved me as my benefactor.

66
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:00,194
I, Gu Yi, know how to repay a favor.

67
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:03,674
So you pay back kindness purposely (Gùyì de)?

68
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:07,414
No, my name is Gu Yi.

69
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:10,870
So, Brother Gu Yi, let's be friends.

70
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,630
Absolutely.

71
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:22,154
My family's kabobs restaurant is up ahead.

72
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,650
Let's go. I'll treat you to a good meal.

73
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,170
Okay.

74
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:38,834
Who let you in?

75
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,074
Sister, what's wrong? This is my new friend.

76
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:45,614
Do you two know each other?

77
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:48,994
What friend? What friend?

78
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:51,194
You always bring back all sorts of random people with you.

79
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:52,674
Mom, what are you doing?

80
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:55,674
Can you cut me some slack in front of my friend?

81
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:58,214
You are just a little boy. What slack do you want me to cut?

82
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:01,514
I'm hungry. I want to eat.

83
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:03,954
Don't you serve food here?

84
00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:07,594
That's right. I'm a guest, too, today.

85
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:12,154
Mom, serve the dishes.

86
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:23,794
- Let's go, Mom. 
 - He was just pulling and tugging you outside.

87
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:26,674
How did he get involved with Qiao Zhi now?

88
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:28,454
Gu Yi is here again.

89
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:33,894
We don't drive away restaurant customers.

90
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,794
If he wants to eat, let him eat well.

91
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:41,834
Jing, the guy outside is your colleague, right?

92
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:54,334
Jing, why are you putting so much green onion and chili in the dish?

93
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:58,034
It'll make the dish more fragrant.

94
00:06:58,034 --> 00:06:59,974
Fragrant, very fragrant.

95
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:03,194
I'm just saying, don't forget to charge him after he finishes eating.

96
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,990
They're colleagues. Why should we charge him?

97
00:07:05,994 --> 00:07:07,514
Not a single cent less.

98
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:12,154
Fine, fine, I will charge him. Seriously.

99
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:13,708
Cheers!

100
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:19,220
Dig in, dig in!

101
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,974
Why are there so many green onions?

102
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,514
Green onions are delicious and fragrant.

103
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:48,814
You know my sister, right?

104
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:54,474
So do you like my sister?

105
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:02,074
I like my sister, too.

106
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:05,314
But she doesn't pay much attention to me.

107
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:08,214
It's okay. I often make her angry, too,

108
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:09,994
but I can always soothe her every time.

109
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:12,934
Don't worry. I will help you.

110
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:16,230
Here, thank you, Brother Zhi.

111
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,630
You're welcome.

112
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:19,934
Brother Gu, I will drink first to show respect.

113
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:27,714
Hello?

114
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:29,994
Director Gu, you finally answered the phone.

115
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:32,554
Everyone is looking for you. Where are you?

116
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,894
It's none of your business. Just do your job.

117
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:36,434
How's the land business with Huan Yu going?

118
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:40,894
Still negotiating, but right now we can't lower the price.

119
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:43,674
Two billion ($275 million). If it's more, then no deal.

120
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:46,394
Did you hear that? Two billion.

121
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:47,874
He is discussing a land deal here.

122
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:51,514
Now people don't go to fancy cafes to brag, but changed to kabob restaurants.

123
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:53,074
Exactly.

124
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,394
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands.

125
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:59,194
Hundred thousands, millions, ten millions, billions…

126
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:03,134
Brother Gu, you're so rich.

127
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,980
Not really. I still have to rely on you, Brother Zhi.

128
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,840
Cheers.

129
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,670
Of course.

130
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:27,094
When have we, the Bai family, ever wronged you?

131
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:29,354
Why is Gu Yi treating Xiao Yun this way?

132
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:31,914
You have to give me an explanation today.

133
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:34,654
Yes, we have treated Xiao Yun unfairly.

134
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:38,274
When Gu Yi comes back, I will make him apologize to Xiao Yun.

135
00:09:38,274 --> 00:09:40,714
We can't afford to lose our reputation.

136
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,420
Cancel this marriage engagement.

137
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,490
That won't do.

138
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:47,224
Mom.

139
00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:50,394
He already ran away to another woman.

140
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:52,854
Why are you still not giving up?

141
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:56,194
There must be some misunderstanding.

142
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:59,294
Gu Yi has Xiao Yun in his heart.

143
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:02,714
I grew up with Brother Gu Yi since we were little.

144
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:05,054
He has always liked me.

145
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:06,634
He is just looking for novelty.

146
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:09,474
It's Qiao Jing who seduced him.

147
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:12,954
Yes, yes, Xiao Yun, don't worry.

148
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:15,614
Auntie will bring Gu Yi back.

149
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:19,514
Your Brother Gu Yi can be only yours.

150
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:23,074
Mom.

151
00:10:40,034 --> 00:10:43,334
It's already closing time. How long will you linger here?

152
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:47,694
Auntie, I've troubled you all day. I will go back first.

153
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:50,114
It's getting late already, and it won't be safe to drive.

154
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:53,294
Why don't you stay? Stay at Auntie's house for the night.

155
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:55,214
Then I'll stay, too.

156
00:10:57,014 --> 00:10:59,754
Great! Yes!

157
00:10:59,754 --> 00:11:02,874
Brother Gu Yi, don't leave tonight. Let's hang out.

158
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:04,294
All right.

159
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:08,334
Where will he sleep? There is no more room at home.

160
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,794
Mom, don't worry about it.

161
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,394
Can't my 1.2-meter (4 ft) bed fit us both?

162
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:14,210
I can sleep anywhere.

163
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,850
Come with me.

164
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:24,212
What's going on?

165
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:32,160
Slow down.

166
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,014
What exactly do you want by lingering at my house?

167
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:39,674
If I leave, you can keep getting cozy with Bai Yan, right?

168
00:11:39,674 --> 00:11:41,834
What's so good about him? I just don't understand.

169
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,174
You've been with me.

170
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:44,634
How could he attract you?

171
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:46,294
How does it relate that I've been with you?

172
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:48,374
Are you an immortal?

173
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:51,834
I even called off the wedding for you.

174
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:53,694
You must return to me.

175
00:11:54,634 --> 00:12:00,134
If... if you want to get married with me, it's not impossible.

176
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:03,594
Are you able to marry me?

177
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:07,024
Yes.

178
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:15,194
But not now, you know that.

179
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,594
Marriage isn't a simple matter.

180
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:19,134
Marriage isn't a difficult matter either.

181
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:22,854
When two people truly love each other, they can get a marriage certificate anytime.

182
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:27,114
The concerns and hesitations you have are all due to weighing pros and cons.

183
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:31,414
In your heart, there's only benefit, with no space for love.

184
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:36,954
If I only cared about benefits, I wouldn't even be here today.

185
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:39,974
I don't care. I won't leave tonight.

186
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:43,554
Gu Yi, when did you become such a rogue?

187
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:47,954
I've always been like this.

188
00:12:47,954 --> 00:12:50,054
Is this the first day you met me?

189
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:52,514
Brother Gu Yi, it's time to go home.

190
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:54,230
All right,

191
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,690
I'm coming.

192
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:11,914
Why do you insist on letting him stay here?

193
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:14,354
It's such a hassle.

194
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:21,214
Xiao Bai is Jing's friend,

195
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:25,210
and Xiao Gu is her colleague.

196
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,950
You're only so enthusiastic about Xiao Bai,

197
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,570
but Xiao Gu must feel embarrassed, right?

198
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:35,814
Qiao Zhi gets along well with Gu, and he insisted on him staying with us.

199
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,954
What can we do?

200
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:41,334
It's all your fault, you stinker.

201
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:45,914
Can Gu Yi be compared with Bai?

202
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:49,714
He has a bad temper and no sense of propriety.

203
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:53,954
I already said there is no room, but he insisted on staying the night.

204
00:13:55,954 --> 00:13:57,014
 Your side is so spacious.

205
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:58,274
 You must be comfortable, but what about me?

206
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:01,334
 "I'm comfortable"? I can't even move.

207
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,034
 Don't push me, get away.

208
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:20,694
I can't take it anymore, get down.

209
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,954
Why should I go down?

210
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:31,454
Don't go too far.

211
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,254
I don't want to cause a scene with you here.

212
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:35,674
Let me go, let go, let go.

213
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:39,690
You guys…

214
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,430
 We...

215
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:45,194
- We're fine. 
 - We're fine.

216
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:49,634
Your body's weak, and you sleep on the bed. I'll go down.

217
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:52,214
No need. The bed is too soft for me; you sleep here.

218
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:54,074
I'll just sleep on the floor.

219
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:58,394
I can sleep anywhere.

220
00:15:06,454 --> 00:15:12,914
The weather is getting cold, and I think it's better to sleep on the bed.

221
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:17,854
All right. Auntie, it's getting late, and you should go rest, too.

222
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:22,494
- Good night. 
 -  Good night.

223
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,174
You're really something.

224
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,974
I don't want to sleep there. I want to sleep with you.

225
00:15:57,974 --> 00:15:59,274
Are you losing your mind?

226
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:02,294
The bed is too small. Bai Yan keeps pushing me, and I can't sleep well.

227
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,394
Our home is too small to accommodate important figures like you.

228
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:07,054
Hurry and leave. You go sleep wherever you want.

229
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:10,314
Isn't your bed just right for us two?

230
00:16:10,314 --> 00:16:12,256
Get out.

231
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:15,874
I told you to get out.

232
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,314
- No. 
 - Get out!

233
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:22,214
Don't be so stingy.

234
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:42,034
Who is this man?

235
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,774
What does it have to do with you? Get out.

236
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,030
Get out!

237
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,130
Go, get out.

238
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:55,494
Exit!

239
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:07,954
 Who the heck is that man?

240
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,454
Did you sleep well last night?

241
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:25,694
After Gu Yi left, I slept quite well.

242
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:29,134
He's quite troublesome.

243
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:31,834
He voided the engagement for you.

244
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:32,954
What are you thinking?

245
00:17:32,954 --> 00:17:37,134
Even with him doing so, I can't possibly go back to him.

246
00:17:37,134 --> 00:17:39,154
Do you really think so?

247
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:49,674
I always thought you treated everyone the same.

248
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:51,734
But last night, I found out

249
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:55,234
that you're different with him.

250
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:48,594
He is still in your heart

251
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,394
It was just a small matter, and it didn't prove anything.

252
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:52,934
We see the big picture from a small angle.

253
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:55,434
Details reveal true feelings.

254
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:58,134
Just as you didn't even know

255
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,114
mosquitoes were in my room too.

256
00:19:30,564 --> 00:19:32,374
When are you leaving?

257
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:34,454
What does it matter to you if I leave or not?

258
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:35,874
You're thicker skinned than city walls.

259
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,234
How long do you intend to keep evading?

260
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:39,594
Hurry, or you'll be stuck in traffic.

261
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,136
You should go, too.

262
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:44,240
Of course. I'm not like you.

263
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,870
So shameless.

264
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:54,194
Qiao Jing, we've been bothering your family for so long. It's time for us to leave.

265
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,514
Could you pass the message to your mom and dad?

266
00:19:56,514 --> 00:19:58,634
I won't disturb them working.

267
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:01,634
All right, take care on the road.

268
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,154
Should only he be careful on the road? What about me?

269
00:20:13,314 --> 00:20:14,796
Let's go.

270
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:18,814
- You go first. 
 - You first.

271
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:22,620
Let's go together.

272
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,930
Let's go.

273
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:14,668
Only a fool would go.

274
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,334
Why is the door closed?

275
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,654
Brother Gu Yi, why are you here, too?

276
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:52,334
Whose birthday is it today?

277
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:53,594
My sister's.

278
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:56,054
Don't you even know my sister's birthday?

279
00:21:56,054 --> 00:21:58,154
Hasn't her birthday already passed?

280
00:21:58,154 --> 00:22:00,694
No, my sister's birthday is today.

281
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,754
Look, the store is already closed.

282
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:08,294
This is the doll I just got from a claw machine.

283
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,714
You give it to her.

284
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:11,994
And take the cake with you too.

285
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,234
Come, let's go home for dinner.

286
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:26,634
Sister, I'm back.

287
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:28,704
My son is back.

288
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:31,614
Why are you back?

289
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:34,054
How could your birthday be today?

290
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:37,834
Xiao Gu, you're here as a guest. There is no need to bring gifts.

291
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:40,874
Come, come, sit here.

292
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,274
I prepared a couple of dishes.

293
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:47,280
Let's have a few drinks later.

294
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,790
Jing.

295
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:53,954
Sister, where's Mom?

296
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:55,674
She went downstairs to buy fruit.

297
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,474
She will be back soon.

298
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:15,754
- What's wrong? 
 - I just want to say, isn't this annoying?

299
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:17,994
The one who should come, didn't. The one who shouldn't, did come.

300
00:23:17,994 --> 00:23:22,074
Imagine if Xiao Bai could attend the birthday party. How great that would be.

301
00:23:22,074 --> 00:23:23,894
He has to work.

302
00:23:23,894 --> 00:23:27,374
Moreover, Xiao Bai is indeed great,

303
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:30,974
but I don't think Jing Jing has feelings for him.

304
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:33,874
She seems to have a thing for Xiao Gu instead.

305
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:34,974
Didn't you notice?

306
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:37,114
I did.

307
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:41,234
You know, although Jing Jing feels annoyed and frustrated with him,

308
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:44,314
how she looks at him is quite special.

309
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:46,970
Yes,

310
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,830
Jing Jing has been hiding her feelings so deeply these years.

311
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:55,234
Even we, as her parents, can't reach them,

312
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:57,834
but this Xiao Gu can.

313
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:04,834
Look, he can make Jing Jing anxious, angry, and be more lively.

314
00:24:06,594 --> 00:24:10,514
If he can help Jing Jing move on from what happened four years ago,

315
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:15,554
I think his bad temper isn't really a problem, isn't that right?

316
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,014
I hope he can.

317
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:21,314
I hope so.

318
00:24:21,314 --> 00:24:23,794
What do you mean, "you hope so"? Time to wash the dishes.

319
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:25,834
All right, all right.

320
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,014
You called off the wedding.

321
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:41,474
Many things must be waiting for you to deal with in South City.

322
00:24:44,634 --> 00:24:46,214
I need to leave,

323
00:24:46,814 --> 00:24:49,174
but I want to take you with me.

324
00:24:55,154 --> 00:25:01,154
Gu Yi, have you ever thought that your current persistence

325
00:25:01,154 --> 00:25:04,334
is a manifestation of your emotional barrier syndrome?

326
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:16,334
Don't try to use this to make me leave.

327
00:25:17,074 --> 00:25:19,334
I know what I'm doing.

328
00:25:21,194 --> 00:25:25,054
I was indeed hesitating before.

329
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:27,534
I didn't want to give up you or Bai Yun,

330
00:25:28,474 --> 00:25:30,634
but now I've figured it out.

331
00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:34,334
If I must choose between you and her,

332
00:25:38,194 --> 00:25:39,988
I choose you.

333
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:46,354
Qiao Jing, we've been together for so long.

334
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:48,554
Can you really bear to leave me?

335
00:26:15,154 --> 00:26:16,894
Normally you always say no to an extra sip.

336
00:26:16,894 --> 00:26:21,154
How come you drank so much today? Let me take you home.

337
00:26:22,154 --> 00:26:24,148
Come on, get up.

338
00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:30,308
Su Juan.

339
00:26:33,254 --> 00:26:35,354
Su Juan.

340
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,974
Su Juan.

341
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:04,354
He is Su Juan.

342
00:27:14,354 --> 00:27:16,774
What exactly is your relationship with him?

343
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:22,674
If you don't tell me, I can find out myself.

344
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,494
He was my senior in high school.

345
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:40,074
Where is this place?

346
00:27:41,754 --> 00:27:44,454
This is the place where I first met him.

347
00:27:49,194 --> 00:27:52,774
 So you're the one called Su Juan.

348
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:55,374
 I heard you were quite arrogant lately.

349
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,474
 Let me tell you! I hate people the most who like to show off!

350
00:27:58,474 --> 00:28:02,414
 Hello, Officer, a robbery is happening behind No. Three Middle School.

351
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:05,574
 Yes, yes, please hurry.

352
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,554
 Y-Y-You…

353
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:08,774
 Where did you come from, you nosy girl?

354
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:11,234
 I'm telling you to mind your own business!

355
00:28:12,214 --> 00:28:13,674
 You heard them, right?

356
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:16,054
 Their attitude is extremely arrogant.

357
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:18,934
 I'm terrified! Please come quickly.

358
00:28:19,674 --> 00:28:21,914
 - Fine, you win. 
 - You wait.

359
00:28:28,914 --> 00:28:30,836
 Are you okay?

360
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:35,450
 I'm fine. Thank you.

361
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,450
 My name is Su Juan.

362
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:42,034
 I'm Qiao Jing. What's your QQ number (social media)?

363
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:45,174
 Did you manage to solve the questions I taught you yesterday?

364
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:50,134
 Then let me teach you again.

365
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,814
 Look at this question.

366
00:28:56,814 --> 00:29:00,134
 Coordinate systems and parametric equations…

367
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:25,554
 Look at the question, not at me.

368
00:29:27,554 --> 00:29:29,160
 Look at it.

369
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:31,774
 Here's how to shoot the ball.

370
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:33,880
 Brother Juan.

371
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:37,934
 Aren't you in class?

372
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:39,674
 How did you come here?

373
00:29:39,674 --> 00:29:43,614
 After you graduate, we will not be in the same school.

374
00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:49,174
 If you want to keep being with me, then you need to study hard.

375
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:52,534
 I will wait for you at South City University next year.

376
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,794
 But my scores…

377
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:58,794
 I believe in you.

378
00:30:00,774 --> 00:30:02,834
 All right, then wait for me.

379
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,874
 Okay, I'll wait.

380
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:26,340
After getting into the university,

381
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,950
I realized I didn't just want to be his little sister.

382
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:34,294
I wanted to be closer to him.

383
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:40,514
In order to confess my feelings for him, I even made a dating checklist.

384
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:47,228
Unfortunately, he couldn't make it to the date.

385
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,994
After being his plan B for so long, he must have forgotten you by now.

386
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,432
He's dead.

387
00:31:01,414 --> 00:31:05,934
Four years ago, you had a car accident in Xilin Mountain.

388
00:31:06,514 --> 00:31:11,294
That accident caused you to lose part of your memories,

389
00:31:13,794 --> 00:31:16,434
and you had a heart transplant.

390
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:31,034
The other party in the accident was Su Juan.

391
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:36,334
The heart you received was his.

392
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:38,274
How is that possible?

393
00:31:38,274 --> 00:31:40,654
How could there be such a coincidence in the world?

394
00:31:40,654 --> 00:31:42,400
Is it a coincidence?

395
00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:45,734
What you see as a coincidence

396
00:31:46,474 --> 00:31:49,194
is actually someone's careful planning.

397
00:31:49,194 --> 00:31:51,414
"Careful planning"?

398
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:54,534
So is his heart the reason you stayed close to me?

399
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:58,134
You stayed by my side for the past three years. Was this all for Su Juan?

400
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:02,800
Every year,

401
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:07,194
the birthday I asked you to celebrate with me

402
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:10,854
was actually his.

403
00:32:25,994 --> 00:32:30,174
Qiao Jing, you're ruthless!

404
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:57,060

405
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,890
 "The Honored Guest" by Zhang Yuan

406
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:06,150
♫  The bell rings imperceptibly  ♫

407
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:14,604
♫  You stay where you are, waiting for him to come closer  ♫

408
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:18,936
♫  He gently kneels on one knee  ♫

409
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:27,500
♫  Slipping the diamond ring onto your ring finger  ♫

410
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:33,104
♫  When everyone is happy for you, I become solemn  ♫

411
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:38,768
♫  It turns out no relationship is between us anymore  ♫

412
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:45,134
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness your love  ♫

♫  You are especially lovely today  ♫

415
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:58,427
♫  This beauty once was in my arms  ♫

416
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:04,313
♫  A pity this wedding is for you and him; I am just a guest  ♫

417
00:34:04,313 --> 00:34:10,718
♫  I set down all my memories to fulfill your love  ♫

418
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:16,654
♫  But I never wanted to believe this is fate  ♫

419
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:20,336
♫  The promised forever has become the past  ♫

420
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:23,918
♫  I tried to give you my best wishes sincerely  ♫

421
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,562
♫  Please forgive me for being improper  ♫

422
00:34:27,562 --> 00:34:34,734
♫  Choosing to excuse myself and leave  ♫

423
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:37,801
♫  It's not a drama  ♫

424
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:42,808
♫  Why am I so into it?  ♫

425
00:34:42,808 --> 00:34:49,119
♫  This unbearable plot  ♫

426
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:55,476
♫  Thank you for the special invitation to witness the love you desire  ♫

427
00:34:55,476 --> 00:35:01,579
♫  Being a guest may be my other destiny  ♫

428
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:08,680
♫  As the one who left, what gives me the right to care?  ♫

429
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,780
♫  After all, you're the one who finally got married, and I'm just a guest  ♫

430
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:21,030
♫  I drained all the memories to celebrate your wedding  ♫

431
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:26,972
♫  But I never had the courage to bless you  ♫

432
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:35,240
♫  Thank you for making me finally sober and returning me back to myself  ♫

433
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:47,972
♫  At least I can still be a guest to witness your love  ♫

434
00:35:47,972 --> 00:35:51,884
♫  He's so lucky to have met you  ♫

435
00:35:51,884 --> 00:36:02,266
♫  I hope he loves you more than I do  ♫
