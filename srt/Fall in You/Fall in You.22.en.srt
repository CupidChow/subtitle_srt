You got the evidence, right?

383
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,570
Yuan said

384
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,960
that Qin Ziyu is the murderer
who killed your parents.

385
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,160
He's truly a monster.

386
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,530
Those two drinks...

387
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,130
You used them to drug those two men.

388
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,120
Your alliance with Qin Ziyu

389
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,680
is fake?

390
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,040
Yes.

391
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,520
Hurry and go.

392
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,850
Qin Ziyu is coming back.

393
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,640
Thank you.

394
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,920
Qiao Yan.

395
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,740
You're trying to run away?

396
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,290
Qin Ziyu!

397
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,520
Let go of me!

398
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,200
Qin Ziyu!

399
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,560
Let go of me!

400
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,760
Qin Ziyu!

401
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,050
Qin Ziyu!

402
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,480
Let go of me!

403
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,490
Qiao Yan.

404
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,400
I gave you a chance,

405
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
but you never

406
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,080
truly accepted me.

407
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,200
Calm down.

408
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,490
Qiao Yan,

409
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,640
I love you so much,

410
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,160
but you do this to me.

411
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,740
Don't tell me that you love me.

412
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,280
Every word you say

413
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,840
makes me sick.

414
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,340
You don't love anyone.

415
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,930
You only love yourself!

416
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,240
That's right.

417
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,000
I only love myself.

418
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,040
Ah!

419
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,560
Qin Ziyu,

420
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,640
don't do this!

421
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,480
Qin Ziyu!

422
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,120
Let go of me!

423
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,000
You know everything?

424
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,040
Help!

425
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,370
Ah...

426
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:01,920
Ah.

427
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:02,720
Qiao Yan.

428
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,400
I never thought

429
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
things would turn out like this.

430
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,120
Wherever you want to go,

431
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,000
I can take you.

432
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,120
Germany...

433
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,240
or the afterlife,

434
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,200
huh?

435
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,090
Qiao Yan.

436
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,010
Qiao Yan.

437
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,760
Get up.

438
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,890
Let's go.

439
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,250
Let's go.

440
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,500
You crazy bastard!

441
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,140
You worthless idiots!

442
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,580
Lu Wanqing,

443
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,160
you've done so much for Gu Jingyuan,

444
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,980
yet he still doesn't love you.

445
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,580
Don't you think you're pathetic?

446
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,720
Someone like you

447
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,560
wouldn't understand anyway.

448
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,690
There's no point explaining it to you.

449
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,520
Qiao Yan.

450
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,560
I'll let you go.

451
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,000
Give that thing to me.

452
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,530
Qin Ziyu,

453
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,320
you'd better stop now

454
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,250
and stop making any more mistakes.

455
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,760
I won't give it to you.

456
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,120
This is

457
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,320
my house.

458
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,290
Gu Jingyuan.

459
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,320
Jingyuan!

460
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,850
Jingyuan, don't punch him!

461
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,480
Don't punch him anymore.

462
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,210
Gu Jingyuan,

463
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,120
I've found the evidence.

464
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,240
Let's go home.

465
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,560
Let's go home.

466
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,040
What a pity.

467
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,880
If he had been just one step late,

468
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,680
Qiao Yan

469
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,680
would have been with me forever.
