193
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,440
how am I supposed to tell you

195
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,770
But he was the one
who killed your parents.

196
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,000
And in my veins,

197
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,800
flows his blood.

198
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,370
You're quite punctual.

But now,

206
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,920
I'm not just interested
in playing the game

207
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,520
of wrecking their marriage.

208
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,920
Don't beat around the bush.

209
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,980
I'll be frank then.

210
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,980

211

213

Mr. Qin, you must desperately want

214
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,240
to take back
what belongs to the Qin family.

215
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,080
So, are you willing to join me

216
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,560

217
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,680

whether Lu Wanqing's resignation

383
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,420
will affect the project's progress.

384
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,930
What a surprise.

385
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,120
I didn't expect you to ask me out.

386
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,160
I want to know

387
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,860
why you suddenly left Gu's Group.

388
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,720
Didn't Yuan tell you?

389
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,920
What exactly is he...

390
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,960
Do you know something?

391
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,920
You shouldn't ask me.

392
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,140
You should ask your Jingyuan.

393
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,450
If Yuan didn't tell you,

394
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,800
I won't either.

395
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,800
Forget it.

396
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,960
You are husband and wife.

397
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,290
But he won't tell you anything.

398
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:15,840
It seems

399
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,800
he doesn't trust you that much.

400
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
At least he doesn't think

401
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,370
you're worthy of sharing his burdens.

402
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,700
Coming to you today

403
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,160
is my mistake.

404
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,540
Gu Jingyuan is my husband.

405
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
I should believe everything he does

406
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,400
is for our family.

407
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,900
As for anything about him,

408
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,520
I shouldn't hear them from an outsider.
