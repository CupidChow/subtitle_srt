Because what Gu's Group did before

How would we be close to each other?

378
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,680
Besides,

379
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,850
even if I'm close to him,

380
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,640
I can't help our enemy, right?

381
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,280
Hello?

382
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,240
What's wrong?

383
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,330

384
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,930
Hello, what's going on now?

385
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,760
We found the suspect when he was trying to
illegally leave our country.

386
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,920
During the pursuit,

387
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,520
the suspect fled to the road

388
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,720
and was hit by a truck.

389
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,040
After emergency treatment,

390
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,640
his life is out of danger now.

391
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,520
But his head is severely injured,

392
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,760
so he can't wake up for the time being.

393
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,600
Did the doctor say

394
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,800
when he would wake up?

395
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,960
Thank you.

396
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,240
Once he wakes up,

397
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,640
let me know immediately.

398
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,260
Thanks for your hard work.

399
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,320
Let's go back.

400
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,840
If he dies,

401
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,760
or he never wakes up,

402
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,360
then we won't be able to
catch the real murderer anymore, huh?

403
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,560
It won't be like that.

404
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,180
Justice has long arms.

405
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,200
The criminals

406
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,920
will be punished.

407
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,600
You're right.

408

The truth will come out eventually.

409
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:27,920
Yes.

410
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,400
What a pity.

411
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,440
He has been arrested.

412
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,880
But we lost the clue.

413
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,800
As for the person who killed Hai,

414
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,920
I'll definitely make him pay the price.

415
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,560
Yeah.

416
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,400

I really don't think

419

this has anything to do with Jingyuan.

420
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,080
Otherwise, he wouldn't have

421
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
saved Miss Qiao Yan again and again.

422
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,320
Miss Qiao Yan is so smart.

423
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,540
I believe in her judgment.

I'm seldom involved in
the company's operations now.

568
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
The whole network
is paying attention to this incident now.

569
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,080
Don't try to shift the responsibility!

570
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,840
We've never thought of
shifting the responsibility.

571
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,570
What's more,

572
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,000
we wouldn't let the kids

573
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,040
eat expired food.

574
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,920
When the kids get better,

575
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,680
someone will come to talk to you
about the compensation.

576
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,400
Or I can talk to you all about it.

577
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,600
You can tell the police about this.

578
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,240
Leave at once!

579
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,360
-Get out! Get out!
-No, no, no. Don't push us.

580
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,840
Get out!

581
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,760
Get out!

582
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,520
Hey, calm down, everyone! Okay?

583
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
I don't want to see you guys anymore!

584
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,360
Yuan.

585
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,240
We've met again.
