00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,480
I kept avoiding you before

5
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
because I was too afraid to face you.

6
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,759
I'm afraid you'll hate me when you know

7
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,800
all the truth.

8
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,479
What truth?

9
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,440
I thought my mom had passed away.

10
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,240
But He Wei told me

11
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,090
she was still alive.

12
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,539
So I went to see her.

13
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,330
She lives in Xin Yu Sanatorium.

14
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,850
How did you know?

What happened later?

Later...

17

Later, I found out about

I didn't want to
believe all of this at first.

22
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,290
But when I first found out about it,

23
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,490
I didn't know how...

24
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,240
how to tell you and Dad.

25
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
So you prepared...

26
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,160
that divorce agreement?

27
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,360
No, Yan.

28
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,900
I've never wanted to divorce you.

29

That divorce agreement

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,850
was a just a tactic when I had no choice.

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,880
I'm late.

193
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,200
Hey!

194
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,160
Don't touch it!

195
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,280
This is the seat of the former chairman.

196
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,760
Mr. Gu.

197
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,330
What does this mean?

198
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:29,840
Yeah.

199
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,680
This is the will
Grandpa made before he died.

200
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,320
If any of you have any questions,

201
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,250
you can check it.

[Signed by: Gu Changfeng]

205
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,640
Hey.

206
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,520
Mr. Gu.

207
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,540
This...

208
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,380
This...

209
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
The position of chairman is no joke.

210
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,970
But Mr. Gu supports her.

211
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
I agree to let Qiao Yan

212
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,770
be the new chairwoman of our group.

213
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,320
Since the former Chairman Gu
and Mr. Gu Jingyuan

214
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,920
both said so...

215
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,320
But...

216
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,880
Then shall we support this idea?

217
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,680
That's right.

218
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
I want to fully take over Gu's Group.

219
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,460
I hope that you can support me.

220
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,540
In the past,

221
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,820
I relied on my parents.

222
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,850
Later, after I came to Xijiang,

223
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,290
I relied on you and Grandpa.

224
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,960
Now I should

225
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,000
learn to be independent.

226
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,420
I promised Grandpa

227
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,420
that I would protect Gu's Group with you,

228
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,520
so I must fulfill my promise.

229
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,040
Okay.

230
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,690
Whatever you want to do,

231
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
I'll support you.

232
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,800
Everyone,

233
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,170
Gu's Group was founded by Chairman Gu.

234
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,040
With all the ups and downs these years,

235
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,240
it's all thanks to
everyone's joint efforts.

236
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
As Chairman Gu's adopted son

237
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,050
and Qiao Yan's husband,

238
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,280
I'm a member of the Gu family.

239
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,480
Though I used to manage Gu's Group
for Chairman Gu,

240
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,440
from now on,

241
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,359
I'll still do my best to assist Qiao Yan.

242
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,920
I also hope

243
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,440
to get your support

244
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,080
and trust.

245
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,820
If you agree to let Qiao Yan

246
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,440
be the new chairwoman,

247
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,730
please raise your hand.

248
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,530
Thank you all for your support.

249
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,560
I'll carry on
my grandpa's unfinished lifework

250
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,960
and work hard with you all

251

will last for four years.

Stop looking.

Do you really want to
see them get divorced?

264

I…

265
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,960
Whatever decision Qiao Yan makes,

266
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
I'll support her.

277
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,490

just take good care of yourself.

288
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
did I realize that

289
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,820

318
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,600

319
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,560
for revenge.

with the investigation team's inspection.

Why are you so flustered?

337
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Some of the company's ledgers

338
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,000
and financial information are missing.

339
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,560
We need to make up for many materials.

340

If this goes on,

341
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,370
the whole investigation
will be delayed for two months.

What's more,

343
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,160
the company's bank accounts
with over 1 billion yuan in cash

344
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
have been frozen.

345
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,280
The entire cash flow

346
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,400
is in these accounts.

347
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,200

for two months,

the company's capital flow

349
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,930

Ms. Qiao.

359
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,360
There was something I couldn't figure out.

360
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,840
A couple of days ago,
when I was tidying up the chairman's car,

361
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,680
I found a mark at the rear par of the car,

362
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,280
which might be caused
by a rear-end collision.

363
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,820
But I clearly remember

364
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,440
the day before his birthday,

365
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,040
there were no such marks
when I cleaned the car.

366
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,660
So you're suspecting that

367
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,560
Grandpa had a heart attack

368
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,020
because of a car accident?

369
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,600
And it was a hit-and-run?

370
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,520
Maybe it was not that simple.

371
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,840
Before your grandpa died,
he asked me to investigate

372
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,000
what happened between you and Jingyuan.

373
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,130
I found that it was related to Qin Ziyu.

374
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,170
And I reported it to him.

375
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,040
So you mean...

376
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Grandpa's death

377
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,200
might be related to Qin Ziyu?

378
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,920
That day, your grandpa suddenly

379
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,050
went to your parents' cemetery alone.

380
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I just thought it was quite strange.

381
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,400
So,

382
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,800
I went to get the surveillance videos
from that day in the cemetery.

383
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,640
I found that he had really

384
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,500
met with Qin Ziyu in the cemetery.

385
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,800
However,

386
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,360
when the two cars left and arrived,

387
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,240
I didn't find

388
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,380
any traces of rear-end collisions
or scraping.

389
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,180
In other words,

390
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,410
Grandpa's car accident

391
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,840
happened on that path

392
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,920
without CCTV cameras, and then he died?

393
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,980
It was very likely.

394
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,050
If that was really the case,

395
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,530
Grandpa's death

396
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,340
had something to do with Qin Ziyu.

397
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,980
It's rare for you to ask me out.

398
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,200
Last time, in the mourning hall,

399
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,330
Gu Jingyuan hit you.

400
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
I'd like to apologize to you for him.

401
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,680
It's okay.

402
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,040
I didn't take it to heart.

403
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,680
How have you been lately?

404
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
You look thinner.

405
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,330
Grandpa is gone.

406
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,640
I've returned to Gu's Group.

407
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,920
I'm a bit busy indeed.

408
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,000
Isn't Gu Jingyuan managing Gu's Group?

409
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,640
You said you were not
interested in doing business.

410
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,120
I'm...

411
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
going to divorce him.

412
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,490
Are you sure?

413
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,780
Did Gu Jingyuan agree?

414
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,680
Yes.

415
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,290
However,

416
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,400
we haven't

417
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,010
announced this news to the public yet.

418
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,210
Can you keep this secret for me?

419
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,400
Sure.

420
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,200
Then what is

421
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,940
your next plan?

422
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,610
What plans could I have?

423
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,130
Grandpa is gone.

424
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,280
And I'm alone again.

425
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,960
Qin Ziyu, tell me.

426
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,680
If I hadn't

427
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,120
married Gu Jingyuan back then,

428
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,780
would everything be fine now?

429
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,460
At least, I would still have an uncle.

430
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,410
I won't leave you alone.

431
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:08,970
Qiao Yan.

432
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,480
I like you.

433
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,040
I wanted to tell you from the first day
I returned to our country.

434
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,970
But I was one step late at that time.

435
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,780
You had already married Gu Jingyuan.

436
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,440
But...

437
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,020
But your dad...

438
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,400
I know

439
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,640
you've never resented me

440
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
because of my dad.

441
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,540
You are the best girl in the world.

442
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Other people can't understand you.

443
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,880
Now

444
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,090
the obstacle between us no longer exists.

445
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,820
I don't want to lose you again.

446
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,360
The obstacle between us?

447
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,980
Are you talking about my grandpa?

448
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,560
I mean...

449
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,940
Chairman Gu

450
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,400
might not want us to be together.

451
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,970
However,

452
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,760
I really want him to be alive, too.

453
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,960
But the accident has already happened.

454
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,800
I'm sorry.

455
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,100
Many things have happened recently.

456
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,200
Now I'm still not able to

457
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,730
accept a new relationship.

458
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,530
Let's be friends first.

459
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,360
So you mean

460
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,570
there's still a chance between us?

461
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,760
Great!

462
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,090
Qin Ziyu.

463
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,840
I'm sorry.

464
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,500
I was a bit too excited.

465
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,100
I must have scared you.

466
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,330
Well, I still have something to do
in the company.

467
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,220
I have to go now.

468
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,640
Let me see you out.

469
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,280
I'm leaving.

470
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,200
Let's have dinner together sometime.

471
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,530
Okay.

472
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,600
What's wrong?

473
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Um,

474
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,530
I don't think I can start my car.

475
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,320
But I'm in a hurry

476
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,560
to go back to the company for a meeting.

477
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,840
Why don't you drive my car now?

478
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,700
I'll handle it.

479
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,760
Thank you.

480
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,520
You're welcome.
