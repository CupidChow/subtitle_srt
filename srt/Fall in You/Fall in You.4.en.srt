Dad,

00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,680
Mom,

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,280
I came to see you.

6
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,280
I was wrong.

7
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
I thought

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,479
Gu Jingyuan was the one who killed you.

and My Daughter-in-law Qiao Yuling]

10
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
But he wasn't.

11
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,120
I go against him every day,

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,600
yet he has been secretly protecting me.

13
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,160
Actually, I'm very grateful to him.

14
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,480
But

15
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,320
now I don't know how to face him,

16
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,480
or even say "thank you."

17
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,800
What should I do?

18
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,920
Am I the most useless person

19
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,680
in the world?

20
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,840
Where's Yan?

21
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,680
Would she be okay?

22
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,840
You...

23
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
Why don't you keep an eye on her?

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,960
Don't worry, Dad.

25
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,160
I'll try to reach her.

26
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,200
It'll be fine.

27
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,640
Hello,

28
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,680
the number you dialed is powered off.

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,280
Sorry.

How did you find me here?

33
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,480
After what happened,

34
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,960
you must miss your parents a lot.

35
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,080
I'm sorry,

36
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
Uncle.

37
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
I wronged you before.

38
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:42,800
It's okay.

39
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,930
I never took it to heart.

40
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
It's okay, Yan.

41
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,760
It's okay.

42
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,960
Don't cry.

43
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
Since my parents died,

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
finding the truth

45
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,640
has been my only purpose.

46
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,960
But now all the clues

47
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,920
are all gone.

48
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,960
I don't know what to do.

49
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,440
If...

Alright.

Stop crying, Yan.

Mmm.

My legs are numb.

00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,800
Your arm still hurts?

61
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,240
I'm fine.

62
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,810
It's just a scratch.

63
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,520
No big deal.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Why are you apologizing to me?

66
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,080
I admit,

67
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,880
at first I was angry with you—

68
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,340
I made you misunderstand,

69
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,280
and

70
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,700
you almost got into trouble for that.

71
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,360
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,680
It's okay.

73
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,120
You saved me.

74
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,320
We're even now.

75
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,080
You know what?

76
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,840
I was abandoned

77
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,440
by my parents as a kid.

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,370
at gambling,

81
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,880
he'd scold and beat me.

82
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,840
Later I went to an welfare house,

83
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
but the elder kids there bullied me.

84
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,080
I endured it all

85
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,920
until...

86
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,460
I was adopted by the Gu family.

87
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,040
I didn't know you had

88
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,130
such a rough childhood.

89
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
I used to envy you

90
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,040
for having a happy family

91
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,960
and parents who love you.

92
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,040
But then I realized

93
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,890
suddenly losing

94
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,290
hurts even more than

95
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,570
never having it.

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,800
Yan,

97
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,570
life isn't just about revenge.

98
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
The hard days will pass eventually.

99
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,240
Give yourself time,

100
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
let go of the pain,

101
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,960
and face what's ahead.

102
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,810
Don't let that crash trap you forever.

103
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,760

I'm sorry.

don't be mad.

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,970
Take it easy.

112
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,840
How could I be mad at my granddaughter?

113

Alright.

and make her some ginger soup.

Okay, Mr. Gu.

Please calm down.

the one who stole the model

should be the mastermind.

Chen Shi did it?

141
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,880
The police already cleared him.

142
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,420
He just wanted to use Qiao Yan
to get at me.

143
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,840
As for Wang He,

144
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,680
it was just for money.

145
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,920

to inherit Gu's Group,

150
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,800
or

151
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,520
to maintain Gu's current equity structure

153

This person

154
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,600
must be afraid of Hai and Yan

155
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,520
inheriting Gu's.

156
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,600
So who do you think

157
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,000
this person

158
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,800
might be?

159
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,100
The most likely person...

160
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,240
is me.

161
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,200
Yuan,

162
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,640
then tell me,

163
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
was it you?

164
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,800
No.

165
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,200
I trust you.

166
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,960
Keep investigating.

167
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,520
Tell me if you find anything.

168
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:32,960
Okay.

169
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,560
Oh, right.

170
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,480
Also,

171
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,220
never let Yan get involved again.

172
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,450
It's too dangerous.

173
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,760
Don't worry, Dad.

174
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,520
I pretended to break ties
with you over Qiao Yan.

175
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,560
And about those restless shareholders,

176
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,200
I've taken back

177
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
all their shares.

178
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,720
Now that Chen Shi's gone down,

179
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,040
I'll deal with the people

180
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,240
behind him one by one.

181
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,920
The company should stay stable for now,

182
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,440
and it'll be easier

183
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,980
if Qiao Yan takes over.

184
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,520
Jingyuan,

185
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,160
you'd really

186
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
hand the company to Yan?

187
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,640
It's yours.

188
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,330
You can give it to whoever you want.

189
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,120
Okay.

190
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,320
You've worked hard lately.

191
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,960
Go rest.

192
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,450
I'll head back then.

193
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,240
Mmm.

194
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,840
Yan?

195
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,040
Don't worry.

196
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,800
I've explained everything to Dad.

197
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,240
He...

198
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,740
I'm here to change your dressing.

199
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,440
Did I hurt you?

200
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,840
It's all my fault.

201
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,320
The wound must've reopened

202
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,720
when you carried me back.

203
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,120
It's fine.

204
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,530
Doesn't hurt at all.

205
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,120
Does Grandpa

206
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,840
have a suspect in mind?

207
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,500
What's he going to do next?

208
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,370
Don't worry.

209
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,400
We won't let your parents' deaths

210
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,480
go unanswered.

211
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,720
But promise me,

212
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,040
until we find the real murderer,

213
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,690
you must stay in Xijiang

214
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,760
and keep low.

215
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,320
Leave it to me.

216
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,080
Trust me.

217
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,400
Okay?

218
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,600
Really?

219
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,000
You're really coming back?

220
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,620
Why, am I not welcomed?

221
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,280
[Flip] [Blur background]
[Switch to voice call]

222
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,600
You heartless thing.

223
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,770
I've been hoping you'd hurry back.

224
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,080
The Gu family is full of danger.

225
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,960
Nothing good comes from
getting involved.

226
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,850
Since Gu Jingyuan isn't the murderer,

227
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
and I'm not after Gu's inheritance,

228
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,220
of course I'm coming back.

229
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,920
Besides, they're worried about my safety

230
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,000
and won't let me
look into my parents' case.

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,760
It's hard to do anything here.

232
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,880
I might as well
go back to Germany and dig for clues.

233
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,520
If

234
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,440
the German police find anything,

235
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,500
tell me right away.

236
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,360
Okay.

237
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,360
But

238
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,240
would your grandpa let you go so easily?

239
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,450
I'm worried too.

240
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,360
How can I convince Grandpa

241
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,890
to let me go back to Germany?

242
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,280
Yan,

243
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,960
you're drowning that plant.

244
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,760
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,480
What's on your mind?

246
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,800
Uncle.

247
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,680
Hmm?

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,530
I want to go back to Germany.

249
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,640
Germany?

250
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,200
Shh.

251
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,610
Keep it down.

252
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,690
Don't let Grandpa hear you.

253
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,440
Don't worry.

254
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,680
Dad won't agree.

255
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,440
I know he won't.

256
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,240
So...

257
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,820
I wonder

258
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,920
could you help me

259
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,400
talk to him?

260
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,200
The thing is, I also believe

261
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,320
you should stay.

262
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,240
Uncle,

263
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,880
have you ever had a dream?

264
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,640
Yes.

265
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,960
What dream?

266
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,250
Has it come true?

267
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,930
I'm not telling you.

268
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,520
Cheapskate.

269
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,800
My dream

270
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,360
is to play the violin.

271
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,140
So I don't want to give up my study.

272
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,960
Besides,

273
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,080
you're the one who told me

274
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,680
to live on and move forward.

275
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,520
That's why I want to go back to study.

276
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,520
I thought

277
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,500
you'd understand me best in this family.

278
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,640
Violin?

279
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,119
Xijiang Normal University also

280
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,200
has a violin major.

281
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,000
It's not the same.

282
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,760
Why not?

283
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,920
If it doesn't work,

284
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,319
I can hire your German

285
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,359
professor here.

286
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,800
You're exaggerating.

287
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,980
Gu's Group is capable of that.

288
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,880
Fine, big boss.

289
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,119
But...

290
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,440
I mean,

291
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,000
it's not necessary.

292
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,080
You sure

293
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,010
this is really about study?

294
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,480
Yes.

295
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,720
I just want my simple,

296
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,080
ordinary life back.

297
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,160
The house here is big,

298
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,360
and you and Grandpa treat me well,

299
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
but

300
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,240
sometimes

301
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,540
it still feels like

302
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,600
this place doesn't belong to me.

303
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,480
I see.

304
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,840
You agree?

305
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,480
Well,

306
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,320
I can try to persuade Dad for you.

307
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,240
You're the best!

308
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,400
Yan.

309
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,360
Don't celebrate yet.

310
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,720
I said I'll try,

311
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,760
not promise.

312
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,040
With Mr. Gu on my side,

313
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,560
it's as good as done.

314
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,450
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

315
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,680
I've learned your skills.

316
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,640
Just let bygones

317
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,480
be bygones.

318
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,810
Besides,

319
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,680
family don't

320
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,440
hold grudges.

321
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,720
Yue.

322
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,240
Yes.

323
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,360
Your bread soup is getting better.

324
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,160
It tastes exactly
the same as what I had in Germany.

325
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,120
I'm glad you like it.

326
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
This sausage too.

327
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,680
Exactly the same flavor as

328
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,410
German ones.

329
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,760
Yeah, I've been making it

330
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,760
for almost a month now.

331
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,320
Practice

332
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,800
makes perfect.

333
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,640
I've been back from Germany for a month.

334
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,980
It's good, Dad.

335
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,640
Mmm.

336
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,840
Grandpa,

337
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,400
I have something to tell you.

338
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,640
Well,

339
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,320
I have something to tell you too.

340
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,440
Oh.

341
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,200
Well,

342
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,010
Grandpa, you first.

343
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,410
I invited the principal of
Xijiang Business University

344
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,000
to discuss

345
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,440
about your transfer.

346
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,640
I...

347
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,320
Grandpa,

348
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,040
I studied violin in Germany.

349
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,610
Why should I transfer to business school?

350
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,240
Can you take over Gu's

351
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,400
by playing the violin?

352
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,320
You need to learn

353
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,240
business skills.

354
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,290
I never thought about
taking over Gu's Group.

355
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
My dream's always

356
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,180
been to be a violinist.

357
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,780
The only reason I agreed to take over Gu's

358
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,800
was because

359
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,050
I misunderstood Uncle.

360
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,360
Now

361
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,760
the misunderstanding was cleared up.

362
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,290
I should go back to Germany
and keep studying.

363
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,080
No.

364
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,360
I can agree to anything else,

365
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,920
but not this one.

366
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,720
You and Uncle are
more than enough for Gu 's.

367
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,120
I don't know business.

368
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,400
I can't even read a balance sheet.

369
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,860
If you hand me the company,

370
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,760
I'd probably run it

371
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,290
into the ground in two days.

372
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,600
You brat,

373
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,480
what did you say?

374
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,040
Dad, Dad.

375
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,760
Dad.

376
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,080
Dad, calm down.

377
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,760
Calm down.

378
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I think

379
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,560
we should respect Yan's choice.

380
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,530
Don't worry.

381
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
I've arranged everything in Germany.

382
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,400
When Yan goes back,

383
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
she'll be well looked after.

384
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,000
So,

385
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,600
you want Yan to give up on our company?

386
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,720
I just want her

387
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,920
to do what she loves.

388
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,800
She's still young.

389
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,640
Even if you want her to take over,

390
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,760
it can wait until after she graduates.

391
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,320
Yan's safest

392
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,760
by my side.

393
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,880
But you... you're
sending her back to Germany.

394
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,520
What if I never

395
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,080
see her again?

396
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,120
Grandpa,

397
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,160
I asked Uncle to speak for me.

398
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,720
Stop blaming him.

399
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,320
If you care about me,

400
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,320
just forget about it!

401
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,120
Grandpa,

402
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,140
is that how you drove Dad away too?

403
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,360
You...

404
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,840
-Dad.
-What did you say?

405
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,120
Dad.

406
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,640
Dad, calm down.

407
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,130
If Brother were still here,

408
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,040
he'd want his daughter

409
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,640
to study what she likes,

410
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,120
do what she loves,

411
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,810
and live the life she wants.

412
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,120
Please agree to her,

413
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,040
for Brother's sake.

414
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,160
Fine.

415
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,800
If you

416
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,960
care so much about your brother

417
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
and Yan,

418
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,480
you should give up the company

419
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,420
and take care of her yourself.

420
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,200
Grandpa, you mean

421
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,090
I should be wary of Uncle

422
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,380
stealing Gu's from me?

423
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Silly girl.

424
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,680
You finally understand?

425
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,760
Wait,

426
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,690
Grandpa,

427
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,320
I only joined the company

428
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,920
to investigate him.

429
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,600
I never wanted

430
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
to inherit it.

431
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,520
You're my granddaughter—

432
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,240
you carry the Gu name.

433
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
If Gu's Group isn't yours, whose is it?

434
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,400
My surname is Qiao.

435
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,640
Yan,

436
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,240
you have to understand me.

437
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
If Jingyuan had no selfish motives,

438
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,880
he'd hand over the company

439
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,200
and go with you.

440
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,240
If he hesitates,

441
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
it means what he thinks

442
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
is different from what he said.

443
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,560
Grandpa,

444
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:41,920
but...

445
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,760
Yan,

446
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,920
you're

447
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,040
too naive.

448
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,760
The one thing

449
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
you can't trust in this world

450
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,370
is people's hearts.

451
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,080
Grandpa,

452
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Uncle is our family.

453
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,720
He's my adopted son—

454
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,280
not Gu blood.

455
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,040
Didn't you suspect that

456
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,560
he killed your father

457
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,080
for the company?

458
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,160
What?

459
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,760
You're going back
to Germany with Qiao Yan?

460
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,160
Even if you want to
stop your dad's worries,

461
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,400
do you have to do this?

462
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,280
Yuan,

463
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,820
you should know

464
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,260
once you give up power,

465
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,780
it's not easy to take back.

466
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,560
Being president

467
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,100
of Gu's Group is not that important to me.

468
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,080
You should know me

469
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,210
better than anyone.

470
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,360
Wan,

471
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,960
title or no title,

472
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,600
I'm still me.

473
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,680
But...

474
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,210
The hardest times are over.

475
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,840
I once promised

476
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,880
I'd get you out of the welfare house,

477
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,000
and I have.

478
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,320
Wan,

479
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,490
I'm not that ambitious.

480
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,560
Yuan,

481
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,760
I just

482
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,160
don't want you to be wronged.

483
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,800
I'm not wronged.

484
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,440
And I've made up my mind.

485
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,340
Let's not talk about this.

486
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,880
Uncle.

487
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,360
Yan.

488
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,410
Why are you still up so late?

489
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,840
What took you so long?

490
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,560
How much did you drink?

491
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,520
No.

492
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,480
I just drank a little.

493
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,120
If you lie, your nose will grow.

494
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,480
I'm not lying.

495
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,680
Why would I lie to you?

496
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,200
Uncle,

497
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,240
are you in a bad mood?

498
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,600
No.

499
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,560
Why would I be in a bad mood?

500
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,840
I'm happy.

501
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,280
Happy?

502
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,080
Happy enough to drink this much?

503
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,810
If Grandpa sees this, he'll...

504
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,840
Yan?

505
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,100
Is that you?

506
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,040
Oh no. We woke Grandpa up.

507
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,440
Weird.

508
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,440
I clearly heard something.

509
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,960
I...

510
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,120
Shh.

511
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,400
Must've been dreaming.
