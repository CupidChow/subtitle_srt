[Episode 3]

3
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello, Mr. Gu.

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,350
Feng.

5
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,000
[Gu Group]

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,320
Why are you here today?

7
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,400
Yan has been back for a long time.

8
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,740
I'll show her around today

9
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,920
to learn some things.

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,120
Oh.

11
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,320
That's great.

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,680
Yan.

13
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,810
Mr. Chen is one of the

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,180
founding members of the company.

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,600
He has been with me for over 30 years.

16
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm too old

17
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,320
to run the company anymore.

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,440
Unlike him,

19
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,880
he's energetic every day.

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,960
Oh.

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,720
Feng, you are the one

22
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,479
who trained Mr. Gu so well.

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,440
Of course you can enjoy your life.

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,840
Yan.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,420
I'll show you around the company.

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,520
Let your grandpa rest first.

27
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,050
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,760
I'll definitely learn well.

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,840
Yan.

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,970
Have some water.

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,490
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,120
I know

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
Feng wants to

34
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,680
hand over the company to you.

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,480
But

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,280
are you ready to face it?

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,440
Are you saying I might

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,370
not be experienced enough?

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,000
It's okay.

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,090
I'll learn well.

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,120
Hey.

42
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,000
Silly girl.

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:41,880
You

44
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,240
are too naive.

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,160
I'm talking about that uncle of yours

46
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,920
who is not related by blood.

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,600
Uncle?

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,900
What's wrong with him?

49
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,340
The business world is a battlefield.

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,760
I'm worried that

51
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,080
in the future,

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,200
he won't want to hand over the company.

53
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,720
My uncle has indeed

54
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,920
made great contributions to the Gu's.

55
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,840
But after all,

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,520
Gu's Group belongs to my grandfather.

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,880
As long as my grandfather is here,

58
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,280
I'm not afraid of anything.

59
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,720
Fine.

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,160
In the future,

61
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,040
I'll give you my full support.

62
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,530
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

63
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,240
If you have no questions,

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,040
that's all for today's meeting.

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,130
Don't dismiss the meeting yet.

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,440
Let me introduce someone to you.

67
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,280
This is

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,170
Chairman Gu's granddaughter.

69
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,920
The future heir of Gu's.

70
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,440
Hello, I’m Qiao Yan.

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,300
Welcome. Welcome.

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,770
What are you doing here?

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,520
Uncle,

74
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,300
I'm not here for you today.

75
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,160
Yan is here for work.

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,800
Everyone,

77
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,360
I recommend

78
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,960
Miss Qiao Yan to join the group

79
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
and lead the company's operations.

80
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,920
I hope to have your support

81
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,120
in the future.

82
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,180
I wonder what Miss Qiao

83
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,440
[Gu Group]

84
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,840
majored in while abroad.

85
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,159
What exact duties

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,850
will you be in charge of now?

87
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,600
I just came back from abroad.

88
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,860
I really know nothing.

89
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,400
I have to start from the beginning.

90
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,600
I wonder if Miss Qiao is willing to start

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,930
from the bottom, working in sales?

92
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,250
Director Lu,

93
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,010
this is inappropriate.

94
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,330
If Miss Qiao Yan joins the company,

95
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,700
she should at least

96
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,690
start as Executive President.

97
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,840
Back in the day, Mr. Gu

98
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,680
started from the bottom
across different departments

99
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,420
and earned his position step by step.

100
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,880
[Gu Group]

101
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,940
If Miss Qiao is given special favors,

102
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
how will shareholders and partners

103
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
think of Gu's Group

104
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,640
and Chairman Gu?

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,840
You’re right.

106
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,400
So, I'm not here

107
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,280
to cause trouble for anyone.

108
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,340
I really hope you can give me a chance.

109
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Since I'm going to inherit the Gu's,

110
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,160
I need to be

111
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,760
a qualified heir.

112
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,960
[Gu Group]

113
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,159
Yan is right.

114
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,210
Chairman Gu.

115
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,050
Chairman Gu.

116
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,080
Feng.

117
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,159
[Gu Group]

118
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,680
Dad.

119
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
Have a seat.

120
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,920
Sit.

121
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,720
I heard what you said just now.

122
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,280
I understand.

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,880
As for whether Qiao Yan

124
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,400
is fit to be the Executive President,

125
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,360
how about

126
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,800
we have a vote by show of hands?

127
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,320
I agree.

128
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,100
Over half are in favor.

129
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,180
The motion passes.

130
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,300
Congratulations.

131
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you, Uncle.

132
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,040
I don't get it.

133
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,560
I really don't get it.

134
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,720
Finally.

135
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,560
So many.

136
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,560
Ah.

137
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,400
Well,

138
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,720
don't worry.

139
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,600
Going through the past three years' report

140
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,440
thoroughly

141
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,850
will take quite a while.

142
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,280
Besides, Mr. Chen said

143
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,360
if you have any questions,

144
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,290
just let me know.

145
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,900
Thank you, Director Wang.

146
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,080
Miss Qiao.

147
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
You don't have to.

148
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm an employee of Gu's Group.

149
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,200
I'm willing to help you.

150
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,760
I...

151
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,409
This is what I should do.

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,659
Director Wang,

153
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,720
I think you're right.

154
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,940
It's just financial reports.

155
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Give me some time.

156
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,340
It won't take long.

157
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,120
Three days.

158
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,200
I can handle it.

159
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,940
What are you doing?

160
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,370
You slammed the door pretty hard,
didn't you?

161
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,360
Now you're scared.

162
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,080
Yes.

163
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,410
I'm afraid of the ugliness of human nature

164
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,650
that hides in this grand house.

165
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,690
I'm fear that kindness and love

166
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,929
can't overcome a wicked heart.

167
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,100
What I fear most is that

168
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,159
neither law nor karma

169
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,679
will punish the evil people.

170
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,240
Qiao Yan,

171
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,980
the Gu's Group is more complex
than you imagine.

172
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,100
It's not too late for you to leave now.

173
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,250
Thank you for reminding me.

174
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,920
But I won't stop.

175
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
Because I'm ready to pay
whatever it takes.

176
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,630
[General Account Information]
[Gu Jingyuan]

177
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,800
This is Gu Jingyuan's account information

178
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,440
and his transfer record.

179
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,480
Yes.

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
In the past year,

181
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,460
he transfers money

182
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,850
to an overseas account every now and then.

183
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,760
It seems like he's secretly

184
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,490
transferring company assets.

185
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,980
But the amounts aren't significant.

186
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,000
This is just

187
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,970
the tips of the iceberg.

188
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,820
Are you showing me this

189
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,680
to get my help against Gu Jingyuan,

190
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,160
or

191
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
is someone else behind you?

192
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,920
My purpose is not important.

193
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,640
We have the same target.

194
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,090
Have you ever suspected

But I don't know

577
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,680
if the Old Mr. Gu arranged it.

578
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,960
It doesn't matter.

579
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,020
No matter who it is,

580
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,000
when Yan is done with her competition,

581
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,240
we'll leave Germany tomorrow.

582
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,680
Okay.

583
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,480
Be careful.

584
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,280
At that time...

585
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,880
I'm sorry.

586
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,520
I followed him

587
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
to your school.

588
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,080
I saw you playing the violin.

589
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,970
Brother didn't want you to know
about Gu's Group,

590
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
so I had to pretend I didn't know you.

591
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,660
That person was asking around about you.

592
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,520
When the accident happened,

593
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,840
he was also at the scene.

594
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,400
Dad.

595
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,000
Dad.

596
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,680
Later,

597
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,620
he attacked you

598
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,440
and stole your model.

599
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,090
I was protecting you in secret,

600
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,240
yet I was still one step behind.

601
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,770
Qiao Yan.

602
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,440
Qiao Yan.

603
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,480
Dad suddenly got sick.

604
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,320
The company was in a mess,

605
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,140
so I had to come back to solve everything.

606
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,440
I figured that

607
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,890
after he got better,

608
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,180
I'd head to Germany and bring you back

609
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,260
once I wrapped up everything.

610
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,410
I didn't realize

611
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,820
it would lead to a misunderstanding.

612
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,050
Why didn't you explain it to me sooner?

613
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,320
At first, you were very guarded.

614
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,400
I was afraid that even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

615
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,600
I was even more afraid

616
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,100
that you had been targeted by the killer.

617
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,060
So I wanted to find out the truth
before telling you.

618
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,740
My position in Gu's Group is awkward.

619
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,940
Many people want to make money

620
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,410
while you come back.

621
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,320
I don't care what happens to me.

622
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,160
But I can't let ill-intentioned people

623
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,220
stay in Gu's Group,

624
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,380
or remain close to you and Dad.

625
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,280
The business world is a battlefield.

626
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,080
I wanted to see if you could adapt

627
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,400
before taking over the company,

628
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,240
so I let you do whatever you want.

629
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,840
You did a good job.

630
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,250
Are you really okay with me taking away

631
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,960
all that you've worked so hard?

632
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,850
Don't you resent me?

633
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,760
In the past,

634
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,120
everything I've done

635
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,640
was to become

636
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,440
a son my father could be proud of,

637
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,760
and also

638
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,760
a qualified heir to the Gu's.

639
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,520
Now,

640
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,720
if you need me,

641
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,960
I'll always be by your side,

642
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,880
even if

643
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,920
everyone calls me the Gu family's dog.
