00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,330
So can you tell me now

5
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,460
why you suddenly decided to stay?

6
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,570

7
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,800

Liang Feng,

11
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,300
goes by "Feng."

12
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
He's already left the country,

13
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,570
headed for Xijiang.

14
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,000
The third person at the kidnapping scene

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,259
is likely tied to the one who attacked me.

16

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,320

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,720
M-my stomach hurts.

22

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,660
We should head to the airport.

Uncle,

37
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,079
do you have something to tell me?

38
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,360
Stay.

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,400
I need you.

40
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,370
Okay.

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,160
So you think

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,280
Wang He met the murderer

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,920
before he kidnapped you.

44
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:14,920
Yes.

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,400
When I met Wang He,

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,740
he didn't smoke at all.

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,040
And that kind of smoke

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,280
is only made in Germany.

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
You can't buy it here.

50
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,579
And Feng left the country.

51
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,320
Too much of a coincidence, right?

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,120
This is most likely left by Feng,

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,260
which means Wang He

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,900
must be connected to Feng.

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,420
When Wang He was arrested,

56
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
he told the police

57
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,770
he kidnapped you on impulse

58
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,640
because he needed money.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,079
He must be lying.

60
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,079
We'll know once we find Feng.

I needed the money.

196
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,800
Who paid you?

197
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,680
Tell me!

198
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,160
Who paid you?

199
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,400
I can pay you more!

200
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,720
Qiao Yan,

201
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,760
knowing too much

202
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,360
won't do you any good.

203
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,290
You're about to die,

204
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,280
go ask

205
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,680
your parents about it.

206
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,920
Let's not waste time.

207
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Die!

208
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,720
Die!

209
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,280
Die!

210
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,560
Yan. Yan.

211
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,520
Yan.

212
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,120
Yan.

213
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,520
You okay?

214
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:48,960
Uncle,

215
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,700
he admitted it.

216
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,100
He admitted

217
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,880
someone hired him

218
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,840
to kill my parents.

219
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,400
It's okay.

220
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,280
I'm glad you're okay.

221
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,760
It's okay.

222
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,640
So that's what happened, right?

223
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,080
Yan.

224
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,120
No casualties?

225
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,880
Are you okay?

226
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,980
Let me go to the hospital with you.

227
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm fine.

228
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,880
By the way,

229
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,600
why are you two together?

230
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,700
Didn't you ask him
to pick me up at the airport?

231
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,620
[Gu Group]

232
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:44,080
[Welcome Han Miao]

233
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,600
Wait,

234
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,880
you're here to pick me up?

235
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,080
You're Han Miao?

236
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,680
Why are you here so early?

237
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,720
I was just about to go.

238
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,320
The flight landed ahead of schedule.

239
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,560
Is Qiao Yan in the company?

240
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,440
I can't reach her.

241
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,370
Her phone is off.

242
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,420
She's not here.

243
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,079
Call Gu Jingyuan.

244
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,490
What are you waiting for? Call him.

245
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,760
Hello, Boss?

246
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,160
Where are you?

247
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,119
Okay.

248
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,240
Boss said Ms. Qiao might be in danger.

249
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,170
We need to head to his location now.

250
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,930
Let's go.

251
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:28,760
Wait,

252
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,560
why don't we take my car?

253
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,520
We don't have

254
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,960
time for that.

255
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,370
Are you going or not?

256
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,520
I'm going,

257
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:35,880
but...

258
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,280
Put it on if you're going.

259
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,640
Wait.

260
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,320
Where'd you get this motorcycle?

261
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,980
I rented it.

262
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,200
[Welcome Han Miao]

263
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,400
He's been roaring the whole way.

264
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,530
My ears are ringing.

265
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,920
You were riding so fast.

266
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,450
Must be going 180 km/h, huh?

267
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,720
You were racing.

268
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,240
If I didn't ride fast,

269
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,320
how'd I get here in time to save Yan

270
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,560
and your boss?

271
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,400
I...

272
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,560
Alright, stop it.

273
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,120
You've both worked hard.

274
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,970
Let's go.

275
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,080
The police said

276
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,720
they'll find Feng soon.

277
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,000
Uncle.

278
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,640
You...

279
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,600
Does your hand hurt?

280
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
Should we go to the hospital?

281
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,360
Uncle,

282
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,600
can you talk to me?

283
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,760
You didn't say a word to me all the way.

284
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,080
Can you at least say something?

285
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,210
Do you know I almost—

286
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,200
Qiao Yan, you promised me

287
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,660
you would never act alone.

288
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,280
But I couldn't help it today.

289
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,600
Feng suddenly showed up.

290
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,560
I couldn't just watch him vanish again.

291
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,120
Do you know how dangerous it was today?

292
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,640
I know.

293
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,480
If I'd been a minute later—

294
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,360
what if something happened to you?

295
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,680
I will be fine.

296
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,570
It's a bit dangerous today,

297
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,200
but look,

298
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
I'm still home now

299
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
safe and sound.

300
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,050
And no matter what happens,

301
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,040
even if the sky falls,

302
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,960
you'll be there, won't you?

303
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,600
Qiao Yan.

304
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,080
I was wrong.

305
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,240
I'm sorry.

306
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,800
Uncle,

307
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,450
forgive me just this once, please?

308
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,840
Just once?

309
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,560
I...

310
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Pack your things.

311
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,960
I'll ask Lin Ze to send you
back to Germany in a few days.

312
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,280
I'll explain to Dad.

313
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,480
What? No.

314
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,570
I'm not leaving.

315
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,320
Uncle!

316
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,290
Please, just forgive me this one time.

317
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,600
We can talk.

318
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,400
Gu Jingyuan!

319
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,080
Don't move!

320
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,080
Don't hurt Yan.

321
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,760
Don't move!

322
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,120
No! No!

323
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,160
Yan.

324
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,080
Die!

325
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,360
Yan.

326
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,440
Uncle,

327
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,640
I was wrong.

328
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm sorry.

329
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,360
You're so troublesome.

330
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,400
Not a—

331
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,680
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,080
I'm guilty. I deserve it.

333
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,160
It's my fault.

334
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,280
Never again.

335
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,200
Just give me one more chance.

336
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,120
With such a sincere apology,

337
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,720
he should forgive me, right?

338
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,000
Hi.

339
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,440
Good morning, Uncle.

340
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,120
Cheapskate.

341
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,640
Grandpa,

342
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
have more.

343
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,120
Okay.

344
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,200
Dad,

345
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,560
good morning.

346
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,570
Grandpa,

347
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,600
I want to ask you a question.

348
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,560
Well,

349
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,840
shouldn't family

350
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,480
be

351
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,080
understanding

352
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,480
and forgiving?

353
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,480
Even if they

354
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
have small disagreements,

355
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,600
or someone makes a little mistake,

356
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,560
shouldn't they still be forgiven?

357
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,410
No need to hold grudges, right?

358
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,080
Of course.

359
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,160
Why do you ask?

360
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,240
Well,

361
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,720
last night

362
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,240
I read a story.

363
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,800
The story is

364
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,960
about

365
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,160
a watermelon

366
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,200
who messed up,

367
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,640
and

368
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,320
his steamed bun family got really mad

369
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,400
and wanted

370
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,920
to kick it out.

371
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,720
After reading it,

372
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,320
I felt so sad.

373
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,040
They're family—

374
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
why not

375
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,440
just talk it out?

376
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,280
Watermelon

377
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,860
and steamed bun

378
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,880
are family?

379
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,120
No,

380
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,400
that's not the point.

381
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,930
Grandpa,

382
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,920
the point is

383
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,080
they are family now.

384
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,480
The watermelon already apologized,

385
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,760
but the steamed bun
still wouldn't forgive it.

386
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
What do you think?

387
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,060
Isn't this steamed bun

388
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,560
being way too stingy?

389
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,360
Stingy won't do—

390
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,800
to steam a bun,

391
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,280
you need plenty of steam.

392
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,400
Full steam makes it fluffy.

393
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,000
Family should

394
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,960
tolerate each other.

395
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,000
Exactly.

396
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,560
Dad,

397
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,800
I'm full.

398
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
I'm going to work.

399
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,800
Wait.

400
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,860
I'll take your car.

401
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,380
Grandpa, enjoy your meal.

402
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,160
Bye.

403
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,860
Wait for me!

404
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,900
Wait for me!

405
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,040
You...

406
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,170
Steamed bun,

407
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,080
tell me,

408
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,000
what will it take for you to forgive me?

409
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,660
Promise me

410
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,640
you'll go back to Germany.

411
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,320
No way.

412
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,400
You know,

413
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,440
we haven't caught Feng yet.

414
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,840
I can't leave now.

415
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Then I'll tell Dad

416
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,080
you're still investigating
your parents' accident—

417
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,880
and almost got yourself killed.

418
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,960
But we had a deal.

419
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,040
You promised not to tell Grandpa.

420
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,900
And you promised not to act alone,

421
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,520
to put your safety first.

422
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,490
We haven't caught Feng yet.

423
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,770
you stay home and don't wander off.

424
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,660
Visiting Han Miao doesn't

425
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,250
count as wandering, right?

426
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,420
Your phone.

427
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,550
Hey, hey, hey.

428
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,560
Give it back.

429
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,130
[Loading]

430
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:36,680
[Sharing location]

431
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,120
I can always track you.

432
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,920
If you leave my set area
for more than half an hour,

433
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,240
I'll send you straight
back to Germany.

434
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,040
That's restricting my freedom!

435
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,560
Says the person
who put a tracker in my car.

436
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,720
Never met such

437
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,920
a petty steamed bun!

438
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,960
Who can tell me?

439
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,520
Why's this man so hard to please?

440
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,560
Because you're not dealing with a man—

441
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,780
you're dealing

442
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,680
with a billionaire CEO

443
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,760
with a lethal aura.

444
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,080
I'm

445
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,320
heir to a multibillion-dollar company,

446
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,400
Ms. Qiao.

447
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,890
Ms. Qiao,

448
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,200
aren't you basically living off Mr. Gu?

449
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,040
Who are you siding with?

450
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,370
Of course I side with...

451
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,280
the truth.

452
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,960
What truth?

453
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,400
What's this?

454
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,800
Why are you living at his place

455
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,200
and using a pillow with his face on it?

456
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,860
These things are everywhere.

457
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,280
I forgot to toss them out.

458
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,520
Wei, I'll visit you next month, okay?

459
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,480
Yes, I got a raise.

460
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,920
I'll buy you the latest phone.

461
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,280
Okay?

462
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,640
Okay, no problem.

463
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,200
Jerk.

464
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,240
Stop.

465
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,600
Han Miao,

466
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,640
please answer me seriously.

467
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,900
Why are you staying at Lin Ze's place?

468
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,040
Wait.

469
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,370
Where are you going?

470
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,000
This place is so expensive.

471
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,520
Do you think I can afford it?

472
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,380
I've told them.

473
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,220
Gu's Group will pay for it.

474
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,560
I never

475
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,440
take advantage of others.

476
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,580
If you don't live here,

477
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
where do you live?

478
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,960
Help me find a short rental.

479
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,690
Is that okay?

480
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,760
Short rental?

481
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,080
What kind do you want?

482
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,920
First, clean.

483
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,320
Second, convenient.

484
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,800
Third,

485
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,300
not too expensive.

486
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,160
He needs money

487
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,460
and happens to have a room to rent.

488
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,440
I need a room

489
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,960
and I don't want to stay in a hotel.

490
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,020
And he's an employee of your company,

491
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,080
so we know him.

492
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,360
What a perfect roommate.

493
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,640
Then why don't you live with me?

494
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,480
Forget it.

495
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,000
You have

496
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,240
two bosses living with you.

497
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,860
I can't stand that.

498
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,200
Fair point.

499
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,320
Fine.

500
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,160
You came back to see me,

501
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,920
so I'll pay

502
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,920
your rent.

503
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,400
Thanks then.

504
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,680
Actually,

505
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,640
I also took some coding gigs

506
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
to explore the domestic market.

507
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,540
Thank you for letting me go back, my lady.

508
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,200
What lady? Come on.

509
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,240
I'm about to be sent back.

510
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,920
A few days ago,

511
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,360
I saw a relationship coach online.

512
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,090
He was teaching how to coax your lover.

513
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,240
Not sure

514
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,800
if it works on elders.

515
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,880
Still worth a try.

516
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,320
Tell me about it.
