88

89
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,000

we would like to represent the majority of

by the company employee,

102
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,260
I didn't expect

103
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,840
my employees

104
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,120

105

Now,

107
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
the netizens are boycotting Qin's,

108
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,240
which has led to Qin's being

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,000
overwhelmed by public scrutiny.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,130
The company not only failed in the bid,

111
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,560

seriously damaged.

What do you think about that?

The netizens' anger and boycott

114
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,159
are somewhat misplaced.

115

But

116
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
I can understand.

123
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,860
One more question.

124
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,880
Is the relationship
between Qin's and Gu's

125
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,800
really as hostile

126
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,600
as the rumors say?

127
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
How could that be?

128
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,440
This is a misunderstanding.

129
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,160
In business,

130
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,610
we are competitors.

131

But as the pillar companies of Xijiang,

132
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,290

133
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,120

calm the public opinion

After what happened at the last bidding,

153
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,800
it has a very bad impact

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,170
It's my honor

195
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,880
that Chairman Gu attends

196
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,770
such a small family gathering.

197
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,920
This is my son.

198
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,560
Ziyu.

199
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,640
He and Qiao Yan are good friends.

200
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,920
I heard the two of them

201
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,200
are working on some kind of
small indoor musical theater.

202
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,730
Qiao Yan.

203
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,250
Welcome to my house.

204
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,280
Mr. Qin.

205
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Are we done?

206
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,520
My dad's health isn't very good.

207
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,450
Let's go inside.

208
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,100
Reporters.

209
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
It's almost time.

210
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,220
Please go to the hotel for dinner.

211
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,610
Chairman Gu.

212
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,500
Please.

213
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,120
Okay.

214
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,740
Please.

215
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,000
Sit.

216
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,770
Chairman Gu,

217
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,610
I specially prepared your favorite dessert.

218
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,450
Have a taste.

219
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,720
Mr. Qin.

220
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,960
Since we've taken the photos

221
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,290
and invited the reporters,

222
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,020
I'll skip the dessert.

223
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:36,960
I

224
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,090
have something to tell you.

225
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,900
Let's talk in my study.

226
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,680
Okay.

227
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,080
Yan.

228
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,370
Wait for me here.

229
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,240
Jingyuan.

230
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,440
Follow me.

231
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,040
Okay.

232
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,840
Wait for us.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,530
Qiao Yan.

234
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,360
This cake is delicious.

235
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,490
Why don't you try it?

236
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm not hungry now.

237
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,640
By the way,

238
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,520
we have many collectible

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,960
vinyl records at home.

240
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,820
Let me show you.

241
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,490
Let's go.

242
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,040
My mother

243
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,140
also liked violin.

244
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
This vinyl record

245
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,810
was left to me by her.

246
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,720
Your mother...

247
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,570
She passed away.

248
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,560
After giving birth to me,

249
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,770
her health has never been good,

250
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,440
but she still did her best
to take care of me.

251
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,280
Sometimes I often wonder

252
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,660
would she have been healthier

253
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,960
if I hadn't been born?

254
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,120
How could you think that?

255
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,730
If your mother knew,

256
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,440
she would surely be very sad.

257
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,880
In this world,

258
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,650
she couldn't live without you.

259
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,480
I believe your mother would want you

260
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,740
to carry on living well

261
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,220
with the love she gave you.

262
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,760
For her,

263
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,120
you must be

264
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,260
the greatest gift in her life.

265
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,490
Qiao Yan,

266
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,540
you should open a psychological clinic.

267
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,880
Your business must be booming.

268
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,080
I'm not that capable.

269
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,890
I'm just telling the truth.

270
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,720
Well,

271
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,840
have you decided whether or not

272
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,570
you want to perform at my place?

273
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,440
Uh...

274
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,180
What happened?

275
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,730
Qin Ziyu.

276
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,740
Where is the bathroom?

277
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,040
In the hallway on the second floor.

278
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,800
I need to go.

279
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,240
Mr. Qin.

280
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,640
Let's get straight to the point.

281
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,360
I know

282
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,240
you've always believed

283
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,640
that your father's death

284
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,680
was related to our Gu family.

285
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
I can't stop you from thinking that.

286
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,240
But

287
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,280
it's not entirely like that.

288
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,820
I didn't expect

289
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,530
after so many years,

290
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,200
Chairman Gu still remember

291
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,520
my father who jumped off the building

292
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,840
because of Gu's debt crisis
in the securities market.

293
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,400
At that time,
we were going through a debt crisis

294
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,330
and couldn't pay
our upstream suppliers on time,

295
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,520
But we provided guaranteed compensation.

296
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,760
Your father

297
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,120
had taken out a huge loan back then,

298
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,040
which led to

299
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,010
the tragic outcome.

300
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,680
You were young

301
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,720
and hot-headed then.

302
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,840
I can understand that

303
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,460
you hated me and blamed me on this.

304
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,080
But

305
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,040
if you still can't get over

306
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,640
and only seek revenge...

307
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,100
Well...

308
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,640
I

309
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,340
feel really bad about his.

310
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Chairman Gu, you are overthinking.

311
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,840
The competition between Qin's and Gu's

312
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,000
is purely business.

313
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,250
This is also why I

314
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,040
invited you here today.

315
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,920
I hope our two families

316
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,320
can make peace.

317
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,240
So that we can cooperate

318
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,500
and develop together.

319
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,770
It looks like...

320
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,040
I think too much.

321
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,210
However,

322
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,560
a few months ago,

323
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,400
my son and daughter-in-law

324
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,290
died in an accident.

325
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,840
Now,

326
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,280
my granddaughter

327
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,520
suffered one accident after another.

328
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:20,920
I...

329
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,450
I have to overthink.

330
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,280
Also,

331
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,500
I suddenly remembered

332
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,880
Yan has a model

333
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,940
that only the Gu family could use,
and it was stolen.

334
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,480
If it's not about getting back
at the Gu family,

335
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,320
I can't see any purpose in taking it.

336
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,580
What's the use of this?

337
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,340
Mr. Qin.

338
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
What do you think?

339
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,810
Qiao Yan.

340
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,610
Qiao Yan!

341
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,680
Qiao Yan!

342
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,410
Qiao Yan!

343
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Weird.

344
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,490
Where did she go?

345
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,540
[Yu]

346
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,120
Yu.

347
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:49,810
[Yu]

348
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,480
This looks like tools mom used.

349
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,160
Mom.

350
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,760
Yes?

351
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,040
The weather is really nice outside.

352
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,600
Do you want to go out for a walk?

353
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,120
Sure.

354
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,970
Let me finish the last few strokes.

355
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,660
It's so beautiful.

356
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,880
Mom.

357
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,640
You're indeed my favorite artist.

358
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
You're so sweet.

359
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,080
Ta-da.

360
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,520
So pretty.

361
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,720
Take the hair clip made for you
by your number one fan.

362
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,580
Put it on for me.

363
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,880
I made this myself, Mom.

364
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,360
Amazing.

365
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,080
Is it pretty?

366
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,560
Yes.

367
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,960
Thank you, Yan.

368
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,540
Why are mom's paintbrushes here?

369
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,960
I'm feel deeply sorry

370
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
for what the Gu family has suffered.

371
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,480
But

372
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,020
you asked the wrong person, Chairman Gu.

373
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,000
I really don't know.

374
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:56,880
Okay.

375
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,170
Sorry to bother you.

376
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
I'll be going now.

377
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,120
Please forgive me
for not being a better host.

378
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,050
I'll see you off.

379
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,340
Please.

380
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,440
Hey, Ziyu.

381
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,370
What are you doing here?

382
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
Where is Qiao Yan?

383
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,440
She said she went to the bathroom.

384
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,240
I don't know where she went.

385
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,160
Maybe she went to the garden.

386
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,180
Go find her.

387
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,960
Excuse me.

388
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,500
I have something to do.

389
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,690
I'll leave you to it.

390
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,520
Okay.

391
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,400
Wait.

392
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,640
Jingyuan.

393
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,400
What...

394
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,420
What happened?

395
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,100
I'm really sorry, Mr. Qin.

396
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,840
Your vase looks so beautiful.

397
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,240
I accidentally slipped.

398
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,240
But don't worry.

399
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,760
I will compensate you
according to the price.

400
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,360
Forget it.

401
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,000
It's nothing valuable.

402
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,440
Mr. Gu,

403
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,850
you'd better be careful in the future.

404
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,120
It is, after all, someone else's property.

405
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,720
Of course.

406
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,250
Qiao Yan.

407
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,850
Where have you been?

408
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,440
I was bored,

409
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,680
so I came out for a walk

410
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,880
to get some fresh air.

411
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,640
I'm just worried

412
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,160
you might accidentally enter
my dad's art studio.

413
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,820
He doesn't let just anyone in.

414
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,880
I didn't expect your dad to have

415
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,640
this kind of interest, an art studio.

416
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,100
Let's not talk about this.

417
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,040
Let's go back.

418
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,810
Your family is waiting for you.

419
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,890
Let's go.

420
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:43,840
Dad.

421
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,410
Why did they leave so early?

422
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,290
What were you talking about

423
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,880
with Qiao Yan’s grandpa?

424
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,410
Where did you find Qiao Yan?

425
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,400
In the garden.

426
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,360
Why did she go to the garden?

427
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
She said she was bored

428
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,760
so she wanted to get some fresh air.

429
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,820
What's wrong, Dad?

430
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:08,920
Nothing.

431
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,400
Yan.

432
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,800
Yan.

433
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,160
What happened?

434
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,280
I think I found the murderer.

435
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,600
It’s Qin Mian.

436
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,000
He killed my parents

437
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,080
Gu Hai's wife.

438
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,120
Yuling.

439
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
Now, you're with me forever.

440
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,290
I gave that hair clip

441
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
to my mom as a birthday gift.

442
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,080
I made it myself.

443
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,240
There can't be another exactly like this

444
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,760
in the whole world.

445
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,620
If he wasn't the murderer,

446
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,400
how would he have gotten that hair clip?

447
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,080
[Yu]

448
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,140
I also saw my mother's paintbrushes.

449
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,360
Each paintbrush

450
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,880
had my mom's name on it.

451
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,040
Tell me,

452
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,840
how can I catch Qin Mian?

453
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,560
How can I catch the murderer?

454
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:54,880
Yan.

455
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,400
Yan.

456
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,400
Calm down.

457
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,560
Qin Mian is dangerous.

458
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Let’s calm down

459
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,860
and think about it.

460
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,120
Don't act strange.

461
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,980
I'm afraid he'll hurt you.

462
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,400
Okay?

463
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,840
Okay.

464
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,120
It's okay.

465
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,920
It's okay.

466
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,760
I never should have let you go,

467
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,810
and given Gu Hai the chance to take advantage.

468
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,560
Yuling.

469
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,240
Don't blame me.
