[Fall in You]

00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,510
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,520
I heard that

4
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Mr. Qin doesn’t like his wife at all.

5
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,690
Mr. Song passed away early.

6
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,479
His only daughter

7
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,520
inherited all the property.

8
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,160
For the family business,

9
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,720
they have to act.

10
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,100
Let me tell you.

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,479
He doesn't allow anyone into a room.

12
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,880
It's where he keeps
his old lover's paintings.

13
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,560
Oh my god.

14
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,560
He is still holding on to past love.

15
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,600
Of course.

16
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,640
I love Yuling.

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,560
She's the only woman I've ever loved

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,289
The only woman I've ever loved.

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,050
The only woman I've ever loved.

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,490
Qin Ziyu.

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,900
What are you doing?

22
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,320
Huh?

23
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,039
Who let you in?

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,600
What's wrong?

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
I told you before,

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,210
without my permission,

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,840
no one can enter this room.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,900
What are you doing?

29
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Ziyu is still young.

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
He didn't mean it.

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,120
I don't want bad people's stuff

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,840
in my house.

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,050
I want to burn it!

35
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,960
I want to burn it!

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,420
Stop it.

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,200
You...

38
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,200
Let go!

39
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,840
You can't hit my son!

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,520
Mom!

41
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,320
Mom!

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,440
Dad.

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,560
Have you truly

44
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,520
never loved my mom?

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,800
What about me?

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,640
What about me?

47
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,800
My son, Ziyu.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
If anything happens to me,

49
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,010
I'll leave the Qin's to you.

50
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,170
I've done many wrong things in my life,

51
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,920
but you'll always be my beloved son.

52
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,079
Dad.

53
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
Have you ever truly loved me?

54
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:51,960
Yan.

55
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,680
It's time to take your medicine.

56
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,760
Again?

57
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:58,940
Be good.

58
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,220
Get up and take your medicine.

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
You just recovered. You need more rest.

60
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,860
You keep me cooped up in my room

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,399
and don't even let me go out.

62
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,680
So I just get Grandpa

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,730
to keep me company and chat  with me.

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,079
Jingyuan.

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,340
Have a seat.

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:23,920
I...

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,400
Do you remember how we used to chat here

68
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,640
all the time when you were little?

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,240
Of course.

70
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,680
I really liked

71
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,820
chatting with you.

72
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,760
I can't believe

73
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,440
you've all grown up.

74
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,010
All these years,

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,240
you've been putting all your effort

76
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,480
into the company.

77
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,040
Thank you.

78
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,000
Dad.

79
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,740
It's the least I can do.

80
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,159
Qin Mian has been arrested.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,840
Gu's Group

82
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,640
developing steadily

83
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,960
and doing well.

84
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,000
It's time you started thinking about

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,240
marriage, too.

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,760
Dad.

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,100
The new project has just started.

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,130
I am not planning on that right now.

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
Both marriage and career

90
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,610
are very important.

91
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,760
Mr. He of He's Group admires you.

92
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,480
His daughter He Yue

93
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,640
seems to like you.

94
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,600
I've seen her before.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,530
She's pretty and generous.

96
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,400
If

97
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,200
the He and Gu families become in-laws,

98
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,320
it would benefit you,

99
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,120
the project,

100
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,840
and the Gu's Group

101
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
as a whole.

102
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,760
Dad, but now I...

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,640
But what?

104
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,200
Could it be...

105
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,370
you've fallen for someone
and didn't tell me?

106
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,920
I...

107
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,440
No.

108
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,680
Okay.

109
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,920
It's a deal.

110
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,880
Later,

111
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,480
I'll invite them here

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,640
as soon as possible.

113
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm not feeling well.

114
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,300
What's the matter?

115
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,159
Are you really going on a blind date
with He Yue?

116
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,280
That's dad's decision.

117
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,440
What's your decision?

118
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,800
It's late. Go back to sleep.

119
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,400
Answer me.

120
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,520
Answer me! Answer me!

121
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,380
-Answer me.
-I won't marry He Yue.

122
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,330
I know you don't like He Yue.

123
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,240
I'll find you a young sister-in-law

124
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,970
who can get along well with you.

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,330
Don't worry.

126
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,120
You...

127
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:17,860
I...

128
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,240
Yan.

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,930
Are you feeling better?

130
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,540
Do you care about me so much

131
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,300
just because you are my uncle?

132
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,010
Gu Jingyuan,

133
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,450
let me ask you this time.

134
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,640
Do you understand what I said to you

135
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,520
at the backstage that day?

136
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,040

This is Mr. He.

193
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,160
Hello, Mr. He.

194
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,920
Hello, Yan.

195
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,850
Chairman Gu,

196
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,520
you are so lucky.

197
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,400
Look at your granddaughter.

198
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,120
She's beautiful and smart.

199
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,200
So is Yue.

200
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,640
Whenever I think about

201
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,770
her being my future daughter-in-law,

202
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,840
I feel so...

203
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,890
Grandpa.

204
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,460
Where is uncle?

205
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,200
He...

206
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,460
I really like that car.

207
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,380
What about you?

208
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,560
Yan.

209
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
You just woke up?

210
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
We have been out for a long time.

211
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,680
He's usually so busy at work,

212
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,600
but he still makes time to be with me.

213
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,060
I almost feel bad about it.

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,520
Miss He,

215
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,200
since you come here, you are a guest.

216
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,530
This is what I should do.

217
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,080
Hey.

218
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,240
Yes.

219
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,160
Well said.

220
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,280
Maybe

221
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,760
we'll be family someday.

222
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,480
Hey.

223
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,080
I’d love to.

224
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,410
Chairman Gu.

225
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,240
The food is ready.

226
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,080
Let's eat.

227
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,760
Jingyuan.

228
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,440
Mr. He.

229
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,000
Miss He, please.

230
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,320
Yan.

231
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,800
Yan!

232
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,610
Grandpa.

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,600
Let's eat.

234
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,200
I-I'm not hungry.

235
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm not going to eat.

236
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,400
Come on.

237
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,640
Yue made all your favorite dishes.

238
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,440
You should eat more.

239
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,020
It's good for your health.

240
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,730
Besides,

241
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
this is your future sister-in-law.

242
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,080
Right?

243
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
You should watch out for your uncle.

244
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,010
Let's go.

245
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,760
Let's go.

246
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,840
Come on.

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,660
Have a seat.

248
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,360
Mr. He.

249
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,880
Welcome

250
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,520
to our house.

251
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,080
Thank you.

252
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,120
Cheers.

253
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,620
Come on.

254
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,160
Eat.

255
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,640
Yue.

256
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,050
Okay.

257
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,570
I've always admired

258
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,680
Jingyuan.

259
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,120
He is exactly like you

260
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
when you were young.

261
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,960
Oh, no, not at all.

262
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,000
Jingyuan.

263
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,600
Yes.

264
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Congratulations

265
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,880
on securing that piece of land
in the East District.

266
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,480
That place

267
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
is truly a gem.

268
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,840
Thank you, Mr. He.

269
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,200
I didn't do it alone.

270
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,520
That's the result of the efforts of

271
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,320
all the employees throughout the company.

272
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,680
Okay.

273
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,880
In the future,

274
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,800
if you need support in terms of finances

275
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,560
or anything else,

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,960
just let me know.

277
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,080
He's Group

278
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,050
will do our best to help.

279
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,450
Then, I'll thank you

280
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,400
for Jingyuan.

281
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:00,760
Here.

282
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,720
Yue.

283
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,400
Is the food delicious?

284
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,290
It's delicious.

285
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,000
These shrimp are especially much tastier

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,040
than those made by the aunt at our house.

287
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,840
If you like it,

288
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,800
just come often.

289
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,130
Okay?

290
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,080
I'm telling the truth.

291
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,810
Chairman Gu.

292
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,080
How about I start calling you

293
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,210
Uncle Gu from now on?

294
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,280
Of course.

295
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,520
We're going to become family.

296
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,580
Just call me uncle.

297
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,000
Okay, Uncle Gu.

298
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,960
In the future,

299
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,400
I'll come often to eat with you.

300
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I'd really be happy

301
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,060
if you all came to keep my company.

302
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,320
Jingyuan.

303
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,250
Peel the shrimp for Yue.

304
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,120
Okay.

305
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,760
Mr. He,

306
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,740
there aren't many girls nowadays

307
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
as mature and understanding

308
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,880
as Yue.

309
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,800
Yan

310
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
is quite mature and understanding.

311
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,800
But...

312
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,250
she is a bit quiet

313
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,120
and shy.

314
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,840
I'm not shy.

315
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,840
Don't talk while eating or sleeping.

316
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,040
Talking while eating

317
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,700
can make you choke.

318
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,280
My granddaughter is

319
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,440
spoiled by me.

320
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,960
It's okay.

321
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,760
Yan.

322
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,240
You're in your twenties.

323
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,300
There must be many boys pursuing you.

324
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,400
No.

325
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,260
Uh...Chairman Gu.

326
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,120
I remember

327
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,600
the youngest son of the Chen family

328
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,460
is pretty good.

329
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,840
Oh?

330
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,050
He is a musician.

331
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,520
He and Yan will go really well together.

332
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,780
I don't like musician.

333
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,360
Oh.

334
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,490
What kind of boy do you like?

335
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,560
Tell me.

336
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,380
I'll watch out for you.

337
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,920
The boy I like

338
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
doesn't say much.

339
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,660
He seems cold and distant.

340
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,240
He looks fierce.

341
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,970
He always looks serious

342
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,720
and

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,120
unapproachable.

344
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,000
He is very sneaky

345
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,600
and a bit sharp-tongued too.

346
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,180
Even though he's not that young anymore,

347
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,280
he can still be childish sometimes.

348
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,280
But deep down,

349
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,330
he's actually very soft-hearted.

350
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
He remembers every responsibility

351
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,460
and promise

352
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,480
in his heart.

353
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,280
Whenever I need him,

354
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,300
he would show up immediately.

355
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,120
He always

356
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,560
shows everyone

357
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,839
his strongest side.

358
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,960
But no one knows

359
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,619
how much sadness he hides inside.

360
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,369
No matter how many grievances he suffers,

361
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,130
he never speaks of them.

362
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,000
For the people he cares about,

363
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,840
even if he's insulted

364
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,220
or misunderstood,

365
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,060
he won't say a word in defense.

366
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,180
He just quietly keeps giving his all.

367
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,800
Well...

368
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,000
It's quite specific.

369
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,720
Well...

370
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,040
Jingyuan.

371
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,530
Where's the shrimp you peeled for Yue?

372
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,000
Look at

373
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,570
how much Uncle Jingyuan

374
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,970
cares for his niece.

375
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,320
Of course.

376
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,840
In the future,

377
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,800
if He Yue marries into the Gu family,

378
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,400
she'll be her sister-in-law.

379
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,200
In the future,

380
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,440
take good care of Yan.

381
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,200
Of course.

382
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,690
I'm full.

383
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,410
Enjoy your meal.

384
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,520
Jingyuan.

385
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,560
Yan

386
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,240
is in good hands with Sister Yue.

387
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,800
Today,

388
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,520
you must accompany

389
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,120
my future daughter-in-law.

390
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,770
Here.

391
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,800
Let's drink.

392
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,840
Jingyuan.

393
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,600
Qiao Yan is acting weird today.

394
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,180
She sometimes throws a little tantrums,

395
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,500
but it passes quickly.

396
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,800
I heard that Qiao Yan

397
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,280
grew up abroad

398
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,400
and just came back recently.

399
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,240
She and Uncle Gu

400
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,600
are not that close, are they?

401
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,450
Qiao Yan is very important to both of
me and my dad.

402
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Of course.

403
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,640
After all,

404
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,900
she is Uncle Gu's granddaughter.

405
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,880
And you're her uncle.

406
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,020
You are all family, after all.

407
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,640
Jingyuan.

408
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,940
Do you believe in love?

409
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,000
In our circle,

410
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,610
alliance might be a more accurate term

411
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,890
than just marriage.

412
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,480
For us,

413
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,080
getting married is really just about

414
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,880
facilitating cooperation
between two families.

415
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,520
That's why

416
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,000
I never believed in love.

417
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
Miss He must have plenty of options,

418
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,040
so don't waste time on me.

419
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,520
Marrying someone suitable for an alliance

420
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,760
doesn't mean you have to marry someone

421
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,960
you don't like for the sake of benefits.

422
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,080
I really like you.

423
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:03,960
Sorry.

424
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,680
I don't.

425
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,680
Why?

426
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,080
If you marry me,

427
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,410
everything in the He family will be yours.

428
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,340
These are not important to me.

429
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,240
What matters is,

430
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,440
you'll no longer have to live under
the Gu family's shadow,

431
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,880
and no one will ever call you

432
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,340
the Gu family's dog again.

433
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,090
If I can protect the Gu family forever,

434
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,340
I don't mind being called a dog at all.

435
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,560
Are you crazy?

436
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,440
You’d rather be a dog?

437
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,480
So you did fall for Qiao Yan, didn't you?

438
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,440
Wake up.

439
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
She's your niece.

440
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,060
Old Mr. Gu won't agree.

441
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,880
Sorry.

442
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,610
Mind your own business.

443
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,360
Excuse me.

444
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,490
Bastard!

445
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,200
Uncle marrying his niece.

446
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,920
Shameless!

447
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:38,780
Dad.

448
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,370
Let's go.

449
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,600
Dad.

450
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,600
Yan.

451
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,570
Gu Jingyuan.

452
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,640
Is this how you take care of my daughter?

453
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,300
You don't deserve to be
a member of the Gu family.

454
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:55,850
Brother.

455
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,160
I...

456
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,280
Yan!

457
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,560
Yan.

458
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,240
Yan.

459
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,240
Yan!

460
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,200
Yan.

461
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,120
Yan.

462
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,000
Yan.

463
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,560
Hey, Yan.

464
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,600
Let's eat.

465
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,860
Morning, Grandpa.

466
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,920
Let's eat.

467
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,520
Your uncle

468
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,160
went to the office early in the morning.

469
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,240
Oh.

470
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,180
Hey.

471
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,840
Yan.

472
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,720
I

473
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,920
have some good news to tell you.

474
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,520
What is it?

475
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
I agree to let you go back to Germany.

476
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,380
I've thought about it.

477
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,000
I want to support you

478
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,640
like your dad.

479
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,040
So

480
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,000
I want to go back to Germany with you.

481
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,320
What?

482
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,660
You are not happy about it?

483
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,680
No.

484
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,360
Grandpa.

485
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,920
About this...

486
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,280
Can I think about it?

487
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:55,920
Yan.

488
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,800
Don't blame me.

489
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,600
I will never allow you

490
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,280
to be with Jingyuan.

491
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,560
Dad, I can't marry He Yue.

492
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,640
I have someone I like.

493
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
-Shut up.
-She...

494
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,690
You'd better keep something to yourself.

495
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,080
Don't say it out loud.

496
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,960
It's wrong if you say it out loud.

497
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,050
You're Mr. Gu from the company.

498
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,240
Tens of thousands of eyes are
watching you.

499
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,570
You must be responsible for
the reputation of the Gu family.

500
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,180
Come in.

501
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,360
Boss.

502
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,240
Gu's and He's Group are about to

503
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,680
hold a strategic partnership
signing ceremony.

504
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,410
At that time,

505
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,650
they will announce
your engagement with Miss He.

506
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,280
Hey, have you heard about it?

507
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,000
Mr. Gu

508
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,840
is getting engaged
to the daughter of He family.

509
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,200
What?

510
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,810
What about Director Lu?

511
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,920
I thought

512
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,920
she’d become Mrs. Gu sooner or later.

513
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,000
What a pity.

514
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,960
Do you really think

515
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,200
marrying into a rich family is that easy?

516
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,800
Gu's Group depends on Mr. Gu.

517
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,360
Chairman Gu must find him

518
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,800
a suitable partner.

519
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,360
Hey.

520
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,680
We know nothing about

521
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
those wealthy families.

522
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,210
Let's go.

523
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:24,890
Let's go.

524
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,120
He Yue.

525
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,880
There's no way
Yuan would like a woman like her?

526
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,720
As long as I'm around,

527
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,040
Gu Changfeng, don't even think about

528
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,440
using him in this matter.

529
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,960
Are you still shopping with me tomorrow?

530
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,440
Sure.

531
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,740
How did it go today?

532
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,040
Are you happy?

533
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,560
Yes.

534
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,530
As long as you're happy.

535
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,810
[Shopping Center B]

536
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,400
Yan.

537
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,850
You've been dragging me out

538
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,810
for walks late into the night
these past few days,

539
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,760
but

540
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,320
you've never

541
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,120
smiled once.

542
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,540
Come on.

543
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,480
What will it take for you to smile?

544
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,760
How about

545
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,570
we go to the karaoke?

546
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,440
Then...

547
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,280
Bars?

548
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,660
I'm not in the mood.

549
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,080
Mr. Gu

550
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,680
is really a coward.

551
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,080
I'll tell him for you.

552
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
No.

553
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,840
Listen.

554
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,400
I've tried everything.

555
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,600
I think

556
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,450
he just doesn't like me.

557
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,120
What a drunkard.

558
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,440
Qin Ziyu?

559
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:54,960
Done.

560
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,080
Let me know
when it's time to change the IV.

561
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,010
Okay, thank you.

562
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,200
Moderate alcohol intoxication.

563
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,360
Luckily, he met us.

564
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,420
Otherwise, what should he do?

565
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,520
But I guess he's fine.

566
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,600
Should I

567
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,360
contact his family?

568
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,480
He has no family.

569
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:24,960
Miao.

570
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,040
Go back first.

571
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,440
I'll stay here.

572
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,170
What?

573
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,010
I'll accompany you.

574
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,960
You've been with me for days.

575
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
You must be tired.

576
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:33,880
Go back.

577
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,010
Besides,

578
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,320
I want to talk to him

579
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
after he wakes up.

580
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,370
Don't you blame him?

581
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,260
No matter what,

582
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,920
I think

583
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,040
he shouldn't have ended up like this.

584
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,400
Fine.

585
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,560
Be careful.

586
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,450
I'm leaving.

587
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,320
Dad.

588
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,600
I'm sorry.

589
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,520
I...

590
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,440
I miss you.

591
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,280
Don't go.

592
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,040
Oh.

593
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,560
You're finally back.

594
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,320
Here, let me help you.

595
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,680
Where have you been

596
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,280
with Miss Qiao Yan all night?

597
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,040
What are you doing?

598
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,370
What?

599
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,720
You are the landlord,

600
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,020
not a dorm supervisor.

601
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,240
I'm not asking.

602
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,240
It's Mr. Gu.

603
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,480
Tell me.

604
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,500
Otherwise, it's hard to explain.

605
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,240
Fine.

606
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,440
Miss Qiao Yan

607
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,480
is in love.

608
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,640
In love?

609
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,320
Really?

610
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,460
With who? And When?

611
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,930
She's in love...

612
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,310
[Boss, Miss Qiao Yan is in love!]

613
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,760
Boss.

614
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,640
Miss Qiao Yan is in love.

615
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,700
[Boss, Miss Qiao Yan is in love!]

616
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,720
Sorry,

617
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,000
the number you dialed

618
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,520
is temporarily unavailable.

619
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,850
Please try again later.

620
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,280
Sorry,

621
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,560
the number you dialed

622
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,080
is temporarily unavailable.

623
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,200
Please try again later.
