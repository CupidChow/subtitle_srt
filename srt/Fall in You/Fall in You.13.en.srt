[Episode 13]

3
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,240
You're awake.

4
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,370
Did you smell it?

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,930
It's really you.

6
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,840
What?

7
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,940
Do you think you're dreaming?

8
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,330
Do you remember?

9
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,880
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,320
Thank you.

11
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,060
Hey.

12
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,720
I'll accept your thank you.

13
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,180
Forget about the apology.

14
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,729
Then,

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,810
will you still be my friend?

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,720
No.

17
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,280
Okay.

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,440
But

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,500
if there is a chance in the future,

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,940
maybe we can get to know each other again.

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,850
Qin Ziyu.

22
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,919
You used to tell me that

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,210
your dad is your dad,

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,780
and you are you.

25
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,700
Now I hope you can think like that too.

26
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,480
Start a new life

27
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,410
and live up to yourself.

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,329
Alright.

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,200
I've finished what I want to say.

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,840
Bye.

31
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,640
Oh, right.

32
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
The wontons are still nice and hot.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,860
You have to eat.

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,360
Also,

35
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,010
don't drink so much from now on.

36
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,530
Where did you go?

37
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,700
What are you doing?

38
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,920
What are you doing here so early?

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,520
Aren't you going to explain?

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
Explain what?

41
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:16,920
Hey.

42
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,540
What are you doing?

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,000
You stayed out all night.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,460
Don’t you need to explain?

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,280
I stayed at Han Miao’s.

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,160
Qiao Yan.

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,960
You said it yourself.

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,090
Lying will make your nose grow longer.

49
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,480
Did you wait for me all night?

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,400
Are you angry?

51
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,280
Shouldn't I be angry?

52
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,360
You stayed out all night.

53
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,640
Lin Ze told me you were in a relationship.

54
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
I don't know where

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,200
and who you are dating.

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,240
You didn't answer my call.

57
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,840
Do you know how worried I was?

58
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
Then why are you worried about me?

59
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,210
Because I...

60
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,850
Because I'm your uncle.

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,440
I promised dad

62
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,900
to ensure your safety.

63
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,920
I should really thank you.

64
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,080
Uncle.

65
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,000
But I'm not a child anymore.

66
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,640
I don't need an elder

67
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,690
to care so much about me.

68
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
If there's nothing else,

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,700
I'll go back to my room.

70
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,640
Uncle.

71
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,440
Who is it?

72
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,000
Will Hotel.

73
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,320
W201.

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,290
You mean you have something for me?

75
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:30,980
Come in.

76
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,240
Oh.

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,730
I used to drink this,

78
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,010
but not anymore.

79
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,600
Oh.

80
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,400
Why do you stay in a hotel?

81
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,060
Because

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,159
I don't want anyone from the company
to find me.

83
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,560
What are you giving me?

84
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,580
Wait for me.

85
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,560
Oh.

86
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,800
Actually,

87
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,220
I wanted to give it to you long ago.

88
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,700
But I didn't have the courage
to contact you.

89
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
This is my mom's favorite painting.

90
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,280
I saw it

91
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
go from an idea to a finished product

92
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,320
over the course of three months.

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,200
Now,

94
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,010
it can be returned to its owner.

95
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,370
Take it back.

96
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,890
Is it because this is my dad's collection,

97
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,820
so you don't want to accept it?

98
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,640
No.

99
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,240
My mom and I

100
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,780
don't need to be connected by a painting.

101
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,760
Mom is a painter.

102
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,040
Her works

103
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,640
should be out there in the market

104
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,250
being collected

105
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
and appreciated.

106
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:10,960
So,

107
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,120
take it back.

108
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,170
Okay.

109
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,050
Qiao Yan,

110
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,210
I’m going abroad

111
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,720
to deal with some financial problems soon.

112
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,900
I'm done being lost and confused.

113
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,210
Please trust me.

114
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,480
Qin's.

115
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,320
I'll take it back.

116
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,290
Okay.

117
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:34,920
Then...

118
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,900
I wish you success.

119
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,680
Thank you.

120
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,250
Okay.

121
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,610
Qiao Yan.

122
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,920
Yes?

123
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,120
Can I hug you?

124
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,200
Ah?

125
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,560
Thank you.

126
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,340
Wait for me.

127
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,460
There's something

128
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,720
I must tell you.

129
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,880
Qin Ziyu.

130
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,500
What do you want to say?

131
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,170
Qiao Yan?

132
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
Uncle?

133
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,770
Did you misunderstand?

134
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,500
Let go of me!

135
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,410
Gu Jingyuan.

136
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,280
You...

137
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,340
Let go of me!

138
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,080
It hurts.

139
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
Are you going to date Qin Ziyu?

140
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,800
What are you thinking about?

141
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,200
Who is dating Qin Ziyu...

142
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,640
I can date

143
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
whoever I like.

144
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
It’s none of your business.

145
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,880
He's Qin Mian's son.

146
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,450
How can you do this to your parents?

147
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,140
Or you just want to take revenge on me?

148
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,370
Qiao Yan.

149
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,880
Can you stop being so childish?

150
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm not childish.

151
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,120
I'm not taking revenge on you.

152
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,800
-What you’re talking about?
-Qiao Yan.

153
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,530
Gu Jingyuan.

154
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Since you have made your choice,

155
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,600
can you stop acting in a way

156
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,260
that makes me misunderstand?

157
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,720
Yan.

158
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,960
I won't marry He Yue.

159
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,040
I will solve this matter.

160
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,880
But even without He Yue,

161
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,680
there will be Zhang Yue,
Wang Yue, or Li Yue.

162
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,380
Don't worry about me anymore.

163
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,170
I'm not a child anymore.

164
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,840
When you get married,

165
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
I'll get married.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Why are you getting married?

167
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,880
Who are you marrying?

168
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,440
I can marry whoever I want.

169
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
I think Qin Ziyu is good.

170
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Just go looking for a partner.

171
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,440
I won't say a word.

172
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,860
From now on,

173
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,400
we're done.

174
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,820
Say that again.

175
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,960
I said

176
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,930
we're done.

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,600
♪ That will remain forever unchanged ♪

195
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,400
Why?

196
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,920
Why Qiao Yan?

197
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,040
Why Qiao Yan?

198
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,360
Yuan

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
abandoned me.

200
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Yuan,

201
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,800
why did you abandon me?

202
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,360
Why?

203
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,820
We're almost home.

204
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:53,960
Yes.

205
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,860
One more round.

206
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,440
Okay.

207
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,210
Let's go.

208
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,480
Time flies.

209
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,780
In a blink of an eye,

210
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,800
we've experienced

211
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
so many things.

212
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,640
Yes.

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,930
Our relationship has changed too.

214
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,400
Yes.

215
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,010
I still remember

216
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,680
the time you first came home.

217
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,480
At that time,

218
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,800
I thought of you as an enemy.

219
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,640
Yes.

220
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,680
Like a poor kitten.

221
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,490
Your claws are amazing.

222
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,360
Hey.

223
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,880
Let me ask you.

224
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,160
Yes.

225
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,740
When did you...

226
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,360
fall in love

227
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,160
with me?

228
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,010
I don't know.

229
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:01,970
What?

230
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,380
Haven't you thought about it?

231
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,640
Then,

232
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,800
when did you know

233
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,560
you like me?

234
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,560
Come on.

235
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,600
Tell me.

236
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,540
Do you know the answer now?

237
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,600
Yes.

238
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,560
Miss Qiao.

239
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,580
Sister Yue.

240
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,120
Miss Qiao.

241
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,720
What are you

242
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,760
doing?

243
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,280
Oh, I got a bit of sand in my eye.

244
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,440
Yan blow the sand off for me.

245
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:21,840
Oh.

246
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,880
Oh.

247
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,600
Oh.

248
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,720
I thought

249
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,760
Miss Qiao brought her boyfriend back.

250
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,080
Oh.

251
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,520
I just bought some vegetables.

252
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,600
I'll go back and cook.

253
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,930
Come back and eat later.

254
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,200
Okay.

255
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,010
Goodbye.

256
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,640
Goodbye, Sister Yue.

257
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,920
I'll wait for you to come back for dinner.

258
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,480
Okay.

259
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,960
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,960
Was I too strong just now?

261
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,880
Are you hurt?

262
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,290
Does it hurt?

263
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,840
Oh.

264
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,400
What's wrong?

265
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,800
What's wrong?

266
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,520
My hand.

267
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,920
What happened to your hand?

268
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,480
My hand.

269
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,360
I hurt my hand.

270
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,840
Your hand.

271
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,360
Where did you poke your hand?

272
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,690
My...

273
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,290
-My palm.
-Does it hurt?

274
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,800
Where did you hurt?

275
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:13,960
Ouch!

276
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,680
It hurts.

277
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,480
Ouch!

278
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,450
It hurts.

279
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,500
Seriously?

280
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,720
You pushed me.

281
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,839
Okay.

282
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,920
Let me blow on your wound.

283
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:26,760
Okay.

284
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,140
Does it still hurt?

285
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,420
Does it still hurt?

286
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,120
Yan.

287
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,820
Are you asleep?

288
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,440
Yan.

289
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,050
Are you in your room?

290
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:22,960
Yan.

291
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,680
Here.

292
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,290
Hurry up.

293
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,460
Yan! What's wrong?

294
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,840
Yan.

295
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,360
What's wrong?

296
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,080
Yan!

297
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,680
Open the door!

298
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,010
Grandpa.

299
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,800
It's too much trouble for you

300
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,600
to bring me fruit.

301
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,920
Why didn't you ask Sister Yue to do it?

302
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,850
Am I not welcome?

303
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,280
Welcome.

304
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,000
Dad.

305
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,000
Hey.

306
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,420
What are you

307
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,000
doing?

308
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:50,960
Oh.

309
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,840
Why didn't you open the door?

310
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,240
Uh,

311
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,480
I was playing Uncle

312
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,890
the song my dad recorded for me.

313
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,010
Oh, it's over there.

314
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Yan is still young

315
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,640
and immature.

316
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,480
You're an elder.

317
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,840
Uncle sneaked into his niece's room

318
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,880
and locked the door.

319
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,720
If this gets out,

320
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,840
people will laugh at us.

321
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,370
Grandpa.

322
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,080
Uncle and I

323
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,360
share a bond that's unbreakable.

324
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,720
Just a family moment, chatting together.

325
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,400
He is your elder.

326
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,960
You are also my elder.

327
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,880
But he entered your room.

328
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,580
Then you...

329
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,800
I...

330
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,520
This is for your own good.

331
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,440
Yan.

332
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,320
Yes?

333
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,720
When you

334
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,260
have a sister-in-law,

335
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,620
you can't stick with your uncle anymore.

336
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,960
Dad.

337
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
Sister Yue told me

338
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,600
you two came back together.

339
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,370
Where did you go?

340
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,120
Uh...

341
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,760
We went to...

342
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,040
Uh.

343
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,200
We met

344
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,240
on our way back.

345
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,000
We didn't come back together.

346
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,480
Right?

347
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,320
Uncle.

348
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,280
Yes?

349
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,720
I just got off work.

350
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,200
Okay.

351
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,800
All right.

352
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,740
It's getting late.

353
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,720
Yan.

354
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,970
Sleep early.

355
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:13,920
Jingyuan.

356
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,640
Dad.

357
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,960
Rest early.

358
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,040
Okay.

359
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,970
Thank you, Grandpa.

360
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,540
Good night.

361
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,660
Good night.

362
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,020
Are you asleep?

363
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,040
Not yet.

364
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,760
What's wrong?

365
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,160
Can't sleep?

366
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,080
A little.

367
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,720
I feel surreal.

368
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,320
I'm afraid that
everything will change when I wake up.

369
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,910
[The other party is inputting…]

370
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,760
Why are you here?

371
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,740
What if grandpa finds out?

372
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,360
I'll wait for a right time

373
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,680
to explain to him.

374
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,850
Don't worry.

375
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,120
Okay.

376
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm relieved.

377
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,480
Well,

378
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
maybe this is

379
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,880
a little

380
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,200
too fast?

381
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,500
What are you thinking?

382
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,140
I'm just afraid you can't sleep well.

383
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,490
I came to accompany you,

384
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,690
so that you can sleep comfortably.

385
00:23:59,560 --> 00:23:59,840
Oh.

386
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,680
Oh.

387
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,700
Good night.

388
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,420
Good night.

389
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,690
You want to give up Gu's shares forever

390
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,280
just to not marry He Yue?

391
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,680
Not just He Yue.

392
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:33,840
Dad,

393
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,320
I hope you can let me

394
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,720
choose the person I love.

395
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,780
What do you think Gu's shares are?

396
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,370
Is it a bargaining chip?

397
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,160
Do you still respect me?

398
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,080
Dad.

399
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,890
Dad, I didn't mean that.

400
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,930
I don't want to marry He Yue.

401
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,240
I like Qiao Yan.

402
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,880
Stop it.

403
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,930
Mind your own business.

404
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,600
I'll deal with

405
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,760
Yan.

406
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,320
Dad.

407
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,440
Yan and I really love each other.

408
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,560
You can beat me or scold me.

409
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
But I beg you,

410
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,200
don't take Yan away from me, okay?

411
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Say it again!

412
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,280
Say it again!

413
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,120
Your brother and sister-in-law

414
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,780
are watching you from heaven.

415
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,480
What?

416
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,800
Can’t say it?

417
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,120
Yuan,

418
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,170
you are not a child anymore.

419
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,740
Have you thought about it?

420
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,640
Once this matter is exposed,

421
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,770
what will Yan

422
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,880
face,

423
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,320
and endure?

424
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,680
I will protect her.

425
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,800
I will face it with her.

426
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,440
As long as she is happy

427
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,200
and joyful,

428
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm willing to give everything I have.

429
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,960
The public's judgment

430
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,360
goes on and on.

431
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,580
Those under the spotlight

432
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,610
can feel completely overwhelmed.

433
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,000
Can you really guarantee that Yan

434
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,200
won't get hurt?

435
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,360
Jingyuan.

436
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm doing this for your own good.

437
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,520
Tomorrow,

438
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,880
at the signing ceremony with He family,

439
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,360
I will announce

440
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,600
your marriage with He Yue.

441
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,440
Don't be late.

442
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,970
Grandpa.

443
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,440
Why aren't you two come for breakfast?

444
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,120
I almost ate them all by myself.

445
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,560
Yan.

446
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,200
Follow me to the study.

447
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,800
I have something to tell you.

448
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,480
Oh.

449
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,050
Grandpa.

450
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,580
Why do you suddenly want me
to change my surname?

451
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,180
You're my granddaughter.

452
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,040
How can you a Qiao?

453
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,970
You'll be seen as a laughingstock.

454
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,640
But...

455
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,080
Does it really matter

456
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,480
how outsiders see us?

457
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,560
My name was given by my dad.

458
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,080
He wanted me to have my mom's last name.

459
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,960
You know that.

460
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,120
And you promised me

461
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,480
you won't let me change my name.

462
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,680
I did promise you.

463
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,240
But after all,

464
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,760
rumors are fearful.

465
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,760
Grandpa.

466
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,600
Yan.

467
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,970
Listen to me.

468
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,520
I can't promise you this.

469
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,320
I love my parents.

470
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,890
I want to respect all their decisions.

471
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,560
They gave me this name.

472
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
I won't change it.

473
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,680
Okay.

474
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,740
We'll discuss this

475
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,840
later.

476
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,280
How have you been thinking about me

477
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,170
going back to Germany with you for school?

478
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,520
Uh...

479
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:11,960
I...

480
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,280
I...

481
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,480
I don't want to

482
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,400
go back for now.

483
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,680
Grandpa.

484
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,320
You're old,

485
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,800
and your health is not good.

486
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,760
After you go to a new environment,

487
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,840
you will not only need to adjust

488
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,200
but also have to take care of me.

489
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,800
I'm afraid

490
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,760
your body can't take it.

491
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,400
Okay.

492
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,080
Fine.

493
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:35,960
Well,

494
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,170
this afternoon,

495
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,000
I'll go shopping with you.

496
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,780
How's that?

497
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,760
Let's buy some new clothes

498
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,200
for you.

499
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,040
Thank you, Grandpa.

500
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,880
Grandpa is the best.

501
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,040
Don't mention it.

502
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,000
I have to make my precious granddaughter

503
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,520
look pretty and lovely.

504
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,160
Later,

505
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,940
you are going to attend

506
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,240
the signing ceremony with me.

507
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,200
Yes.

508
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,760
Good.

509
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,600
It's about time to

510
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,240
make your uncle's marriage public.
