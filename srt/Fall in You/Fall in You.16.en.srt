00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,200
Hello?

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,330
Hello, Miao.

7
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,650
Gu Jingyuan is taking a shower.

8
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,800
What should I do?

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,600
You don't have to be so nervous.

10
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,920
Have you never

11
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
heard about how others
spend their wedding night?

12
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,960
After he's done,

13
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,360
you go in and take a shower.

14
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,720
Okay.

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,040
No, no.

16
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,570
How can I do that?

17
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:04,840
And

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,120
my heart is beating really fast.

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
What should I do?

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,720
How about...

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,580
How about this?

22
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,640
I pretend I'm asleep now?

23
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
You can't.

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,160
It's your wedding night.

25
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,040
Hey.

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,690
Go get some wine.

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
Alcohol makes a coward bold.

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,720
Oh.

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,640
Alcohol makes a coward bold.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,680
No.

31
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,880
Who's a coward?

32
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,040
Don't underestimate me.

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay.

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,720
The bridal chamber decorated by Yue

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,680
is so tacky.

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,120
I can't help complaining about it.

37
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,360
Come on.

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,480
Go get some wine.

39
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,340
What are you doing?

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,210
I'm just curious

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,050
about my boss's wedding night.

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,280
Pervert!

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,560
I'm curious about my boss's wedding night.

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,160
How does it make me a pervert?

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,040
I'm afraid he has no experience.

46
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,920
Yes.

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,330
He's not as experienced as you.

48
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,720
But

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,600
we don't need to worry too much.

50
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,160
He's not that inexperienced.

51
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,000
The other day in the office,

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,530
I saw he and Miss Qiao Yan...

53
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,500
What happened in the office that day?

54
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,840
Say it!

55
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
That day, I saw...

56
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,240
What?

57
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,780
He and Miss Qiao Yan...

58
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,410
I won't tell you!

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,930
Pervert!

60
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,960
Hello, Mei.

61
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,610
I missed you too.

62
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,480
Humph.

63
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,210
It was Wenwen last time.

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,240

We're finally married.

69
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,400
You're here.

70
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,050
Wait, you...

71
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,720
Why did you drink so much?

72
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,320

73
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,440

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,080
Yes.

77
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm very happy.

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,400
Let's drink again.

79
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,960
Hey, you...

80
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Stop drinking.

81
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,880
You're drunk.

82
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,480
I'm not.

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Let me tell you,

84
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,560
I can

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,640
drink really much.

86
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,800
Nothing but alcohol

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,840
flows in my veins.

88
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,680
All right.

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,240
Stop it.

90
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,440
I'll get you some water.

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,770
What?

92
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,720
Don't go.

93
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,090
Where are you going?

94
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,280
Look.

95
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,490
You usually wear very much.

96
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,040
I didn't know you had such a good figure.

97
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,880
Stop it.

98
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,160
No.

99
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,200
I can't touch my husband?

100
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,570
But you have to wait until you sober up.

101
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,570
What did you say?

102
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,840

No, the sentence after it.

106
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,440
You have a good figure
and I want to touch it.

107
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,280
Whose figure?

108
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,040
My uncle's.

109
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,640
What?

110
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,400
Never call me Uncle again.

118
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,980
dangerous or difficult it is to do so.

119

as long as you want it,

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,130
I'll bring it to you.

122

I want...

123
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,400

126
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,520
Why are you in my room?

127
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,680
I should be asking you that.

128
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:11,960
Oh.

129
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,560
Right.

130
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,080
We're married.

131
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,320
Yes.

132
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,960
Do you still remember

133
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,680
what happened

134
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,100
last night?

135
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,000
I need to use the bathroom.

136
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,400
Wash your face and sober up.

137
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,700
I'll get you some honey water.

138
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm not drunk.

139
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,240

You usually wear very much.

142

I didn't know you had such a good figure.

143
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,200
Stop it.

144
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,480
I'm not.

145
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,520
I can't touch my husband?

146
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
I want...

147
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
I want...

148
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
I...

149
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,080
What?

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,400
What did I do

151
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,520
on my wedding night?

152
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,410
Well.

153
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,160
It's okay.

154
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,370
Yeah.

155
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,040
Morning, Goddess of Alcohol.

156
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,850
Are you feeling better?

157
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,460
Have some honey water.

158
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,880
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,040
Last night,

160
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,800
I did drink too much.

161
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,880
Can you tell me

162
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,280
why you drank so much last night?

163
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,760
Slow down.

164
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,450
Han Miao told me to do it.

165
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,560
She said

166
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,840
alcohol makes a coward bold.

167
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,680
So she asked me to drink more.

168
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,560
Alcohol makes a coward bold?

169
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,200
Stop laughing.

170
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm already so embarrassed.

171
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,220
Fine, I'll stop laughing.

172
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
But how will you make up for

173
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,480
our terrible wedding night?

174
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,960
You got up so late.

175
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,810
Breakfast is ready.

176
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,620
Go downstairs and eat.

177
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,460
Why didn't you lock the door
after you poured water?

178
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,930
Good morning, Grandpa.

179
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,060
Good morning, Dad.

180
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,900
Are you going to

181
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,640
keep calling me that?

182
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,200
How about I call you Dad

183
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
as Jingyuan does?

184
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
What do you think?

185
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,620
I'm willing to be your grandson-in-law.

186
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,040
Okay.

187
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,600
Okay.

188
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,440
You two

189
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
call me the way you used to.

190
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,090
Okay.

191
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
Now, let's eat.

192
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,800
Ice water.

193
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,410
Goddess.

194
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,940
You need to take good care
of your stomach today.

195
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,320
Are you worried about my stomach

196
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,780
or are you worried that
I'm feeling so unwell

197
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,720
that I can't make it up to you?

198
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,560
Hey.

199
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,680
Why are you blushing?

200
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,720
Yan, stop it.

201
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,260
Stop it.

202
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,060
Why are you so cute?

203
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,880
Find a proper occasion
to show your intimacy.

204
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,240
Okay?

205
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,560
Although I'm old,

206
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,760
I've

207
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,720
never been a third wheel.

208
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,080
You

209
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
took away my son.

210
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,360
You

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,600
took away my granddaughter.

212
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,920
Now,

213
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,200
I'm all alone.

214
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,320
Humph.

215
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,880
Grandpa.

216
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,120
Are you jealous?

217
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,640
No.

218
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,080
Grandpa, you should think this way:

219
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,440
well,

220
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,360
I

221
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
brought you

222
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,290
a grandson-in-law;

223
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,640
he

224
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,240
brought you

225
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,400
a daughter-in-law.

226
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,320
This is called

227
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,890
"Don't let outsiders
take advantage of you."

228
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,290
You're really a sweet-talker.

229
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,200
Well said.

230
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,560
All right.

231
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,360
Let's eat now.

232
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,210
Okay.

233
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,740
By the way, Dad,

234
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,380
I want to discuss something with you.

235
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,760
Since I've given up

236
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,600
being the adopted son of the Gu family,

237
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,200
I think

238
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,760
I have to go to the company

239
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,360
and resign from my position.

240
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,160
What?

241
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,680
Are you worried people at the company

242
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,880
will gossip about us?

243
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,200
Yes.

244
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,120
I can't let

245
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,250
my family and the Gu's Group

246
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,280
be gossiped about because of me.

247
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,380
I've been thinking these days

248
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,320
that though Yan joined the company

249
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,050
not long ago,

250
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,880
she's smart and capable.

251
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,120
I can help her

252
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,010
with managing the company.

253
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,120
Slow down.

254
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,570
What's the rush?

255
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,680
No.

256
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,080
How am I capable of managing the company?

257
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Why can't you?

258
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,880
You are so capable

259
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,600
and smart.

260
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,280
What makes you think so?

261
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,360
I can't even read a balance sheet.

262
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,820
I can teach you how to do it.

263
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,520
We had a deal before we got married.

264
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,360
You make money and I spend it,

265
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,680
right?

266
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,080
Well.

267
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,520
Why should I take over the company?

268
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,680
Hey, Yan.

269
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,200
I...

270
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,200
Jingyuan.

271
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
I won't interfere

272
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,650
in you two's business anymore.

273
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,400
In the future,

274
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,720
I'll

275
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,720
just exercise

276
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
and keep fit

277
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,859
so that I can be expecting your child.

278
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,970
After getting married,

279
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,300
you're grown-ups now.

280
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,720
You can discuss to
decide everything yourselves.

281
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,050
Okay?

282
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,480
Now,

283
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,880
let's eat.

284
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,480
Let's eat.

285
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,960
Why do you think

286
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,880
Qiao Yan

287
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,360
called us in this big office?

288
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,010
Is she preparing to take over the company?

289
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,760
Miss Qiao Yan is still young,

290
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,120
and has never done any business.

291
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
After all,

292
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,920
compared to Mr. Gu, she's outdone.

293
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,680
If Chairman Gu retires,

294
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,240
and Mr. Gu leaves the Gu's Group,

295
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
what should we do?

296
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,120
Then we'll have no leader.

297
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,160
What should we do?

298
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,960
Yeah.

299
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,120
Sorry, everyone,

300
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,650
I'm late.

301
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,680
I gather you here today

302
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,680
to tell you

303
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,080
about the recent changes
of the Gu's Group.

304
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,210
and at the same time,

305
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,940
to clarify rumors of me
taking over the company.

306
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,360
I know you're all worried

307
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,520
that Mr. Gu will leave the Gu's Group.

308
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,040
Here,

309
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,680
I can promise you

310
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,940
that Mr. Gu's position

311
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,160
won't change.

312
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,260
Although Mr. Gu

313
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,050
gave up being
the adopted son of the Gu family,

314
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
he's my husband

315
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,600
and he's still a member of the Gu family.

316
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,080
I'll focus on taking care
of my grandpa at home.

317
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,860
From now on,

318
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,880
Mr. Gu and you guys

319
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,520
will forge ahead with

320
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,450
developing the Gu's Group.

321
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,330
As the heiress to Chairman Gu's position,

322
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,680
Qiao Yan will make best use of time

323
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,480
to learn the business of the company.

324
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,960
I hope you'll join me

325
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,480
to fully support her.

326
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,760
Of course.

327
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,240
The Gu's Group

328
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,840
will be better and better

329
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,520
with you two.

330
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,300
I'll give my full support.

331
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,840
We support you!

332
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,900
We all support you.

333
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,670
[Choose]

334
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,360
[Han Miao]

335
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,940
Don't drink too much today.
Remember what to do!

336
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,880
Don't worry.

337
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,920
I'm waiting for Jingyuan.
We'll do it together.

338
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,650
So romantic.

339
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,280
Wish you a happy, romantic wedding night.

340
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,560
Enjoy it.

341
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,360
Still busy?

342
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,000
[I'll be home late. Go to bed first.]

343
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'll be back soon.

344
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,100
Go to bed first.

345
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,660
I'll be right back.

346
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,640
Can we talk?

347
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,780
It'll only take a few minutes.

348
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,520
I won't take you much time.

349
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,900
You'll meet your newlywed wife soon.

350
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,780
Have a seat.

351
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,400
No need.

352
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,660
This is for you.

353
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,820
I haven't officially congratulated you
on your marriage.

354
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,880
Thank you.

355
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,760
At least,

356
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,080
you look happy.

357
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
So I don't regret

358
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,920
for not taking you away from her.

359
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,540
By the way, one more thing.

360
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,850
Qin Ziyu likes Qiao Yan.

361
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
He asked me to help make you break up.

362
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,290
Director Lu.

363
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,960
Qin Ziyu.

364
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,370
It's boring to drink alone.

365
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,200
Let me drink with you.

366
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,920
I don't think we're close enough

367
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,980
to drink together.

368
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,880
Looks like

369
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,200
today's wedding

370
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
not only got me heartbroken.

371
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,560
Why are you heartbroken?

372
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,760
Do you

373
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,000
like Qiao Yan?

374
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,480
Of course.

375
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,600
Lunatic.

376
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Your dad killed Qiao Yan's parents.

377
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,520
So what?

378
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,600
I won't give up

379
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,080
the woman I love.

380
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,210
Can you stand seeing

381
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Gu Jingyuan be taken away by others?

382
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,140
What are you trying to say?

383
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,810
I don't like your beating around the bush.

384
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,880
We have the same goal.

385
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,880
So,

386
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,640
we can cooperate.

387
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,560
Anyway,

388
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,200
be careful.

389
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,920
Thank you.

390
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,080
Can you give me a hug?

391
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,480
I...

392
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,240
Don't get me wrong.

393
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,680
I just...

394
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,840
One day,

395
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,680
you will find your Mr. Right.

396
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,540
I'm here to take you...

397
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,330
Home.

398
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,680
Don't be jealous.

399
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,200
I'm just here to congratulate

400
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,560
Yuan on his marriage.

401
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,920
I even gave him a gift.

402
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,560
Here it is.

403
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,280
Well.

404
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,200
Why would Yan be jealous?

405
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,900
Why did you come in person?

406
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,400
Mm?

407
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,440
I missed you.

408
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,160
I missed you too.

409
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,440
Okay.

410
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,040
If you want to be intimate,

411
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,080
go home first.

412
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,160
Think about me.

413
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,880
I don't want to see this.

414
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,280
Bye.

415
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,120
You...

416
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:55,970
Well.

417
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,640
Yan.

418
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,720
Yan!
