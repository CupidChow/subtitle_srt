00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,180
I've always wanted to ask you a question.

196
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,930
Why do you keep calling me scum?

197
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,960
What makes you think I am scum?

198
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,080
You date Wenwen and Mei at the same time.

199
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,210
Only scum does that.

200
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,240
Well.

201
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,440
They are my...

202
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:55,760

Hey.

207
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,410
Hey, what are you doing?

208
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,000
Just go.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,600
Hurry up!

210

211
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,810
Qin Ziyu, calm down!

212
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,240
Calm down.

213

Gu Jingyuan.

214
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,940
Leave Luo Qian here

215
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,940
and I'll not hurt Qiao Yan.

216
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,440
Qin Ziyu, let me tell you,

217
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,800
it's illegal to detain a patient.

218
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
Call the police then.

219
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
When the police come,

220
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,200
the reporters will come too, right?

221
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,000
I'd like to see

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,960
what shocking news they can get.

226
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,180
Look at Ms. Luo.

227
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,720
Mom.

228
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,680
Mom, what's wrong?

229
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,140
Ms. Luo.

230
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,960
She has a brain tumor.

231
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,050
She must take her medicine in time.

232
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,240
Mom.

233
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,280
Mom.

Qiao Yan.

235
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,980
Do you still take his side?

236
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,440
Fine.

237
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,560
I'll show you

238
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,280
what kind of person he is.

Qiao Yan and Luo Qian.

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,330
You can only choose one.

242
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,720
Now pick.

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,440

245
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
What should we do?

246
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,920
Lin Ze.

247
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,320
Let's go to the hospital first.

248
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,760
Okay.

249
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,410
Gu Jingyuan,

250
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,640
how could you leave Yan here?

251
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,310
Get her into the car.

253
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,010
Hurry up.

254
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,840
Gu Jingyuan!

255
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,280
What?

256
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,570
Han Miao, calm down.

257
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,690
Gu Jingyuan.

258
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,400
We have to save Yan first.

259
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,280
Don't be impulsive.

260
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,010
Gu Jingyuan!

261
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,280
Gu Jingyuan!

[Xin Yu Sanatorium]

263
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,080
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,120
I did that

265
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
to let you see

266
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,580
what the real Gu Jingyuan is like.

267
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,720
Did he

268
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,100
say anything to you

269
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,240
about my dad and Luo Qian?

270
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Is there anything else I don't know?

271
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,440
No.

272
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,540
I'm just wondering

273
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,420
why you still divorced him

274
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,720
after you chose to help him.

275
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,480
Actually,

276
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,280
I don't care

277
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,360
whose son he is.

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,260
But he didn't trust me.

279
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,560
He hid everything from me.

280
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,040
He didn't let me face it with him
and handle it with him.

281
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,850
Then tell me,

282
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,580
what's the meaning

283
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,920
of such a marriage?

284
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,300
Besides...

285
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,840
I didn't expect

286
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,400
he would do this to me.

287
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,080
Both you and your grandfather
were fooled by him.

288
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,480
He has been disguising himself.

289
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,600
He did everything

290
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,700
just to get the Gu's Group.

291
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,170
Qiao Yan.

292
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,540
There's something

293
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,260
I'd rather not to tell you,

294
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,980
but I don't want to see you being cheated.

295
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,480
Actually I just found out

296
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,680
about Luo Qian and my dad.

297
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,560
After all, Gu Jingyuan is my brother

298
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,760
so I told him about it.

299
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,520
But

300
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,840
he threatened me
not to tell it to anyone else.

301
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
He even tried to harm the Qin family.

302
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,160
I think

303
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,040
he must have known it long ago.

304
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,240
I think

305
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,280
Gu Jingyuan

306
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,450
may be related to your father's death.

307
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,210
What are you talking about?

308
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,000
Calm down.

309
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,100
It's just my speculation.

310
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,660
But think about it.

311
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,560
If he didn't know so much,

312
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,580
and he didn't cooperate with those guys,

313
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,640
it would be
such an unbelievable coincidence.

314
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,560
I must

315
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,530
find out the truth about it.

316
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,400
If it really was him,

317
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,240
I won't let him off.

318
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,970
Qiao Yan.

319
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,240
Calm down.

320
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,240
I will

321
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,130
investigate it for you.

322
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,520
Okay.

323
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,609
How about you

324
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,940
stay here tonight?

325
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,240
W-W-What?

326
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,930
D-D-Don't get me wrong.

327
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:17,880
I mean,

328
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
it's not safe for you to go out alone.

329
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
If you stay here,

330
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,810
Gu Jingyuan will have
no way to bother you.

331
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,120
Okay.

332
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,240
Thank you.

333
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,320
Not at all.

334
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,320
Well,

335
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll have a room cleaned for you now.

336
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,600
These are for guests.

337
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,600
Wait a minute.

338
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,520
I'll ask them to buy you new ones.

339
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,180
No, thanks.

340
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,090
I've already troubled you.

341
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,610
Don't feel that way.

342
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,560
I'll wait

343
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,090
until you truly accept my love.

344
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,840
Then you will know

345
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm the one

346
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,640
who truly loves you.

347
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,580
You must be sleepy.

348
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,780
Rest early.

349
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,100
Good night.

350
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,560
Okay.

351
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,580
Good night.

352
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,100
Good night.

353
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,280
Be careful.

354
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
Keep in touch.

355
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,280
What?

356
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,760
Saving Ms. Luo can be a good opportunity.

357
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,490
I want you to put on a show with me

358
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,010
to make Qin Ziyu believe

359
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,410
we've really broken up.

360
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,000
No.

361
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,440
I can't let you
stay close to Qin Ziyu alone.

362
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,360
It's too dangerous.

363
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,560
But I have to do this.

364
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,160
Qin Ziyu is very likely

365
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,290
to be the murderer who killed Grandpa.

366
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,080
I can't let him

367
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,280
get away with murder.

368
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,520
Yan.

369
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,140
There are many ways

370
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,600
to investigate this matter.

371
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:49,960
You don't have to...

372
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,290
This is the only way now.

373
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,560
We have no evidence.

374
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,160
We'll only alert them
if we call the police.

375
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,800
You know

376
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
Qin Ziyu

377
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,320
is vigilant and cunning.

378
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,290
If we don't get close to him,

379
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,280
there's no way we can find any evidence
of his wrongdoing.

380
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,600
Besides,

381
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
only I can do this.

382
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,560
You must protect the Gu's Group.

383
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,820
Only you can see through Qin Ziyu's plot.

384
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,840
Yan.

385
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,180
How can I not be worried about you?

386
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,120
Trust me,

387
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,820
and cooperate with me.

388
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,800
Let's avenge Grandpa together.

389
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,520
In my opinion,

390
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,760
your boss should have

391
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,240
told me everything earlier.

392
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,900
Otherwise,

393
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,080
I wouldn't have

394
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,980
bitten you so hard.

395
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,680
It's just a minor injury.

396
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,080
Mr. Gu and Miss Qiao Yan

397
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,340
are having a hard time.

398
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,040
They must be very sad.

399
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,440
[The marriage of a rich family
breaks rapidly.]

400
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,360
[The Gu's Group may plunge
into its biggest crisis.]

401
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
It must have been leaked by Qin Ziyu.

402
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,600
Miss Qiao.

403
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,160
Mr. Qin asked me

404
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,760
to make you
this white fungus soup with longan.

405
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,930
Thank you. Put it there.

406
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,080
Mr. Qin asked you to rest early.

407
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,760
He has a dinner appointment today

408
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,090
and will come back late.

409
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,480
Where is it?

410
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:09,920
Mom.

411
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,000
Please bless me

412
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,320
so that Qin Ziyu
will be brought to justice.

413
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
To my son Ziyu,

414
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,040
If anything happens to me,

415
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,570
I'll leave the Qin's to you.

416
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,600
I saw what you were hiding.

417
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,040
Forget everything you've done.

418
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,970
Dad will take all the blame for you.

419
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,240
Don't avenge me.

420
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,520
Remember, be patient.

421
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,900
You must protect the Qin's first.

422
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,530
I've done many wrong things in my life,

423
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,720
but you'll always be my beloved son.

424
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,720
What did Qin Ziyu do?

425
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,100
Is my parents' death also related to him?

426
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,160
You and your grandfather
were fooled by him.

427
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,880
I think

428
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,720
Gu Jingyuan

429
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,250
may be related to your father's death.

430
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,200
Why did Qin Ziyu

431
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,840
drive a wedge between Jingyuan and me
with that matter?

432
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,600
Was Qin Mian not the only one

433
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,340
who killed my parents?

434
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,930
There was someone else?

435
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,120
Who?

436
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,080
It's me.

437
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,530
Have you gone to bed?

438
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,920
I brought you some snacks.

439
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,000
Do you want some?

440
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,200
Sure.

441
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,560
What's wrong?

442
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,650
No appetite?

443
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,400
Qin Ziyu.

444
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,640
Did you spread the news

445
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,210
about my divorce with Gu Jingyuan?

446
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,840
Are you unhappy about it?

447
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,000
I...

448
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm not.

449
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,060
I'm just...

450
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,480
I just think

451
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,080
if

452
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,000
the news of divorce gets out,

453
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
it might do harm to

454
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,960
the Gu's Group.

455
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,610
Isn't this the best time

456
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,730
to deal with the Gu's Group?

457
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,500
W-W-What's your plan?

458
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,370
I want to help you

459
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,440
take back the Gu's Group.

460
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,960
Although you're Chairwoman Qiao now,

461
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,620
Gu Jingyuan has been in his position
for so long.

462
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,660
He shouldn't be underestimated.

463
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,480
That's why

464
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,240
I tired to get his ledger

465
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,620
and disrupt his capital flow.

466
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,170
Do you want me

467
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,650
not to deal with him?

468
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,360
No.

469
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,600
I

470
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
must get the Gu's Group back.

471
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,560
I just think

472
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,000
what we're doing

473
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,440
might also

474
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,720
cause us

475
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
great losses.

476
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,130
Don't worry.

477
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
I know what to do.

478
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,480
By the way,

479
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
will you go back to the company
in the next few days?

480
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,220
I want to go back to the company tomorrow.

481
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:21,820
Because

482
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,880
I have a regular meeting tomorrow.

483
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,960
If I don't go,

484
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,340
Gu Jingyuan

485
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,210
might take advantage of it.

486
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,520
I'll go with you then.

487
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,240
Uh...

488
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,880
I don't think so.

489
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,370
Well,

490
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,880
there are many shareholders
in the company.

491
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,080
It's improper for you

492
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,320
to go there.

493
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,800
Trust me.

494
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,020
I can handle it myself.

495
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,000
Qiao Yan,

496
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,640
Thank you.

497
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,700
Thank you for coming into my life.

498
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,800
I still want to thank you.

499
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,740
Thank you for coming into my life.

500
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

501
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,840
I'm sorry.

502
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,200
Check

503
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,250
if this phone can still be used?

504
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,660
[Please enter the password.]

505
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,880
It's fine.

506
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,480
Look.

507
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,520
Qiao Yan.

508
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,120
Sorry.

509
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,480
I was too impulsive just now.

510
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,000
No.

511
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,680
It's my fault.

512
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm not ready yet.

513
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,250
Qiao Yan,

514
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,040
I've always liked you.

515
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,720
You are a ray of light in my life.

516
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,680
When I was in despair,

517
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,360
it was you

518
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,720
who gave me hope so I could live on.

519
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,520
As long as you give me a chance,

520
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,200
I can be really good to you.

521
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,080
I can be a good husband,

522
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,960
a good father.

523
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,080
I'm a little

524
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,360
sleepy.

525
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,120
I'm going back to my room.

526
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,560
Qiao Yan,

527
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,360
don't let me down.
