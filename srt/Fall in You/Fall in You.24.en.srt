00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,640
Hello.

195
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
I want to report a case.

196
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,760
There's a kidnapping
in the suburban villa district.

197
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,480
Hurry up!

198
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,280
Look.

204
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,240
but he found out his lover was pregnant.

205
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,410
So he figured

206
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,690
if the two babies were the same gender,

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
he could swap them

208

That's impossible.

don't think you can trick me

216
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,360

217
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,850
I want it to be a lie more than you do.

218
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,540
That is what you've wanted
your entire life,

219
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,100

always living in pain.

225
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,440
I found the letter

226
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,300
you hid behind the rose painting.

227
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,530

228
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,810
he knew you ordered Feng

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,780

I'll leave Qin's to you]

[I'll take all the responsibility for you]

236
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,750
he already told you back then

[Don't avenge me. Remember to be patient]

238
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,370

If you had told me earlier,

248
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,560
I wouldn't have gone

249
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,640

253
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,680
Then who is my mother?

Who truly loves me?

255
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,040
Who?

256
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,040

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,760

I'll just take you to the grave with me.

260

Gu Jingyuan,

261
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
you are my mother's biological son.

262
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,440
If you die here,

263
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,370
my mother would probably be happy.

264
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,610

265
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,400

266
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,720
Song Xinyue already knew the truth

267
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,880
before she died.

268
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,120
She came to the welfare house for me.

269
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,570
She asked me
if I wanted to go home with her.

270
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,330
But she also said...

271
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,520
Yuan.

272
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,480
I...

273
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,300
already have a son.

274
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,760
Um, he's about your age.

275
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,360
If I suddenly bring you home,

276
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:04,960
when

277
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,160
he sees you,

278
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,780
he might feel like he's being abandoned.

279
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,640
Wait for me.

280
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,130
Let me think about how to explain to him

281
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,800
that he has an older brother.

282
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,370
Then I'll come take you home, okay?

283
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,520
But before

284
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,300
she could arrange all of this,

285
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,460
she died suddenly.

286
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,160
She knew you weren't her biological son,

287
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,520
but she still loved you.

288
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,650
Qin Ziyu,

289
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,920
before Luo Qian died,

290
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,480
she called your name.

291
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,170
Although she and Qin Mian did that,

292
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,160
they always protected you,

293
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,000
just to make sure you can live well.

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,930
Every one of them

295
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,160
loved you in their own way!

296
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,580
So you already got
everything you want long ago!

297
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,640
It's too late.

298
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,080
Qin Ziyu!

299
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,610

300
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,000

309
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,880
Get him on the stretcher!

310
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,440
Boss!

311
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,240
Hurry!

312
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Are you okay, Yan?

313
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,079
Be careful.

314
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,480
Hurry!

315
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
It's been so long.

316
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,920
Why hasn't Boss come out yet?

317
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,130
I don't know.

318
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,160
There.

319
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,240
Doctor.

320
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,410
How is he?

321
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,600
The patient's injuries are severe.

322
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
Acute hemorrhagic shock

323
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,920
has led
to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

324
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,580
We've done everything we can,

325
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,560
but his condition is critical.

326
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,440
He cannot regain consciousness for now.

327
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,970
Maybe...

328
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,460
he'll remain in a coma indefinitely.

329
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,120
I know

330
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,600
you won't leave me alone,

331
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,680
right?

332
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,400
I'll stay here,

333
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,500

Yan...

336
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,680
won't eat anything

337
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,200
or go back with us.

00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,740

00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,400
Who did Boss and Miss Qiao Yan

342
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,860
offend to end up like this?

343
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,960
Stop crying.

At a time like this,

00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,040

408

Yan.

409
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,400
Yan.

410
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,640

Gu Jingyuan,

418
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,360
if you dare to die,

419
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,720
I will never forgive you!

420
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,120
Gu Jingyuan!

421
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,600
The doctor will save him, Yan.

Gu Jingyuan!

423
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,450
Let's go.

The patient's will

426
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,540
to live is very strong.

427
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
He's now temporarily out of danger.

428
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:07,880
Great.

429
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,260
Thank you, doctor.

430
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,370
Qiao Yan,

431
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,280
Yuan still hasn't woken up

432
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,340
because of you.

433
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
He didn't save you

434
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,680
to see you like this.

435
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,290
For people like Yuan and me,

436
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,900
it's hard
to truly fall in love with someone.

437
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,460
Unless that person

438
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,890
can give us enough love
and sense of security,

439
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
is willing to open the heart,

440
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,480
to actively trust us,

441
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,800
to be more determined than we are

442
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,160
when we waver,

443
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,540
to press forward even more

444
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,120
when we retreat,

445
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,980
and no matter when,

446
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,320
to make us feel

447
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,980
that life is beautiful

448
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,420
and the future is certain.

449
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Yuan is very lucky

450
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,020
to have met you,

451
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,920
but definitely not this version of you.

452
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,610
Qiao Yan,

453
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,880
trust him.

454
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,490
And trust yourself.

455
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,120
Only then

456
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,400
will fate favor you both.

457
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,400
Everyone,

458
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,580
as you all know,

459
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,280
a lot has happened recently

460
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,120
to Gu's Group and the Gu family.

461
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,880
Fortunately,

462
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,940
we've weathered it together.

463
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,040
Here,

464
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,850
on behalf of Gu's Group,

465
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,920
I want to say to all of you
who have stood by our side:

466
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,520
thank you.

467
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,240
The company will give all employees

468
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,080
three months' salary as a bonus.

469
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,340
From now on,

470
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,280
I will take over Gu's.

471
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,640
But you can all work with peace of mind.

472
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,530
Everything will be the same
as when Mr. Gu was here.

473
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,790
If you have any issues,

474
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
you can come to me.

475
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,840
Ms. Qiao, rest assured.

476
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,960
The company has treated us so well.

477
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,000
We will definitely work hard.

478
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,360
Right?

479
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:22,800
Yes.

480
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,360
Yes.

481
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,120
Yes.

482
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,440
Yes, Ms. Qiao.

483
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,240
Rest assured.

484
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:26,640
Yes.

485
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,440
Rest assured.

486
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,300
Go back to work.

487
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,680
Great!

523
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,880
Mr. Gu,

524
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,000
you've been lying there long enough.
Time to get up.

525
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,200
Look how tired and thin you've made Yan.

526
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,480
Don't talk nonsense.

00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,100

528
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560

537

539
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,100

Didn't Lin Ze say

549
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,560
he'd drive you to the airport?

550
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,220
Where is he?

556
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,480
Okay.

557
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,440

are you out of your...

mind?

570
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,250
No...

571
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,000
Yes.

572
