195
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,740
about the Gu family's existence.

196
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,040
That means

197
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,450
he didn't want me
to return to the Gu family

198
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,970
and didn't want me to return to you.

199
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,400
So,

200
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
I've decided to respect his wishes.

201
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,840
Why did something happen to you

202
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,930
right after Grandpa found you?

203
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,840
Why was the model taken

204
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,490
right after I got it?

205
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,160
What is that model for?

206
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,640
Who took the model?

207
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,780
Was the car accident really an accident?

208
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,000
It was definitely not...

209
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,520
an accident.

210
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,560
[Gu Hai, Qiao Yan: father and daughter]

211
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,920
[Gu Hai, Gu Jingyuan: brothers,
fight over inheritance]

212
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,880
You mean

213
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,470
you suspect your parents' car accident

214
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,040
[Gu Hai, Qiao Yuling: husband and wife]

215
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,680
is connected to the Gu family finding you?

216
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,140
My parents lived quietly,

217
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,420
never making enemies.

218
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,360
Before the accident,

219
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,920
they just came out of the repair shop.

220
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,980
But the police said

221
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,880
the cause was brake failure.

222
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,320
And the model of this house—

223
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,510
the moment it appeared, it was taken.

224
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,840
[Model]

225
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,640
Don't you think
that was too much of a coincidence?

226
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,290
Before I passed out,

227
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,450
I saw a scar on the person's right hand.

228
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,600
[Someone else]

229
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,560
And this letter.

230
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,790
[Gu Hai's death wasn't an accident.
The murderer is Gu Jingyuan.]

231
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,560
Who sent it to you?

232
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,130
I don't know.

233
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,680
[Gu Jingyuan's personal information]

234
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,480
Gu Jingyuan

235
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,480
was adopted
by your grandfather, Gu Changfeng,

236
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,640
from a welfare house.

237
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,200
He was a top student in college.

238
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,280
Within just 7 years,

239
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,080
he rose from the very bottom
to the vice president.

240
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,400
Mr. Gu,

241
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,420
I know I made a mistake.

242
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,300
I lost my head for a moment.

243
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,570
Don't worry.

244
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,360
I'll pay pack the money soon.

245
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,160
You know

246
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,960
what to do.

247
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,560
No.

248
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,850
I can't work for you.

249
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,840
I dare not do it again.

250
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,810
I gave you a chance,
but you didn't take it.

251
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,130
Then I'll have to respect your choice.

252
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,520
Rumor has it he is decisive and ruthless,

253
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,580
never shows mercy,

254
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,440
and stops at nothing to achieve his goals.

255
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,320
If it weren't for your grandfather

256
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,760
suddenly finding you,

257
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,400
he would already be

258
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,840
the heir to Gu's Group.

259
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,640
Mr. Gu,

260
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,360
my parents are sick.

261
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,680
My wife has no job.

262
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,020
Please forgive me.

263
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Please spare me!

264
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,660
I'll kowtow to you!

265
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,440
You just reminded me.

266
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,760
Remember to notify his family.

267
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,320
Got it.

268
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,560
You

269
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,210
forced me into this!

270
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,800
From all this information,

271
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,320
it does look like

272
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,820
Gu Jingyuan is the prime suspect.

273
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:08,520
Don't move!

274
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,650
If it really was him,

275
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,640
he must have gone after your parents

276
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,650
just to inherit Gu's Group.

277
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,970
Gu Jingyuan,

278
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,970
who doesn't have ambition?

279
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,040
You even killed Gu Hai

280
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,220
for the right of inheritance!

281
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,640
You're nothing but a dog

282
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,880
raised by Chairman Gu!

283
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,440
Shut up!

284
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,480
What?

285
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,810
You feel guilty?

286
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,280
You're scared?

287
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,480
If Chairman Gu finds out,

288
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,760
he won't let you off!

289
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,040
Not everyone deserves

290
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
to have ambition or selfish desire.

291
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,520
You said I killed my brother.

292
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,370
Who would believe that?

293
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,600
And who would know

294
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,880
whether the one kept by his side

295
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,200
is a dog or a wolf?

296
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,400

297
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,370

No, it's too dangerous.

300
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,450
But I have to go back.

301
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,080
I can't let my parents

302

die without knowing why.

303
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,560
But even if you go back,

304
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,360
what evidence can you even find?

305
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,980

the truth

She's so pretty.

328

She is young,

329

Maybe you've forgotten me.

Qiao Yan,

360
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,160
I really regret

not bringing you back earlier.

362

It's quite cold at night in Xijiang

365

when it's windy.

366
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,260
If you plan to stay here often,

367
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,640
you'll need to get used to it.

368
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,840
Of course.

369
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,080
This is my home.

Chairman Gu is waiting for you
in the study.

378
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,120
We moved into this old house

379
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,040
when your father was born.

380
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,640
Mr. Gu is nostalgic.

381
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,240
He's lived here all the time.

382
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,560
Oh, this room

383

belongs to Jingyuan.

384
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,880
He likes peace and quiet

385
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,600
and doesn't like to be disturbed.

386
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,360
Make sure you don't enter by mistake.

387
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,760
Come,

388
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,500
your room is over here.

389
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,040
Dad,

390
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,290
you wanted to see me?

391
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,320
Jingyuan,

392
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,280
come, have a seat.

393
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,720
What?

394
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,240
You're unhappy?

395
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,640
Of course not.

396
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,960
I'm happy for you

397
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,650
that Qiao Yan has come back.

398
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
Your brother died in a car accident.

399
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,280
Yan is my biological granddaughter

400
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,920
and the only blood relative
I have left in this world.

401
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,120
Over the years,

402
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,440
I've owed her far too much.

403
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,840
I must make it up to her double.

404
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,360
Dad,

405
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,120
what am I

406
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,920
to you?

407
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,600
Yan's uncle

408
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,100
and my adopted son
who has been by my side for many years.

409
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,100
Since Yan is willing to come back,

410
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,440
you should get along well with her.

411
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,080
When I'm gone,

412
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,720
you must take good care of her

413
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,970
and help her
safeguard the Gu family's business.

414
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,530
That is your duty

415
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,520
as my closest

416
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,880
adopted son.

417
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,980
Do you understand?

418
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,080
Yes.

419
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,920
If there's nothing else,

420
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
I'm going back.

421
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,280
Yuan,

422
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,680
don't

423
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,120
let me down.

424
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,200
Yuan,

425
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,960
Yan is my biological granddaughter

426
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,610
and the only blood relative
I have left in this world.

427
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,040
You must take good care of her

428
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,090
and help her
safeguard the Gu family's business.

429
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,640
Oh my!

430
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,400
Come out.

431
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,960
What are you doing in my room?

432
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,440
This house is too big.

433
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,120
I got lost.

434
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,640
Just now,

435
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,920
Uncle Xu specially showed me around.

436
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,560
But

437
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,400
I didn't remember the way.

438
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,800
So I ended up in the wrong room.

439
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,240
When you walk into the wrong room,

440
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,320
your first reaction should be to leave,

441
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,720
not to stay.

442
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,840
You're right.

443
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Just now,

444
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,800
I was about to leave,

445
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,920
but you suddenly came back.

446
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,280
I...

447
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,720
The way you looked

448
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,400
scared me,

449
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,280
so I hid.

450
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,500
What way did I look?

451
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,260
You're very happy today, huh?

452
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,160
You think you made a fool of me, huh?

453
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,200
Qiao Yan,

454
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
why exactly

455
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,720
did you come back to the Gu family?
