excuse me, sir.

385
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,240
Can I put this photo on the wall?

386
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,800
Oh, okay.

387
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,370
This is the restaurant where the woman

388
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,880
who almost adopted me
brought me back then.

389
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,360
[In all the vastness of space
and the immensity of time,]

390
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,880
[it's my joy to share a planet]

391
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,760
It's okay.

392
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:46,920
[and an epoch with you.]

393
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,280
Say hello to her later.

394
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,560
[Carl Sagan, "Cosmos"]

395
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,240
Hello.

396
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,480
Are you Yuan?

397
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,520
Mm.

398
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,540
Then...

399
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,890
what's your mother's name?

400
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,560
Luo Qian.

401
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,080
Um...

402
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,520
are you willing

403
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,530
to let me take you out to play

404
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,740
and eat something delicious?

405
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,820
Yuan, you're willing, right?

406
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:19,960
Mm.

407
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,200
Great.

408
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,640
I'll take you to eat

409
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,100
your favorite food, okay?

410
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,170
Let's go.

411
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,760
Yuan,

412
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
tell me

413
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,580
what you want the most.

414
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,040
I want a home.

415
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,180
I don't want the old home anymore.

416
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,080
My mother died.

417
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,680
My dad...

418
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,560
He...

419
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,200
would only beat me.

420
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,220
No one has come to adopt me.

421
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,080
So,

422
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,600
I can only

423
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,400
stay in the welfare house alone.

424
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,720
Will you come with me?

425
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,620
I...

426
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,120
I... I mean

427
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
if you're willing

428
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,600
to come home with me

429
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,280
and let me be your mother.

430
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,640
Yes.

431
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,960
Great.

432
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,120
I promise you.

433
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,250
I'll come pick you up in a month at most.

434
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,130
Promise.

435
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,650
Pinky swear.

436
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,520
Pinky swear.

437
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,400
Never break the promise.

438
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,040
Deal.

439
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:41,800
Hello,

440
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,210
can I take a photo of you?

441
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,160
Okay.

442
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,200
Let's take a photo.

443
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,850
Come closer.

444
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,610
Three, two, one.

445
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,700
Look at the camera.

446
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,820
Who are you really?

447
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,400
Why didn't you come pick me up back then?

448
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,720
Geez!

449
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,200
Sir.

450
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,480
Sir, wake up!

451
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,160
Sir!

452
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,120
Sir.

453
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,960
Sir?

454
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,280
Oh.

455
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,880
Thank you.

456
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,450

457
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,920
Hello, Yan.
