Didn't you have to work today?

199

Did you

202
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,320
make all these by yourself?

203
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,920
They're all your favorites.

204
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,280
By the way.

205
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,400

and longevity noodles in the kitchen.

Okay.

208

I'll go get some then.

209
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,560

210
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,600
Get me enough money

211
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,360
and a fake identity for going abroad,

212
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,400
or I'll reveal

213
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,290
everything about you ordering me to kill.

215

I'll arrange a meeting spot.

216
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,760
Dad,

217
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,970
it's my birthday today.

218
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,320
Can you stop working?

219
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,610
Okay.

220
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,320
I'm turning off my phone.

221
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,320
Come on, son,

222
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
happy birthday.

223
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,890
Thanks, Dad.

224
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,520
Let's eat.

225
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,840
That concert you're organizing

226
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,640
is premiering tomorrow, right?

227
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,400
Dad,

228
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,760
at a time like this,

229
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,880
please don't say I'm

230
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,140
wasting my time again.

231
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,650
Whatever you do,

232
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,560
I support you.

233
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,960
However,

234
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,800
after this concert is over,

235
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,760
you need to come work at the company.

236
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,120
Dad,

237
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,620
you should know

238
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,520
I don't know anything about business.

239
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,240
What could I possibly do there?

240
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,040
You learn because you don't know,

241
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,760
otherwise how will I

242
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,090
hand the company over
to you in the future?

243
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,080
Well, I think

244
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,920
you should have another child
while you can,

245
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,760
and let them inherit the company.

246
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,600
Nonsense!

247
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,520
I started this business with

248
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,490
your mother's inheritance
from the Song family.

249
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,920
Even though the Song family
doesn't have many people left,

250
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,180
there are still so many eyes watching me.

251
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,160
So are you

252
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,520
concerned about me because I'm your son,

253
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,280
or only because of the Song family?

254
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,610
What's the difference?

255
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,280
You're my son no matter what.

256
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,080
Ziyu.

257
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,650
I'm getting old,

258
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,300
and there are many things
I can no longer handle.

259
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,980
But you're different.

260
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,000
You must protect everything I give you

261
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,280
and don't let me down.

262
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,880
Do you understand?

263
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,200
Yes,

264
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,240
I promise.

265
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Let's eat.

266
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,730
Where's my invitation?

267
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
What invitation?

268
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,090
The one to your concert!

269
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,680
You don't want to invite me
to the concert organized by you?

270
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:48,960
Oh.

271
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,200
Dad,

272
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,800
it's just that

273

276
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,600
I was

277
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,640
afraid you'd be upset, so...

278
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
You know I'll be unhappy about it,

279
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,340
yet you're still so close to Qiao Yan.

280
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,720
Don't tell me you've fallen in love
with that girl?

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,860
I think she's quite interesting.

282
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,080
I really like her.

You did an amazing job today.

290
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,960

291

Didn't he come to
see your performance today?

296
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,900
something important to do today.

Okay.

302
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,010
I got you a fake passport

303
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,880
and a Swiss bank card

that you can use to
withdraw money across Europe.

305

that you ordered me
to cause the car accident

backstage at the small theater.

319
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,380
Since we reported the case to the police,

320
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,740
they've been watching Qin Mian closely,

321
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360

322

Feng refused to confess his crimes.

326
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,520
However,

327

has been caught

under your orders

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,780
He deserved to die!

384
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,680
Shut up!

385
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,400
Yan.

386
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,520
You have no right to say my mother's name.

387
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,240
My mom

388
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,720
and my dad

389
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,720
loved each other deeply.

390
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
We were a happy family.

391
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,760
My mom never mentioned you.

392
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,880
Yuling and I were in love.

393
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,800
We just had a small disagreement

394
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,100
and parted for a while.

395
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,400
Gu Hai took advantage of the situation

396
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
and took her away,

397
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,720
making it impossible for me to find her.

398
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,980
Gu Hai deserved to die!

399
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,320
The reason for
the so-called small disagreement

400
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,800
was that you wanted to marry Song Xinyue

401
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,930
for the Song family's fortune, right?

402
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,850
Qin Mian.

403
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,040
It was you who made that choice.

404
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,840
Why did you have to blame others?

405
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,770
That's not true,

406
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,380
I loved Yuling.

407
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,800
You can only

408
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,880
use your fake love to deceive yourself.

409
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,690
Even saying those words

410
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,400
is insulting my mom!

411
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,920
You loved her?

412
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,250
Then how could you kill her?

413
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,440
You don't love anyone!

414
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,120
You're just a lunatic!

415
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,320
Qin Mian.

416
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,000
Take your hypocritical and dirty love
with you

417
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,370
and spend the rest of your life
atoning for your sins.

418
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,560
Dad.

419
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,240
Did you

420
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,520
never truly love my mother?

421
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,440
What about me?

422
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,480
I failed her.

423
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,680
Ziyu.

424
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,730
The Qin's from now on

425
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,400
will depend entirely on you.

426
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
You must remember

427
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,160
what I told you before.

428
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,240
Live well.

429
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:29,840
Go.

430
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:30,840
Dad.

431
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,080
Dad!

432
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Dad!

433
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,860
It's okay now, Yan.

434
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,050
I'm here.

435
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,980
It's all right now.

436
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:54,410
[Xijiang]
[In Memory of My Son Gu Hai,
and My Daughter-in-law Qiao Yuling]

437
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,720
Dad.

438
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,280
Mom.

439
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,380
The real murderer who killed you
has been found.

440
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,720
You can rest in peace now.

441
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,240
After all,

442
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,840
this is the karma I created.

443
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,480
Hai.

444
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,600
Yuling.

445
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,880
I failed you.

446
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:20,960
Dad.

447
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,640
Yan.

448
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,200
It's good that Qin Mian has been arrested.

449
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,160
Don't be too sad.

450
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,760
Take care.

451
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,160
Yan!

452
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,520
Yan!

453
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,000
Yan!

454
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,360
Yan!

455
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:34,920
Yan!

456
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,600
Hurry.

457
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh no.

458
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,440
Dad.

459
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,170
Grandpa.

460
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,280
Uncle.

461
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,210
Don't leave.

462
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,810
I'm here.

463
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,140
Your uncle is here.

464
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,730
Don't be afraid.

465
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,520
The doctor said you had caught a cold

466
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,980
and that's why you had a fever
and collapsed.

467
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,200
Would you like something to eat?

468
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,570
Here.

469
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,040
It's okay.

470
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,040
Don't cry.

471
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,160
Okay?

472
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,580
Have something to eat.

473
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,200
When I was sick in the past,

474
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,240
my mom would always stay with me,

475
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,460
and my dad would make
all kinds of delicious food for me.

476
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,280
So

477
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,880
I actually used to

478
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,440
kind of enjoy being sick.

479
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,720
Because

480
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,840
when I was sick,

481
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,160
I didn't have to go to school,

482
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,920
and I could stay home

483
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,580
and be pampered by my parents.

484
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,160
Uncle.

485
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,680
I miss them so much.

486
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,920
Yan.

487
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,280
stop crying, okay?

488
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,810
Stop crying.

489
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,940
No matter where your parents are,

490
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,220
they're always blessing you,

491
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,280
right?

492
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,480
I...

493
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,440
Grandpa and I

494
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,020
will take good care of you too.

495
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,650

521
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,040
Dad, um...

522
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Yan was missing her parents,

523
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,970
so I was comforting her.

524
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,530
Good.

525
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,560
Hmm.

526
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,000
Yan.

527
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,370
How are you feeling?

528
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,360
Should we

529
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,560
have a doctor check on you again?

530
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,640
No need.

531
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm feeling much better now,

532
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,480
I just need some more rest.

533
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,200
Your uncle has been with you all day.

534
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,450
Let me keep you company now.

535
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,000
Jingyuan.

536
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,850
Yes, Dad.

537
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,920
Go back now

538
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,480
and

539
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,050
ask Yue to come here.

540
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,600
Tonight,

541
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,840
she can stay with Yan overnight.

542
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,120
Okay.

543
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,200
All right.

544
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,740
Drink your porridge later

545
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,680
and take the medicine.
