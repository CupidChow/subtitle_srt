[Episode 8]

3
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,320
[Gu Jingyuan's biological father
reported his refusal to provide for him]

4
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,250
My name is He Wei.

5
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,740
I'm the father of Gu Jingyuan,

6
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,039
who's the President of Gu's Group.

7
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,400
Under my real name, I'm reporting that

8
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,480
he favors the rich and disdains the poor,

9
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,080
a-and he's an ungrateful man

10
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,840
as he refuses to provide for his father.

11
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,240
Do you have any evidence?

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,720
Yes.

13
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,650
All of this is the evidence.

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,080
At that time, Yuan...

15
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,780
Gu Jingyuan was called

16
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,170
He Yuan at that time.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,479
After his mother died,

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,970
he thought his family was poor,

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,080
so he went to the welfare house himself
and claimed to be an orphan.

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,400
When I found him,

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,240
he had been adopted by Chairman Gu.

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,140
He refused to recognize me as his father.

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,449
All these years,

24
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,250
he has never cared about me.

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,880
But I never thought that

26
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,780
though he used to steal stuff,

27
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,480
now

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,650
for the so-called bidding,

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,480
he would even take advantage of the kids.

30
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,600
I... I... I...

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,640
I can't let him harm others.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,079
Right?

33
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,240
[Gu Jingyuan's biological father
reported his refusal to provide for him]

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,970
After all...

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,100
After all, I'm his father.

36
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,520
[Gu Jingyuan]

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,520
Sorry.

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,240
The subscriber you dialed

39
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,400
is unavailable.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,200
Please redial later.

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,360
Mr. Gu!

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,079
The kids on the Parent-Child Day...

43
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,280
Mr. Gu, answer my question.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,840
Mr. Gu, please accept our interview.

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Say something, Mr. Gu.

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,240
Yeah, Mr. Gu.

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,160
Mr. Gu, just say something.

48
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,680
Say something.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,640
Mr. Gu, please give us a response.

50
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,500
Say something.

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,400
Regarding this incident,

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,480
do you have anything to say to the public?

53
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,080
Please say something about

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,200
the incident on the Parent-Child Day.

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,600
Mr. Gu!

56
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,600
Mr. Gu!

57
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,600
Mr. Gu!

58
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,180
Did you steal my stuff?

59
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,520
I didn't steal it.

60
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,560
It wasn't me.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,720
You're lying! It was you!

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,240
-Yes, it was you.
-It was you.

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,200
Take it out now.

64
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
Take it out!

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,360
Take it out!

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,980
Take it out at once!

67
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,560
Take it out!

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,290
It wasn't me.

69
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,560
Take it out!

70
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,440
It was you.

71
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,480
I didn't steal it.

72
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,140
Take it out.

73
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,079
I didn't steal it.

74
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,760
Take it out now!

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,090
I saw it with my own eyes.

76
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,120
You stole it.

77
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,040
You stole it.

78
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
-Yes, it was him!
-It was him!

79
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,520
I didn't steal it.

80
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,250
It wasn't me.

81
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:38,970
It was you

82
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,560
who stole my mom's wallet!

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
I didn't steal it.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
Because you're a bastard child.

85
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,480
A bastard child would steal wallets.

86
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,210
Little liar,

87
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,040
if you still refuse to give it to me,

88
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,760
I'll ask your dad to beat you up.

89
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
I didn't steal it.

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,520
You're still denying it?

91
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,920
I really didn't steal it.

92
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,120
Hey, He Wei.

93
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,960
Your bastard son stole something.

94
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,360
Will you discipline him or not?

95
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,680
He... He stole something?

96
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,080
Yes.

97
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Little bastard!

98
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,410
H-How dare you steal stuff?

99
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,120
I didn't steal anything.

100
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,400
You're still lying?

101
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,860
I'll beat you to death!

102
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,120
He deserves to be beaten up.

103
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,640
How dare you steal stuff?

104
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,300
-Beat him up!
-He deserves it!

105
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,279
How dare you steal stuff?

106
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,500
How dare you...

107
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
I didn't steal it.

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
How dare you steal stuff?

109
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,240
Just let him beat you to death,
bastard child!

110
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,280
How dare you steal stuff?

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,000
Bastard child!

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
-He deserves it!
-Beat him to death!

113
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,480
How dare you steal stuff?

114
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
You wicked thief!

115
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,159
Bastard child!

116
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,240
Will you steal stuff again?

117
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I didn't steal it!

118
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,400
Oh!

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,120
Isn't this my son, who's a president?

120
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,520
What's wrong?

121
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,400
You finally found your way home?

122
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,320
Huh?

123
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,040
Isn't this very familiar to you?

124
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,900
Are you quite touched?

125
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,760
Call me Dad.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Let me hear it.

127
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,330
You've never looked for me.

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,660
Why did you lie?

129
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,690
I want money.

130
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,360
I've raised you for so many years.

131
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,560
Isn't it quite normal

132
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,480
to ask for compensation?

133
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,080
If you had just wanted money,

134
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,680
you wouldn't have needed to
slander me from the start.

135
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,340
What on earth is your purpose?

136
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,940
Because I want to destroy you.

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,300
Because you didn't make me happy.

138
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,770
That annoying woman

139
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,040
gave birth to a bastard child like you.

140
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,400
I shouldn't have let you be born!

141
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,060
He Wei, you're such a villain!

142
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,360
What?

143
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,280
As the President of Gu's Group, you think

144
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,140
you're a member

145
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,340
of the upper class?

146
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:50,960
Huh?

147
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,320
You are just a bastard child.

148
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,780
A bastard child that no one wants!

149
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,760
You want me to keep living

150
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,290
in my childhood nightmare.

151
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,840
He Wei, let me tell you. Dream on!

152
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,280
I know

153
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,580
you have many ways to deal with me.

154
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,330
However,

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,240
don't you want to know
where your mom, Luo Qian, is?

156
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,330
Your mom is not dead.

157
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,600
I lied to you.

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If you piss me off,

159
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,120
I can do anything.

160
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,240
Do you dare to risk

161
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,730
your mom's life?

162
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,600
Why should I trust you?

163
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,020
Lin Ze, have you got in touch with him?

164
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,400
I got it.

165
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,360
Qiao Yan!

166
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,179
Are you going to look for Yuan?

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,530
Wanqing.

168
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,320
Do you know about He Wei?

169
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,520
This is

170
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,039
what he hates to talk about the most.

171
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,320
He Wei

172
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,180
is not his biological father.

173
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,240
What?

174
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,980
He merely married his mother.

175
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,640
He Wei

176
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
is a scoundrel.

177
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,250
Every time he got drunk,

178
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,700
he liked to hit others.

179
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,970
What's more,

180
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,890
he was a habitual thief.

181
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,720
When people found out about it,

182
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,520
he would let Yuan be the scapegoat.

183
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,450
Because of that,

184
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,740
Yuan was beaten up many times.

185
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,160
No matter how hard he tried to refute it,

186
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,290
no one believed him.

187
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,160
So later,

188
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,290
whenever he's criticized,

189
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,060
he won't defend himself anymore.

190
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,410

563
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,080
you've been keeping an eye on Gu's Group.

564
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,520
In terms of doing business,

565
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,520
we should remember the rule,
"Business is business."

566
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,920
Why should we let the Gu family
monopolize the market in Xijiang?

567
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,040
Only by understanding our opponents

568
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,440
and hounding them relentlessly

569
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,100
will we have the chance to win.

570
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,120
But we originally...

571
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,520
Ziyu.

572
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,080
Everything I have now

573
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,570
will all be yours in the future.

574
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,440
Everything I'm doing now

575
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,480
is all for you.

576
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,280
Okay.

577
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,320
I haven't had hot pot for a long time.

578
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,850
Grandpa.

579
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,080
Why did you think of eating it today?

580
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,920
Having hotpot

581
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,000
is just for a lively atmosphere.

582
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,320
Hey, Xu Wen.

583
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,090
I'm here!

584
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,080
Go to the study room

585
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,040
and fetch my two bottles of old wine.

586
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,520
Okay.

587
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,250
Grandpa.

588
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,680
It looks like you're in a good mood today.

589
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,720
But don't forget that

590
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,800
the doctor told you

591
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,720
to avoid drinking if you can.

592
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,760
It's okay to drink occasionally.

593
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,080
Jingyuan.

594
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,760
Hey, Dad.

595
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,680
It's been a long time
since we drank together last time.

596
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,740
Don't you want to drink with me later?

597
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,410
Yes, I do.

598
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,960
Of course I'll drink with you.

599
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,160
But let's make a deal.

600
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,680
Just stop when you should.

601
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
Don't drink too much.

602
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,010
Yeah.

603
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,210
That's what my good son should be like.

604
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,490
Here's the wine.

605
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:36,960
Dad.

606
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,920
This wine is quite old, isn't it?

607
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,680
I remember it has existed
since I came here.

608
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,480
That's right.

609
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,080
I specially bought it and kept it

610
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,300
when you joined the Gu family.

611
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,560
We're drinking your wine today.

612
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,370
Alright.

613
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,440
Now

614
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,560
there are no outsiders here.

615
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,560
As a family,

616
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,740
let's drink a toast first.

617
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,240
Come on.

618
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,680
Dad, I wish you good health.

619
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,400
Grandpa, I wish you happiness every day.

620
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:03,840
Well,

621
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,800
thanks for my granddaughter's good wishes.

622
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,260
Cheers.

623
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,760
Hey, Dad.

624
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,740
Drink slowly. You're drinking too fast.

625
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,560
Jingyuan.

626
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,200
Yes?

627
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,330
Hai and I were apart,

628
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,380
wasting half of our lifetime.

629
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,640
You grew up with no one to rely on.

630
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,410
Since you joined the Gu family,

631
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,520
I've treated you as my own son.

632
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,000
Remember.

633
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,930
No matter what you do in the future,

634
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,890
the Gu family

635
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
will always be your strong backing.

636
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,450
Alright?

637
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,460
Come on.

638
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,540
Thank you, Dad.

639
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,600
Okay.

640
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,720
Hey, Grandpa.

641
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,960
We agreed
you would drink only one glass of it.

642
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,920
Why are you still drinking?

643
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,380
Just let me drink a little.

644
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,280
Let's have some meat.

645
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,200
I'm starving.

646
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,520
Oh. Okay.

647
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,720
Let's eat.

648
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,200
Hmm.

649
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,520
Thank you, Dad.

650
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:14,960
Hey.

651
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,360
Humph.

652
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,600
I'm not happy.

653
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,080
Grandpa,
all you know is giving meat to Uncle.

654
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,520
You're not even giving meat to me.

655
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,000
You're biased.

656
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,920
Oh, my goddess.

657
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,130
Everyone has it.

658
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,200
Oh, come on.

659
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,770
Here you are.

660
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,490
Thank you, Grandpa.

661
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,720
Hey, Dad.

662
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,440
Eat some, too.

663
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,600
Okay. Let's eat.

664
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,170
Here you are.

665
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,680
Dad.

666
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,440
Yes?

667
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,120
Regarding the Parent-Child Day incident,

668
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,250
don't worry. I'll handle it properly.

669
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,960
As for the land we're bidding for,

670
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,520
we'll certainly get it.

671
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,000
I believe

672
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,160
you will definitely handle it well.

673
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,690
Alright.

674
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,040
Let's not talk about this now.

675
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,640
Let's eat.

676
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,840
Okay.

677
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,820
Be careful.

678
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,480
Thank you, Uncle.

679
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,400
Oh.

680
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,460
This wine is quite strong.
Don't drink too much.

681
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,760
Okay.

682
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,960
Uncle, you're so stingy.

683
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,840
I haven't drunk too much.

684
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,600
I feel nothing at all.

685
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,890
This is strange.

686
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,930
Why is my heart beating so fast?

687
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,440
Am I really drunk?
