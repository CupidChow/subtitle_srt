[Episode 15]

3
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,100
Does it still hurt?

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,280
No.

5
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,400
Why?

7
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,380
Why are you apologizing to me?

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,680
I told you,

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,970
I would protect you,

10
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,160
never let you get hurt.

11
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,520
That's my promise to you.

12
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
And for that promise,

13
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,160
I'd give everything—

14
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,240
even my life.

15
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,280
But what happened today,

16
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,040
it's all because of me...

17
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,100
Are you stupid?

18
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,250
Well,

19
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,079
so I

20
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,960
get to be happy,

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,930
while you

22
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,160
take all the pain and blame.

23
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,200
Why?

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,380
We're a couple now.

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,840
We should

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,320
trust and rely

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
on each other.

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,240
Whatever

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
trouble or danger

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,000
comes,

31
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,440
we have to

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,920
bear and face it

33
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,640
together.

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,240
Yan.

35
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,800
Yan.

36
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,320
Grandpa.

37
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,680
Dad.

38
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,650
why are you back?

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,530
Grandpa,

40
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,490
why are you back?

41
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,720
Mr. Gu

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,760
saw the news,

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,440
knew you two were in trouble,

44
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,920
and insisted on being discharged.

45
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,480
Yan,

46
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,880
don't be afraid.

47
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,000
Grandpa's here.

48
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,760
Dad,

49
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,240
I'll take care of Yan.

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,680
Your health matters more.

51
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,760
Please go back to the hospital.

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,960
Hospital? Forget it.

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
This is how you take care of her?

54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,440
Grandpa,

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,160
you just got discharged.

56
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
Did you forget what the doctor said?

57
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,920
Alright.

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,200
Hey,

59
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,560
you two, stop standing here.

60
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,560
Figure out a solution soon.

61
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,160
Okay.

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,880
Well.

63
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,760
Yan.

64
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,560
Yes?

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,760
Now you see

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,200
why I opposed

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,880
you being with Jingyuan?

68
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,480
Public gossip can drown you.

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,160
But Grandpa,

70
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,720
new scandals pop up every day.

71
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,570
Give it time and everyone will forget.

72
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,560
Humph.

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
That's so optimistic of you.

74
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,920
Yan.

75
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,520
Yes?

76
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,810
Do you really

77
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,480
like Jingyuan that much?

78
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,320
Yes.

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,480
At first,

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,000
I treated him like family.

81
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,850
I think he's dependable

82
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,640
and reliable.

83
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,840
But gradually,

84
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,320
somehow,

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,420
I started having expectations of him

86
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,820
and caring for him.

87
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,040
And later,

88
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,080
I always felt sorry for him.

89
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,760
I'm thinking,

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,320
if my parents had stayed in Xijiang,

91
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,360
if I'd met him earlier,

92
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,220
I could've been by his side all along.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,800
Given the current situation,

94
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,920
what are you going to do?

95
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,880
Dad,

96
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,690
I've made up my mind.

97
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll hold a press conference

98
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,600
to tell everyone that

99
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,380
I've decided to give up
the Gu's adopted son status.

100
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,700
If my surname is not Gu,

101
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,680
I'm not Yan's uncle,

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,600
then our love is acceptable.

103
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,000
And the Gu family's reputation

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,200
will not be affected.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,060
Most importantly,

106
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,200
no one can judge Yan anymore.

107
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
You've known Yan

108
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,240
only a few months.

109
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,360
How deep can your feelings be?

110
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,880
How far

111
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,640
can you go?

112
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,400
Have you

113
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,480
thought about that?

114
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,560
Yes.

115
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,760
I will marry Yan.

116
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,240
Whether I marry into your family

117
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,840
or keep the marriage secret,

118
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,159
I don't mind.

119
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,010
I won't leave the Gu family.

120
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,440
No matter who I am,

121
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
we'll always be the closest family.

122
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,250
And you'll always be my father.

123
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,200
You asked me here

124
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,560
to tell me something important?

125
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,450
No hurry.

126
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,400
I'll tell you slowly.

127
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,860
Have a seat.

128
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,760
Don't you want to know

129
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,720
why He Yue

130
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,120
had that video of you two?

131
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,480
I gave it to her.

132
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,400
I knew she'd

133
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,080
hand it to the reporters.

134
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,640
Why did you do that?

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,800
First tell me,

136
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,240
what's

137
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,080
Chairman Gu's attitude?

138
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
Grandpa's worried about us.

139
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,080
But no matter what happens,

140
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,970
no matter what others think or say,

141
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,360
Jingyuan and I will be together

142
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,010
and never back down.

143
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,080
Good.

144
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,000
Then

145
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,770
my efforts weren't wasted.

146
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,690
What do you mean?

147
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,050
As long as Yuan is happy,

148
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,010
I'm willing to do anything.

149
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,020
Since he likes you,

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,960
I'll make sure

151
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,220
you two stay together.

152
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,800
Yan.

153
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,980
Lu Wanqing, what are you up to?

154
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,120
I've found out

155
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,880
you sent that video to He Yue.

156
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,560
Yes,

157
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,040
I did.

158
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,100
But I did it for you.

159
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,370
Chairman Gu cares about his image,

160
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,660
but he's softhearted.

161
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,520
If you keep hiding it,

162
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,940
he'll never agree.

163
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,760
But if it blows up,

164
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,200
he'll feel for you

165
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,740
and take your side.

166
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,290
Who asked you to do that?

167
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,480
Yuan,

168
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,200
anything you want,

169
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,850
I'll help you get it.

170
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,970
Even if you rejected me,

171
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,360
we've been together since childhood,

172
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
and we're the closest to each other.

173
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,000
That

174
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,480
will never change.

175
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,480
Wan,

176
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,520
I don't need you to meddle

177
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,290
with what's between Yan and me.

178
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,600
Why did you bring me here?

179
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,780
This is the most
beautiful place in Xijiang.

180
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
Whenever I feel down,

181
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,600
I come here

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,200
and it always helps.

183
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,000
Hah.

184
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,000
Mmm.

185
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Jingyuan,

186
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,560
do you have

187
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,200
something to say to me?

188
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,200
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
I apologize to you

190
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,890
for what Lu Wanqing did.

191
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,660
Actually, she's not a bad person.

192
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,960
She's relied on me
too much since we were kids,

193
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,240
so she's a bit extreme.

194
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,130
But don't worry,

195
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,640
I will handle it.

196
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,720
It's okay.

197
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,120
Actually,

198
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,840
I can understand Wanqing.

199
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,120
And

200
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,080
who knows—

201
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,530
this might work on Grandpa.

202
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,320
Also,

203
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,210
I'm warning you.

204
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,650
Stop saying "sorry" to me all the time.

205
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,000
Because in my heart,

206
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,000
our Mr. Gu shoud be proud.

207
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,740
I don't like seeing you bow your head.

208
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,880
You don't have to always worry about me.

209
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,360
Smile.

210
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,960
Qiao Yan,

211
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,520
marry me.

212
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,160
At first,

213
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,920
I cared about you like family—

214
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,010
thought you were lively

215
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,560
and adorable.

216
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,490
But after everything we've been through,

217
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,480
I cared for you a lot.

218
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,600
And then,

219
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,530
you could always stir my heart.

220
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,040
I want to protect you,

221
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,240
never let you get hurt again.

222
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm thinking,

223
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,680
if I could spend every second

224
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,260
by your side in the future,

225
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,370
seeing you,

226
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,800
guarding you—

227
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
how wonderful that'd be.

228
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,120
Yan,

229
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,260
I know this isn't a perfect proposal.

230
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,760
No flowers,

231
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,280
no ceremony,

232
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
and no blessings.

233
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,920
But it's just us here—

234
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,040
and only us.

235
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,920
Qiao Yan,

236
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,000
will you marry me?

237
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,480
Yes.

238
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,400

Mr. Gu.

264
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,040
Mr. Gu, say something.

265
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,160
Tell us about you and Miss Qiao Yan.

266
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,680
Say something.

267
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,640
Are you and Miss Qiao Yan really together?

268
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,840
-Say something.
-Answer us.

269
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,720
We've been waiting for so long.

270
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,320
Just a few words, Mr. Gu.

271
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,400
Yeah, say something.

272
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,880
Mr. Gu.

273
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,880
Say something.

274
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,520
Say something.

275
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,380
Say something.

276
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,400
Miss Qiao Yan.

277
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,920
Were you two together last night?

278
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,839
What happened exactly?

279
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,240
Yeah.

280
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,880
Yeah.

281
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,060
Please tell us.

282
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,339
What's your relationship

283
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:10,599
[Gu Group]

284
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,130
exactly?

285
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,160
Tell us.

286
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,079
-Yeah. What's your relationship?
-Dad.

287
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,810
Chairman Gu.

288
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,810
Chairman Gu.

289
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,210
Chairman Gu.

290
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:20,920
Chairman Gu.

291
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,520
Chairman Gu.

292
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,560
Are you here to respond

293
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,680
about the relationship between
Mr. Gu and Ms. Qiao Yan?

294
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,540
You've been chasing us this hard,

295
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,640
waiting at the company every day.

296
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,320
It must be exhausting.

297
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,780
If I don't say something,

298
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,280
you

299
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,920
won't give up.

300
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,160
Everyone,

301
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,680
my adopted son

302
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,840
Gu Jingyuan

303
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,320
and my granddaughter Qiao Yan

304
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,880
are indeed in a relationship.

305
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,000
And they're

306
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,080
getting married soon.

307
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,720
Really?

308
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,060
Getting married soon?

309
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,440
Chairman Gu,

310
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,920
do you support their marriage?

311
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,880
What do you think

312
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,080
of their relationship?

313
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
They love each other—

314
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,940
there's nothing wrong with that.

315
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,120
Their marriage

316
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,200
should have

317
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,200
everyone's blessing.

318
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,520
Chairman Gu's right.

319
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,600
What about

320
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,120
the rumors that Gu Jingyuan's

321
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,800
doing this to fight for the inheritance?

322
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,520
What do you think?

323
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,440
Yeah. What's your take?

324
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,640
I'm handing Gu's Group to Jingyuan

325
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,000
not just because

326
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,200
he's my son,

327
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,960
but because of

328
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,760
his ability

329
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,200
and my trust in him.

330
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,410
All these years,

331
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,040
he's been dedicated

332
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,400
to both the company

333
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,920
and the Gu family.

334
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,560
But

335
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,520
Gu Jingyuan is your adopted son,

336
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,440
and Qiao Yan is your granddaughter.

337
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,600
If they get married,

338
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,360
wouldn't that—

339
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,600
Let me answer that.

340
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,320
Everyone,

341
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,680
I don't want any speculations

342
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,060
or misunderstandings

343
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,000
to make my dad worried

344
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,360
or my fiancee

345
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,760
wronged.

346
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:01,960
So,

347
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,280
I hereby announce

348
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm giving up my status
as the Gu's adopted son.

349
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,120
Grandpa,

350
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,160
tell me.

351
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,920
Why did you suddenly agree?

352
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,400
What?

353
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,120
Don't you want me to?

354
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,800
Of course I do.

355
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,920
Maybe I should go back

356
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,180
and talk to them again?

357
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,200
I see.

358
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
Did you discuss it beforehand

359
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,090
without telling me?

360
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
Jingyuan told me not to tell you.

361
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,570
He didn't want you to worry.

362
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,440
Whether I'm Dad's son

363
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,080
or

364
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,000
your husband,

365
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,730
I'm still part of the Gu family, right?

366
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,280
That's great.

367
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,570
I wish you both the best.

368
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,250
From now on, you're in charge of

369
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,720
your own lives.

370
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,420
Thank you, Dad.

371
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,970
Thank you, Grandpa.

372
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,560
We'll be happy, for sure.

373
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,380
These old foxes

374
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,900
are so tough to handle.

375
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,320
No matter how cunning they are,

376
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,280
they still ended up

377
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,480
tamed by you, Mr. Qin.

378
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,760
Oh, by the way,

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,330
the violin has arrived.

380
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,800
The violin made by the master
is really different.

381
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,120
All credit goes to you.

382
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,200
Ordinary people
can't buy it even with money.

383
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,080
The one who receives it

384
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,280
must be very touched.

385
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,200
By the way,

386
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,300
any news from Xijiang lately?

387
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,900
Does this gossip about

388
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,050
