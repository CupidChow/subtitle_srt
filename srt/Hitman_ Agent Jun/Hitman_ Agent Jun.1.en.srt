1
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:21,391
<i>They usually listen with punishment,</i>
<i>but this kid is a tough one.</i>

2
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,059
He has no fear.

3
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,895
He beat up three ninth graders at once.

4
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,230
They're way bigger.

5
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,149
What about his parents?

6
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,568
His dad was an Olympic
Tae Kwon Do athlete.

7
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,320
His mom was an Olympic gymnast.

8
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,947
They both died in a car accident.

9
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,326
A truck driver nodded off
and hit their car.

10
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,579
Luckily or not, only the kid survived.

11
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,331
I heard you're looking for a kid like him.

12
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,253
You know, this is top secret.

13
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,431
I heard you're quite the fighter.

14
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,603
You crushed some ninth graders?

15
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,149
Your dad's name is Kim Tae-seung, right?

16
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,777
Do you know my dad?

17
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,947
Tae Kwon Do silver medalist,
Kim Tae-seung.

18
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,992
He brought honor to our country.

19
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,369
What do you want to be?

20
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,415
A Tae Kwon Do athlete like your dad?

21
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,920
You have the guts to win gold.

22
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,381
I just want to draw cartoons.

23
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,424
Cartoons?

24
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,847
-Why do you want to draw cartoons?
-Because it makes me feel good.

25
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,060
When I draw, I forget everything.

26
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,355
Bad things don't come to mind.

27
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,703
What nonsense.

28
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:12,293
A man should dream big, you know.

29
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,588
What? Cartoons?

30
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,885
Don't you want to honor
our country like your dad?

31
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,751
You're coming with me.

32
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,507
COUNTERTERRORISM SECURITY AGENCY

33
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,675
Jason Lee.

34
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,177
From North Korea,
the Middle East, and Central Asia,

35
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,889
we've confirmed 38 terrorist attacks
and abductions so far.

36
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,766
He's a worldwide terrorist.

37
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,436
His nationality is unclear,
but he is a native Korean.

38
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,231
A few years ago,
Agent Jun caught him in Vladivostok.

39
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,692
Though Jun lost him,

40
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,403
Jason was hurt and scarred badly.

41
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,698
He's the one

42
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,908
behind the Hansem Bank explosion
yesterday.

43
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,411
So far, we've confirmed 27 casualties.

44
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,954
Fortunately,

45
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,708
Jason's brother, who bombed it
on his command, was caught.

46
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:38,004
It was our ace Agent Jun's solo mission.

47
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,505
Jun.

48
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:49,724
We must eliminate Jason
for the innocent victims he killed.

49
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:50,808
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

50
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,563
CARTOON CONTEST

51
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,458
<i>Code Nine. Return to base.</i>

52
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,717
What if he dies, sir?

53
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,094
I have to make him talk.

54
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,138
Dozens of innocent people died
because of them.

55
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,559
We got a tip that his brother's ship
will soon leave from Busan.

56
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,562
Eliminate him before he leaves our waters.

57
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,526
Cheol!

58
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,615
You've grown so much.

59
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,325
What brings you here?

60
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,494
This is part of your training.

61
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,663
-Watch carefully.
-Yes, sir.

62
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:58,209
He's the next ace of the Shield Team
who will follow in your footsteps.

63
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,627
You're my idol, sir!

64
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,962
What idol...

65
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,507
You and I were just dragged in here.

66
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,135
-We were chosen, sir!
-Right.

67
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,475
He's dead, sir!

68
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,645
Get ready to eliminate Jason tonight.

69
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,563
Yes, sir.

70
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,375
Three minutes to the drop zone.

71
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,793
This is too dangerous.

72
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,795
Shouldn't you request to stop the mission?

73
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,422
Think they'll let me stop?

74
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,507
Stick to the operation.

75
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,052
If I should die on the job...

76
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,513
my funeral portrait.

77
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,434
That won't happen, sir.

78
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,354
You never know what fate will bring us.

79
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,065
Go!

80
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,072
Agent Jun,
it's dangerous! Open your chute!

81
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,159
What? It's not opening!

82
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,495
<i>Try it again! Hurry!</i>

83
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,301
Jun!

84
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,225
The country is indebted to you.

85
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,145
We'll never forget your sacrifice.

86
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,482
Agents.

87
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,943
Salute.

88
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,616
I really respected you.

89
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,201
Now,

90
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,746
I hope you draw...

91
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,417
in heaven...

92
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,380
all you want.

93
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,753
<i>I can start a new life!</i>

94
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,880
<i>I'm going after my dream!</i>

95
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,633
<i>I'm going to be a hotshot cartoonist!</i>

96
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,010
<i>Let's go!</i>

97
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:09,900
15 YEARS LATER

98
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,343
I'm screwed.

99
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,221
What do I do? There's no time.

100
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,019
EDITOR

101
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,447
-Hello?
<i>-Why haven't you sent it yet?</i>

102
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,324
<i>Is it a masterpiece or something?</i>

103
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,743
Sorry, sir. I'd like to send it,

104
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,621
but the last part is boring.

105
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,582
<i>I'm cutting your pay for it being late.</i>

106
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,543
What? Cut my pay?

107
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,047
It's not much. You know my situation, sir.

108
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,965
<i>Then what about the company's situation?</i>

109
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,968
<i>You get no ratings or views,</i>
<i>and you're always late!</i>

110
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,013
<i>I covered your ass</i>
<i>to get you this far, you know?</i>

111
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,100
Of course, sir. I'm always thankful.

112
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,019
<i>Then meet the deadline at least.</i>

113
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,480
Sorry, sir. I'll send it by noon.

114
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,316
You idiot!

115
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,945
I told you to pay the bills on time.

116
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,697
Must I do this, too?

117
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,616
I forgot because of my deadline.

118
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,868
Did I ask you to make money to pay for it?

119
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,414
Can't you even go and pay
with my hard-earned money?

120
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,873
You can't even do that?

121
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,127
-I was going to--
-Stop making me so mad!

122
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,337
You're angry and stressed.

123
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,922
Sit down.

124
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,591
You gotta relax it, or it'll get worse.

125
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,301
You're too tense.

126
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,429
It hurts! Forget it.

127
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,432
-Honey?
-I'm late!

128
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,350
I'll pay this today.

129
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,268
You'd better.

130
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,980
Make sure Ga-yeong eats
before going to school.

131
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,442
Don't worry.
Aren't you forgetting something?

132
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,738
She doesn't have
an appetite these days.

133
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,823
We're out of toilet paper and soap, too.

134
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,410
This won't be enough.

135
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,833
How's the webtoon coming along?

136
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,128
I'm working hard on it.

137
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,422
Don't worry. It'll be good.

138
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,507
Right.

139
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,969
Don't work too hard.

140
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,388
I'm the only one who does.

141
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,853
Ga-yeong!

142
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,276
Don't sleep with these on.
Wake up. It's time for school.

143
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:58,986
You'll be late.

144
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,030
Why you...

145
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,365
-Stop it!
-Wake up.

146
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,619
-Stop it!
-Tickle! Tickle!

147
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,678
Did you write rap lyrics all night again?

148
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,348
You have to sleep at night to grow.

149
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,185
You stay up all night drawing webtoons.

150
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,478
It's to make money.

151
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,649
You don't even make much.

152
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,734
Mom yells at you every day.

153
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,696
What has that woman
been saying to the kid?

154
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:44,865
Ga-yeong.

155
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,951
I've still got it.

156
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,954
You want an electric piano, right?

157
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll make a hit and buy you the best one!

158
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,294
What?

159
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,841
Me winning as best rapper
on <i>Show Me the Money </i>would be faster.

160
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,927
What? Wait! Eat!

161
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:05,970
I'm late.

162
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,390
She's becoming more like her mom.

163
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,657
The ending is missing something.

164
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,996
What is it? How frustrating.

00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,477
<i>-Who is this webtoon artist?</i>
<i>-What a waste of time.</i>

182
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,147
<i>Your fans are rooting for you!</i>

183
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,066
<i>Cheer up!</i>

184
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,028
<i>Are you the artist?</i>

185
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:28,946
No, I'm not.

186
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,240
<i>Yes, you are. It's so obvious.</i>

187
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,366
<i>Why live?</i>

188
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,702
<i>It's obvious who wrote this.</i>

189
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,621
<i>Grow up! Go to hell!</i>

190
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,583
Should I track their IPs and kill them?

191
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,980
Kim Ga-yeong!

192
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,989
Ga-yeong!

193
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,409
-Watch where you're going!
-I'm sorry.

194
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,703
Shit! That was close!

195
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,167
Not again!
I told you to keep the volume down!

196
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,003
I forgot. I was into the song.

197
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,504
That's what happened before!

198
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,215
You could get in an accident!
I'm taking these.

199
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,012
Did you smoke again?

200
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,307
-No, I didn't.
-I'm gonna tell mom.

201
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,308
Hold on.

202
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,810
It was a long day for me.

203
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,104
Today was my deadline.

204
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,732
Let's make a deal. Don't tell your mom.

205
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,236
Wait up.

206
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:52,905
Stop it.

207
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,531
Why?

208
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,076
Hey!

209
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,912
My shoe's coming off. Wait for me!

210
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:04,249
By any chance, did you see my webtoon?

211
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,212
-Yup.
-You did?

212
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,632
Why? You don't have to.

213
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,008
You worked hard, Dad.

214
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,343
It's okay.

215
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:16,887
How was it?

216
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,140
Honestly?

217
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:21,892
Honestly.

218
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,019
I read it with my friends.

219
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,980
What did they say?

220
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,109
They said it sucks.

221
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:40,577
Why not just tell your story, Dad?
Like on <i>Show Me the Money.</i>

222
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,829
What?

223
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,124
It's cool when rappers
talk about their stories.

224
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,917
It's not the same.

225
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,255
I'm writing my story in my raps.

226
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,092
Why don't you draw your story?

227
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,510
Be real.

228
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,346
If I tell my story...

229
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,683
all of Korea will flip out.

230
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,600
Ga-yeong!

231
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,229
-I gotta go.
-Okay.

232
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,399
Don't read the comments. You'll get hurt.

233
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,486
Don't read them! Never, ever!

234
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,240
Right. You, too.

235
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,002
Hello, sir.

236
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,547
Please end the series in the next episode.

237
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,506
Drop the rest.

238
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,424
What?

239
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,551
But we had a deal.

240
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,053
It'll catch on like fire soon, sir.

241
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,847
Thanks to you, I've become famous.

242
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,224
I got over 20,000 comments.
They're all insults.

243
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,270
No, sir. Let me keep it going!

244
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,607
As an editor,
I thought you'd make it someday.

245
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,234
I supported you until now,
but I can't do it anymore.

246
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,361
Please! Don't can my webtoon!

247
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,280
-<i>It'll go viral.</i>
-Doubt it.

248
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,032
-Please wait... Sir!
-<i>It's over.</i>

249
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,201
Hello?

250
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,952
Hey! Wait!

251
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,163
No!

252
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,843
Hey!

253
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,179
Loser!

254
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:27,017
You call that digging?

255
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,979
Lazy bum! Do it right!

256
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,940
Think digging is a joke?

257
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,026
Didn't you learn anything in the army?

258
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,736
Damn it.

259
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,155
If you slack off, you're dead!

260
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,577
Damn it.

261
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,331
When did I slack off?

262
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,542
If it weren't for my family,
I'd kill that piece of...

263
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,835
Freeze!

264
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,462
What did you just say?

265
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,923
Did you just call me a piece of shit?

266
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,219
You son of a bitch!

267
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,845
Lazy bum.

268
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:05,931
Look down.

269
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,183
Don't stare at me!

270
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,816
I was singing.

271
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,236
Right. I know that pop song.

272
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,990
-I'll work hard, sir.
-Good.

273
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:29,955
Jeez. Oh, God.

274
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,171
<i>About as much</i>
<i>as the first-year salary of a company.</i>

275
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:42,509
I can't even buy a piano for my daughter.

276
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,474
Stupid! What are you doing?

277
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,437
<i>I started out with 600,000 won a month,</i>
<i>then made more with a series.</i>

278
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,314
<i>I bought my mother a house.</i>

279
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,857
<i>I paid off her loans.</i>

280
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,693
<i>I bought her a mid-sized sedan.</i>
<i>I bought myself a place.</i>

281
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,321
What does Kian84 have that I don't?

282
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,243
THIS IS WORSE THAN TERRIBLE

283
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:09,995
You bastards.

284
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,496
<i>This is just garbage.</i>

285
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,457
<i>I can't even recycle this.</i>

286
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,125
<i>I lost my appetite.</i>

287
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,169
<i>Go clean at Kian84's company.</i>

288
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,254
-<i>This is worthless.</i>
-<i>What a waste of my data.</i>

289
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,797
<i>Get lost, jerk!</i>

290
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,341
<i>Why live?</i>

291
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,676
<i>It's cool when rappers</i>
<i>talk about their stories.</i>

292
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,387
<i>Draw out your story. Be real.</i>

293
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,230
How dare they! What do you jerks know?

294
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,358
I'm scary as hell! Damn it!

295
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,236
I'll show them who I really am!

296
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,364
You're all dead.

297
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,251
Welcome, lads.

298
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,713
I'm the legendary trainer from hell,
Cheon Deok-kyu.

299
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,673
Now, you must all be reborn

300
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,176
as the Shield Team to protect our country.

301
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,969
Anyone who falls behind

302
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,722
will be sent back
to your wretched realities!

303
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,105
<i>Be stronger than anyone else!</i>

304
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,573
<i>Never give up!</i>

305
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,787
<i>No matter what comes your way,</i>

306
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,456
<i>finish your given missions!</i>

307
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,459
<i>Don't be afraid of death!</i>

308
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,970
<i>You must be reborn</i>
<i>as the ultimate Shield Team!</i>

309
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:57,227
<i>The Shield Team is our top weapon</i>
<i>made with billions of won in funding.</i>

310
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,481
<i>Remember, you're human weapons!</i>

311
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,120
You've finally reached this point.

312
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,541
This is the last gateway
to becoming a Shield Team agent. Fight!

313
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,009
What did I do next?

314
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,495
I've still got it!

315
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,467
Incredible!

316
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,177
I knew I was right about you!

317
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,971
Now, you're the ace of the Shield Team!

318
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,725
Go! Shield Team Agent Jun!

319
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,105
SPECIAL AGENT JUN

320
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:37,869
We have guests?

321
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,958
You must be so tired.

322
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,751
I made you some food.

323
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,462
I tried to wake you,
but you wouldn't get up.

324
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,216
You must be exhausted.

325
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,467
Sit here.

326
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,096
Honey.

327
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,475
I've been so hard on you these days.

328
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,102
I'm sorry.

329
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,772
You're scaring me.

330
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:11,069
I knew you'd make it someday.

331
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,696
Make what?

332
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:14,990
It's good.

333
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:20,912
Your new webtoon is awesome.
Why had you kept the idea to yourself?

334
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,039
What new webtoon?

335
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,293
Are you still drunk? Look.

336
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,253
-It tastes good.
-Really?

337
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:31,339
Look. It looks like it'll be a hit!

338
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,811
Why is this uploaded here?

339
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:49,107
You fell asleep,
so I sent it all in for you.

340
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,318
You can thank me.

341
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,695
Are you nuts? Why did you send that?

342
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,740
-I didn't draw that to be sent!
-Then Why did you draw it?

343
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,867
Why yell at me for helping you?

344
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,870
Hey! Look at all the comments!

345
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,871
THIS WEBTOON ROCKS!

346
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,247
This is new to you, huh?

347
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,707
I don't believe this.

348
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,084
-You said it.
-It can't be.

349
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,338
-What?
-Please take it down or I'll die!

350
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,883
You topped the ranking for once!
Why? Are you nuts?

351
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,510
I was drunk. I didn't mean to send it.

352
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,055
-Please, sir.
-I knew it! You drew it drunk!

353
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,723
You're a true artist now.

354
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,893
Draw again drunk. I'll pay for the drinks!

355
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,228
-This is great.
-Please! It's personal!

356
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,898
Cut the nonsense
and go draw the next episode!

357
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,066
I'm busy!

358
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,734
Sir...

359
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,819
Forget it.

360
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,823
Hello, sir.

361
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,784
<i>Special Agent Jun?</i> You saw it?

362
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,411
Go! Yes, sir.

363
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,872
I told you he'd make it big someday.

364
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:46,998
Today's the day!

365
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,959
Yes, sir.

366
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,503
Sir?

367
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:52,962
Leave!

368
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,631
Go and draw!

369
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,930
I give up.

370
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,896
Ga-yeong didn't take an umbrella.

371
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:17,779
Ga-yeong...

372
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,365
-Daddy!
-Hello.

373
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,326
Wanna come over to my house?

374
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,036
My dad bought me a VR machine.

375
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,413
-Really?
-Yes.

376
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,291
But where's my dad?
He always comes when it rains.

377
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,210
Your dad didn't come today?

378
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,213
Does he still draw cartoons?

379
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,507
Yes.

380
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,425
<i>Let's go.</i>

381
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,217
NEVER LOOK INSIDE!

382
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,845
IF YOU FLIP ONE MORE PAGE, YOU'RE DEAD!

383
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,519
MONEY, MONEY

384
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,105
<i>What the heck is money?</i>

385
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,775
<i>Why is money so far from reach</i>
<i>For my family?</i>

386
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,401
<i>Mom always says to me</i>

387
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,613
<i>If I study well, I'll be happy</i>

388
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,407
<i>But I know the truth in life, you see</i>

389
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,076
<i>Only money will make you live worry-free</i>

390
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,788
<i>It's all about money</i>

391
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,791
<i>Without it you're sad and weary</i>

392
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,043
<i>Mom and dad's fights</i>

393
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,712
<i>Mom drinking at nights</i>

394
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,423
<i>They wouldn't happen if we had money</i>

395
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,510
<i>So I'll enter Show Me the Money</i>

396
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,137
<i>I gotta win to pay off dad's debt</i>

397
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,723
<i>Gotta get rich and set</i>

398
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,767
<i>I'm here on the show for my family</i>

399
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,561
<i>I got the mic, so show me the money</i>

400
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,986
I'll die someday anyway.

401
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,076
I've got to provide for my family.

402
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,955
My family means more.

403
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,412
Watch the beautiful spectacle.

404
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,707
The whole world will know who I am!

405
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,971
Jun! Get that bastard!

406
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,176
Scram!

407
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,053
Kill him!

408
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,686
That son of a bitch.

409
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,113
Step on it!

410
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,188
Jun. I'll kill him!

411
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,941
Jun!

412
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,835
Jun!

413
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,300
What are you doing?

414
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,851
-What's this?
-Look!

415
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,477
It's awesome.

416
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,402
It's incredible.

417
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,073
Tell me. Please?

418
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,409
Ta-da!

419
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,120
What's this?

420
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,040
-Like it?
-Yes!

421
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,548
How do you do?

422
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,341
NIS, CHEON DEOK-KYU

423
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,262
-There's been a terrorist threat.
-A terrorist threat?

424
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:20,475
A bomb threat was posted
on the government's site.

425
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,768
We tracked the IP address

426
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,936
and found it was posted
from here an hour ago.

427
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,730
Where is this computer?

428
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,565
Stall 14.

429
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,910
Your ID is "Handsome Boss 18"?

430
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:39,911
Yes.

431
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,538
Are you really an NIS agent?

432
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,833
-You don't look like it.
-Don't lie.

433
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,754
You can't be an agent.
The NIS agents in webtoons are so cool.

434
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,881
You can't be!

435
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,550
What's with him?

436
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,468
Here.

437
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,178
Cheon Deok-kyu?

438
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,222
It's the same name
as the trainer from hell.

439
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,226
You're right. Trainer of the Shield Team.

440
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,521
How do you kids know that?

441
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,606
That's top secret!

442
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,817
Who doesn't know
the Shield Team these days?

443
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,568
The Shield Team is totally hot.

444
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,071
-What?
-Look.

445
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:20,743
What's this?

446
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,496
What...

447
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,082
Who drew this?

448
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,710
The Shield Team project.
Kids raised as human weapons?

449
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,589
You brought orphans
and raised them as killers?

450
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,841
This is insane.

451
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,510
I got a call
from the President to come here.

452
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,303
Chief Cheon.

453
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,264
Explain yourself.

454
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,474
The project was terminated
a long time ago.

455
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,809
And it's not all true, sir.

456
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,895
I don't know who drew it,
but it's fabricated.

457
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,524
Especially, about me...

458
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,402
What if the press snoops around?

459
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,529
Who knows what else he'll draw?

460
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,241
Are you kidding me?

461
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,411
You know about the Shield Team.

462
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,164
Who made it here
without knowing about that?

463
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,875
Why pretend you don't know?

464
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,211
That bastard. Who could it be?

465
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,213
I can guess who the bastard is.

466
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,717
The agent who was sent
on all the missions in the webtoon.

467
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,718
There's only one.

468
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,802
You mean, Jun?

469
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,096
Jun died during a mission, sir.

470
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,347
His body was never found!

471
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,392
Listen. You've all been tricked by him.

472
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,353
-He's pretending to be dead?
-That makes no sense.

473
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,771
If he faked his death,

474
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,648
then why would he disclose his story?

475
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,359
-He'd be exposing himself.
-There is a reason.

476
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,612
It's obviously for money.

477
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,948
Another agent of ours died last week.

478
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,283
His eye was gouged out.

479
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,286
An investigative team
is searching for the suspect.

480
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,706
-Why are you bringing that up?
-He was from the Shield Team like Jun.

481
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,166
And the other murdered agents.

482
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,667
That's true, but...

483
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,378
Exposing the Shield Team
at a time like this?

484
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,340
Think that's just a coincidence?

485
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:03,054
You mean our agents getting killed
has to do with this webtoon?

486
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,724
Anything can be sold for money.
If Jun is the one who drew this,

487
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,102
it means he sold out the agents who died.

488
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,356
Who was close with him on the Shield Team?

489
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:17,318
Agent Cheol was sent to another team
once the project was terminated.

490
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,863
He's the last of the Shield Team.

491
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,823
He'll be useful in catching Jun.

492
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,576
Call him in now.

493
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,836
That's him, right?

494
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,547
He's totally hot.

495
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,098
Cheer up!

496
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,435
-You can do it!
-Oh, my!

497
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,272
This is crazy!

498
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,400
-What if he has a girlfriend?
-He's so cute.

499
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,531
Chief? I told you Sasha is not here.

500
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,659
He gets the royal treatment in Russia.
Why would he come here?

501
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,829
I stink.
I haven't been able to wash in a week.

502
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,665
Why use the ace of the team as a bum?

503
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,252
<i>What kind of crap is that?</i>
<i>Who says you're the ace? Come back now.</i>

504
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,336
Really?

505
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,755
Did Sasha appear? Where is that bastard?

506
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,173
<i>The real ace appeared.</i>

507
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,175
<i>-I think Jun is alive.</i>
-What?

508
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,219
Jun...

509
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,097
-Let's come back tomorrow.
-He's dreamy.

510
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,645
Thank you. Don't forget me.

511
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,150
-I won't forget!
-Oh, my!

512
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:47,241
-Wait!
-We love you!

513
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,876
Jeez!

514
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,756
-People should knock as a courtesy.
<i>-</i>Are you the editor of <i>Special Agent Jun?</i>

515
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,300
Yes. What is this about?

516
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,470
-We're from the NIS.
-The NIS?

517
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,848
Do you know this man?

518
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,893
Well...

519
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,480
He looks familiar, but I'm not sure.

520
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,898
Look carefully!

521
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,274
He drew it, didn't he?

522
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,070
Maybe he resembles Mr. Kim.

523
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,237
Or maybe not.

524
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,073
The hair is so different.

525
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,449
Look closely.

526
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,327
Mr. Kim is not dandy like this.

527
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,621
-Got a picture of him?
-No.

528
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,915
He's a very private person.

529
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,875
He's very private?

530
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,127
He must be Jun.

531
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,465
Did Mr. Kim do something wrong?
I should know what's going on.

532
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,758
He's a spy.

533
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,469
What? A spy?

534
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,140
Mr. Kim can't be a spy. It makes no sense.

535
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,852
What is this? <i>Candid Camera?</i>

536
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,146
-No way!
-Are you nuts?

537
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,317
-My arm! That hurts!
-You must cooperate with us.

538
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,161
-Yes?
-<i>Mr. Kim.</i>

539
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,372
Good work.

540
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,792
The new episode is a hit, too.

541
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:24,255
<i>It's awkward to be popular</i>
<i>after all the bad comments.</i>

542
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,883
You lazy bum!
Can't you see everyone else working hard?

543
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,011
-Hang up!
-I'll call you later, sir.

544
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,723
If you slack off again, you're dead.
Start digging!

545
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,394
You're not even worth one punch.

546
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,278
Should I just bury him?

547
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,705
Have you seen this man?

548
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,458
He's working over there.

549
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,338
-Jun?
-Is that him?

550
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,132
Yes.

551
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,175
It's him. Get him!

552
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,217
Get him!

553
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,436
Mr. Kim Bong-jun?

554
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,522
What?

555
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,567
My name is Kim Su-hyeok.
You've got the wrong man.

556
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,820
We know you're Kim Bong-jun.
Or should I call you...

557
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,363
Special Agent Jun?

558
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,496
You'll have to come with us,

559
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,331
Mr. Kim Bong-jun.

560
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,208
-I'm not him.
-The lazy bum?

561
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,336
That's him. Seize him!

562
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,451
Oh, no...

563
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,926
He's leaving! Change cameras!

564
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,804
What the hell!

565
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,682
Change it!

566
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:47,314
Teams B and C, tail him carefully.
Remember, he's a class above you.

567
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,239
Honey?

568
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,284
Ga-yeong isn't home from school yet.
We gotta run! Come pack now!

569
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:02,162
-What's wrong?
-Why did you send in my webtoon?

570
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:03,789
That's my story.

571
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,583
I'm Special Agent Jun!

572
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,959
What the hell do you mean?

573
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,587
<i>We have to leave the country.</i>
<i>We'll change our names.</i>

574
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,966
You wanted plastic surgery, right?
It's your chance to become pretty.

575
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:14,883
What!

576
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,094
Are you drunk again?

577
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,889
I'm sick of your crap!
I have to teach my class.

578
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,641
Who cares about teaching now?

579
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,143
Shut up!

580
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,811
I'm Special Agent Jun!

581
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,731
Honey? She doesn't believe me.

582
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:29,940
I'm Jun!

583
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,453
By any chance...

584
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:27,998
Are you Cheol?

585
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,628
You've grown so much.
I almost didn't recognize--

586
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,386
Gotcha, you bastard.

587
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,221
Mr. Kim is a spy?

588
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,849
What's going on?

589
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,559
Who are you?

590
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,940
The fool who drew this works here, right?

591
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,777
Not again.
I told them everything earlier.

592
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,364
Please stop bothering me.
The NIS can't coerce citizens like this.

593
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:02,950
The NIS?

594
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,370
What? Who's smoking in my office?

595
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,624
People have no manners.

596
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,674
The NIS bastards were here?

597
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:20,676
Wait a minute.

598
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,179
Are you Jason from the webtoon?

599
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:28,767
The details are strikingly similar.
Is this cosplay?

600
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,853
You think?

601
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,772
I think so, too.

602
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,441
What?

603
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,740
I want the fool who drew it.

604
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,701
No one else seems to know.

605
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,494
But...

606
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,872
They said you'd know.

607
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:54,001
It's personal information.
I can't tell you.

608
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,548
Want me to make your face like mine?

609
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:04,678
It hurts!

610
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,346
Help!

611
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,432
COUNTERTERRORISM SECURITY AGENCY 3

612
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,818
Smoke bombs
and stun guns to catch a civilian?

613
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,320
You're not just a civilian.

614
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,406
I wanted to become just like you.

615
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,827
How could you deceive us like that?

616
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:30,913
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

617
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,415
I had no choice.

618
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,666
This whole time...

619
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,795
I thought you were gone.

620
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,967
Why did you do that?

621
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,805
Because there was no way out but to die.

622
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,557
Do you still do hit jobs?

623
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,351
Things have changed, sir.

624
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,269
After you disappeared,

625
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,565
the project was
terminated a few years later.

626
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,070
-I'm the last of the Shield Team.
-That's good to hear.

627
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,783
You were dragged in like me.

628
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,201
Worry about yourself, sir.

629
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,079
You've been arrested
for betraying the state.

630
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,670
It's been a while, Chief.

631
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,721
Why did you screw us over?
Why did you draw the webtoon?

632
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,392
If I tell you, will you believe me?

633
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,478
Why did you leave?
I invested so much in you.

634
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,064
I wanted to live the life I want.

635
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,359
-If only just once.
-The life you want?

636
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,444
So you lived your life
drawing damn cartoons?

637
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,156
What's wrong with that?
I told you a million times. It's my dream!

638
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,241
That bastard.

639
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,410
After the millions spent on you,

640
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,828
webtoons?

641
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,079
Are you out of your mind?

642
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,207
You used me more than enough!

643
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,961
Do you know how much blood is on my hands?

644
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,631
Enough!

645
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,349
Spill it.

646
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,352
How much did you get
for exposing the Shield Team?

647
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,689
It got posted by accident
when I got drunk.

648
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:24,735
-I had no ulterior motive.
-You don't even make 500,000 won a month?

649
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,529
That's it for the man of the house?

650
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:31,199
How irresponsible.
If you can't provide, why have a kid?

651
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,244
How embarrassing
to mooch off your wife like that.

652
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,664
So you must've been desperate
to do anything for a big payout.

653
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,626
It all fits together.

654
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:46,715
-You sold out your fellow agents.
-Stop trying to write a story.

655
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,968
How dare you.
You think I'm joking here?

656
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:55,140
Want me to make
your kid an orphan like you?

657
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,850
You son of a bitch!

658
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,145
-Kill him.
-Sir!

659
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,188
Let go!

660
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,689
Let's talk outside, sir.

661
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,494
Viper?

662
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,997
Is it a code name?

663
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,166
Someone you work with, sir?

664
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,210
An agent or a killer?

665
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,211
The missus.

666
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,090
Missus? Mississippi?

667
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,217
My wife, stupid.

668
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,221
I take her calls right away.
Let me talk to her.

669
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,266
No more favors.

670
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,311
Honey?

671
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,940
Don't talk.
Just listen, or your wife will die.

672
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,152
<i>How does it feel to be back there?</i>

673
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,363
Honey! Who are these men?

674
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,992
If you want to save your wife,
do what I say.

675
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:55,993
Got that?

676
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,287
-Fine.
-<i>I don't like your tone.</i>

677
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,584
Okay. I'm listening.

678
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,045
<i>You got caught by the NIS, right?</i>

679
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,922
<i>I'll give you 20 minutes.</i>

680
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,342
<i>Bring Chief Cheon</i>
<i>and come to Guryong Tunnel.</i>

681
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,928
-That's going to be tough.
-Can't do it?

682
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,889
Want me to make it easier for you?

683
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,643
<i>Bring the bastard to me now.</i>

684
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:26,231
For every five minutes that you're late,
the bitch will lose a finger.

685
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,983
<i>When all her fingers are gone,</i>

686
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,778
what should I cut off next?

687
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,493
VIPER

688
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,411
Done?

689
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,623
Some agents went to your house.

690
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,460
They'll bring your family here soon.

691
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,838
Fine. I'm a traitor.

692
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,798
I'm a spy.

693
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,926
I'll confess everything. Call the Chief.

694
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:59,514
Chief, Jun says he'll confess
to his espionage activities.

695
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,266
-What?
-But...

696
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,893
He'll only talk to you, sir.

697
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,277
Tell me everything that happened.

698
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,361
May I have one?

699
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,159
I'm sorry.

700
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,036
That idiot!

701
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,923
I knew you were a traitor.

702
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,050
What are you really after?

703
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:35,967
Drop your guns.

704
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,971
You're going way too far. Stop now.

705
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:40,889
Drop the guns.

706
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:46,228
Want to see a hole in his head? Drop them.

707
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,321
Come inside.

708
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,330
Drop the gun.

709
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,498
Are you okay, sir?

710
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,625
Do I look okay? Shoot the bastard.

711
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,419
-Just shoot him.
-Wait.

712
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,880
-Just shoot him once.
-Drop the gun!

713
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,390
Stupid idiot.

714
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,103
I told you to shoot him!

715
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,484
Okay, fine.

716
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,077
Stop!

717
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,539
Shut the building down.

718
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,374
Don't let him get away!

719
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,630
What are you doing?

720
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,965
Come on.

721
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,183
Uncuff me. I'm not a criminal.

722
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,642
Hold on tight.

723
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,907
Did you get caught on purpose?
Was your goal to abduct me?

724
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,408
My wife has been abducted.

725
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,160
What? By whom?

726
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,454
I don't know.
If I don't bring you, she'll die.

727
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,831
So? You'll hand me over?

728
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:34,127
If you do, we're all dead. You know that.

729
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,761
Give me your phone.
I don't want them tracking us.

730
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,846
I left it at the office.

731
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,264
I came without it.

732
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,558
I don't have it. Hey!

733
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,143
Why you!

734
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,061
I left it!

735
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,479
Don't touch me!

736
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,814
How rude.

737
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,191
Watch the road!

738
00:53:57,025 --> 00:54:00,487
The target is the most elite agent
we've ever had. Brace yourselves.

739
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,281
He is a human weapon trained to kill.

740
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,285
All agents are permitted to kill him.

741
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,373
We found him, sir! He's headed northeast
from Ilwon Intersection.

742
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,540
Send his location.

743
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,461
Teams A and B, tail him!

744
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,728
Watch out!

745
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,358
Car! Look out!

746
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:08,722
Holy shit!

747
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,284
I'm going into Guryong Tunnel soon.

748
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:32,454
You've got a long tail behind you.

749
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:33,872
Cut it off inside the tunnel.

750
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,040
Is my wife okay?

751
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,708
Worried?

752
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,585
Then you should hurry.

753
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,259
He went into the tunnel.

754
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,221
All teams, after him!

755
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,691
Chief!

756
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,450
-Shit.
-Looking for me?

757
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,537
They came so fast.

758
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,463
Legendary special agent, Jun.

759
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,715
I'm sick of hearing about you.

760
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,760
-Yes, I was a legend.
-Let's see what you've got.

761
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,645
That's it? You're disappointing.

762
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,155
I retired 15 years ago.

763
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,574
Why did you surface and cause hell!

764
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,498
Let go, bastard!

765
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,126
Where's your respect? Wanna die?

766
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,389
You'll catch hell for this.

767
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,229
-Move! Out of my way!
-I'm sorry. Please run.

768
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,605
I'm borrowing your car.

769
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,023
Run, mister.

770
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,191
Run! Hurry!

771
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,319
Please! Don't shoot! Don't kill me!

772
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,591
<i>I got rid of them, sir.</i>

773
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,261
Any idea who's behind this?

774
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:56,264
Since he wants you,
it's someone holding a grudge against you.

775
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,724
What do you mean?

776
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,602
He abducted your wife,
so he must want your head!

777
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,479
He could've abducted your wife first.

778
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,608
-I don't have a wife.
-You got divorced?

779
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,028
You're still single?

780
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,992
Since you couldn't get married
and have no wife,

781
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,327
he abducted my wife!

782
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,288
Who says I couldn't?
I'm married to the state!

783
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,749
Too bad for the state!
This is all your fault!

784
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,585
Why is this my fault?
You exposed everything in your webtoon!

785
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,754
-That's why we're in this shit!
-I forgot!

786
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,257
What is it?

787
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,343
-My webtoon will be updated.
-What?

788
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,888
Jason's brother
and you are in this episode.

789
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,474
If that gets out, it'll get worse.

790
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,683
Hold on.

791
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,018
I'm dead meat.

792
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,275
I got a laser treatment yesterday.

793
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,069
Ow, my back!

794
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:57,325
CHIEF EDITOR PARK KYU-MAN

795
00:58:57,408 --> 00:59:00,912
Mr. Kim. I'm so sorry for everything.

796
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,457
I gave them your address.

797
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,877
How did they look?
Tell me anything you remember.

798
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:12,173
<i>One looked exactly</i>
<i>like the Jason character in your webtoon.</i>

799
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:14,717
Jason?

800
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,802
That sick psycho?

801
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:19,013
<i>The scar and burns looked brutal.</i>

802
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,140
Shit.

803
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,559
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

804
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:26,604
He said he'd gouge my eye out.
I had no choice.

805
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,941
It's not your fault.

806
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:30,900
<i>Still.</i>

807
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:35,655
Those bastards and the NIS agents
wanted the file for the next episode.

808
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,573
<i>You know what?</i>

809
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,909
I put my foot down
and said I don't have it.

810
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,786
I protected it with my life.

811
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:46,332
-Great! Way to go, sir!
-Thank you!

812
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,001
I owe you a meal!

813
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:51,504
Jason's brother is tortured to death
by the chief in the next episode.

814
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,300
-He kills him.
-If that gets out, I'm dead. Thank you!

815
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,927
I know how hard you worked on it.

816
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,762
We have to let the world see it!

817
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,723
That's why I updated it just now!

818
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:02,849
Huh?

819
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,142
-What?
-Where?

820
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:09,439
You found fame at last! You deserve this.

821
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,734
Crazy jerk! How can you post that?

822
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,193
Take it down right now!

823
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,989
Who are you to tell me
to take it down or not?

824
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:21,826
You stupid bastard!
Take the webtoon down now!

825
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:22,785
Why'd you post it!

826
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,203
"Stupid bastard"?

827
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,998
How dare you! I was in the Special Forces!

828
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,375
Want me to break your back in half?

829
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,628
I'm not buying you a meal! Never!

830
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,545
Dickhead.

831
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,673
-It's been updated!
-Where?

832
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,092
Hey.

833
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,844
-We're screwed.
-Am I in it?

834
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:41,012
Let me see.

835
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,043
Wait.

836
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:15,963
There must be a mistake.
You've got the wrong girl.

837
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,674
Aren't you Jun's wife?

838
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:18,716
No way, sir!

839
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:22,053
My husband's name is not Jun.
It's Su-hyeok.

840
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,012
Kim Su-hyeok.

841
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:26,766
He's just a lousy webtoon artist
who makes peanuts.

842
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:31,896
You're the one mistaken.
You chose the wrong husband.

843
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,902
They were all shot to death
in the head, sir.

844
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,571
They also have wounds from close combat.

845
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,073
What the hell!

846
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:46,661
If abducting Chief Cheon were the goal,
he wouldn't have had to do this.

847
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:49,455
He murdered them.

848
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,291
That malicious devil!

849
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,132
Director. Do you remember Jason Lee?

850
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,466
The crazy terrorist?

851
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,510
Jason is here in Korea.

852
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,347
The editor, who gave us the tip,
got beaten up by him.

853
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,392
-What?
-And this was just posted.

854
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:16,524
Now, the puzzle is coming together.
Jason is the one who gouged out

855
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,109
our agents' eyes and killed them.

856
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:20,862
And Jun gave
the agents' information to him!

857
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:23,448
-It can't be.
-You asshole!

858
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,532
Still don't get it?

859
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,325
He drew the webtoon on purpose!

860
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,286
To get into our headquarters!

861
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,662
We didn't catch him!

862
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,038
He let himself be caught.

863
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,999
-Did you trace the phone?
-It's off, sir.

864
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:34,584
You idiot!

865
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,461
Not his! Chief Cheon's!

866
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,421
His phone can't be traced, sir.

867
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,422
Damn it.

868
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,883
What about the kid?

869
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:43,760
She just arrived, sir.

870
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,512
-Let go!
-Call Chief Cheon now.

871
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,889
Let go!

872
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,852
The country hasn't given up on you.

873
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,813
There's still hope for you to be pardoned.

874
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:59,817
What kind of crap is that?
What has the country ever done for me?

875
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:05,740
What's that sound?

876
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:08,451
What is it?

877
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,286
Mine's turned off.

878
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:13,247
Isn't it the engine?

879
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:17,543
The car is so old.
This piece of junk is making weird sounds.

880
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,586
I don't think so.

881
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:30,431
What? You hid your cell phone here?

882
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,849
-No, I didn't.
-Take it out!

883
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:34,101
It's a light stick!

884
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,561
I'm serious!

885
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,480
-Don't touch it!
-Relax!

886
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,606
Don't touch that!

887
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:39,690
Stop!

888
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:43,444
-No!
<i>-Chief Cheon?</i>

889
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,032
Yes, Director!

890
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,200
I can explain--

891
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:51,410
What are you bastards doing?

892
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,539
<i>If you want your kid to live,</i>
<i>turn back now.</i>

893
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,500
-What the hell do you mean?
<i>-Dad?</i>

894
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,168
<i>Is that you, Dad?</i>

895
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:02,964
Ga-yeong! Where are you? Are you hurt?

896
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,298
-Stop.
-<i>Dad? Where are you?</i>

897
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,591
Ga-yeong! I love you!

898
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:09,637
If you touch one hair on her head,
you're dead!

899
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,973
-Damn bastards!
-Don't grab it.

900
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,520
What the!

901
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:22,984
<i>Where are you?</i>

902
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,987
-Are you okay?
-<i>I'm scared, Dad!</i>

903
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,572
Hold on. I'll come and get you.

904
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,866
<i>If you want to save her,</i>
<i>bring Cheon back now.</i>

905
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,785
<i>A traitor must still care about his kid.</i>

906
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,914
If you touch even one strand of her hair,
I'll kill you.

907
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,124
<i>-Is that so?</i>
-Hey--

908
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:45,840
<i>Dad!</i>

909
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:48,050
-<i>Help me!</i>
-What are you doing?

910
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,302
Dad!

911
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,803
Dad!

912
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,097
I would do anything for this country.

913
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:57,393
Think I care about the kid
of a traitor who killed my agents?

914
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:59,937
No! I didn't kill anyone.

915
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,898
Stop acting, asshole.

916
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,191
Bring Chief Cheon now!

917
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,735
<i>Or your kid dies!</i>

918
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:07,653
Stop it! Stop!

919
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,196
-Dad! Help me!
-Pull her up!

920
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,282
Dad!

921
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:12,909
Bring Chief Cheon now,

922
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,869
<i>if you want to save your kid.</i>

923
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,417
I'll kill you bastards!

924
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:28,549
Here comes your husband.

925
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:31,677
He came knowing he'll die.

926
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:38,392
Honey!

927
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,227
Don't come here!

928
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:44,106
Stop! Go back!

929
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:46,400
Run!

930
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:57,995
-I am sorry!
-Shit!

931
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,541
Where are you going?

932
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,047
Come back!

933
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,840
Why turn around?

934
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,389
I knew it!

935
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:21,602
I can't believe
I trusted that son of a bitch!

936
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,105
After everything I did
to support that jerk!

937
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,107
You son of a bitch!

938
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,775
Fine! I'll die alone.

939
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,277
<i>Something came up.</i>
<i>Please don't hurt my wife!</i>

940
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,864
What's with the U-turn?
Want me to kill your wife now?

941
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:34,824
No!

942
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:38,160
The NIS took my daughter.
That's why I turned around.

943
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,996
You expect me to believe that?

944
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,957
It's him, isn't it? Give me the phone!

945
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,959
I swear on my life.

946
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,585
I'll save my kid and come back.

947
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,921
Please don't hurt my wife.

948
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,965
How do you expect me to believe that?

949
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:55,136
I'm a traitor framed for murder
being chased by the NIS.

950
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,596
But it was all your doing.

951
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:02,184
Don't be late, or your wife dies.

952
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:07,064
Poor Mi-na. She trusted me...

953
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:11,027
You're crying?
You were cold-blooded before.

954
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:13,112
You've changed a lot.

955
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,406
-Are you that worried?
-Of course I am!

956
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:16,907
My wife...

957
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:21,662
She's a soft-hearted, gentle woman.

958
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,831
Damn it to hell!

959
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:29,253
I'm the crazy bitch
for having that asshole for a husband.

960
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:34,133
I'll kill that son of a bitch.

961
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:36,802
When I get out of here,

962
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,888
I'll kill you myself!

963
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,144
I have to get out.

964
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,626
Okay! Come on.

965
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:13,964
Okay. Got it.

966
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:31,440
-Get out. Stay still!
-Stop!

967
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,110
-What's going on?
-Let go! Stop it!

968
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,986
Sir! Who is she?

969
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,613
-The spy's kid.
-What?

970
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:39,198
-Come in.
-Let go!

971
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,122
But I don't think it's right
to abduct a kid, sir.

972
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,498
What?

973
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,376
Jun killed our agents.

974
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:52,211
How can you say that?

975
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,089
Honestly,
I don't think Jun killed them, sir.

976
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:56,924
Jun! Damn it!

977
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,052
Chief Cheon and now you?

978
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,054
Siding with your fellow Shield Team agent?

979
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,559
Check if she hid her phone.

980
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:09,478
Stop it! This is sexual harassment!
I'll report you!

981
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:10,980
-Stay still.
-Stop!

982
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:14,024
Stop. I'll do it.

983
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:17,236
Come here.

984
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,446
What's with him?

985
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,787
Stop it!

986
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,756
I checked. There's no phone, sir.

987
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:46,307
Sir? She needs to go to the bathroom.

988
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,516
What should I do?

989
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,728
-How annoying. Go!
-Yes, sir.

990
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:00,237
What's taking so long?

991
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:05,284
What?

992
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,785
Oh, shit!

993
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,247
Mister?

994
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:14,210
You're taking me to my dad, right?

995
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,049
Don't worry.

996
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,219
You'll meet him soon.

997
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:30,809
DAD, I'M AT HWAJIN PORT
I RAN AWAY FROM THE MEN

998
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:41,028
Why are you going so fast?

999
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:43,864
-My daughter is nearby.
-Give me a seatbelt too!

1000
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,329
Help me pull this thing down.
I want my seatbelt!

1001
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,831
Ga-yeong! Daddy's coming!

1002
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,501
We're on our way.

1003
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:59,129
Give me everything on Cheol
and track down his location!

1004
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:05,427
Ga-yeong!

1005
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:10,307
-Dad!
-Ga-yeong! Are you okay?

1006
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,270
I'm sorry I'm late. Let's go.

1007
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,229
Freeze!

1008
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:20,651
Hey!

1009
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:22,236
Uncuff me first.

1010
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,445
Uncuff me now!

1011
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:24,989
Hands up and kneel.

1012
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:28,701
-Don't make me shoot you in front of her.
-What's with you?

1013
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:33,664
Dad.

1014
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,458
Please let my kid go, Cheol.

1015
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,254
Cheol?

1016
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,465
The Uncle Cheol you talk about?

1017
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:45,384
You know me?

1018
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,928
When Dad gets drunk, he talks about you.

1019
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:52,516
He's an orphan with no family,
but he said you were like a brother.

1020
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:54,810
He wanted to see you,
but he said he couldn't.

1021
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:57,479
You're like a brother to him!
How can you do this?

1022
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,398
You're too young to understand.

1023
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,443
Your dad is a spy.

1024
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:06,864
Ever seen a spy work his butt off
at a construction site?

1025
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:09,908
-How'd you know I work there?
-Even Mom knows!

1026
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:10,909
-She does?
-Yup.

1027
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:11,869
Hands up!

1028
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:19,335
Do you know how pitiful my dad is?

1029
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:24,340
He draws webtoons all night,
but he gets cursed at all the time.

1030
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,552
Mom looks down on him
for not making money.

1031
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:31,597
My grandparents yell at him so much

1032
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,016
that he can't even go to their house.

1033
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:35,976
Ga-yeong? Stop it.

1034
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,562
-There's more!
-Ga-yeong.

1035
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:45,486
Mom got drunk
and told Dad to go out and die.

1036
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,988
-Not only that...
-I said stop it!

1037
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:50,366
-That's enough!
-Why yell at the kid?

1038
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:55,037
You're like a brother to him.

1039
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,539
How could you do this?

1040
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,042
Don't you feel sorry for him?

1041
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,719
Why did you abduct the chief?

1042
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,722
Some bastard took his wife.
He was threatened into taking me.

1043
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,308
You have no sense of timing.

1044
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,435
How can you say that in front of my kid?

1045
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:21,313
Mom got abducted?

1046
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:22,856
Don't worry.

1047
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,316
I'll go and rescue her soon.

1048
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,112
Right. Uncle Cheol will go with him.

1049
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:31,490
We're both
legendary agents of the Shield Team.

1050
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,827
Wait!

1051
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:37,996
Add one more.

1052
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,582
I'm the original Shield Team ace.

1053
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,085
Please uncuff me now.

1054
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,255
Come in.

1055
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,348
I was given your old place, sir.

1056
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,308
I had this place first.

1057
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:05,357
This place was passed down
to the aces of the Shield Team.

1058
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,901
Sir? Look over here.

1059
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,033
Wow!

1060
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:18,370
You kept all this?

1061
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:20,414
Is this you, Dad?

1062
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:22,124
I missed you, sir.

1063
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,793
And I really respected you.

1064
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,004
Truly.

1065
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:31,758
Uncle Cheol is your fan.

1066
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,888
Damn fools. What fan?

1067
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,893
Why's the fridge so big?

1068
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,812
Got anything cold to drink?

1069
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:54,948
You took and hid so much!

1070
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,241
Just in case.

1071
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,370
Ready to fight like the old days?

1072
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,850
That's enough.

1073
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,227
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

1074
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:29,942
Wait a minute, sir.

1075
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:33,695
Idiot.

1076
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:35,739
-Take one out.
-Yes, sir.

1077
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,102
I'll explain everything, sir.

1078
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:08,981
Think Director Choi
will take your word for it?

1079
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,317
Cheol, I apologize in advance.

1080
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:13,986
Apologize for what?

1081
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,739
Why did you hit me?

1082
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,200
-Why did you hit him?
-Why did you hit him, you jerk?

1083
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,035
What?

1084
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,871
It's so you can pretend
you lost me on the chase.

1085
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:28,542
Wait.

1086
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:34,965
I'm sorry.

1087
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,178
Dang, it hurts.

1088
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,725
But he's so cool!

1089
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:50,522
We'll go and rescue Mom.
Go stay at your grandma's.

1090
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:51,523
No!

1091
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,568
I'm coming with you! I want to go to Mom.

1092
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:57,404
Listen to your dad.
This is no place for you.

1093
01:16:58,071 --> 01:16:58,905
But...

1094
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,992
What if the men catch me again?

1095
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,745
I'm scared. Take me with you.

1096
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,540
Then you have to do exactly as I say.

1097
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,541
Okay.

1098
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,295
Dad?

1099
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:19,509
Is everything
in the webtoon really about you?

1100
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,347
Why? Are you scared of me now?

1101
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:25,265
No.

1102
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:31,980
The thought of Jun from the webtoon
being you makes me feel bad.

1103
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:35,734
Being dragged in there
as a kid like that...

1104
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:39,446
It must've been hard.

1105
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:44,076
Still, your dad was the best one there.
He's great at shooting.

1106
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,535
He never missed!

1107
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,330
How do you know that?

1108
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,749
-I'm in the webtoon too.
-Really?

1109
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,501
Who are you?

1110
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:54,670
Well...

1111
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,171
The trainer.

1112
01:17:56,254 --> 01:18:00,133
The one who teaches.

1113
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:03,720
-Then he's the trainer from hell?
-Yup.

1114
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,641
-Why did you hit me?
-Why did you do that to my dad!

1115
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:08,642
Why you!

1116
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:12,229
That scary look...
Like father like daughter!

1117
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,649
Stop it!

1118
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,653
I envy you for having a kid.

1119
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:23,323
But where's the bag? Is it in the trunk?

1120
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,908
It's not back there?

1121
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:28,704
Didn't you bring it, Chief?
All the weapons are in there.

1122
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:33,208
Why would I?
I'm the senior! You should have it.

1123
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:34,835
But I'm a senior too!

1124
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:37,671
We have no weapons?

1125
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:39,589
Then how do we fight?

1126
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:49,266
Was he going to start a war or something?

1127
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,520
So you went to Jun

1128
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:56,982
to tell him to turn himself in?
Then he beat you up and brought you here?

1129
01:18:57,065 --> 01:19:00,068
Yes, sir. He said
he'll resolve everything on his own.

1130
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,031
Does it hurt?

1131
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:06,366
You idiot!

1132
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:11,955
Your solo act will cost you.
Losing him will cost you more!

1133
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,041
-Let him go.
-Director?

1134
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,127
What if he goes solo again?

1135
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:20,255
Who here has the guts
to take on Jun one-on-one?

1136
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,134
Stupid jerks.

1137
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:32,267
Catch him,
even if it means you have to kill him.

1138
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:36,521
Or I'll kill you.

1139
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,064
Yes, sir.

1140
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:14,976
CHIEF CHEON DEOK-KYU

1141
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,729
Where are you? Where is your dad?

1142
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:20,357
Allow me, sir.

1143
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,276
Ga-yeong! It's Uncle Cheol.
Where's your dad?

1144
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,278
<i>He said to call this number.</i>

1145
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,579
Track him down now!

1146
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,044
You're back? I thought you ran away.

1147
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:52,264
Jason, that sick psycho!

1148
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:54,182
That's him for sure.

1149
01:20:55,392 --> 01:21:00,021
You tortured his brother
and killed him ruthlessly.

1150
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,608
Why bring that up now?

1151
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:07,112
You gouged out his eye
and abducted his brother!

1152
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,031
Because you ordered me to!

1153
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:11,575
I saw in the webtoon

1154
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,995
how my brother died so painfully.

1155
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:19,291
I've been killing the wrong agents.

1156
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:24,087
-When you two are to blame.
-So!

1157
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:27,674
You're the one who killed our agents?

1158
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:28,592
Yes.

1159
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:33,054
I tortured them
till they begged for their lives.

1160
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,348
I gouged out their eyes too.

1161
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:37,809
You'll end up like that, too!

1162
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,270
I brought him as promised.

1163
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:42,147
Where's my wife?

1164
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,196
Ow! That hurts!

1165
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,532
-I'm so drunk.
-Mi-na!

1166
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:57,829
Mi-na!

1167
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:01,833
Don't hit my husband!

1168
01:22:38,828 --> 01:22:41,081
How dare you hit my husband!

1169
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:46,670
I'll knock some sense into you!

1170
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:57,973
Asshole...

1171
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,851
What's wrong with my wife?
What the hell did you do to her?

1172
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:05,313
She drank all my expensive liquor.

1173
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:07,482
She's an alcoholic!

1174
01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:08,775
Don't call her that!

1175
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,528
Are you okay?

1176
01:23:11,611 --> 01:23:15,448
Are you okay?
Wake up! I told you to stop drinking!

1177
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:18,660
You son of a bitch!

1178
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,495
You call yourself a man?

1179
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:24,332
How can you leave me and run?

1180
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,002
So I came back! Something came up earlier.

1181
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:32,007
You made up your webtoon, right?
You're not the main character, right?

1182
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,633
Tell me!

1183
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:34,551
I'm sorry.

1184
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:35,719
What?

1185
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:38,179
But you're Kim Su-hyeok!

1186
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,347
I'm Kim Bong-jun!

1187
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,391
I'm not Kim Su-hyeok.

1188
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:45,520
-I'm Special Agent Jun.
-Like hell you are! You jerk!

1189
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:46,730
I'm sorry I lied.

1190
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:50,150
You're sorry? This is grounds for divorce!

1191
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:53,653
It was all in the past!
I changed after I met you!

1192
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:58,241
Kim Bong-jun.

1193
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,328
Think that'll change your past?

1194
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:06,875
Now, it's time for you to pay.

1195
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:12,172
You're the one who should pay!
You murderer!

1196
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:15,050
What about the people you killed?

1197
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:16,676
And our agents!

1198
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:20,930
Give me that!

1199
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:27,729
Stop!

1200
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,277
Right. I can't kill him easily.

1201
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:39,532
I won't kill you till you beg me to.

1202
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,787
I kept my promise.

1203
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,289
Now, let my wife go.

1204
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:47,707
Take me instead.

1205
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,504
There's one more thing for you to do.

1206
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:56,007
What are you doing?

1207
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,217
Let me go!

1208
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:01,096
What that bastard did to my brother...

1209
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:03,056
Do exactly that.

1210
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:06,142
Think you'll get away with this?

1211
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:08,269
We're still after you!

1212
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:12,107
You'll die from brutal torture

1213
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,983
by an agent you raised.

1214
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:20,365
What's wrong? Can't do it?

1215
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:22,909
Want me to help you?

1216
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:31,501
Stop it! Stop! I get it!

1217
01:25:32,585 --> 01:25:33,711
I'll do it.

1218
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,256
Chief.

1219
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:40,552
-Please don't blame me.
-Jun.

1220
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:44,222
You're not going to do it, are you?

1221
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,099
You wouldn't do that to me.

1222
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,518
Right?

1223
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,488
What are they doing?

1224
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:01,447
Zoom in.

1225
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:05,368
He's torturing Chief Cheon!

1226
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:07,370
That damn son of a bitch!

1227
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:08,454
I told you!

1228
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:10,248
-That bastard is with Jason!
-But...

1229
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,126
Hurry! Floor it!

1230
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:26,681
You killed my brother like this.

1231
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:29,934
Keep going!

1232
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:32,395
Wait! Hold on!

1233
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:40,278
This is all a big misunderstanding.

1234
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:46,534
He exaggerated everything in his drawings.

1235
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,205
I didn't exaggerate!

1236
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:52,540
You ungrateful brat!

1237
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:56,377
How could you do this to me?

1238
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,839
After how I raised you?

1239
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:01,841
You son of a bitch!

1240
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:04,344
You bastard!

1241
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:09,933
Are you okay?

1242
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:15,980
Are you all right?

1243
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:23,905
Holy shit!

1244
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:27,367
You two should burn too!

1245
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:36,668
Hold still.

1246
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:38,795
Should I burn your wife first?

1247
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:24,799
Target located.

1248
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:39,147
Everyone, freeze!
If you move, we'll shoot!

1249
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:48,364
-Chief!
-Get these off me.

1250
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:49,907
What's all this?

1251
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,367
Hurry up!

1252
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:52,702
This is hard.

1253
01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:54,704
Just bite it off!

1254
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:56,956
That's it!

1255
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:57,999
There.

1256
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,963
I can see you. Come out now!

1257
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,718
I'm not the one who killed the agents.
He fabricated everything.

1258
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:12,096
Mr. Webtoon Artist. You're a good liar.

1259
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:16,184
You're with Jason.
You abducted Chief Cheon as he ordered!

1260
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:17,727
I had no choice!

1261
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:19,312
He abducted my wife!

1262
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:21,272
Yes! My husband is right!

1263
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:24,442
That bastard abducted me!

1264
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:25,985
Do you think we're stupid?

1265
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,821
I saw you torturing Chief Cheon!

1266
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:30,156
He ordered me to do it!

1267
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,199
What?

1268
01:29:31,282 --> 01:29:33,868
You did it because you wanted to!

1269
01:29:33,951 --> 01:29:35,286
No! You made me do it!

1270
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:38,664
Don't be fooled!

1271
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:42,335
I saw him try to kill Jun!

1272
01:29:42,418 --> 01:29:44,504
If they're a team, why would he do that?

1273
01:29:45,254 --> 01:29:46,964
But he's still alive!

1274
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:51,677
Did you forget?
He even faked his own death!

1275
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:53,513
This is insane!

1276
01:29:53,596 --> 01:29:56,933
I said I didn't kill the agents!
How frustrating!

1277
01:29:58,226 --> 01:29:59,227
Arrest him!

1278
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,604
-Stay back!
-Stop!

1279
01:30:01,687 --> 01:30:02,688
Stay back!

1280
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:08,820
I warned you!

1281
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:12,156
Of course,
you won't go down without a fight.

1282
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,034
-Just shoot him.
-No!

1283
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:16,661
-Don't shoot!
-It's dangerous!

1284
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:18,287
Put the guns down!

1285
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,707
I'll convince him, sir. Give me time.

1286
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:24,752
You crazy jerk! How dare you!

1287
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:29,006
-What are you doing! Shoot him!
-Don't shoot!

1288
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,552
No! Don't you dare shoot!

1289
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,554
No! Don't shoot!

1290
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:36,097
Jun has been framed.

1291
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,015
What a tearjerker.

1292
01:30:40,643 --> 01:30:42,311
Change the target.

1293
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:43,646
The target is Jun.

1294
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:51,237
Jun will be gone forever.

1295
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,030
Along with our dark past.

1296
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:57,577
Don't shoot my dad!

1297
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:01,789
-Ga-yeong!
-Don't shoot!

1298
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:02,748
Ga-yeong!

1299
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:05,042
Don't shoot my dad!

1300
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,670
-Don't shoot!
-The woman and kid are too close.

1301
01:31:08,254 --> 01:31:11,174
Just shoot the traitor now!

1302
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:12,633
Wait!

1303
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,637
Shoot him now!

1304
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:21,517
No!

1305
01:31:27,523 --> 01:31:28,816
Cheol!

1306
01:31:32,945 --> 01:31:35,323
-How dare he!
-Why!

1307
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:36,240
Cheol!

1308
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:39,327
Bro...

1309
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:41,120
You have a family.

1310
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,748
I don't...

1311
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:47,752
I don't even have a girlfriend.

1312
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:50,296
I'm all done.

1313
01:31:50,379 --> 01:31:51,547
You're not done!

1314
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:54,091
This won't kill you, Cheol.

1315
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:57,011
Cheol! Wake up!

1316
01:31:57,094 --> 01:31:58,513
Don't die!

1317
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,473
Wake up!

1318
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:02,391
Open your eyes!

1319
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,393
Don't listen to him!

1320
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:05,603
Shoot him!

1321
01:32:10,566 --> 01:32:12,860
You fools! Can't you shoot properly?

1322
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:14,403
I did shoot properly.

1323
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:18,407
What's this?

1324
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:30,086
Hey!

1325
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:09,041
-Honey!
-Dad!

1326
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:13,963
Oh, no! Dad!

1327
01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:15,798
Tell everyone to drop the guns.

1328
01:33:15,881 --> 01:33:17,800
Or I'll kill you all!

1329
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:31,439
Drop the guns.

1330
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:33,608
Drop them!

1331
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,484
Get the car!

1332
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,903
-Let's go!
-Hurry!

1333
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:39,280
Come on!

1334
01:33:42,241 --> 01:33:43,534
Dad!

1335
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:47,538
-Dad! No!
-Honey! I'm sorry!

1336
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:48,456
Dad!

1337
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:50,499
Dad!

1338
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,716
Jun died fighting with you.

1339
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,843
Because you made him out to be a spy.

1340
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:06,349
Stupid moron!

1341
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:10,019
I told you Jun wasn't a spy! You bastard!

1342
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:16,567
-Are you talking to me?
-Yes, you! You asshole!

1343
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,944
Take your earphone out.
The mission ended long ago!

1344
01:34:19,028 --> 01:34:19,862
Are you crazy?

1345
01:34:19,945 --> 01:34:22,323
He's the director!
Have you lost your mind?

1346
01:34:22,406 --> 01:34:25,284
Chief! We ended up
like this because of this bastard.

1347
01:34:25,868 --> 01:34:28,245
Who cares? We're about to die.

1348
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:31,040
Stupid idiot! I should just slap him!

1349
01:34:31,123 --> 01:34:33,542
-You son of a bitch!
-Shithead!

1350
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,212
Sir! I'm sorry!

1351
01:34:36,295 --> 01:34:39,715
-Shut up! You son of a bitch.
-How dare you spit! Are you nuts?

1352
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:41,258
-You look like a fish!
-Shut up!

1353
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,552
I'm sorry. Please forgive him.

1354
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:45,971
Chief Cheon! You know I hate mutiny.

1355
01:34:46,555 --> 01:34:49,392
Write 100 letters of apology
when we get back!

1356
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:52,269
A written apology?

1357
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:55,940
Forget it, asshole! Because of you,
I'm about to die a bachelor!

1358
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,274
It's all your fault!

1359
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:58,818
Yeah, asshole!

1360
01:34:58,901 --> 01:35:00,403
Damn bastards!

1361
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:01,404
Shit!

1362
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:03,948
You psychotic bastard!

1363
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:07,410
Do you know who I am? If you mess with me,
you're messing with Korea!

1364
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:17,336
I was going to kill you
in front of that bastard.

1365
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:19,547
But the bastard got killed first.

1366
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:29,056
Don't worry.

1367
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:34,103
-Dad!
-Honey!

1368
01:35:36,313 --> 01:35:37,815
I won't leave you two

1369
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:39,817
-and die like this.
-Honey!

1370
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:57,126
Son of a bitch!

1371
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:09,388
Get that bastard!

1372
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,308
That hurt.

1373
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:23,068
Honey!

1374
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:28,657
Are you all right?

1375
01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:30,201
Yes. Are you okay?

1376
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:32,620
If it weren't for this, I'd be dead.

1377
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:34,663
You wore two?

1378
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:36,290
-Put it on.
-Okay.

1379
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:37,958
You too.

1380
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:44,423
Honey.

1381
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:47,134
If something happens to me,

1382
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:51,722
-take good care of Ga-yeong.
-Don't say that.

1383
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:55,142
I'm sorry for hiding my past.
It's all my fault.

1384
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:56,352
I'm sorry too.

1385
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,730
I always nagged and yelled at you.

1386
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:01,232
It's okay. It's all my fault.

1387
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:14,245
Oops.

1388
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:18,958
Chief.

1389
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:20,084
Protect my family.

1390
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:21,544
I will.

1391
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:25,840
My baby girl, Ga-yeong.

1392
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:31,345
I was so lucky to have you as my daughter.

1393
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:33,013
Dad...

1394
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:37,870
I'll kill you.

1395
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:48,714
Come on, asshole.

1396
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:20,329
Damn cheat!

1397
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:22,873
-Does it hurt?
-Yes, asshole!

1398
01:39:29,672 --> 01:39:32,007
I'm the legendary trainer from hell!

1399
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:34,051
You rock!

1400
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:46,271
Handle the rest.
The next ace of the Shield Team!

1401
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,461
I finally get to finish

1402
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:11,547
my last mission on the Shield Team.

1403
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:50,335
What the...

1404
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:34,463
Jun!

1405
01:41:34,546 --> 01:41:35,547
Dad!

1406
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:36,590
Honey!

1407
01:41:36,673 --> 01:41:37,716
Jun!

1408
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:39,093
Bro!

1409
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:41,678
You're totally cool!

1410
01:41:42,846 --> 01:41:44,181
My final mission is...

1411
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:47,434
Complete.

1412
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:38,986
ALL NAMES OF PERSONS
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

1413
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:42,114
Ga-yeong! Pet him!

1414
01:42:46,368 --> 01:42:47,369
Bro?

1415
01:42:47,953 --> 01:42:50,038
Some Russians hacked our network today.

1416
01:42:50,956 --> 01:42:53,417
There are dozens of gangsters
out to get you.

1417
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:57,337
At this rate, they'll locate you soon.

1418
01:42:58,297 --> 01:43:01,216
Buy me more time.
Just till my family can settle.

1419
01:43:01,925 --> 01:43:04,052
I can't do it any longer.

1420
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:09,099
Hey. If it weren't for me,
you disloyal fools would be dead!

1421
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:11,643
Did you just say disloyal?

1422
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:13,687
-That's right!
-You call this disloyal?

1423
01:43:14,813 --> 01:43:17,983
Why did I jump in
when you had two vests on?

1424
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:19,818
Don't you remember?

1425
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:21,361
Does it hurt? I'm sorry.

1426
01:43:21,445 --> 01:43:23,280
Just stop it!

1427
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:25,657
Damn it.

1428
01:43:28,577 --> 01:43:30,412
Enough about that.

1429
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:35,083
Instead of webtoons,
how about coming back as an agent?

1430
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:38,003
Chief Cheon and the director
are hoping you'll come back.

1431
01:43:38,086 --> 01:43:40,297
Like hell! When they ordered to shoot me!

1432
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:42,758
They want me back? Forget it!

1433
01:43:42,841 --> 01:43:44,051
I'm not going back.

1434
01:43:44,635 --> 01:43:45,636
I'm drawing webtoons.

1435
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:48,222
You make
less than 500,000 won a month doing this!

1436
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:50,432
How long will you mooch off your wife?

1437
01:43:50,515 --> 01:43:52,142
Aren't you embarrassed?

1438
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:54,770
What are you, a parasite?

1439
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:57,648
You could make more
working for minimum pay!

1440
01:43:57,731 --> 01:43:59,066
Don't say that!

1441
01:43:59,149 --> 01:44:02,945
-My dad's webtoon will be a hit.
-How do you know that?

1442
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:04,863
-I saw it.
-How can you see that?

1443
01:44:04,947 --> 01:44:08,742
I rode a time machine and saw everything!
My dad's webtoons will be huge hits!

1444
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:12,454
It's true!

1445
01:44:13,372 --> 01:44:14,623
She's right.

1446
01:44:14,706 --> 01:44:15,958
My husband will succeed.

1447
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:19,086
I'm serious.

1448
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:20,587
See that?

1449
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:23,340
I have two people who trust me this much.

1450
01:44:23,423 --> 01:44:24,549
Think I can't do it?
