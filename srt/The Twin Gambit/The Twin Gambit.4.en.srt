00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:11,593
Khun Tul, I have something to discuss with you.

3
00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:13,533
May I have a moment?

4
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:15,387
- Sure.
- Follow me.

5
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:23,840
Here's the Spring-Summer collection design I made.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,247
Take a look when you can.

7
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:27,360
I designed a lot of pieces.

8
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:30,240
What do you think?

9
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:34,360
This won't work, Min.

10
00:00:35,713 --> 00:00:39,100
This concept is too similar to our previous collection.

11
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:44,560
Khun Cream, please come here for a second.

12
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:54,520
Did you see Khun Min's Spring-Summer collection already?

13
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:56,840
No, not yet.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,693
I ran into you first, so I showed it to you directly.

15
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:05,800
From now on, make sure you review it first before sending it to me.

16
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:09,873
I apologize on Khun Min's behalf.

17
00:01:09,873 --> 00:01:13,087
I guess we need another talk about teamwork.

18
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,607
As for this collection, I'm working hard to create something. Please be patient.

19
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:20,300
Please speed things up.

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,513
This collection is really important to us.

21
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:25,666
Send any updates to me for review at once.

22
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,047
Sure.

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,173
Have you forgotten?

24
00:01:34,173 --> 00:01:37,300
You're just a designer, not the creative director.

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,160
Well, what can I do

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,527
when the so-called talented creative director can't even generate any ideas?

27
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:46,393
All I see is you messing with your iPad each day.

28
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:47,867
Are you even working?

29
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:52,427
Instead of questioning other people's abilities, look at yourself.

30
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:55,380
If you submit poor work only to be rejected like this,

31
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,413
it's good you aren't outrightly called incompetent.

32
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:59,300
Keep talking all you want.

33
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,493
There's less than a month left.

34
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:04,613
If you don't come up with an idea for Khun Tul,

35
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:07,820
you'll definitely lose your position as Creative Director.

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,846
Yes, Cake.

37
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:30,820
Where's the Spring-Summer collection?

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,273

Cranes are a symbol

42
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:23,747
of good fortune, hope, and longevity.

43
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:28,940
I wish both Cake and Cream a lifetime of happiness, my children.

[The best gift from my mom]

45
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,300
Thank you, Mom.

46
00:03:55,973 --> 00:04:00,227
If you're ready, you can start now.

47
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:05,470
The concept I created for the Spring-Summer collection

48
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,710
is called "Memories."

49
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:12,080
It's inspired by cherished memories from the past

50
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,470
and blended with an Asian look using Japanese-style

51
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,133
patterns to add a unique touch for the wearer.

52
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,053
I like it. The crane has a positive vibe.

53
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,250
But I just want to double-check the idea.

54
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,300
Why did you choose cranes?

55
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,573
Cranes are symbols of good fortune...

56
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:32,513
Luck, and longevity.

57
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:35,873
Luck, and longevity.

58
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:40,800
Why do you think this can outperform the "Jigsaw" concept?

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,993
Jigsaw was created to appeal to the masses.

60
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:45,827
Its downside is that it's easy to copy.

61
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,060
But "Memories" focuses on detail and craftsmanship.

62
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,427
Even if someone steals our idea, they can't replicate our skill.

63
00:04:52,427 --> 00:04:55,500
No matter how hard they try to copy it, it won't be the same.

64
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:01,273
So this project will require more money and time, right?

65
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:03,133
Yes.

66
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:06,867
Since we can't compete with the original target, we must find a new one.

67
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:09,433
"Memories" might not sell to a broad audience...

68
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,911
But it will appeal to a niche with high purchasing power.

69
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,361
Once the product becomes a trend...

70
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:15,367
Everyone will start to notice.

71
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:20,533
- I truly believe that "Memories"...
- Can outperform "Jigsaw" in terms of sales.

72
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,100
Perfect. Well done, Cake.

73
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,460
I understand now why Ai Tul chose you as Creative Director.

74
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,040
I'm confident this concept can compete with "Jigsaw."

75
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:46,327
Please, continue your presentation.

76
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,420
Cake, don't forget to brief the team about the embroidery patterns.

77
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,820
Okay.

78
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,627
Khai.

79
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:04,913
Yes, P'Cream?

80
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:07,760
Could you help me create more embroidery patterns? I want more options.

81
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,880
Sure. I'll make several graphic designs for you to choose from.

82
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,860
Please hurry.

83
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,927
My team wants to start the pattern-making process.

84
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:18,607
Oho...

85
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:21,370
If the embroidery patterns actually turn out well,

86
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,720
make sure nobody's slacking off.

87
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:27,640
I never slack off.

88
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,380
- Don't even think about it.
- Ouch! That hurts!

89
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,020
Hey, Cake.

90
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,380
Can you hear me? Cake?

91
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:52,120

Thank you.

97

98
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,660
Well...

99
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:13,767
Do you... Do you have some free time?

100
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,333
I'd like to talk to you about something.

101
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,193
Is there something you want to discuss?

102

00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:40,087

But what's the occasion?

109
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:10,587
I'm confident that this collection of ours will be successful.

110
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:14,327
Keep this pen for signing the contract with P&Y.

111
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,707
All right.

112
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:23,720
Earlier, during the meeting, I apologize if I seemed too demanding.

113
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,447
It's okay.

114
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:26,847
I understand.

115
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:32,220
I know this collection is really important to you.

116
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,830
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

117
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,910
Sure.

118
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,780
I'll leave it to you.

119
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:54,153
What's up, Wine?

120
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:57,175
Cream, Cake gave Khun Tul a pen.

121
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:59,143
It was in a special box with a ribbon.

122
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:01,553
It looked so fancy.

123
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:04,653
Does this mean Cake likes Khun Tul?

124
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:07,007
I have to go, Wine.

125
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,400
I can't waste any more time.

126
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,207
Oh, Ai Cream. Cream?

127
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:46,220
Help me zip it up.

128
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:06,980
It's late. Driving home is dangerous.

129
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,920
I need to go.

130
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,467
I have to be at the office early tomorrow.

131
00:10:15,587 --> 00:10:18,980
Then why don't you leave some clothes here?

132
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,707
You come over so often anyway.

133
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:30,300
Just because I come often doesn't mean I'm staying here with you.

134
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,833
Friends with benefits, remember?

135
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,800
Or are you thinking of something more?

136
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,607
I think you're overthinking things.

137
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:46,740
You've known Khun Tul for a long time.

138
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,000
What kind of woman does Khun Tul like?

139
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,120
You're not his type.

140
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,673
His type doesn't match with you.

141
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:55,273
How can you be so sure?

142
00:10:55,273 --> 00:10:59,247
Because if Ai Tul really liked you, you wouldn't be asking me about it.

143
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,010
I think you should give up on Ai Tul

144
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,560
and go for someone who truly understands you.

145
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,627
Are you challenging me again?

146
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:09,740
I'm not challenging you.

147
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,693
But I do know you.

148
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:23,460
You don't know me at all.

149
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:48,767
Everyone is so excited that you've reached your weight-loss goal.

150
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,480
Thank you.

151
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,660
I didn't expect to lose this much weight either, Doctor.

152
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:58,780
But you must keep taking your prescribed medication and vitamins regularly.

153
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,593
Losing weight so quickly, especially with your pre-existing conditions, is dangerous.

154
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:04,207
But don't worry.

155
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:08,173
After following the recovery program for another week, you can go home.

156
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:09,360
Okay.

157
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,900

- My pleasure.

Call the deputy. We've paid him so much money.

183
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:11,160
Tell him to take care of it!

184
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,327
Yes, Khun Cindy.

185
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,147
I know I made a mistake,

186
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:27,480
but could you transfer the money to me first?

187
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,633
My factory... No one wants to lease it.

188
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:40,580
No work means no money.

189
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,400
Understand?

190
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:45,560
You can leave my office now.

191
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
[Dreamer]

192
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:12,287
Our textile factory reported that villagers called the authorities for an inspection.

193
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,093
Why are you so stupid?

194
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:17,707
Call the deputy. We've paid him so much money.

195
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,727
Tell him to take care of it!

196
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:21,760
Yes, Khun Cindy.

197
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:35,227
Ee* Cindy.
(*Similar to Ai, but an insult in this matter)

198
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:40,380
If you betray me, I'll take all the evidence to the police.

199
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:49,760
What's the matter?

200
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,360
Has Khun Cindy transferred the money yet?

201
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,307
The workers will go on strike if they don't get paid this month.

202
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,533
I'll borrow money from my friends first, but only enough for one month.

203
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:02,227
- Excuse me, Khun Wasin.
- Just a moment.

204
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,573
There's some urgent paperwork for you to sign.

205
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:06,013
Here.

206
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,119
- Okay.
- Did you sign the documents from this morning?

207
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,400
- All set. Here.
- Okay.

208
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,527
What were you saying earlier?

209
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:19,100
If we can't find a new client to replace Tul's company, we're done.

210
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,613
And what do you expect me to do?

211
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:22,920
Just get us through this month, okay?

212
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,840
- I am sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

213
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:47,013
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

214
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:48,747
Did you get hurt?

215
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:50,860
No, I'm fine.

216
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:58,167
- Goodbye. I'm heading home.
- Sure.

217
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:03,973
All right. It's done.

218
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:06,513
Do you want to play badminton with us, P'Cream?

219
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:07,836
No, thanks.

220
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,800
Khun Min's going, right?

221
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:12,780
You made that obvious.

222
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,947
- All right, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

223
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:16,953
- Bye.
- Bye bye

224
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:20,293
- All right. Forget anything?
- Nope.

225
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:24,067
P'Cream! Goodbye. I'm heading home.

226
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:57,140
- I am sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

227
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:09,653
- Cut properly, cut properly.
- Hurry!

228
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:10,526
Slacking off?

229
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,467
- Cut properly, cut properly.
- Hurry!

230
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:14,807
- Cut properly!
- Are you sleepy?

231
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:16,480
- Come on, do the damn job!
- Hurry!

232
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,267
- Cut properly, cut properly.
- Hurry!

233
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,167
Keep cutting! Faster!

234
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,267
What are you looking at?

235
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:21,474
- Cut properly!
- Are you slacking?

236
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:24,160
- Slacking off?
- Quickly, faster

237
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:39,700
Kae.

238
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,033
There's a problem.

239
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:47,267
Our textile factory reported that villagers called the authorities for an inspection.

240
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:49,807
The police are on their way right now.

241
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:53,587
Just call the deputy. We paid him so much money.

242
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:56,353
Tell him to take care of it!

243
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:59,113
- Kae, stop for a second.
- Yes?

244
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:03,807
When you were getting the files from my room, did you see my flash drive?

245
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:06,633
- "Flash drive"?
- Yes.

246
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:11,847
Earlier, I bumped into Khun Cream and dropped everything.

247
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:15,380
Maybe Khun Cream accidentally picked it up.

248
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:25,527
Khun Cindy, I know I messed up,

249
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,213
but could you transfer the money to me first?

250
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:30,907
That voice... Is it Wasin?

251
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:34,160
No one wants to lease my factory.

252
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,027
Answer the phone, Khun Tul.

253
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,240
Hello, what's up?

254
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,907
Hello, Wine.

255
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:59,813
I urgently need to talk to Khun Tul.

256
00:20:59,813 --> 00:21:02,293
Oh, he's super busy right now.

257
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,013
- Wine.
- Yes?

258
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,800
Follow me.

259
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,313
Okay, I have to hang up now.

260
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:09,093
Wine.

261
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,680
[Cake]

262
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,740
- What's up, Cake?
- I found Khun Wasin's flash drive.

263
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,620
And on it...

264
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,160
What?

265
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,760
My phone's out of battery at a time like this?

266
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,500
What's her problem?

267
00:23:14,547 --> 00:23:15,933
Ai Pae,

268
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:18,240
Cream got my flash drive.

269
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:39,313
What's up, Skinny Girl?

270
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:40,813
Is Cake home?

271
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:43,733
Not yet. I'm still waiting for her.

272
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:46,240
Cake said she was coming for dinner tonight.

273
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,860
Is something wrong, Dear?

274
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,380
Well, Cake called me earlier.

275
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,230
It seemed she was trying to tell me something,

276
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,433
but the call got cut off.

277
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,053
Oh, it's probably nothing.

278
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:59,880
Tell you what, once she's home, I'll have her call you.

279
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,260
How about that?

280
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,100
Okay, Bpaa.

281
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,813
Hey, wait! Is that a fire?

282
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,107
- There's someone inside. Hurry! Hurry!
- Who?

283
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,240
- I don't know.
- What?

284
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,773
- Did they make it out?
- Hurry! Hurry, everyone!

285
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:32,700
Come on, help! Fast! Faster! Quick!

286
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,813
Hurry! Hurry up, everyone!

287
00:25:34,813 --> 00:25:36,840
Hey, there's a fire!

288
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,067
Is it done, Ai Pae?

289
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:14,773
I followed her in the car.

290
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,900
But her tire blew out. She lost control and hit a tree.

291
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,987
Villagers started gathering, so I left quickly.

292
00:26:19,987 --> 00:26:21,507
Did anyone see you?

293
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:24,080
No. I got away before anyone noticed.

294
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,380
But when I left, the car was already on fire.

295
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,613
The flash drive was inside and was probably destroyed.

296
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:30,587
But she might have survived.

297
00:26:30,587 --> 00:26:32,720
Go find her.

298
00:26:40,747 --> 00:26:43,640
Gosh, so useless!

299
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:07,660
Yes, Bpaa?

300
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:14,720
I-I'm heading back to Bangkok right now.

301
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,720
[WIH International Hospital]

302
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,547
Here are the belongings we found at the accident site.

303
00:27:31,547 --> 00:27:35,580
Rescue workers said the victim was holding this pillow tightly and wouldn't let go.

304
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,200
If the victim wakes up,

305
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,777
I'll need to return to conduct further questioning.

306
00:27:39,777 --> 00:27:41,057
Okay.

307
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:43,260
If that's all, I'll take my leave now.

308
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,090
Thank you.

309
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:51,739
Bpaa.

310
00:27:57,813 --> 00:27:59,873
How's Cake, Bpaa?

311
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:05,999
The doctor said we may have to wait for a miracle.

312
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:09,434
They don't know if she'll ever wake up.

313
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:30,200
You know, the person who saved her

314
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,324
said Cake was holding this pillow tightly, Dear.

315
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:43,593
Here.

316
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:48,173
You travel a lot and might find it useful. Try resting on it.

317
00:28:48,173 --> 00:28:50,309
Hey, thanks.

318
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:52,940
That's so sweet of you.

319
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,746
Let's see.

320
00:28:56,719 --> 00:29:00,252
Wow, it's so soft.

321
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:02,719
Try lying on your side like this.

322
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:08,697
But I don't need one... because I have no neck.

323
00:29:36,264 --> 00:29:39,580
Ladies and gentlemen, last night, a terrifying accident occurred

324
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,918
on a road outside the city, in the Samut Prakan area.

325
00:29:42,918 --> 00:29:46,481
A young woman crashed her car, causing it to explode.

326
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:49,703
Fortunately, a good Samaritan was able to rescue her.

327
00:29:49,703 --> 00:29:53,548
We've now identified the injured woman as Miss Panisa Rattanawong.

328
00:29:53,548 --> 00:29:57,485
She has been taken to the hospital.

329
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,822
- Hello, Khun Tul.
- Did you see the news?

330
00:30:15,822 --> 00:30:17,052
Yes, I did.

331
00:30:17,052 --> 00:30:20,002
But I'm heading to the hospital right now.

332
00:30:20,002 --> 00:30:24,247
- I'll be there soon.
- No, no, no, you don't have to.

333
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:28,132
I'll go by myself. If there's an issue, I'll call you, okay?

334
00:30:28,132 --> 00:30:31,840
Wine, Khun Cream is important to the company. I must go!

335
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:34,442
I'll see you in an hour.

336
00:30:34,442 --> 00:30:36,161
Khun Tul...

337
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:41,519
Cream, Khun Tul will be here in an hour.

338
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:43,339
What should we do?

339
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:46,756
He's just coming to visit. What's the big deal?

340
00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:51,430
Bpaa, if Khun Tul comes and sees that Cake is in a coma,

341
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,570
we can't switch Cream in.

342
00:30:53,578 --> 00:30:55,360
The plan will fall apart.

343
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,365
And right now, Dreamer might fall apart.

344
00:30:57,365 --> 00:31:00,701
And my life will fall apart, too, Bpaa. Do you understand?

345
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:02,964
But Cake is in the ICU.

346
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:06,069
- How will you hide that? It's the truth.
- Right, right.

347
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:08,624
But if Khun Tul finds out now, the news will spread.

348
00:31:08,624 --> 00:31:11,336
Soon they will know. The entire team will find out.

349
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,400
Then everyone will be rushing to see her.

350
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,101
I don't even want to think about it.

351
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:17,016
What do we do? What do we do?

352
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:18,417
Cream, Cream, are you okay?

353
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:19,667
- Oh no, Dear!
- Hey!

354
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:20,459
Cream, Cream!

355
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:21,680
- Excuse me!
- Nurse!

356
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,768
- Please help!
- Oh no, Dear!

357
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:24,005
- This way, please.
- Oh no, Dear!

358
00:31:24,005 --> 00:31:26,440
- Take it easy, take it easy.
- This way, please.

359
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:35,439
Why the hell is she still alive?

360
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:37,032
Should I just kill her in the hospital then?

361
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:38,137
No.

362
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:39,358
I'll handle this myself.

363
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:42,093
You go search through the wreckage.

364
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:45,642
Make sure my flash drive is not in that car!

365
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:48,576
- But the fire...
- Go now!

366
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,231
Yes, Khun Wasin.

367
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,087
Cream...

368
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:05,118
Cream.

369
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:07,041
Don't disturb the patient right now.

370
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,668
Let her rest first.

371
00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:09,905
Okay.

372
00:32:09,905 --> 00:32:12,572
Thank you so much.

373
00:32:12,572 --> 00:32:14,446
Thank you.

374
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:17,254
What's with all the chaos?

375
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:19,027
- Hey, Cream, wake up, wake up, wake up!
- Wine.

376
00:32:19,027 --> 00:32:21,481
- No, you can't do that. Just let her sleep.
- Bpaa,  I'm sorry.

377
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,561
Bpaa, we don't have time!

378
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:23,968
- Wake up! Wake up!
- No!

379
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:25,526
- Wake up! Wake up, Cream.
- Wine.

380
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,850
- Just let her rest a while. Goodness.
- Bpaa.

381
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,948
She can't rest now.

382
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:30,772
- If she rests, she's as good as dead.
- What?

383
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:33,258
No, don't try to get up, Sweetheart.

384
00:32:33,258 --> 00:32:34,805
- Are you okay?
- Just give her an IV or something.

385
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:37,539
Sorry, but Khun Tul will be here in half an hour.

386
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,217
We must do something, so what is it?

387
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:41,481
Should we ask Bpaa Su to greet him first?

388
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:43,253
Hey! No!

389
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:46,433
Khun Tul thinks I am Fresh's aunt.

390
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:48,113
If he sees me here, it will ruin everything.

391
00:32:48,113 --> 00:32:49,813
Oh...

392
00:32:49,813 --> 00:32:51,730
Then what should we do?

393
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,617
If our plan gets exposed, everything we've done will be for nothing.

394
00:32:54,617 --> 00:32:56,460
Exactly.

395
00:32:57,765 --> 00:33:02,307
I... I'll switch with Cake and pretend to be Cream for Khun Tul.

396
00:33:02,307 --> 00:33:04,092
- What?
- What?

397
00:33:04,092 --> 00:33:07,332
Switch with Cake right now, Bpaa.

398
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:10,680
But you and Wine have to help me.

399
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:31,263
I am sorry.

400
00:33:31,263 --> 00:33:33,760
Where is the ICU?

401
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,147
It's on second floor.

402
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:38,827
You can take the elevator over there.

403
00:33:38,827 --> 00:33:40,400
Thank you.

404
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:42,662
Oh no, he's already here.

405
00:33:42,662 --> 00:33:45,206
Hello, Khun Tul. Where are you now?

406
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:46,661
I'm taking the elevator to the ICU.

407
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:49,753
What? Oh, just wait right there. I'll come meet you.

408
00:33:49,753 --> 00:33:51,039
Let's meet upstairs.

409
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,784
What?

410
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:56,062
Khun Tul!

411
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:02,600
Right this way.

412
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,847
Khun Tul.

413
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:04,950
Khun Tul!

414
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,296
What the hell was that?

415
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:16,600
Wait...

416
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:22,400
Khun Tul!

417
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:27,720
Gosh...

418
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,880
Khun Tul!

419
00:34:35,689 --> 00:34:37,280
Khun Tul!

420
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:39,086
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

421
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:41,508
Which room is Panisa Rattanawong in?

422
00:34:41,508 --> 00:34:43,460
One moment, please.

423
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:46,492
Khun Tul! Khun Tul!

424
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:49,919
Excuse me, please keep your voice down.

425
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,362
Sorry.

426
00:34:51,362 --> 00:34:52,990
Why were you running?

427
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,340
You seemed to be in such a hurry.

428
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,220
Just a second.

429
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,829
I just wanted to tell you...

430
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:03,000
Khun Cream is already out of the ICU.

431
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,086
What? Wait, wait, wait.

432
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:08,119
The news said it was a serious accident. How did she get out so quickly?

433
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,920
I don't know. But right now, let's go.

434
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:14,228
She's not here anymore. Let's go.

435
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:16,980
Come on. Follow me.

436
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:24,122
Oh, P'Wasin.

437
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,822
Are you here to see Khun Cream, too?

438
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:28,581
I just saw the news. How is Khun Cream doing?

439
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:31,720
She's already out of the ICU. This way, please.

440
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,115
- This way, please.
- Hurry.

441
00:35:33,115 --> 00:35:34,607
Come on.

442
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:41,620
This is the room.

443
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,707
The doctor said Khun Cream is out of danger now.

444
00:35:57,707 --> 00:35:59,710
So I messaged everyone at the office

445
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,940
to tell them not to worry or come visit.

446
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,087
That way, she can rest properly.

447
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:05,793
That's good.

448
00:36:07,153 --> 00:36:09,860
I saw the news about the car crash.

449
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,447
I thought it would be much worse.

450
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:18,613
But we're lucky it's not too bad.

451
00:36:23,327 --> 00:36:25,147
Khun Cream...

452
00:36:29,427 --> 00:36:33,227
Hello. Khun Tul, Khun Wasin.

453
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:55,347
I'll go get the doctor.

454
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:58,900
Thank you so much for coming to visit.

455
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,373
And... so... how are you feeling?

456
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:09,200
Well... Khun Wine told me I was in a car accident,

457
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,260
but I can't remember anything.

458
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:18,673
- Are you sure?
- The doctor is here.

459
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,693
Excuse me, please.

460
00:37:26,253 --> 00:37:28,573
How do you feel, Khun Panisa?

461
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:32,292
Can you remember anything about the accident yet?

462
00:37:33,273 --> 00:37:34,800
I can't remember anything at all.

463
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,527
It's like... I remember working at the office,

464
00:37:40,527 --> 00:37:44,700
and the next thing I knew, I was here, Doctor.

465
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,913
So why can't she remember anything?

466
00:37:49,473 --> 00:37:54,740
The accident caused a severe head injury.

467
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:59,960
Doctor, will she forget everything?

468
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,307
From what I can tell, she's only forgotten some things, not everything.

469
00:38:06,307 --> 00:38:08,813
The brain is a complicated organ.

470
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:15,230
When there are several severe injuries to the head,

471
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,900
it can cause memory gaps.

472
00:38:17,907 --> 00:38:20,633
So how long until her memory returns?

473
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:22,900
I don't know.

474
00:38:26,877 --> 00:38:28,713
I can't really say.

475
00:38:28,713 --> 00:38:32,040
We'll have to keep monitoring her condition.

476
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,680
But in her case, I don't think it's too serious.

477
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,813
If there are no complications, she should be able to go home in a few days.

478
00:38:40,813 --> 00:38:43,200
Thank you so much, Doctor.

479
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,247
You don't need to worry.

480
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:50,480
Even if my memory isn't perfect, I still remember all of my work.

481
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,880
Once I'm out of here,

482
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,940
I'll finish the fashion show to the best of my ability.

483
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,080
Don't worry about work right now.

484
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,687
You can return to work when you are fully recovered.

485
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:06,767
Just focus on resting and recovering.

486
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:08,820
Thank you.

487
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,360
Well, I think we should leave now.

488
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,080
She needs to rest.

489
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,320
Very good, Dear.

490
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,920
Hey...

491
00:39:18,527 --> 00:39:20,190
I have to go.

492
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,060
I have another patient waiting.

493
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,083
See you.

494
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,573
Gosh...

495
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,960
Let's go.

496
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,880
Khun Wasin.

497
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,940
Let's go.

498
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,260
- Doctor.
- Yes?

499
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,073
Khun Cream is really okay, right?

500
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:58,940
The news made it sound like the accident was really bad.

501
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,647
The crash was severe.

502
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:02,267
She has head wounds and arm injuries.

503
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:07,560
But honestly, this is a miracle case.

504
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:12,820
Well, if there's nothing more, I must go now.

505
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:16,287
Oh, Khun Tul...

506
00:40:16,287 --> 00:40:19,680
I think we should leave now.

507
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,100
We shouldn't bother anyone here.

508
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,240
Right this way.

509
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,773
Let's go.

510
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:39,107
Did you find the flash drive?

511
00:40:39,107 --> 00:40:40,433
I didn't.

512
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:42,900
I searched the wreckage thoroughly.

513
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,350
But she can't remember anything,

514
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,890
and we don't know if her memory will ever return.

515
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:49,727
But what if it does?

516
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:51,493
You'll be in trouble.

517
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:52,900
Let me handle it.

518
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,567
Not yet.

519
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:56,827
It will look suspicious if we deal with her now.

520
00:40:56,827 --> 00:40:59,033
Will you just let her be like this?

521
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:01,100
I'll take care of it.

522
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,940
If her memory returns, we'll deal with her then.

523
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,500
At this point, there's no evidence to be used against me.

524
00:41:37,227 --> 00:41:40,820
It's me. You scared me.

525
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,253
Where's Wine?

526
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:44,360
She went to drop him off, didn't she?

527
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,553
Oh, everyone, it's me.

528
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:53,093
Gosh!

529
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,280
I almost had a heart attack.

530
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,673
Do you think Khun Tul suspects anything?

531
00:41:58,673 --> 00:42:03,066
Well, not yet. But who knows about later?

532
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:08,447
In the end, I have to be your accomplice in this whole mess, right?

533
00:42:08,447 --> 00:42:11,550
If he finds out I lied to help you,

534
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,060
he will fire me.

535
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:18,413
Ai Wine, I'm sorry, okay?

536
00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:22,620
Same to you as well, Bpaa.

537
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,887
I really have no other choice.

538
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:27,207
There is one, Dear.

539
00:42:27,207 --> 00:42:30,300
The choice is to tell him the truth.

540
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,933
That's better than lying to him over and over like this.

541
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:36,093
Be careful, you know? When you keep lying so much,

542
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:39,653
you forget what you lied about.

543
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:43,240
Please, just let me get through this collection first, Bpaa.

544
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,333
I really want Dreamer to become part of P&Y.

545
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:51,333
After that, I'll find the right time to tell Khun Tul the truth immediately.

546
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,127
And one more thing.

547
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:56,807
If I confess now, and he fires me,

548
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:59,973
where will I get the money to pay for Cake's treatment?

549
00:43:05,507 --> 00:43:08,120
The patient's condition is still critical.

550
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,867
I don't agree with what you're planning.

551
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:13,273
I understand, Doctor.

552
00:43:13,273 --> 00:43:16,580
But the truth is, neither of us is in a convenient situation.

553
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,880
I must work every day, and my aunt has to run her shop.

554
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,773
Do you have a safe suggestion for the patient?

555
00:43:24,773 --> 00:43:28,400
If the family insists on taking the patient home to continue recovery,

556
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,280
I'd prefer to wait till her condition stabilizes more.

557
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,680
It may take at least one month before we can approve a discharge.

558
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,587
- Yes.
- Thank you, Doctor.

559
00:43:38,587 --> 00:43:41,100
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

560
00:43:47,893 --> 00:43:49,660
Cake, Dear.

561
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,080
Hello.

562
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,933
Yes, I just got back to Thailand.

563
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:16,860
I'll summarize the meeting results at the office tomorrow.

564
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,247
All right.

565
00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:20,040
Goodbye.

566
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,240
[I'm back. Can we meet?]

567
00:44:57,687 --> 00:45:00,080
Have I been ditched?

568
00:45:07,713 --> 00:45:12,160
Even if Cream is out of the hospital, can we be sure she's at full capacity?

569
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,120
After a brain concussion like that...

570
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:17,867
I agree with Min.

571
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:20,747
This fashion show is a huge deal.

572
00:45:20,747 --> 00:45:24,647
It will determine whether our company signs with P&Y.

573
00:45:24,647 --> 00:45:27,867
How about this? I'll try talking to Khun Pemika.

574
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:30,960
I think she wants to work with us.

575
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,520
But if you don't want to work with Khun Pemika,

576
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,450
I can handle it instead of Cream.

577
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:39,187
But Khun Cream initiated this project.

578
00:45:39,187 --> 00:45:41,813
She knows the work best.

579
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:46,467
Tul... Isn't it too risky, Tul?

580
00:45:46,467 --> 00:45:51,147
Will you stake everyone's future on someone who can't remember anything?

581
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:54,220
Tul, these days,

582
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,307
I'm not sure I've come to the right company, Tul.

583
00:45:57,307 --> 00:45:59,200
Hello.

584
00:46:15,613 --> 00:46:17,873
Khun Cream.

585
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:19,960
Are you feeling better now?

586
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,673
Yes.

587
00:46:21,673 --> 00:46:25,173
Tul said you couldn't remember the accident,

588
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:27,887
but you remembered how to get to the office like this.

589
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:29,913
That means you can remember work, right?

590
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:32,453
I remember everything about work.

591
00:46:32,453 --> 00:46:35,900
- So shall we start working then?
- Sounds great.

592
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,660
- Please, go ahead.
- Okay.

593
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,713
Yes.

594
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,173
- Let's go quickly.
- Just as we discussed earlier.

595
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,827
Exactly as we discussed.

596
00:46:42,827 --> 00:46:45,660
- Oh, my gosh, P'Cream.
- How are you?

597
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,900
Oh, my gosh!

598
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,713
- It's like a miracle.
- Seriously.

599
00:46:49,713 --> 00:46:52,053
You're really better now, right?

600
00:46:52,053 --> 00:46:53,533
Oh, my gosh, did this really happen?

601
00:46:53,533 --> 00:46:55,853
- Oh, of course it did.
- Look, see?

602
00:46:55,853 --> 00:46:57,987
- It's the same as before.
- No, it's different.

603
00:46:57,987 --> 00:47:01,127
- Gosh!
- She was in an accident and came back prettier.

604
00:47:01,127 --> 00:47:02,707
Let's focus on work first.

605
00:47:02,707 --> 00:47:04,120
How far along is the work I assigned?

606
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,960
- How far along?
- It's all done.

607
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,010
- Today is hot.
- This really brightens the mood, doesn't it?

608
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,240
Seriously, everything looks fresher now, doesn't it?

609
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,507
- Look, even the fabric looks brighter, right?
- Right.

610
00:47:14,507 --> 00:47:19,727
Right. Gosh, P'Cream, do you know how happy we are that you're finally back?

611
00:47:19,727 --> 00:47:23,605
- We were shocked by the news! We thought something awful had happened.
- Yes.

612
00:47:23,605 --> 00:47:25,813
And when we tried to visit you at the hospital,

613
00:47:25,813 --> 00:47:28,773
P'Wine said you were already discharged.

614
00:47:28,773 --> 00:47:31,240
Luckily, someone found me quickly, so I wasn't seriously hurt.

615
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,040
That's good, Phi.

616
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,020
If you're back to work, do it well.

617
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,520
Don't just use the accident as an excuse if you can't come up with anything.

618
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,500
You'll be dealing with these people while pretending to be me at work.

619
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,553
The others aren't much of a concern.

620
00:47:47,553 --> 00:47:49,467
But that girl...

621
00:47:50,373 --> 00:47:52,320
You need to be very careful.

622
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,953
She's surely trying to undermine you.

623
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,507
Mintra.

624
00:48:00,613 --> 00:48:02,467
Oh, don't be like that, P'Min.

625
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:04,580
P'Cream just got better.

626
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,320
- Don't start anything, okay?
- Who's starting anything?

627
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,667
Our work requires brains, Moo.

628
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:12,720
If someone's brain was injured so badly in an accident,

629
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,900
can they really work as before?

630
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:17,933
If it were me, I'd resign.

631
00:48:19,653 --> 00:48:21,820
Just ignore her.

632
00:48:26,093 --> 00:48:28,160
Khun Cream.

633
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,773
Come talk to me for a moment.

634
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,760
Let's speak outside.

635
00:48:43,673 --> 00:48:46,940
- Sweetheart, go do your work.
- Yes, go on.

636
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,080
- It's not your business.
- Right.

637
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,473
- Hey, Phrae.
- What?

638
00:48:51,473 --> 00:48:55,127
- Aren't you curious?
- Yes, I really want to know, too.

639
00:48:59,113 --> 00:49:03,460
Is there something you need, Khun Wasin?

640
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,747
Are you really better now?

641
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,493
The doctor said your brain was affected by the concussion.

642
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:13,489
I didn't think you'd be able to return to work this quickly.

643
00:49:14,149 --> 00:49:15,533
Are you sure you're okay?

644
00:49:15,533 --> 00:49:17,060
I'm okay.

645
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:22,013
Well, I'm really fine, but some of my memories...

646
00:49:22,013 --> 00:49:25,167
They just haven't come back yet.

647
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:26,840
What memories?

648
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,480
I mean, what period of time are you unable to recall?

649
00:49:37,373 --> 00:49:42,060
I have to apologize for constantly pestering you.

650
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:47,073
I just want to ensure you're truly back at 100% capacity.

651
00:49:47,073 --> 00:49:49,000
You understand, right?

652
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,400
This fashion show is extremely important for our company.

653
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:54,487
Yes.

654
00:49:54,487 --> 00:49:59,260
When it comes to work, I remember everything.

655
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,100
But...

656
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:07,080
As for any incidents right before the accident,

657
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,720
I can't remember.

658
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:17,200
I remember only that I was sitting in the office, working...

659
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,100
Then suddenly, all memory is gone.

660
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,580
So what were you doing in your office that day?

661
00:50:31,182 --> 00:50:33,880
My head hurts again.

662
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,880
When I try to recall or bring back my memory,

663
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,400
it always gives me a headache.

664
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,827
If there's nothing else, may I excuse myself?

665
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:45,520
I really do remember everything about work.

666
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,160
Phrae, could you put this over here?

667
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:11,280
- Where's the desk?
- At the waist.

668
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,600
- P'Cream.
- Yes?

669
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,220
P'Cream, what are you looking for?

670
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,220
I'm looking for...

671
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:24,630
Looking for... What's it called again?

672
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:27,447
The work update from Moo.

673
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:29,073
- The work update?
- Yes.

674
00:51:29,073 --> 00:51:32,073
Phrae already dropped it in your office.

675
00:51:32,073 --> 00:51:33,493
The office upstairs?

676
00:51:33,493 --> 00:51:35,053
Yes.

677
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:37,440
Your office, P'Cream.

678
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,787
Thank you.

679
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:41,589
What's with her?

680
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,873
- You...
- Ouch!

681
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:50,673
- Oh, Khun Tul.
- I am sorry.

682
00:51:50,673 --> 00:51:51,600
Just a second.

683
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,880
Gosh. Are you all right?

684
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,404
Slimming cream.

685
00:51:58,404 --> 00:52:00,760
For weight loss.

686
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,787
A friend asked me to buy it.

687
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,120
M-May I take a look?

688
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,340
Wow.

689
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,200
This brand is quite popular; many people have reviewed it.

690
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,151
Your friend uses this too?

691
00:52:11,151 --> 00:52:12,273
Yes.

692
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:13,853
That's great.

693
00:52:14,413 --> 00:52:18,018
- Here, come on, let me help you.
- Thank you.

694
00:52:18,018 --> 00:52:21,420
Is there something you want to discuss with Khun Cream?

695
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:24,473
I wanted to discuss the fitting day with you.

696
00:52:24,473 --> 00:52:28,093
After lunch, let's meet at the coffee room, okay?

697
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:30,837
Okay.

698
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:35,107
Where is the coffee room?

699
00:52:35,107 --> 00:52:36,640
Over there.

700
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,220
Don't slip up on your first day.

701
00:52:41,987 --> 00:52:44,100
Don't get familiar with me.

702
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,200
Not familiar at all.

703
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:50,493
You can do it, Cream.
