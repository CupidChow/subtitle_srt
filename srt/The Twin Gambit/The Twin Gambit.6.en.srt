1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Is that you, Cream, Dear?

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,093
Hello, Bpaa.

3
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:15,080
Hello, Dear.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,400
You're Khun Tul, right?

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,800
Yes, but...

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,200
How did you end up inside Cream's house?

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,600
Do you two know each other?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Bpaa... rents my kitchen to cook and sell food.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, right, right. I rent her kitchen.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,600
Oh, that explains it.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,100
You live near Fresh's place. She's my friend.

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,100
- Fresh?
- Yes.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,800
Bpaa Su's niece?

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,800
A-Are you friends with her? What a small world.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,000
Very small indeed.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,800
So how's Fresh doing?

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,600
Haven't seen her in a while, Bpaa.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,700
- How's Fresh?
- Yes.

19
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:10,447
Bpaa, thank you so much for watching the house.

20
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:12,193
You should go get some rest.

21
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:15,193
Oh, sure.

22
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:17,507
- Bpaa! Bpaa...
- Yes?

23
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:18,980
To your house, Bpaa.

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,467
My house?

25
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:23,007
This is my house, remember, Bpaa?

26
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,640
Oh, right.

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,300
I'll excuse myself now.

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,900
- Where should I go? Where?
- Just keep on going!

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,800
Bpaa?

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,300
Yes?

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,400
How about this? I'll take you home.

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Oh no, that's okay. It's all right.

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,200
I can get home myself. It's just nearby.

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,000
- I don't want to trouble you.
- Bpaa.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's late already. Let me take you home, please.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,500
Khun Cream, you should rest.

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,600
I'll take Bpaa home.

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,800
Thanks.

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,100
Let's go, Bpaa.

40
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,200
- Just go.
- Where do I go?

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,900
I don't know.

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,000
Off we go then.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
Bye bye.

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Right this way, Bpaa.

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,000
I getting into the car now.

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,400
Don't worry. I'll get her home safely.

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
See you.

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,900
Good luck, Bpaa.

49
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,500
Yes, right here. Don't go too far.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,800
- We're here. I'll get out now.
- Okay, Bpaa.

51
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,000
- Okay.
- This way please.

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,100
Thank you so much, Khun Tul.

53
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,600
Get home safe.

54
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,650
Thank you, Bpaa. Anyway...

55
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,400
Please send my regards to Fresh.

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,800
Sure.

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,300
- See you.
- Sure.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't you dare.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Stop barking at me.

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
Stop scolding me already.

61
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm sorry, I messed up. I know now I shouldn't drink anymore.

62
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Yes.

63
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, that's all for now.

64
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,200
Bpaa... I'm so sorry. I got you into trouble again.

65
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,400
Hey...

66
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,700
If it's this hard, shouldn't we just tell Khun Tul the truth?

67
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,500
How can I, Bpaa? What if he gets mad and fires me?

68
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,400
Then how am I supposed to pay for Cake's treatment?

69
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,100
Well, true.

70
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,000
But what if one day he finds out the truth?

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
He'll still be angry.

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,100
Especially since he hates liars so much.

73
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:09,450
True,

74
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,220
I don't even know why he hates liars that much...

75
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,720
There must be a reason.

76
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,800
Maybe I'll make him stop hating liars.

77
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,600
Then when we finally tell the truth,
he might not hate me as much.

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,880
[Dreamer]

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,500
Morning.

80
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,000
And... are you okay?

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You look really pale.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,670
Last night, there was a party
at the company and I...

83
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,200
kind of overdid it. Now I have a hangover.

84
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,000
Really?

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You used to down a whole bottle without even flinching.

86
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:07,727
How about a cup of coffee?

87
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:10,373
Or maybe we go for round two tonight?

88
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,647
Oh my!

89
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:15,273
- Good morning, Khun Pete.
- Hello.

90
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,847
Oh god, what did we just see?

91
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,150
You didn't only come to bring flowers, did you?

92
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,200
Do you have business here?

93
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,880
I do have business with your boss,

94
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,550
but I missed you so I thought I'd see you first.

95
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,000
In that case, I'll leave now.

96
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,700
What? Where did he go?

97
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,800
P'Cream! What's going on between you two?

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,300
- What?
- What's this?

99
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,800
Didn't he just bring you a whole bottle of tequila the other day?

100
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,600
And what now? Now flowers too?

101
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,800
He was just congratulating me, that's all.

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,100
Oh, come on, P'Cream. Things are looking pretty sweet.

103
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,800
So, what's going on between you two?

104
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,900
- How is it?
- Nothing. Stop focusing on me.

105
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,700
Then focus on what Khun Pete's talking about to Khun Tul.

106
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,600
Even though Dreamer's Spring-Summer collection beat Nira Fashion House,

107
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,360
P&Y has already had a meeting

108
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,400
and decided we're not choosing a brand to join our group just yet.

109
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,600
Wait a second, Ai Pete.

110
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,000
You really hate Tul that much that you're mixing personal with business?

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
I'm professional enough, okay?

112
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
But let's be honest. Nira Fashion House has consistently done well.

113
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,000
This was the first time you guys actually beat them.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
Then why say earlier

115
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,700
that the Spring-Summer collection would determine entry into P&Y?

116
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,640
Because it does matter. The Spring-Summer collection sales

117
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,000
made us eliminate all the other choices.

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's down to two: Dreamer and Nira Fashion House.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,400
So I've a proposal for you.

120
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,600
What kind of proposal?

121
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,520
We want to see which Thai brand has the potential

122
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,800
to bring Thai fashion to the global stage.

123
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,900
Dreamer and Nira Fashion House will go head-to-head in a design competition under the concept:

124
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,000
Iconic Thai Designer.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,100
Whichever brand wins will immediately be brought into the P&Y family.

126
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,700
And how much time do we have?

127
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,400
Two months.

128
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,900
But if you think the challenge is too difficult, Dreamer can always withdraw.

129
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:32,600
In two months, my brand's clothes will be in front of you.

130
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,400
I'll be watching.

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Doesn't your face hurt from holding that smug expression all the time, Ai Patrick?

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,700
Calm down, Kong.

133
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,300
How can I stay calm?

134
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,580
We won fair and square,

135
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,400
and now they're changing the rules, and still won't let us in.

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,200
Well, Ai Pete's not wrong.

137
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Nira's Fashion House has been outselling us for a long time.

138
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,210
The fact that they eliminated the other teams

139
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,800
and left it down to just us versus Nira...

140
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,700
That's P&Y giving us a fair shot.

141
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,400
I think we should focus now on how to beat them.

142
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,600
So that means all our hopes rest on Khun Cream now.

143
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
We don't have much time.

144
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,300
Please help rally the design team,
and start brainstorming as soon as possible.

145
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,600
I'll send over the details via LINE*.
(chatroom app which is mainly used in Thailand)

146
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,800
Sure. I'll get the team together and bring the ideas to you as soon as possible.

147
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
All right.

148
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,200
Should I schedule a full board meeting?

149
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,900
So everyone is on the same track.

150
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,600
No need, Wine.

151
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,900
The design team and I suffice.

152
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,040
Honestly, I'm starting to suspect something.

153
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,100
How come they always seem one step ahead of us?

154
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,000
Are you saying we have a mole in the company?

155
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,400
Do you remember the power outage during the fashion show?

156
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,000
Someone intentionally cut the main circuit and destroyed the CCTV footage.

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,200
Just like the night someone broke in and stole our designs.

158
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,500
Ai Tul suspects it might be an inside job.

159
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,700
Please keep your eyes open, but do it quietly.

160
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,600
We don't want them to know we're on to them.

161
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,600
This campaign will decide who wins between us and Nira Fashion House.

162
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,000
They won't just sit back and watch.

163
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,787
[Nira Fashion House]

164
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,600
You're truly unbelievable.

165
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,800
You never finish a job (task) properly,

166
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,160
yet you still dare ask me for money?

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm really sorry, Khun Cindy.

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,100
You can yell at me all you want,

169
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,000
but, please, can you transfer the money first?

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I did it for you.

171
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,900
Ken.

172
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,300
Yes?

173
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's go.

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,200
Khun Cindy, please. Khun Cindy.

175
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,600
Give me another chance, please.

176
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,670
I promise, in this competition,

177
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,100
I'll make sure Nira Fashion House signs with P&Y.

178
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,300
Please, Khun Cindy.

179
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,400
Just one more shot.

180
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,700
All talk, as always.

181
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,980
If you know you can't do it on your own,

182
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,830
go find someone who can help you!

183
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:28,747
Sure.

184
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:30,860
I'll find someone to help.

185
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,907
But you will send me the money, right?

186
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:37,100
Finish the job first, then we'll talk.

187
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:42,067
This is your last chance.

188
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,153
Now get out.

189
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:50,280
Go!

190
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,720
Damn it!

191
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:05,047
Ai Tul and Cream have started a new project now.

192
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:07,273
It's all top secret.

193
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:10,447
I want to know what they're talking about.

194
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:14,307
Do whatever it takes to get me that information.

195
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,907
Got it.

196
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:19,460
But are you sure Cream really has amnesia?

197
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,880
I'm not sure.

198
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,120
Keep your eyes on her for me.

199
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,760
[Dreamer]

200
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,580
"Iconic Thai Designer" might sound simple,

201
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,720
but I think they want to test us

202
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:42,980
and see how we highlight the Thai identity through our designs.

203
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,753
I believe choosing Thai fabric would be the best way to go.

204
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:48,300
That's so cliché.

205
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,140
Anyone can think of Thai fabric.

206
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,133
But wouldn't it be more surprising if we take something ordinary

207
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,347
and turn it into something extraordinary?

208
00:11:57,347 --> 00:12:01,793
If we could take Thai fabric to a global level, not only would it be good for us,

209
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:04,279
but also for the entire Thai fashion industry, and it would support

210
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,153
local communities who make these textiles.

211
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:07,633
But...

212
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,413
Do you already have a concept?

213
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:13,027
I want to use fabric from Northern Thailand.

214
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:18,387
The northern fabric has such a rich history, and the production methods are so intricate.

215
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:21,813
I want to present this to the world.

216
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:23,580
I don't agree.

217
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,240
Northern fabrics have very distinct patterns.

218
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,194
I don't think they'll match modern cutting or our target audience.

219
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:32,887
I've done my homework.

220
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:37,987
I'll design the pattern myself, but keep the traditional weaving technique.

221
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:40,407
We only have two months. Can you really finish it in time?

222
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:43,527
I know it's risky,

223
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:46,020
but if we don't step out of our comfort zone,

224
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,010
we'll never beat Nira Fashion House.

225
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:51,373
I agree with Khun Cream.

226
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:55,980
I think we need to take a chance.

227
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,287
I choose Khun Cream's idea.

228
00:12:57,287 --> 00:13:00,433
- But Khun Tul...
- Sorry, Min.

229
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:03,780
I understand you're concerned about the time,

230
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,490
but Dreamer got this far because of Khun Cream's ideas.

231
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,140
I trust her.

232
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:16,227
Please take the lead, Khun Cream.

233
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,753
Of course.

234
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:30,853
Then, everyone, please help me research Northern Thai textiles.

235
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:40,293
Khun Tul.

236
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,200
Can I talk to you?

237
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,313
I don't understand.

238
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:52,167
No matter how hard I try, you never acknowledge my abilities.

239
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:55,460
- You mean what we talked about in the meeting?
- Not just that.

240
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,027
Every time I present an idea, it is rejected.

241
00:13:59,027 --> 00:14:04,667
Even if I'm not the creative director, I've learned so much from P'Ben.

242
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,620
Doesn't my opinion matter at all?

243
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,000
Of course, it does.

244
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,807
Everyone's input matters to me.

245
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,893
I listen to all of you.

246
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,520
Then tell me straight.

247
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:23,500
Why wasn't I chosen to be the creative director?

248
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:28,567
To me, Min, you're very skilled.

249
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,027
Your work is flawless, always on point.

250
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:34,920
If this were a test, I'd give you a perfect score.

251
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,060
But fashion isn't a test.

252
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,460
It's an art of communication with customers.

253
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,367
Khun Cream's work may not be technically perfect...

254
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:48,380
but it connects with people emotionally.

255
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:52,573
Khun Tul, are you being biased toward Cream?

256
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:54,200
Did someone from the team complain to you about me?

257
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,340
No one needs to complain.

258
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:59,160
The work speaks for itself.

259
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,467
Right now, you're more suited to be a great assistant, not a leader.

260
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:10,273
But if you want to grow, try adjusting your attitude a bit.

261
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,687
Open up more.

262
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:16,327
Listen more.

263
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:18,420
Min, please listen to what I'm saying.

264
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21,400
You may go faster alone,

265
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,880
but you'll go further as a team.

266
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,107
I'll excuse myself now.

267
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:35,540
Thanks for being honest with me.

268
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,107
The person talking to Tul, and the person sitting here now...

269
00:16:39,273 --> 00:16:41,480
feels like two different people.

270
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:44,480
What do you want?

271
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:49,500
I don't know what you and Tul talked about.

272
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:54,540
But if it made someone as strong as you cry,

273
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,700
it must've been serious.

274
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:01,780
I am really stupid.

275
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,040
Khun Tul never saw my worth.

276
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:10,180
No matter how well you work, at the end, the boss still overlooks you.

277
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:15,200
It's unfair, for someone who's loyal to the company like you.

278
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:18,820
You're talented.

279
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,660
You are smart.

280
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,480
I know that.

281
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:30,480
And what if I told you I could help you go even further?

282
00:17:31,987 --> 00:17:33,953
Would you want to hear it?

283
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,460
How?

284
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,780
Let's set up a proper time to talk.

285
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:44,953
I promise It'll be worth it.

286
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,113
Gosh, Cream, why do you always end up at a barbecue place when you're stressed?

287
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:23,307
You keep saying you won't come back. "No more!"

288
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:26,130
But now that we're here,

289
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:31,600
let's just say this meal will help boost creativity.

290
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:35,100
You did the right thing.

291
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,520
Happy pork 1 set and also 1 Pork Lover.

292
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,310
Nong*!
(*Common way to call Waitress Nong/Phi)

293
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:42,907
One Happy Pork set, please.

294
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:44,987
- Khun Cream.
- Lover...

295
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,087
Khun Tul?

296
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:52,213
If you know each other, feel free to sit together.

297
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:56,260
We've got a "Two for one" promo right now.

298
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:01,787
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

299
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:04,460
- Shall we grill?
- Absolutely.

300
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,367
Didn't expect you to like Thai BBQ.

301
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:10,780
Didn't you already invite me once before?

302
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,000
I...

303
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,107
Did I ever invite you to eat with me before?

304
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:17,013
The accident might've made you forget.

305
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:20,860
But yes, you did invite me once.

306
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:26,167
And did we end up going together?

307
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,593
No, we didn't.

308
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:31,547
There are only a few people I'd eat Thai BBQ with.

309
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:36,773
It's outside of work so I save it for people I feel close to.

310
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,353
Khun Cream, why are you smiling?

311
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:46,880
Because what you just said means

312
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,140
you feel close to me now, right?

313
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:59,887
To be honest, when I first met you, I didn't really click with you.

314
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:03,990
But now, even without the "Two for one" promo,

315
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,960
I'd still want to eat Thai BBQ with you.

316
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,807
Here, this one's ready.

317
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:14,033
Please help yourself.

318
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,580
This one too.

319
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:18,773
Let's start eating.

320
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
Want this?

321
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
Thank you.

322
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,000
Is this how you normally set up your dipping sauces when you eat BBQ?

323
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,610
Yes.

324
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,690
That way my hands...

325
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
What about your hands, Khun Cream?

326
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,900
Tell me.

327
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,200
Khun Tul... erm...

328
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,400
About our meeting earlier, regarding the Thai fabric,

329
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,200
if you have anything else to add, please let me know.

330
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,100
Are you free tomorrow?

331
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,400
I want to take you somewhere.

332
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,800
Can you tell me where we're going yet?

333
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,600
You'll know soon.

334
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,900
Is something wrong?

335
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,840
I think I remember that motorcycle.

336
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,900
It followed me once before, Khun Tul.

337
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,700
- P'Eak.
- Yes, Sir.

338
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,600
If you see anyone suspicious lurking around, let me know immediately.

339
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,000
And don't let anyone in.

340
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,700
Understood, Khun Tul.

341
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,600
Khun Cream, this is my mom's old house.

342
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Let's go inside.

343
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,000
Please, after you.

344
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,900
This was her first sewing machine.

345
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,300
Wow, that's a classic model.

346
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,600
That's me in high school.

347
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,300
You still kind of look the same.

348
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,420
That's Khun Cindy, right?

349
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:06,820
- She and your mom...
- Yes.

350
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,400
My mom and Naa Cindy co-founded Dreamer together.

351
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,030
But then, Naa became too focused on profit,

352
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,600
and she argued a lot with my mother.

353
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,700
The board sided with my mom,

354
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,600
so Naa got furious and left to start Nira Fashion House.

355
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,000
So that's why Khun Cindy wants to destroy Dreamer.

356
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,900
This is my mom's notebook,
full of ideas and inspiration.

357
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,000
Want to take a look?

358
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,600
- May I?
- Go ahead.

359
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,280
[Jigsaw]

360
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,800
Jigsaw.

361
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,500
Yes.

362
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:09,200
It's similar to the concept you've thought of.

363
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,280
Look. My mom used to piece different elements together

364
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,900
to create something uniquely her own.

365
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:19,540
You remind me of my mom.

366
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:24,320
You must've been very close to her.

367
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,980
When you talk about her,

368
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,200
it's like all your memories are good ones.

369
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,500
And you've kept everything that belonged to her.

370
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,100
Not all the memories are good.

371
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,400
Mom, you should eat and take your medicine, then rest.

372
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,200
I have to finish the sample to send to the factory first.

373
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,400
I'm almost done.

374
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,900
- Okay, but once you finish, take your medicine.
- Yes.

375
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,200
Try helping me convince your mom, Tul.

376
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,600
She never listens to me no matter how much I talk.

377
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,200
Darling, I have to check on the factory site in Khao Yai (south thailand) this weekend.

378
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,100
Take care of your mom for me, okay?

379
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,400
I'm almost done. I'll head out soon.

380
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,000
I'll head out now, Son. Take care, Sweetheart.

381
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay, safe travels.

382
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,800
Why does Dad go out of town so often lately?

383
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,440
Mom?

384
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,200
Mom! What's wrong? Mom! Mom!

385
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,500
From the X-ray results,

386
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,000
we found a mass in the patient's left lung.

387
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,400
It's stage 3 lung cancer.

388
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,200
My mom had stage 3 lung cancer.

389
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,000
But she stayed strong.

390
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,500
She has been fighting for ages.

391
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,600
She always said she had to get better, for me.

392
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,340
She went through chemotherapy.

393
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,020
But the worst part

394
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,700
was that my dad never took care of her.

395
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,600
[Calling Dad]

396
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,900
I was upset.

397
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,900
I thought he might find work more important.

398
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But the truth was worse.

399
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,590
I don't even know if my mom ever found out that he was cheating on her.

400
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,400
She worked tirelessly, and fought cancer until her last breath.

401
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,500
Meanwhile, my dad...

402
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
He kept lying to us.

403
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,460
He never told me anything.

404
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,200
Okay, slowly. There we go.

405
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:33,470
Hello?

406
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,000
Hello, where are you, Dad?

407
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,200
I told you already. I'm on a business trip in Hua Hin (southern thailand).

408
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,800
Are you wearing the shirt Mom made for you today?

409
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:55,160
That explains it.

410
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,700
That's why you hate liars.

411
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,800
Khun Cream.

412
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,613
I'm sorry, for sharing such a heavy story with you.

413
00:31:10,693 --> 00:31:13,033
I still have much more I want to show you.

414
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:15,400
In case it might inspire you.

415
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,200
Please, go ahead.

416
00:31:38,387 --> 00:31:41,300
Oh, just a second.

417
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,000
Khun Patrick?

418
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,440
Wow, you came all the way here.

419
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,160
Is there anything I can help you with?

420
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:48,173
You can just call me Pete, like everyone else.

421
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,853
So...

422
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:54,067
Where's Khun Cream? I brought something for her.

423
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:55,460
All of this?

424
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,173
Yes, all of it.

425
00:31:57,173 --> 00:31:58,967
Is it a special occasion?

426
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:02,280
No, gifts like this don't need a special occasion.

427
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,420
Wow. But the thing is, Khun Cream's not here.

428
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,760
She went out with Khun Tul.

429
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,600
- Just the two of them?
- Yes.

430
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,200
Where to?

431
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,280
Can't say. Khun Tul specifically said not to disturb them.

432
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,500
So I...

433
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,387
Please wait a second.

434
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:21,273
Hello, P'Ting?

435
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,120
Oh, what! I forgot!

436
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,900
Okay, I'll, I'll deliver it right away.

437
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,000
Sorry, Phi!

438
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:30,080
Would you like to leave the gifts here?

439
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,570
That's okay. I'll just wait for her.

440
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,720
Okay then, I'll get back to work.

441
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,580
Khun Pete.

442
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,400
- Yes?
- Khun Tul and Cream went to Khun Tul's mother's old house.

443
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,800
And where exactly is that?

444
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,900
I can send you the location.

445
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,900
Here you go.

446
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,940
Why are you telling me this?

447
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:06,740
Win her over, okay?

448
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,160
Thanks.

449
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,426
P'Min! Why'd you tell him that?

450
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:24,640
Didn't Khun Tul say not to tell anyone?

451
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,420
Why should I care?

452
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,987
Khun Tul doesn't seem to care about us anyway.

453
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:32,890
We're also part of the design team, but he took only Cream.

454
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,853
Oh, and don't go blabbing to anyone else, okay?

455
00:33:36,853 --> 00:33:39,413
That I told Khun Pete anything. Understood?

456
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:40,687
Is your work done yet?

457
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,320
Go. Finish it. Now.

458
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,400
Before my mom passed away,

459
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,900
her last project was

460
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,700
to create income for villagers who weave traditional fabric.

461
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,340
But she passed before she could finish it.

462
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,300
All the information is in that notebook.

463
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,700
If there's anything useful in there, you can just let me know.

464
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,100
This isn't just usable, this is a treasure trove, Khun Tul.

465
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,127
Look at this. Here.
[The pattern of sin teen jok]

466
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:17,453
This is special jok-woven sin fabric of Nan (nothern province in Thailand).

467
00:34:17,453 --> 00:34:20,393
It's one of the eight ancient fabrics, a true masterpiece.

468
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:23,900
It's been honored as the Queen of Sin Fabric.

469
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,273
So it's...

470
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:26,833
It's that special?

471
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,393
Well, most people might not know about it,

472
00:34:29,393 --> 00:34:34,280
but this is a textile with incredibly rich, multi-dimensional weaving techniques, Khun Tul.

473
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,300
And it has been influenced by many ethnic groups.

474
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,700
Look at this, Khun Tul.

475
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,933
It's both beautiful and intricate.

476
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:46,020
It's like a form of recording history on fabric.

477
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,973
I think this right here is the key message of our project.

478
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:52,200
Then how about we go to Nan to gather more information?

479
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,140
We can contact the local weavers and see if it's possible

480
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:01,420
to use this special jok-woven sin fabric of Nan weaving technique within our time frame.

481
00:35:01,427 --> 00:35:03,200
Sounds good.

482
00:35:15,793 --> 00:35:20,000
Thank you so much, Khun Tul, for bringing me here.

483
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,700
You're actually the first person I've brought here.

484
00:35:25,847 --> 00:35:29,580
So shall we head back for today?

485
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,953
Sure.

486
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:34,420
I'll take this notebook and read through it first.

487
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,700
- Please do.
- Thanks.

488
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,480
Oops.

489
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,400
Khun Cream?

490
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:10,727
I am sorry, Khun Cream.

491
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:12,840
It's all right.

492
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,200
Khun Pete.

493
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:20,953
Hello, Khun Pete.

494
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:23,650
Khun Cream, I'm in front of the house.

495
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,760
Can you come out and see me for a moment?

496
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,173
In front of Khun Tul's house?

497
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:29,560
Yes, I couldn't get in, though.

498
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,720
The owner of the house wouldn't let me in.

499
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,993
- This...
- Why is Ai Pete here?

500
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:41,180
I don't know either. I didn't tell him.

501
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
Ai Pete.

502
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,793
What are you doing here?

503
00:36:47,793 --> 00:36:50,073
How I got here is my business. Why do you care?

504
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:51,280
And you.

505
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,900
Why are you using your position to take an employee off-site alone like this?

506
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,700
If people find out, Khun Cream's reputation could be damaged.

507
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,600
No one's getting hurt.

508
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,913
Khun Tul and I are here for work.

509
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,300
Okay then. Once you're done, how about we go to dinner?

510
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,300
We could go to your favorite place.

511
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,153
I'm not available tonight. I still have work to do.

512
00:37:09,153 --> 00:37:11,800
Come on, Khun Cream. Work-life balance.

513
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,800
- Give yourself a little time off.
- She said no, didn't you hear?

514
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,727
Khun Tul.

515
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,840
I'll head out for now, then.

516
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,660
If I have any more ideas, I'll let you know.

517
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:29,980
Let's go, Khun Cream.

518
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,000
Khun Cream.

519
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,467
Hey, Khun Cream!

520
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:34,980
Ai Pete, that was way out of line.

521
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,007
- Why are you getting involved?
- Sir.

522
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,253
You're just a supervisor. Stick to work matters.

523
00:37:39,253 --> 00:37:41,500
Why? Are you trying to be the third wheel or something?

524
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,800
What's that supposed to mean?

525
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,740
Khun Cream and I used to date.

526
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,367
We're just having a little argument now.

527
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:49,673
If we talk things out, we'll be back to normal.

528
00:37:49,673 --> 00:37:53,700
So someone like you, an outsider, should stay out of it.

529
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,573
What the hell did you do to make Khun Pete this into you, huh?

530
00:38:30,247 --> 00:38:32,540
And Khun Tul...

531
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,700
Girl, you need to wake up already.

532
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,160
I don't even know what to do anymore.

533
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:51,353
You're done wiping her down already? I was just about to help.

534
00:38:51,353 --> 00:38:53,873
- Too late.
- You finished eating?

535
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,347
All done, dear. Let's go.

536
00:38:55,347 --> 00:38:58,580
You should get back to work now. I'll stay and watch over her.

537
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,593
I understand now, Bpaa.

538
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:07,420
I finally get why Khun Tul hates liars so much.

539
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:12,173
It's not just hate.

540
00:39:12,173 --> 00:39:15,900
It's a deep scar in his life.

541
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,000
If I tell him the truth, he won't just be angry, Bpaa.

542
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,977
I think he'll probably hate me very much.

543
00:39:22,977 --> 00:39:26,073
He'll hate me so much that he'll never want to see me again.

544
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:31,933
So that means we have to keep this a secret?

545
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,320
I'm sorry, Bpaa.

546
00:39:58,747 --> 00:40:01,290
Back when Ai Ben was still around,

547
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,700
he ordered fabric from a subpar factory,

548
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,430
jacked up the price, and pocketed the difference,

549
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,100
and you helped him cover it up.

550
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,900
How do you know that?

551
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:22,400
It doesn't matter how I know.

552
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,340
What matters is, if Tul finds out,

553
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,000
you'll definitely be fired.

554
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,700
You said you had a way to help me advance.

555
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,220
So what is this? What do you actually want from me?

556
00:40:36,793 --> 00:40:40,433
Look, I'm not done talking.

557
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:46,247
You know Ai Tul's gotten extra cautious lately.

558
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:50,360
He won't even share work details with anyone.

559
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,793
He's starting to realize there's a traitor inside the company.

560
00:40:58,313 --> 00:41:00,360
You?

561
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,747
I've worked for Dreamer since Khun Tul's mom's time.

562
00:41:03,747 --> 00:41:07,700
So, so, then why are you doing this?

563
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:17,387
Because we're alike.

564
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:19,533
We're ambitious.

565
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:24,327
When we want something, we go after it.

566
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:26,770
If we team up

567
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:31,860
and bring Dreamer into Nira Fashion House,

568
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:36,640
that creative director position you want so badly? It'll be yours.

569
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,000
You're smart.

570
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,260
So I know...

571
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,100
you'll make the right choice.

572
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,500
Oh, here, Dear. Your charger.

573
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,480
Thanks, Bpaa.

574
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,147
- Your flight's early tomorrow, right, Dear?
- Yes.

575
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,887
If anything comes up, you can call me anytime.

576
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:36,900
Okay. Go do your best at work.

577
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,330
And when you're away for several days with others,

578
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,860
be extra careful, okay, Sweetheart?

579
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:47,033
Yes. I'll take the best care of myself.

580
00:42:58,487 --> 00:43:00,387
What are you looking for, Dear?

581
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:05,340
The fabric swatch catalog.

582
00:43:06,573 --> 00:43:09,660
I gave it to Cake when we switched places.

583
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,460
It must still be at her condo.

584
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,000
I need it to compare with the samples up there too, Bpaa.

585
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,527
- I'll be right back.
- Hey, aren't you eating dinner first, Dear?

586
00:43:20,527 --> 00:43:24,227
I will. I'll eat when I get back. Food's a priority.

587
00:44:02,547 --> 00:44:03,800
Yes, Khun Tul?

588
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,400
Khun Cream, I need to talk to you about yesterday.

589
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,867
Khun Tul, I think there's a car following me.

590
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:13,467
I'm quite sure it's the same one from the other day.

591
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:15,856
- Where are you, Khun Cream?
- I have to go for now.

592
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:18,433
Khun Cream. Khun Cream?

593
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,100
[KT | Huaikhwang]

594
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,380
[KT | Huaikhwang]

595
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:12,500
- Where?
- Over there, Phi!

596
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,300
Let's go.

597
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,967
Excuse me.

598
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,093
Are you a resident here?

599
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,640
Hey! Hey! Stop right there! Hey!

600
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,800
Where are you running off to?

601
00:45:34,547 --> 00:45:36,080
Help! Somebody help me!

602
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,393
- Please! Help!
- Hey! Stop!

603
00:45:37,393 --> 00:45:40,000
Let me go! Help! Let go!

604
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,700
Let go of me!

605
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,850
Please help!

606
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,200
Khun Cream!

607
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,300
Khun Cream!

608
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,500
Khun Cream... Khun Cream...

609
00:46:57,187 --> 00:46:59,060
Khun Cream, are you okay? Where are you?

610
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,467
Wha-Whe... Is he still following you?

611
00:47:01,467 --> 00:47:04,600
Calm down, Ai Tul. Khun Cream is with me now, and she's safe.

612
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,500
Ai Pete, how did you even answer her phone?

613
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,200
I told you, didn't I?

614
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,753
Khun Cream and I, we're getting back together.

615
00:47:11,753 --> 00:47:14,613
So me being with her, whenever or wherever, isn't weird at all.

616
00:47:14,613 --> 00:47:16,927
You're the weird one, calling like this.

617
00:47:16,927 --> 00:47:18,547
I was worried about her.

618
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:21,580
That's my job as her boyfriend. Not yours.

619
00:47:46,293 --> 00:47:48,060
Khun Pete.

620
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,000
- Khun Cream?
- You?

621
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,507
How did you get into my apartment?

622
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:54,973
Take it easy.

623
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:57,610
At the scene, you fainted from hyperventilating earlier,

624
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,100
so I carried into your apartment.

625
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,820
- You carried me into my apartment?
- Yes.

626
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,520
I... I'm thirsty.

627
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,100
Of course.

628
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,900
Here you go.

629
00:48:33,193 --> 00:48:38,453
Look. Thank you so much for helping me, really.

630
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:42,160
But I don't feel comfortable having you in my apartment like this.

631
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,000
You say that like we've never been in this apartment together before.

632
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,300
I already told you.

633
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,380
I don't remember anything about what happened between us.

634
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,673
Then maybe I can help jog your memory.

635
00:48:54,673 --> 00:48:56,893
Khun Pete.

636
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,413
Okay.

637
00:48:58,413 --> 00:48:59,870
I'm joking.

638
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,660
You make it sound like I'm some kind of psycho.

639
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,800
Are you hungry?

640
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:20,060
I totally forgot. Hold on.

641
00:49:20,867 --> 00:49:22,500
Here.

642
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,900
Your favorite.

643
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,400
I didn't know you could cook.

644
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,100
You asked me before, remember?

645
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,240
My family used to run a restaurant.

646
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,900
Don't tell me you forgot that too? I'd be heartbroken.

647
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,827
I've just had a lot on my mind lately.

648
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's really good.

649
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,640
You mean the spaghetti or the chef?

650
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,620
Okay, that joke flopped.

651
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,130
Do you have any idea who that guy was?

652
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,100
What does he want from you?

653
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:05,180
I don't know, but it's not the first time he's followed me.

654
00:50:06,827 --> 00:50:09,060
I think you should report it to the police.

655
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,453
I'll go with you.

656
00:50:11,453 --> 00:50:14,960
Well... I really appreciate everything you've done.

657
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,673
You've been so kind to me,

658
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:21,520
but I don't think I can go back to how things used to be with you.

659
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,473
But we can still be friends, right?

660
00:50:24,473 --> 00:50:26,560
Then let's start from being friends.

661
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,947
And if there's a way forward, we'll see where it goes.

662
00:50:28,947 --> 00:50:31,540
Just don't avoid me, okay?

663
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,600
Just friends. Are you sure?

664
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,200
Yes.

665
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,400
If that's not enough, just say the word. I've got more to give.

666
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,600
Thank you.

667
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,100
Khun Wasin.

668
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,200
How could you be so damn stupid, huh?

669
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,200
It was such a simple job, and you still managed to screw it up!

670
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,700
Did anyone see your face?

671
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,160
No.

672
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,193
If no one had helped her, she would've been finished. I swear.

673
00:51:09,193 --> 00:51:11,407
Someone helped her?

674
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:14,407
So maybe they know we're onto them.

675
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:16,593
For now, stay away from them.

676
00:51:16,593 --> 00:51:18,387
Yes, Sir. So...

677
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:21,553
What about the project info you wanted?

678
00:51:21,553 --> 00:51:24,020
I'll take care of that myself.

679
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,273
You disappear for a while.

680
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,100
Yes.

681
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:46,600
All packed?

682
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,880
Have a safe trip.
