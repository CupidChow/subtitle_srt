1
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:07,653
Cake, no one recognizes us anymore.

2
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:14,280
Good, good. The air is nice.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,767
How are you?

4
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,707
Feeling any better?

5
00:00:23,493 --> 00:00:27,533
The air's nice, and the breeze is cool.

6
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:29,867
I'll go take a phone call real quick.

7
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:35,487
Yes, Pete. What's up?

8
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:37,487
I'm worried about you.

9
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:40,360
I was afraid you might be stuck
thinking about work, so I called.

10
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:45,100
Are you outside?

11
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:52,473
Yes. I couldn't concentrate,
so I came out for a walk.

12
00:00:52,473 --> 00:00:55,153
Cream, it's already so late.

13
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,113
You shouldn't be out alone.

14
00:00:57,113 --> 00:00:59,773
The police still haven't caught the criminal.

15
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:03,753
How about this? Tell me where you are,
and I'll come keep you company.

16
00:01:03,753 --> 00:01:06,927
No, it's okay. I'm about to head back now.

17
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,160
What's wrong, Cake?

18
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,700
Cake!

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,200
What's wrong?

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,967
Cake, what's happening?

21
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,500
Cake!

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,047
Cake!

23
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:01,300
Cake!

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,567
- Oh no, Cake!
- Cake!

25
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,353
- Cake, what's happening?
- Cake!

26
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:06,780
Oh no, Cream, help her! Quick!

27
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,360
- Cake!
- Oh no! Cake calm down.

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,727
Stay calm, sweetie. Calm down.

29
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:19,536
I think she was startled by
the balloon popping earlier.

30
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:20,553
Was it?

31
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:22,267
- Calm down, Cake.
- It's okay.

32
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,993
- It's okay
- Sweetie, breathe.

33
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:26,060
- Breathe.
- There's nothing to worry about now.

34
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,460
Cake is that relative?

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,860
Oh, goodness.

36
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,893
Those kids!

37
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:56,747
Playing pranks and scaring everyone half to death.

38
00:02:56,747 --> 00:03:00,327
Cake must have panicked, that's all.

39
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:01,700
Or maybe

40
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,580
the headaches Cake's been having are aftereffects from the accident?

41
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,187
Lately, she seems strange.

42
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:13,353
Almost like she's trying
to communicate something to me.

43
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:16,800
Or could it be her memory
is starting to come back?

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,067
That's possible. I'll consult the doctor about it.

45
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,267
But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.

46
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:26,207
You need to stay focused on the competition
coming up.

47
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:30,467
You should dedicate all times and resource
to that.

48
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:31,627
Got it.

49
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:35,060
Alright, let's go get some rest.

50
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,540
Good night, sweetheart.

51
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,093
Wasin.

52
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:02,240
How's your wife doing?

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,580
She's better,
but still needs close care from the doctors.

54
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,673
And... has the competition started yet?

55
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:10,540
Almost.

56
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:15,120
Everybody.

57
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:20,680
Hi Gen, allow me to introduce you
to an organizor hall of Bangkok fashion week,

58
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,347
- Khun Tue Sombatsara.
- Good to see you.

59
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:25,680
Our A-list celebrity for Thailand, Rasamee Khe.

60
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,622
- Hi.
- Hi.

61
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:33,760
And Khun Art Araya,
fashion icon and stylish extraodinaire.

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,220
- Good to see you.
- Me too.

63
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,927
Wonderful.

64
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,987
You can do this.

65
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:45,053
You can do this, Cream.

66
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:47,673
You've come so far already.

67
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,087
You can do this.

68
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:52,000
You can do it.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,180
You can do it.

70
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,967
But can you really?

71
00:04:56,967 --> 00:05:00,449
The exquisite handwoven cloth
from Nan province is...

72
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,920
Cream.

73
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,240
Are you nervous?

74
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:08,660
Yes.

75
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,640
Maybe you could try that trick
I told you about during the designer competition?

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,707
I'm just teasing.

77
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,327
Cream, you do realize how far you've come?

78
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:32,060
I really hope you succeed again today.

79
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm rooting for you.

80
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,147
And after the competition,
there's something I want to talk to you about.

81
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:42,040
I'll wait inside.

82
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,940
Hey...

83
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:59,007
Isn't that Kat?

84
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:05,040
How did she end up with Nira Fashion House?

85
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,660
Cream.

86
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,713
Hello, Tul.

87
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:23,820
I'm sorry to hear about the fire
at your fabric warehouse.

88
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,667
Dreamer's been through a lot of bad luck lately.

89
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,493
If there's anything I can help with,
just let me know.

90
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:31,053
It's alright.

91
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:35,140
You already have your hands full
trying to beat me.

92
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,907
Are you accusing me of playing dirty?

93
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,280
Because if I really were,

94
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,180
by now you must already have the evidence to put me in jail.

95
00:07:02,393 --> 00:07:03,767
Tul.

96
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,593
Cream.

97
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,653
I think you should focus on your role for now.

98
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:11,640
Don't worry about me.

99
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,780
Okay.

100
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:19,937
Alright, everyone, follow me.

101
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,433
How did a freelance designer like Kat
end up working with Nira Fashion House?

102
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:33,933
Exactly! I've followed her since I was a student.

103
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:36,860
She's won awards from
all the major fashion competitions.

104
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,133
Wow, Nira Fashion House is going all in
to crush us.

105
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,833
They even hired a top-tier designer to compete.

106
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,360
How are we supposed to beat that?

107
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,247
Calm down.

108
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:53,500
Sorry, Cream. I think I panicked a bit.

109
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,940
It's alright.

110
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,327
I understand.

111
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:59,880
We've all worked so hard
these past couple of months.

112
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,867
But since we've come this far,

113
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:04,930
I promise you...I'll present our collection

114
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,547
that we've poured our hearts into as best as I possibly can.

115
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:11,380
All of our efforts must pay off.

116
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:13,880
Stay strong.

117
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,127
Even though we're not using the
original handwoven fabric from Nan,

118
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:19,807
you've already done your very best.

119
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:22,607
We all believe in you.

120
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,553
Thank you, Min.

121
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:29,447
Everyone, you can head to the runway with Tul now.

122
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:33,340
I'll dress the models and brief them myself.

123
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,347
Wait, you're doing it all alone?

124
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:40,467
I want to be fully focused before I present.

125
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:41,700
Go ahead.

126
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,960
Okay. Let's go, guys. Come on.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,587
Please welcome the
Iconic Thai Designer competition.

128
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:03,833
Our first showcase will be
from Nira Fashion House.

129
00:09:57,907 --> 00:10:02,373
Designers from Nira Fashion House,
please come forward to present.

130
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,873
I'd like to ask the designer.

131
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:13,240
Why did you choose to use plain-colored fabric
for the structure of this piece?

132
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,287
Isn't it a bit too simple?

133
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:19,480
I don't think it's simple. I'd call it classic.

134
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,280
Thai textiles are already recognized globally.

135
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,053
I just wanted to build on that success.

136
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:30,887
I chose plain fabric because
I love its simplicity and elegance.

137
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,207
Looking at the craftsmanship,
it couldn't have been easy to complete.

138
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:38,627
How did you manage the process?

139
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:41,630
Our entire team, from the designers,

140
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,060
to the patternmakers and weavers,

141
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,953
we selected professionals only.

142
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:50,540
Because I wanted to make this piece
the absolute best.

143
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,813
I love it.

144
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:56,133
It looks refined and classic, just like you said.

145
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:59,540
And honestly, I can picture a Hollywood star

146
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,520
wearing this on a red carpet gala.

147
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,113
It's absolutely wow.

148
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,800
Thank you.

149
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,933
Now, please welcome the next showcase
from Dreamer,

150
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:20,700
featuring handwoven fabric from Nan Province.

151
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,093
Tul, I'm not confident in this design at all.

152
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:55,874
No matter how beautiful it is,

153
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:58,767
if we don't use the original handwoven fabric
from Nan as the main material,

154
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,300
I don't think we can beat Nira Fashion House.

155
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,853
Can I go back to using the Nan handwoven fabric?

156
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:05,800
But it was burned in the fire.

157
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,720
How are you going to manage that?

158
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,980
I'll create a new design.

159
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,287
There's something I need to ask Professor.

160
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:15,860
I want to request two pieces of newly woven fabric,

161
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,360
but no one can know about this.

162
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,550
If Min really is involved in trying to sabotage Dreamer,

163
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,040
then none of our work is safe.

164
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,940
Exactly.

165
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:40,073
About using the Nan handwoven fabric,
we must absolutely hide it from her.

166
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:43,547
Starting tomorrow,
I'll tell everyone to work from home.

167
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:46,887
That way she'll think we're still working
on the old designs.

168
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:51,500
Then we'll gather at Tul's house
to finish the new collection I designed.

169
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,920
Alright, if there's nothing else,
let's break for now.

170
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,207
Next, we invite the designer from Dreamer
to present.

171
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,840
- Hello.
- Hi there.

172
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,313
Excuse me, is this handwoven fabric
from Nan Province?

173
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:12,727
Yes.

174
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,393
This is a traditional teen jok fabric from Nan.

175
00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:17,857
It's considered one of the queens
of Northern Thai textiles,

176
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,567
specifically from the Chiang Saen lineage.

177
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:24,313
The fabric is made of cotton,
and woven using both jok and khit techniques.

178
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,820
My team and I designed the pattern from scratch

179
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,380
to give the fabric its own distinct identity.

180
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,327
We drew inspiration from a famous mural in Nan,

181
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:39,040
called The Whisper of Love
That Echoes Through the World.

182
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,627
It's beautiful.

183
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:43,387
The embroidery detail is stunning.

184
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:45,087
Thank you.

185
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:50,233
Could you tell us why you chose
this particular fabric?

186
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:55,587
I heard it's quite difficult to work with.

187
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:56,753
Yes, it is.

188
00:14:56,753 --> 00:14:59,980
Not only is the fabric incredibly hard to weave,

189
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,015
but I also wanted to use
the Iconic Thai Designer theme

190
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:04,947
to tackle real issues in the fashion industry.

191
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,833
First is the environmental issue.

192
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:11,673
The fashion industry is one of the most
notorious polluters.

193
00:15:11,673 --> 00:15:13,750
So I thought, if we could promote Thai textiles

194
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,820
which are made from natural materials,

195
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,953
and elevate them on a global scale,

196
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:23,860
we could actually help reduce
the use of harmful raw materials.

197
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,460
Second, I wanted to address
the economic challenges in local communities.

198
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,293
I want to support sustainable careers
for local weavers.

199
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:38,773
Right now, the customer base for this fabric
is very small.

200
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:42,987
But if we can make Nan's handwoven fabric
globally recognized,

201
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:48,200
then we can generate sustainable income
for these communities.

202
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,540
That's a huge surprise. That you chose local
traditional fabric to create such a modern piece.

203
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,300
It's creative yet still rooted in preservation.

204
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,260
Yes. That is the intention
of all of us at Dreamer.

205
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,633
We want to showcase the talent of Thai people
to the world.

206
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:13,000
To show that Thai fabrics truly belong
on the global stage.

207
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:28,063
Actually, I'd to say that it was
a very difficult decision to make.

208
00:16:28,744 --> 00:16:32,700
What you guys did it...
very beautiful and I like it very much,

209
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,213
good determination to want to be apart of P&Y.

210
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:45,780
You guys are wondering
who will be joining P&Y team.

211
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,293
And now, the judges have made their decision.

212
00:16:56,293 --> 00:17:00,320
The company joining the P&Y group is...

213
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,440
Dreamer.

214
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,520
[Dreamer]

215
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,474
You called me in? What is it?

216
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,920
I'll ask you honestly.

217
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,007
Were you involved in all the chaos
that's happened?

218
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:17,780
The design theft at the office,
the blackout during the Spring-Summer show,

219
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,773
and the fire that destroyed
the handwoven fabric at the factory.

220
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:24,747
You were involved, weren't you?

221
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:27,140
Do you have proof that I did all that?

222
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,053
Cream and I have been watching your behavior
for a while.

223
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:37,567
You've been acting very suspicious.

224
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:40,873
Really? I think I've been perfectly normal.

225
00:18:40,873 --> 00:18:45,040
The one acting strange is Cream.

226
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,240
Haven't you noticed?

227
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,213
I only changed because of the accident.

228
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:58,380
But you never treated me nicely before,
and suddenly you're all kind and trusting.

229
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,400
And when you didn't know about the backup plan,
everything still turned out fine.

230
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,067
If anything, I should be the one upset.

231
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:08,340
Everyone conspired to hide things from me
and now you're blaming me?

232
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,480
I'm giving you a chance.

233
00:19:16,213 --> 00:19:21,700
If you admit
that Cindy is the mastermind behind all of this,

234
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,880
I won't press charges against you.

235
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,840
But if you deny it,

236
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,420
I'll make sure everyone involved is held accountable.

237
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,247
If you're so sure it was me,
then bring the evidence.

238
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:38,827
But I'm pretty sure you don't have any.

239
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:42,633
And if you trust me that little, I'll resign.

240
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,287
I think she already knows the truth.

241
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:24,693
Cake!

242
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:28,940
Get the notebook, the pencil too.

243
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,127
- My dear.
- Are you okay?

244
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:48,093
- Cake!
- That's enough, sweetie. Stop now.

245
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:52,040
Don't stress, honey. Don't stress.

246
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,560
Calm down.

247
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,630
Listen to Auntie.
No more, okay?

248
00:21:57,633 --> 00:22:00,727
Just breathe. Don't think too much.

249
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,807
Why did P&Y choose
to sign a contract with Dreamer?

250
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:10,240
Of course, Dreamer's work has
both creativity and the kind of quality

251
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,020
that meets international standards.

252
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,213
Right now, there's no brand
more deserving than Dreamer.

253
00:22:15,213 --> 00:22:16,487
And what about you?

254
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:19,400
Being the first Thai brand
to join a global company,

255
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,413
how does that feel?

256
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:22,327
I'm incredibly proud.

257
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:25,320
It feels like I've passed another major test.

258
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,020
And Dreamer wouldn't have made it to this point
without this Creative Director.

259
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,073
- Thank you, Tul.
- Thank you as well.

260
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,600
[Dreamer]

261
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,490
The first project P&Y will work on now is

262
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,480
pushing Dreamer to the international stage.

263
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,780
From now on, you and I...

264
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,810
Gong, you and I will probably be meeting a lot.

265
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,390
I hope you won't get sick of seeing me.

266
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,800
I'm good with that.

267
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:07,230
And when it comes to the fashion design itself,

268
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,910
we're giving Dreamer full creative freedom.

269
00:23:09,913 --> 00:23:13,040
That way, the brand can maintain its identity.

270
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,770
Dreamer's first collection under P&Y

271
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,380
will debut at the upcoming Paris Fashion Week.

272
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,213
Isn't that a bit soon?

273
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,753
It's only a few months away.

274
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:26,200
If we delay, it'll look like

275
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,367
Dreamer lacks the capability.

276
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,180
Don't worry, Pete.

277
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,880
Dreamer will definitely present
a Fall-Winter collection

278
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,213
at Paris Fashion Week.

279
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,007
Good.

280
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:41,540
Well, that's all from me today.

281
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,340
Thank you, everyone.

282
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,620
Let's go to Paris Fashion Week.

283
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:56,027
Just make sure it turns out as good as you say.

284
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:57,800
Because if anything goes wrong,

285
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,400
Dreamer will be remembered as the biggest failure

286
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,980
P&Y ever took under its wing.

287
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,007
I'll never let that happen.

288
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:15,107
Didn't you say you'd hire me?

289
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:16,807
You failed.

290
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:21,233
And now you have the nerve to ask me for a job?

291
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:28,653
I know I underestimated them.

292
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:31,793
But a smart woman like you must know.

293
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:34,920
I'm still useful to you.

294
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,040
Go on.

295
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,867
I used to work in the design department,
the heart of Dreamer.

296
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:50,410
I have all the info you need,

297
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,490
including Tul's weaknesses.

298
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,313
What weaknesses?

299
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,520
Tul hates liars.

300
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,367
And I think Cream is lying to him.

301
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:07,220
If I can dig up the truth,
we'll have a shot at getting rid of her.

302
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,830
And without someone like Cream,

303
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,520
I believe P&Y will cancel their contract with Dreamer.

304
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,960
You haven't outed me yet
because you don't want to cut Cindy's loss, right?

305
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,493
Right.

306
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:31,867
I've invested so much.

307
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:35,367
The least she can do is guarantee me
some kind of financial backing.

308
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:41,000
But you know Cindy
won't support you forever.

309
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,333
I'm not planning to stick with her forever.

310
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,647
One day, I'll move on.

311
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:48,427
To a place where people
actually recognize my worth.

312
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:50,853
When that day comes, you'll be alone at Dreamer.

313
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,507
So don't slip up and let anyone find out.

314
00:25:53,507 --> 00:25:56,500
Because we still need each other.

315
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,013
You mean about Cream's secret?

316
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:09,620
- That suspicion you had.
- You feel it too, right?

317
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,680
Cream has been acting strange
ever since the accident.

318
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,060
We need to investigate this together.

319
00:26:51,753 --> 00:26:53,440
Birthmark.

320
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,193
You never seen it?

321
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:58,340
Honestly, I think it makes you
look even more attractive.

322
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:11,900
Let me help you.

323
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:15,447
Oh, thank you.

324
00:27:30,153 --> 00:27:32,147
Hey...

325
00:27:32,147 --> 00:27:34,560
Is there something you want to talk to me about?

326
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:39,560
The other day, when I called you,

327
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,640
I heard your auntie in the background saying,
"Help your sister, Cake."

328
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,047
Do you have an older sister?

329
00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:51,690
Cake...

330
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,730
She's my cousin.

331
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,740
And the reason you've been acting strange lately,

332
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,267
is it because your cousin is sick?

333
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:02,780
No.

334
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:08,793
It's just like I told you before,
I was in an accident.

335
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:12,627
But that time when Tul and I came over
to your house, your face looked so worried.

336
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:17,020
Like you were scared we'd see something
we weren't supposed to.

337
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,880
If this isn't about work,
I'm going to excuse myself.

338
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,280
Wait.

339
00:28:26,347 --> 00:28:28,147
One last question.

340
00:28:28,147 --> 00:28:32,320
If it's not work-related,
I'm really not comfortable.

341
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,840
Excuse me.

342
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,427
Pete's starting to get suspicious of me.

343
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:55,887
He asked me if I have a sister named Cake.

344
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:57,773
Do you think he knows?

345
00:28:57,773 --> 00:29:00,607
Like, knows we're twins?

346
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:03,633
I doubt it. Maybe he just suspects something.

347
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:07,493
But he called me in and asked directly about Cake.

348
00:29:07,493 --> 00:29:11,547
When I didn't give an answer,
he kept pressing and pressing...

349
00:29:11,547 --> 00:29:12,640
What should I do?

350
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,227
Don't forget Cake is still at your house.

351
00:29:15,227 --> 00:29:17,853
Pete won't see her, right?

352
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:19,753
He has no proof.

353
00:29:19,753 --> 00:29:20,753
True.

354
00:29:20,753 --> 00:29:25,920
But you must not let him see Cake
under any circumstance. Got it?

355
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,793
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,480
Thanks.

357
00:30:02,193 --> 00:30:04,340
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.

358
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,340
Cream!

359
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:35,660
Help! Someone's being attacked downstairs!

360
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:41,660
Over there!

361
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,873
Hey! What are you doing? Stop!

362
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:49,573
- Help! Someone help!
- I said stop!

363
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:51,167
- Help!
- Stop!

364
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:54,240
- I said stop!
- Tul, are you okay?

365
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,253
- I'm okay. Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

366
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,760
[Bang Mae Nang Police Station]

367
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:07,820
- Good evening, officer.
- Good evening.

368
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,587
The officers told us you were attacked.

369
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:16,007
Can you remember what the suspect looked like?
Any details?

370
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:20,313
He was wearing a mask
and everything happened so fast.

371
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:23,433
Could it be the same person
who attacked you before?

372
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:25,147
The one with the tattoo?

373
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:26,360
Yes.

374
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,327
Then we'll need to investigate further.

375
00:31:28,327 --> 00:31:33,147
From the information we have,
that tattooed suspect already fled out of town.

376
00:31:33,147 --> 00:31:35,807
The police are doing their best to catch him.

377
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,340
Thank you very much.

378
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:41,767
Officer, I'd like to add something.

379
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,740
This attack happened

380
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,320
right after our company signed
with a global brand.

381
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,800
So I'm wondering

382
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,967
if the attacker might be connected
to a rival brand that's losing out.

383
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:56,460
You're suggesting all of these events are linked.

384
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,100
That it's the same group behind it?

385
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,520
Yes.

386
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,550
Alright then, please inform the officer on duty

387
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,250
to record that statement in the incident report.

388
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:05,420
- Thank you.
- I'll take my leave then.

389
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,733
- Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

390
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:10,687
Now please walk me through what happened.

391
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:12,100
Yes. So...

392
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,127
Cream.

393
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:23,480
Over here.

394
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:33,587
I understand you're shaken up,
but we've already reported this.

395
00:32:33,587 --> 00:32:36,320
The police will catch the culprit, I'm sure.

396
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,240
Thank you.

397
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,520
If you hadn't stepped in,
I don't know what would've happened.

398
00:32:47,607 --> 00:32:49,193
But...

399
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:52,200
How did you even know I was there?

400
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,840
I saw you talking to Pete.

401
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,047
You looked really tense.

402
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:04,920
So I came over to check on you.

403
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,680
Pete was just asking

404
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:15,820
if I had any new ideas
for the collection, that's all.

405
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,253
Would you feel safer staying at my place tonight?

406
00:33:25,473 --> 00:33:29,960
I just think you'll be safer,
and I don't want to take my eyes off you.

407
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:33,413
I'm just worried about my relative.

408
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:37,040
What if those thugs go to my house and hurt them?

409
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,727
Then let's ask the police to assign someone
to watch your house.

410
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:53,440
[They're already at the station now anyway.]

411
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,120
[I am not going home tonight.
I am staying at Tul's place.]

412
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:15,584
Make yourself at home.

413
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:18,153
There's a guest room upstairs, I'll show you.

414
00:34:18,153 --> 00:34:21,253
But first, are you hungry?

415
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:24,827
I... I don't really feel like eating.

416
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:27,173
Cream, now more than ever, you really need to eat.

417
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:29,100
You'll feel better, I promise.

418
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,980
Let me take care of it for you.

419
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:34,387
Thank you.

420
00:34:35,927 --> 00:34:39,093
I brought the Korean BBQ to the house
just for you, you know?

421
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:40,840
Thank you so much.

422
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,713
You really went all out.

423
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,487
Of course. Please, help yourself.

424
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,520
Is the way you set all this up some kind of trick?

425
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,020
Oh, no. I just like arranging things like this.

426
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,100
It makes everything feel more organized,

427
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,800
and easier to grab.

428
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,880
It looks great.

429
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:19,940
Yummy.

430
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,847
I haven't eaten this late at night in a long time.

431
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:26,580
Well, that's because
you're always watching your weight.

432
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,473
Honestly, you don't have to be as serious about it
as the others at the company.

433
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:33,833
If eating makes you happy, then just eat.

434
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:39,067
Sometimes being happy
makes your creativity flow better.

435
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:41,007
Just like your mom said, right?

436
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:46,427
That if you do things with love and joy,
success will follow.

437
00:35:48,787 --> 00:35:52,573
But I've never told anyone
what my mom said before.

438
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:57,320
I think the only person I ever told was Fresh.

439
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:05,050
My mom used to say,  if you do anything with happiness,

440
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,480
it will always lead to success.

441
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,290
I don't know what you're stressed about,

442
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,920
but maybe
thinking like my mom did might help a little.

443
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:15,920
Thank you.

444
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:22,313
It's like...

445
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,350
I feel like I read something like that once.

446
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,760
In a fashion magazine interview or something.

447
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:29,813
Must be one of those.

448
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:34,430
Your mom said it so beautifully

449
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,670
that I kept it in my heart.

450
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:40,673
Really? That's great. But which magazine was it?

451
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,573
I can't remember.

452
00:36:54,573 --> 00:36:59,453
One of them, but it was really good.

453
00:37:00,142 --> 00:37:02,120
Good. That's good.

454
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,707
So... Soju?

455
00:37:07,707 --> 00:37:10,807
- Oh, sure. Here.
- It's better with the meat, makes it tastier.

456
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:12,807
Ah, okay.

457
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,580
Hey Champ, can you help me out?

458
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,940
Just check someone's name
in the national database for me.

459
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:40,273
That's it?

460
00:37:40,853 --> 00:37:43,327
Dude, I'm a cop, okay?

461
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:48,467
You want me to access someone's personal info
without consent?

462
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,060
Bro, that's straight-up jail time.

463
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,713
Then why am I even friends with a cop?

464
00:37:52,713 --> 00:37:54,327
Pete.

465
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:57,160
If this person scammed you or hurt you,

466
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,520
I'd help you in a heartbeat.

467
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,727
But you're just suspicious
that she's acting different.

468
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:04,007
Come on, is that really a good enough reason?

469
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:05,870
At first I tried to let it go, I really did.

470
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,100
I told myself she changed because of the accident.

471
00:38:08,107 --> 00:38:09,880
But the way she acts now is super sketchy.

472
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,720
And that birthmark on her waist,
it suddenly disappeared.

473
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,573
Birthmark?

474
00:38:14,573 --> 00:38:18,353
Dude, nowadays you can get stuff like that
removed easily at a good clinic.

475
00:38:18,353 --> 00:38:20,167
I think you're overthinking it.

476
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:25,140
No, I'm sure she's hiding something from me.

477
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,840
[Dreamer]

478
00:38:34,247 --> 00:38:35,713
Min.

479
00:38:40,113 --> 00:38:43,187
What? Wait, wait.

480
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,700
Hey!

481
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,687
You came back?

482
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:49,900
We'll talk later, I'm in a hurry today.

483
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,940
Hi, Min.

484
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,653
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

485
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:23,260
I just came to grab some stuff.

486
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,020
And you? What are you doing here so early?

487
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:27,073
- I had some work to catch up on.
- Oh, I see.

488
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,187
Min. - Feel free to do your job.
- Sure.

489
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:32,040
- Let me know if you need help.
- It's okay, thanks.

490
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,433
Okay.

491
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,507
- Hi, Min.
- Hi.

492
00:39:40,507 --> 00:39:42,547
Hi.

493
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,727
Just grabbing a few things.

494
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:46,760
Okay, we'll talk later.

495
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,390
See you.

496
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,207
Morning, everyone.

497
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:53,574
- Good morning!
- Hi, Tul and Cream!

498
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:54,687
Hi, everyone.

499
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:59,400
Wow, you two have been arriving and
leaving together a lot lately.

500
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,027
Yeah, when are you two going to make it official?

501
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,952
Oh, stop it. What are you talking about?

502
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:11,540
Hi. I'm just here to collect my things.

503
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,960
There's no rule against former employees
doing that, right?

504
00:40:18,813 --> 00:40:21,900
If it's a former employee we trust,

505
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,720
we don't have a problem.

506
00:40:28,013 --> 00:40:30,047
I'm watching you.

507
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,380
Hurry up and come out with new project.

508
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:37,047
I'll be going now. I've got what I need.

509
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,340
I heard Cream was attacked yesterday?

510
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,087
That's so scary.

511
00:40:59,087 --> 00:41:02,927
So I want everyone to be extra careful right now,
okay?

512
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:06,053
- Okay.
- Will do. Is Cream alright?

513
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:07,747
I am fine.

514
00:41:07,747 --> 00:41:09,793
Tul got there just in time to help.

515
00:41:09,793 --> 00:41:10,960
I think whoever did it

516
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,267
was trying to get information about our Paris Fashion Week project.

517
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:17,187
- But to go as far as ambushing her like that?
- Yeah.

518
00:41:17,187 --> 00:41:19,460
- That's really scary.
- For real.

519
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,273
And Cream tends to work late all the time too.

520
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:24,860
Maybe you should stay at my place for now?

521
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,960
Yeah, good idea?

522
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,370
Don't worry, everyone.

523
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,530
Cream is staying at my house right now.

524
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:31,080
What?

525
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,407
Well, now I feel a bit more relieved.

526
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:38,707
But... but I just...

Yes, Pete?

528
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:14,960
Hello.

529
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,840
Are you almost at your condo?

530
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,207
Actually, I'm not at my condo.

531
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:21,240
Wait, did you go to my condo looking for me?

532
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,053
I just came from your house.

533
00:42:23,053 --> 00:42:26,640
Auntie told me you had something to do here,
so I came to find you.

534
00:42:27,347 --> 00:42:29,933
Why didn't you call me first?

535
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:31,940
I'm not going there anymore.

536
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,490
I thought maybe you were avoiding me.

537
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,500
Are you trying to avoid me?

538
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:38,827
It's just that I've been really busy
with work lately.

539
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:41,860
I have to go now, talk later.

541
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:01,567
Yes, I should be there in about half an hour.

542
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:03,253
Excuse me.

543
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,787
You dropped your wallet.

Excuse me, ma'am.

Do you remember me?

547
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:22,973
I'm a friend of the person who lives in unit 803.

548
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:25,647
Oh yes, I remember. What's the matter?

549
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:30,153
I came to see my friend,
but I couldn't find her.

550
00:43:30,153 --> 00:43:33,640
She hasn't been back to her unit in months.

00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:35,987

552
00:43:35,987 --> 00:43:37,947

554
00:43:39,373 --> 00:43:41,800

- Cake, calm down.

- Can I ask you something.

566
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,593
Have you see this person before?

567
00:44:27,593 --> 00:44:29,913
She looks familiar, but I'm not sure.

568
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:31,567
Come on, take a closer look.

569
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:33,987
My friend's a heavy drinker.
She probably came here a lot.

570
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:36,347
In that case, you should ask the bartender.

571
00:44:36,347 --> 00:44:39,127
If your friend really drank that much,
he'll probably remember.

572

Pardon me.

She is a condo agent.

584
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,553
Whenever she closed a deal,
she'd come here to celebrate.

585

Do you happen to have her contact info
or know where her office is?

Sorry, no.
