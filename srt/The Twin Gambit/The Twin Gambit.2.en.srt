If you were to design a collection for sale, what would you focus on?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,600
- Collection for sale...
- Excuse me, Phi.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,100
Could you please buy some candy from me?

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,700
- Just ten baht.
- No, I'm fine; I'm busy. So the...

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,400
- Please help buy some candy.
- Design... Not designing a collection, Cake...

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,387
Oh, Khun Tul...

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,613
About what you asked me earlier.

8
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,913
- Designing a collection...
- Please buy some candy.

9
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:32,993
Gosh, no.

10
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:34,480
Fine.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,700
About designing a collection for sale... Say this, Cake.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,600
First, we need to identify the target audience

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,800
and determine which market we're aiming to sell to.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,600
First and foremost, we need to identify the target audience

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
and determine which market we're aiming to sell to.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
From there, we go deeper into the design process

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,300
and gradually develop a brand that stands out and has its own identity.

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,600
Before moving on with the design to make it unique and recognizable.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,200
But the most important thing is to put your heart into the design.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,600
I believe if a designer is happy with their work...

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,800
The people who buy it and wear it will feel that happiness too.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I love seeing the smiles of those who wear my clothes.

23
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,640
Let me ask you something else.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,780
If you become Dreamer's creative director,

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:32,247
are you confident you can lead Dreamer to number one in the fashion industry?

26
00:01:32,247 --> 00:01:34,193
Yes, I'm confident.

27
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:37,613
Right now, our biggest competitor is Nira Fashion House.

28
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:41,973
But what sets Dreamer apart is how much we care about our customers.

29
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:46,293
By combining the fresh, innovative designs I'll create to that principle...

30
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:51,560
I'm sure we can surpass Nira Fashion House.

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,580
Exactly!

32
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,767
Thanks a lot, Khun Cream.

33
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:01,773
Thank you for changing your mind and agreeing to meet today.

34
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,507
I've spoken to the board.

35
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:06,980
I secured your chance to create the Spring-Summer collection.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,400
If you meet the sales target, you'll get to continue working with us.

37
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,800
And... if I don't meet the target?

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,400
Then you'll be fired.

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,600
And as for me, I'll have to let someone else take over Dreamer.

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm counting on you, Khun Cream.

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Thank you.

I thought getting rid of Ben would be enough.

45
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,800
I really expected Tul to choose Pemika.

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,193
I tried my best.

47
00:03:02,193 --> 00:03:04,300
Some board members were on my side.

48
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,400
But the problem is Ai Tul. He wants a new designer.

49
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,400
When your fabric factory had problems,

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,000
you came to me for money in exchange for helping me bring down Dreamer.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,200
I thought you could do it.

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
It's been two years since.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,100
Yet you still haven't accomplished anything for me!

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Cindy, don't worry.

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
The new designer replacing Ben

56
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,600
is just a rookie.

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,900
I'll ensure she fails and drags Dreamer down with her.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,100
Just do as you said.

59
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,247
- Are you hungry?
- Starving. I haven't eaten anything all day.

Khun Tul...

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,800
He really trusts me, right?

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
You're actually proud of that?

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,600
I'd be panicking if it were me.

64
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,800
The future of the whole company is on your shoulders!

65
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,900
You're literally carrying the brand.

66
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,600
In addition, you have to ensure Tul doesn't learn the truth.

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Don't worry.

68
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,400
I won't let it fall apart.

69
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,000
Because this is my future, too.

70
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,500
Okay, then. I need to organize my schedule so neither of us crashes and burns.

There's only so much time.

And with all your health issues, losing weight won't be easy.

I haven't even eaten anything yet...

78

- The red one?
- Yes.

00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:56,413
No way. It doesn't make me feel confident.

Don't worry.

178
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:53,727
I'm confident I can make P&Y choose our brand as part of their label.

179
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:55,467
Don't worry.

180
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:59,980
I'll make sure P&Y chooses us to join their network.

181
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:18,267
Ladies and gentlemen, and everybody.

182
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,747
Let's all get to know your new boss.

183
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:23,540
- Oh?
- Wow.

184
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:27,000
Hello.

185
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,827
Hello, I'm Phrae. And no, I'm not a doctor.

186
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:31,940
I'm a pattern maker.

187
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,453
- And this here is Doctor...
- I'm not!

188
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:36,160
This is Khun Moo.

189
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,867
Moo. The prettiest one in the pattern department.

190
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:41,227
Yeah, right.

191
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:42,598
And over here...

192
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:45,493
Khai, from the graphics department.

193
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:48,973
And these are Muk and Aom, our designers.

194
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:50,280
Nice to meet you.

195
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,313
Nice to meet you. I look forward to working with everyone.

196
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:53,527
Same here.

197
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:57,633
And this... is your personal flash drive.

198
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:00,407
And over there is your personal office.

199
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,660
It used to be P'Ben's.

200
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,293
I've already had IT unlock the password for the computer there.

201
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:07,733
Some of P'Ben's old files might still be on it.

202
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:10,967
Feel free to set a new password and use it however you like.

203
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:12,507
Thanks.

204
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:16,280
Congrats on winning the Young Designer Competition this year, P'Cream!

205
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,740
You really deserve to be our boss... perfect and elegant.

206
00:14:20,697 --> 00:14:24,200
- Congratulations!
- Are we celebrating a little too soon?

207
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:29,630
Maybe you just got lucky.

208
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:31,647
Hello, I'm Mintra.

209
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:33,710
I'm a designer here.

210
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:37,820
You must have your hands full taking over for P'Ben.

211
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,597
He was really talented.

212
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:43,730
But, anyway, nice to meet you.

213
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,467
Is the work I assigned you done?

214
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,990
- Not yet.
- Then get back to work.

215
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:56,240
Excuse me.

216
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:03,317
Jeez, it's so hot today.

217
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:05,820
It'll cool down soon. Just hang in there.

218
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,600
True.

219
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,520
Did you get the email I sent?

220
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:14,130
Wait a second.

221
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,863
Hey, are you drinking coffee?

222
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:19,170
- Yes.
- Come this way.

223
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,977
- Thank you.
- So...

224
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:31,770
Continue talking.

225
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:37,423
Listen, I sent you the Facebook profiles of everyone at the office.

226
00:15:37,423 --> 00:15:40,823
Study them so you'll know who's who and won't mess up when you come, okay?

227
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:42,710
And the fake Facebook profile you gave them...

228
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,873
You double-checked that there were no photos of me, right?

229
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:48,023
Yeah, I double-checked everything.

230
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:49,237
And what about mapping?

231
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:53,740
Okay, when I get home, I'll update you on who is who.

232
00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:58,003
Wow. Startled much?

233
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:01,753
Did I interrupt something important?

234
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,090
No.

235
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,799
Wait.

236
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,247
Why don't you stick around and chat?

237
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:16,120
Or do you think you don't need to talk to anyone?

238
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,350
Because you got this job through connections?

239
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,503
"Connections"?

240
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,163
You're just a newbie designer.

241
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:27,080
You win one competition, and Tul hires you at once as Creative Director.

242
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,603
If that's not called using connections, what is?

243
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:32,943
You can call it whatever you want.

244
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:35,903
The fact is that I'm already working here.

245
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:39,477
If I were you, I'd be angry.

246
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:42,547
They brought in an outsider with skills they trusted,

247
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:45,480
rather than promote someone internal, like you.

248
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:49,440
You can't look down on me or anyone else just because you won.

249
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,473
I'm not looking down on you. I'm just telling the truth.

250
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,100
Okay.

251
00:16:57,713 --> 00:17:00,887
I'll be watching your work closely.

252
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:04,313
We'll see if your winning entry was really yours...

253
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:07,240
or if you just stole someone else's designs.

254
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,480
Cake, please, don't be too harsh.

255
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,367
Just stay calm.

256
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:20,800
What's the matter? Speechless?

257
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Or did I just hit the nail on the head?

258
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,633
Cake, listen to me. Stay calm.

259
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,600
Calm down.

260
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:32,127
As Creative Director, I have way too much work to do.

261
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:34,753
I don't have time to argue with interns.

262
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,100
Oh, my.

263
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,047
Not an intern.

264
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,080
But a designer.

265
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:43,773
Cake?

266
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,180
What happened?

267
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,587
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! It was an accident!

268
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:58,273
Khun Cream, a-are you all right?

269
00:17:58,273 --> 00:18:01,200
I'm sorry, it was a total accident.

270
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,713
Cake, stay calm.

271
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:04,600
Please don't lose control. If you fight her, the truth will come out.

272
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,187
Stay calm, Cake!

273
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:10,320
I think... maybe we should clean that up first,

274
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,573
just to be sure you have no cuts or bruises. Let's go, Khun Cream.

275
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:17,000
You, too. Let's go.

276
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,907
Yes, Khun Tul.

277
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,000
Are you feeling all right?

278
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,033
I'm fine now.

279
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:39,633
Luckily, it didn't hit my arm that much.

280
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:40,920
Here you go.

281
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,593
Thank you.

282
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:45,060
Keep it for use later.

283
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,287
- Thank you so much.
- Certainly.

284
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:55,027
Well, that's it for today. You should head home and rest.

285
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:59,353
Also, here's a new outfit. I had them get it from the warehouse.

286
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:01,480
You can put it on right away.

287
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,593
Thank you.

288
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,880
And make sure to use only this gel on the wound, all right?

289
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,513
Absolutely no toothpaste.

290
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:16,060
Wait, you say that as if you've used toothpaste before.

291
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,553
Just don't use it, okay?

292
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:21,427
Or your wound will get worse.

293
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,360
Is something wrong?

294
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:36,027
It's just... You look like someone I've met before.

295
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,520
But I can't figure out who.

296
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,747
Wine.

297
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:51,271
Look after Khun Patrick for me. I'll be there soon.

298
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,380
Khun Patrick has arrived.

299
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:24,553
Ai Pete.

300
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:28,733
I told you we'd meet again.

301
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,367
Got anything smart to say to me today?

302
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:35,747
The new assistant CEO of P&Y... is you?

303
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,240
Yes.

304
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,158
I just got the position recently, and when I learned P&Y was scouting

305
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:43,456
for a Thai brand to add to their network...

306
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,890
I volunteered to oversee the project.

307
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:52,455
Hold on. Why?

308
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:54,061
Why the face, huh?

309
00:20:54,061 --> 00:20:55,671
Hey!

310
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,966
What? Are you not happy to see an old friend?

311
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:04,254
Maybe your company won't even make the cut for P&Y.

312
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:09,855
Be sure to attend P&Y's press conference next week.

313
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:11,837
You must come.

314
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:17,104
You could have just sent your secretary.

315
00:21:17,104 --> 00:21:18,824
Yes, that's true.

316
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:20,569
But I wanted to come myself.

317
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:23,073
I couldn't miss seeing your face when you learned my identity.

318
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,824
Hey, Ai Pete, maybe you should separate personal matters from work.

319
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:28,620
Hey!

320
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,333
Watch your words.

321
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:35,536
The man standing before you now is Patrick, P&Y's representative.

322
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:40,816
I may not have the final say over which brand joins P&Y...

323
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:45,082
but my opinion carries a lot of weight.

324
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:16,706
So I'll be watching closely to see whether your Dreamer has what it takes,

325
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,984
or whether you'll end up disappointing all your employees,

326
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:22,875
Ai Tul.

327
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:35,920
Gosh.

328
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,646
The guy goes abroad, gets polished up, and now he's Patrick. "Hey, I'm Patrick."

329
00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:42,695
But back here in Thailand? He's just Ai Pete.

330
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,937
- I must admit he's made it quite far, though.
- What?

331
00:22:44,937 --> 00:22:45,868
He is going places.

332
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:48,889
- And you're still complimenting him?
- Well, excuse me.

333
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:52,772
Can I ask something purely work-related?

334
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:58,329
What's the deal between Khun Patrick and our boss?

335
00:22:58,329 --> 00:22:59,887
Those two?

336
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:02,526
They've been competing since university,

337
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:04,889
in everything from academics to sports.

338
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:07,690
Ai Pete developed this complex

339
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,940
because no matter what he competed with Ai Tul in, he always lost.

340
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:15,233
- Academics, sports, even love...
- I just lived life and minded my own business.

341
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:17,120
He's the one.

342
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:22,088
The one who turned everything into a competition.

343
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:24,246
Should you go back to work?

344
00:23:24,246 --> 00:23:27,356
- What are you waiting for?
- Yes. Let's go.

345
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:52,793
Oh, what's wrong, Sweetie?

346
00:23:52,793 --> 00:23:54,732
You look so down.

347
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:57,554
I'm trying to come up with ideas for the Spring-Summer collection.

348
00:23:57,554 --> 00:24:01,879
It's just that I have so many ideas, but none of them feel right.

349
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:06,224
It's like it's not right. Something's missing.

350
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:08,201
You need a little snack, Sweetie.

351
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:10,089
Here...

352
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:13,640
Hot chocolate topped with whipped cream and caramel.

353
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,700
Your favorite!

354
00:24:22,384 --> 00:24:24,467
Bpaa...

355
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,320
You forgot I'm on a diet.

356
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,813
I have only three months, remember?

357
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:32,837
I'll never reach my goal if I cave in now.

358
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:34,523
Well,

359
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:39,139
if you were doing this for health, I'd support you all the way.

360
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:43,139
But you're pushing yourself just to fool someone else.

361
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:44,535
Look.

362
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:48,781
You're hurting your body, and you're dragging everyone around you into this mess.

363
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:51,283
It's not too late to stop, you know.

364
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,707
Gosh.

365
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:55,610
It's too late, Bpaa.

366
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:01,210
If I quit now, so many other people will be affected because of me.

367
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:06,240
I can't think of anything.

368
00:25:07,815 --> 00:25:11,913
I'm going for a run.

369
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:14,740
Maybe I'll have a new idea while getting closer to my goal weight.

370
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,979
Oh, my!

371
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:19,260
- What?
- Big ass.

372
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:39,390
Why is exercising so tiring? And it hasn't helped me think of ideas either.

373
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,301
I am so exhausted!

374
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:51,007
Go! Go play somewhere else!

375
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,701
Go!

376
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:01,953
Hey!

377
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,163
Khun Fresh?

378
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:16,520
Fresh? Fresh?

379
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:29,619
Easy... Easy now.

380
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,695
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

381
00:26:38,695 --> 00:26:40,759
Go, go, go.

382
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:52,710
- Khun Fresh, are you okay?
- Meds...

383
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,053
What?

384
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:56,160
Meds...

385
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:58,746
"Meds"?

386
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,780
Open it.

387
00:27:23,145 --> 00:27:25,740
Do you need me to take you to the hospital?

388
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,147
No, it's fine.

389
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,560
I'm feeling better now, Khun Tul.

390
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Why were you riding a skateboard like that?

391
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,440
It was an accident.

392
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,593
The skateboard just rolled right under my foot on its own.

393
00:27:43,593 --> 00:27:45,960
I didn't mean to...

394
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,130
Sorry about that.

395
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,640
No worries.

396
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,207
I think maybe you should ease up on the intense exercise

397
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,147
and focus on managing your weight instead.

398
00:27:55,147 --> 00:27:57,107
And controlling your diet.

399
00:27:57,107 --> 00:28:00,033
I balance my diet and exercise.

400
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:02,880
It works pretty well for me.

401
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,087
If you're comfortable, maybe you could try that.

402
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:09,693
Sure. Thanks.

403
00:28:10,327 --> 00:28:14,813
If you're feeling better, I'll get going then.

404
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:16,653
Here you go.

405
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,020
Thank you.

406
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,740
Excuse me.

407
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,707
- Are you sure you're okay now?
- Yes, I'm fine.

408
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:27,393
- Good. Take care. See you around.
- Okay.

409
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:43,493
Happy Pork Set 3, Lovers' Pork Set 2,

410
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:46,500
four servings of pork shoulder, three of pork neck, and three rice bowls.

411
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,207
That will be all for now.

412
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:52,913
Oh, right. Let's have the special menu as well.

413
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:57,297
This one... two of them.

414
00:28:57,297 --> 00:28:58,930
And two of these.

415
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,010
And... two of the usual as well.

416
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,480
Got it.

417
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,467
Khun Tul?

418
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:14,240
Khun Tul.

419
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,300
Didn't you say you were controlling your diet? You ordered two of each!

420
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,387
Yes.

421
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,303
Well, today is my cheat day.

422
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:30,510
I've been working so hard and deserve a little reward, don't you think?

423
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,440
True. You're right.

424
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,083
Well, you just found out my secret.

425
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:41,577
I guess it's only fair I join you for dinner, right?

426
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,250
Well, I ordered rice for three.

427
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,880
If you want more, you'll have to order it yourself.

428
00:29:51,683 --> 00:29:54,093
I thought you'd offer me some of yours.

429
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:56,227
Nope, you're on your own.

430
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:02,680
Delicious.

431
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,710
I love eating here.

432
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,563
I never thought you'd be a fan of this place too, Khun Fresh.

433
00:30:08,247 --> 00:30:10,950
What are you doing these days?

434
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,790
"These days"? I'm selling things online.

435
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,870
Selling what?

436
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,337
Cosmetics.

437
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:18,477
"Cosmetics"?

438
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:20,560
Khun Tul.

439
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,693
By the way, earlier, you said it was a secret.

440
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,977
What's so secretive about eating barbecue?

441
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:33,860
Well, at my office, everyone is on a diet.

442
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,780
When we have meetings, there are only nuts.

443
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,720
Just nuts. It's like eating bird food.

444
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,207
Oh, my! You must feel so restricted.

445
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:45,717
Exactly.

446
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:48,697
So I have to sneak away and eat out like this

447
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:50,700
just to take a break from all the stress.

448
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,473
This place... This is where I feel most like myself.

449
00:30:56,197 --> 00:30:57,560
Here.

450
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,843
Delicious! I'm so happy my hair is standing up.

451
00:31:05,357 --> 00:31:07,670
What's making you smile?

452
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,740
Well...

453
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:13,440
I feel...

454
00:31:14,297 --> 00:31:16,900
You seem familiar to me.

455
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:20,903
Well...

456
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,267
Actually, you kind of resemble someone at my office...

457
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:28,387
if she were a bit fuller.

458
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:33,253
When I saw her application photo, I even thought she was you.

459
00:31:41,513 --> 00:31:44,127
I guess I just have a common face.

460
00:31:44,127 --> 00:31:46,150
Maybe.

461
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:50,083
By the way, when you're stressed, what do you do?

462
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:54,567
This, actually. Eating here makes me feel better.

463
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,963
Same with me, Khun Tul.

464
00:31:56,963 --> 00:32:00,963
So you're stressed then?

465
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:06,170
Very. I can't seem to come up with new ideas.

466
00:32:08,147 --> 00:32:09,757
Khun Fresh,

467
00:32:10,503 --> 00:32:13,100
my mom once told me...

468
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,243
Told you what?

469
00:32:17,243 --> 00:32:21,410
She said if you do something with happiness,

470
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,860
it will always lead you to success.

471
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:28,739
One day when I was a kid, our house was full of stacked clothes everywhere.

472
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:32,104
Mom said she had collected these old, branded clothes to donate.

473
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:35,168
Some were torn, and some were beyond repair.

474
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:39,307
These are torn, so I'll sew them together to make a single outfit.

475
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:41,296
- Is that a good idea?
- Yes, Mom.

476
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:43,844
She saw the value in those clothes.

477
00:32:59,725 --> 00:33:02,974
Seeing others smile was her happiness.

478
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:06,990
I don't know what you're stressed about,

479
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,890
but if you think like my mom did, maybe it will help.

480
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:14,450
Thanks a lot.

481
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,785
Dreamer started from my mom's happiness.

482
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:23,950
But... it's a shame.

483
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,380
She didn't live to see how much it's grown.

484
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:38,999
So that's why Dreamer's clothes have such unique cutting styles,

485
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:44,291
combining different pieces of fabric into distinctive patterns.

486
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:47,950
Exactly. My mom created that concept.

487
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,677
Taking one part and combining it with another,

488
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:55,160
adding patterns, colors, and making it look more fun...

489
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,700
It's kind of like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.

490
00:34:00,893 --> 00:34:03,660
- "A jigsaw puzzle"?
- Yes.

491
00:34:04,489 --> 00:34:06,408
A jigsaw puzzle.

492
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:07,899
Jigsaw...

493
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:09,723
- Khun Fresh?
- Jigsaw.

494
00:34:10,485 --> 00:34:12,064
- Khun Fresh?
- Yes?

495
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:13,554
What are you doing?

496
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:15,060
I...

497
00:34:16,656 --> 00:34:19,119
I'm just jotting down your mom's quote.

498
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,614
It was so inspiring, so I wanted to keep it.

499
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:25,524
Yes!

500
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,560
Jigsaw... jigsaw...

501
00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:50,152
Thank you, Khun Tul.

502
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:54,791
You won't be disappointed with this Spring-Summer collection.

503
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,040
[Dreamer]

504
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:16,258
If you're ready, go ahead and present.

505
00:35:19,106 --> 00:35:21,740
- You ready, Cake?
- Yes.

506
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:34,868
"Jigsaw" is the name of the concept for this Spring-Summer collection.

507
00:35:34,868 --> 00:35:38,909
"'Jigsaw' is the name of the concept for this Spring-Summer collection."

508
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:42,370
Every part... collars, bodies, sleeves...

509
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,783
"Every part... collars, bodies, sleeves..."

510
00:35:45,783 --> 00:35:47,922
I've designed them with various playful elements.

511
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:51,926
The pattern cuts are aimed at working professionals.

512
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:57,703
- I believe...
- This Jigsaw concept will appeal to all

513
00:35:57,703 --> 00:36:02,070
who are searching for their own unique style.

514
00:36:02,718 --> 00:36:05,501
The idea of mixing and matching different pieces,

515
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:08,058
giving customers the freedom to build their own "jigsaw"...

516
00:36:08,058 --> 00:36:12,035
I think... it's great.

517
00:36:12,611 --> 00:36:14,720
But I'd like to adjust some of the patterns.

518
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,677
I think it could be even better.

519
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:19,041
Let's discuss it privately sometime.

520
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:21,725
I really like it. Your concept is very clear.

521
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:24,264
I'll work on the marketing plan, then.

522
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:28,742
What do the buyers think?

523
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:34,425
I'd like to see the final product.

524
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,411
- Sure.
- Don't worry about it.

525
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:39,420
I'll make sure Dreamer's Spring-Summer collection

526
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,400
will beat Nira Fashion House for sure.

527
00:36:53,738 --> 00:36:55,219
Yes!

528
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,120
[Dreamer]

529
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,241
- I'm going to wash the dishes first.
- Hey, wait a second!

530
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:18,220
- Why is it always me?
- Wash those for me.

00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:33,748

533
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,263

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,060

535
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,640
Why is there a bowl here?

[Enter Password]

537
00:38:26,018 --> 00:38:27,284
I turned on the computer.

538
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:29,180
What's the password?

539
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,920
Sure.

540

[Dreamer]

541
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,930
Ai Ton.

542
00:38:48,836 --> 00:38:50,400
Ryu?

543
00:39:06,773 --> 00:39:08,569
Ton? Ryu?

544
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:10,160
What?

545
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,361
Ryu?

546
00:39:23,385 --> 00:39:24,985
Ton.

547
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:41,568
Hey!

548
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:44,340
Who broke in?

549
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:52,244
Ouch!

550
00:39:59,237 --> 00:40:00,591
All set.

551
00:40:00,591 --> 00:40:02,791
I got the clothing designs.

552
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,401
Yes.

553
00:40:12,122 --> 00:40:13,712
Thank you.

554
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,670
Oh, sorry, Khun Tul.

555
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,291
- Thank you. For the meal.
- No problem at all.

556
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:27,690
I should be the one thanking you, for coming out to eat with me.

557
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,690
Being with you makes me really happy.

558
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,310
Same here. I'm happy when I can eat without having to pay.

559
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,640
So, how are you getting home?

560
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,873
I'll just grab a taxi out front.

561
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:42,000
Why don't I drop you off? It's already late.

562
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,100
It's okay, Khun Tul. My house is really far.

563
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,483
I'll go by myself. I don't want to trouble you.

564
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:51,130
Khun Fresh, with a bill this long,

565
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,290
I think we're close enough now.

566
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:55,947
So I'm taking you home. Come on.

567
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:59,317
- No, it's really fine.
- Nope, I insist. Come on.

568
00:40:59,317 --> 00:41:02,401
Come, Khun Fresh. Let me drop you off.

569
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:06,495
- Okay.
- Quickly, quickly. Come on.

570
00:41:15,384 --> 00:41:18,050
So whom do you live with at home?

571
00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:22,317
I live alone.

572
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:24,484
"Alone"?

573
00:41:32,563 --> 00:41:34,526
Khun Tul is driving me home.

574
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:38,500
Hurry and hide all the twin photos before he sees them!

575
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:58,840
You can drop me off here.

576
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,920
I'll get off here. I need to buy something.
[Minimart]

577
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,056
I'll walk home from here. Thanks so much.

578
00:42:04,056 --> 00:42:07,054
- But I can wait for you, Khun Fresh.
- What?

579
00:42:07,054 --> 00:42:11,241
No need. I like to take my time picking snacks.

580
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:14,433
I don't want to keep you waiting.

581
00:42:14,433 --> 00:42:17,232
It's really close to my house.

582
00:42:17,232 --> 00:42:18,777
- Yes.
- All right, then.

583
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:20,250
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

584
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,410
Let's go out to eat again sometime.

585
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,013
Absolutely.

586
00:42:24,774 --> 00:42:27,780
- Bye.
- Take care on your way home.

587
00:42:58,149 --> 00:43:01,268
Bpaa, you scared me!

588
00:43:01,268 --> 00:43:04,425
What? Why are you so startled like that?

589
00:43:04,425 --> 00:43:07,250
- It's just... I just parted ways with Khun Tul.
- What?

590
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,090
He almost drove me all the way home. If he'd made it...

591
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,440
I don't even want to think about it.

592
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,140
Wait, wait, wait... How did you end up with Khun Tul?

593
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,700
Huh?

594
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,168
You can't keep meeting him like this!

595
00:43:40,168 --> 00:43:43,058
One day, if you lose weight, and your faces start looking alike,

596
00:43:43,058 --> 00:43:45,529
he'll figure out you're twins. What will you do then?

597
00:43:45,529 --> 00:43:48,530
- I want to know... What?
- He is coming.

598
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,000
What are you doing, Tul?

599
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,738
Come on then.

600
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:55,855
- It's stuck!
- Come!

601
00:43:57,956 --> 00:44:00,670
Hurry! Come off! Hurry, come off!

602
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,230
- What are you guys doing?
- Oh, goodness...

603
00:44:17,977 --> 00:44:21,013
Right on time. Just need to pay.

604
00:44:21,013 --> 00:44:23,136
I'll take this one, please.

605
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,200
Wait... Didn't I just see you leave?

606
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,600
Oh, I forgot. Here, I brought this for you.

607
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,000
It's a vitamin supplement for respiratory health.

608
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,200
It's good for people with asthma.

609
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,700
- Here.
- Thank you, Khun Tul.

610
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

- Fresh's Bpaa.
- My Bpaa.

Pleasure to meet you, Fresh's Bpaa.

617
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,200
Is something wrong?

618
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,300
You can't go in.

619
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,400
- I'd like to ask for some advice about clean eating.
- Sure.

Oh, my goodness. Come here!

621
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,600
What is it, Bpaa? I was about to go buy a face mask.

622
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,700
Listen to me. Don't go back there. Don't turn around!

623

Cream and Khun Tul are inside.

624
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,800
If he sees you two together, everything will be exposed!

625
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,000
Why is Khun Tul here?

626
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,100
And why is he with Cream?

627
00:45:58,733 --> 00:46:00,333
Cream.

628

629
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,753
Do you have something to tell me?

630
00:46:10,527 --> 00:46:14,460
Didn't she already tell you everything?

631
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:19,900
I didn't mean for it to happen.

632
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,800
I'm sorry, Cake.

633
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,700
You don't have to apologize.

634
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,800
I used my time to help you, Cream, switching places at the office.

635
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,400
But now you're getting friendly with Khun Tul, eating together like that?

636
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,800
What's going on, Cream?

637
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,400
I didn't think it through.

638
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,300
I didn't think. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen.

639
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,100
If so, you shouldn't see Khun Tul again.

640
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,700
Unless you're not afraid of the truth coming out.

641
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,000
Fine. If that's how it is, I'm canceling our entire deal.

642
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,300
I'm sick of lying to everyone.

643
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,200
Cake!

644
00:46:54,873 --> 00:46:58,247
Fine. I won't meet him again.

645
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:03,147
You said it.

646
00:47:23,113 --> 00:47:25,560
What's up, Gong?
[Gong, Dreamer]

647
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,480
What? What did they take?

648
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
Okay, I'll be right over.

[WIH International Hospital]

650
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
When I went into the design department, everything was a mess.

651
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,400
I knew at once it was a robbery.

652
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,200
I quickly called the police,

653
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,800
but then someone hit me from behind, and I passed out.

654
00:47:47,913 --> 00:47:50,520
So it wasn't just an ordinary thief?

655
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,373
They deleted all the surveillance footage.

656
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,800
I think they must have planned to steal from several places.

657
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,000
And you know what? The police even said some employees' laptops were stolen.

658
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,700
If they wanted valuable stuff, why not hit the executive offices?

659
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,400
Why focus on the design department?

660
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,000
Good point.

661
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,800
Maybe they weren't after something valuable...

662
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,600
but something else entirely.

00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,140
Yes, Khun Tul?

665
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,180
Khun Fresh, are you busy?

666
00:48:53,656 --> 00:48:55,300
A little bit.

667
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,087
Is there anything special?

668
00:48:58,087 --> 00:49:02,013
Well, you know our Sunday buffet, our cheat day?

669
00:49:02,013 --> 00:49:06,200
I was thinking of inviting you to a gallery instead, to see some art.

670
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,260
Well, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately,

671
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,380
so I thought it might help clear my mind.

672
00:49:12,387 --> 00:49:15,427
Would 11 a.m. work for you?

I've been really busy lately.

674
00:49:19,673 --> 00:49:22,520
- You're not free at all?
- Let's talk later, okay?

675
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,200

679
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,380
Are you here for inspiration, Khun Cream?

680
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:20,147
Yes, I like to walk around and look at these things.

681
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:23,833
It's like clearing out all the stressful thoughts from my head.

682
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:26,747
- Art therapy.
- Yes.

683
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,353
Since we're here already, why don't we look around together?

684
00:50:31,353 --> 00:50:34,593
Well, sure. This way.

685
00:50:35,173 --> 00:50:38,076
This room is all about contrasting colors...

686
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:41,493
warm and cool tones alternating between green and red.

687
00:51:01,873 --> 00:51:06,860
Khun Tul, you know more about art than I expected.

688
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,200
Well, fashion and art are basically the same thing.

689
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,353
I agree.

690
00:51:13,353 --> 00:51:16,813
About the robbery, you don't need to worry.

691
00:51:16,813 --> 00:51:21,020
I'm sure the police will catch whoever did it.

692
00:51:21,893 --> 00:51:25,433
Well, I really hope so, too.

693
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:30,407
If you ever feel upset or worried again, you can tell me.

694
00:51:30,407 --> 00:51:34,960
I know lots of good galleries to visit.

695
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,420
Sure.

696
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,600
Kh-Khun Tul,

697
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,400
when we're done looking around, do you want to go grab some food?

698
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,200
We could talk about art some more.

699
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,400
Well, I am sorry, Khun Cream.

700
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,900
I have something else I need to do.

701
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,253
Then... I'll have to leave now.

702
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,500
Oh!

703
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,200
What a coincidence.

704
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,600
They say once is chance, twice is coincidence,

705
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,600
but three times is destiny.

706
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,600
So what would the fourth time be called?

707
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Probably karma.

708
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,000
What? Do you hate me or something?

709
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,800
I'm just saying it's too much of a coincidence, isn't it?

710
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,400
Don't tell me you've been following me.

711
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,500
Hold on. First you called me karma, and now you accuse me of being a stalker?

712
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,000
Do you like Ai Tul, by the way?

713
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,400
Why do you ask?

714
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,620
It's not surprising.

715
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,660
Back in school, every girl liked him.

716
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,800
Wait, you went to school with Khun Tul?

717
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,700
I just overheard you asking him to lunch, but he turned you down.

718
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,800
- So how about going with me instead?
- I'm not free.

719
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,300
I just remembered I have something to do.

720
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,300
Excuse me.

721
00:53:21,473 --> 00:53:24,240
Now, this is going to be fun.

722
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,800
[Dreamer]

723
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,900
Hey, when you present, make sure you emphasize

724
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,000
that we adjusted the design to expand our customer base.

725
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,800
I know. You've reminded me.

726
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,000
I spent all night practicing more than a hundred times.

727
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,400
Okay, okay.

728
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,400
If you get stuck, I'll help you like always.

729
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,400
Yes.

730
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,200
My team and I enhanced the Jigsaw theme by adding more colors and playful elements.

731
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,000
This will help expand our target audience to not just working adults,

732
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,800
but also to teenagers.

733
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,200
Yes! That's right.

734
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,260
It's definitely an improvement.

735
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,600
But I'd like to tweak some details.

736
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,500
Khun Tul, something big just happened!

737
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,100
Open the OneD app right now.

738
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,500
What?

739
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,520
[Breaking news]

740
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,700
This season's Spring-Summer collection from Nira Fashion House is...

741
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,400
"Collage."

742
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:31,800
I want my customers to be able to mix and match pieces themselves.

743
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,400
So I decided to add a special feature to this collection:

744
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,200
selling clothing parts separately.

745
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,000
For example, sleeves, collars, and bodies.

746
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,600
Customers can choose to assemble them however they like.

747
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,500
It's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.

748
00:54:52,107 --> 00:54:53,780
Hey!

749
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:02,500
Nira Fashion House is the only Thai brand that will design for you,

750
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:07,000
because you are special to us.

751
00:55:19,893 --> 00:55:21,966
How can this be?
