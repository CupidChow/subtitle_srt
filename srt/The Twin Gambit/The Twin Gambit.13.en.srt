00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,900
What shocked authorities was the discovery
of a group of migrant workers

180
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,200
who had been physically abused.

181
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,100
And even more horrifying,
a buried body was found on the premises.

182
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,200
Initial investigation suggests
the workers may have

183
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,400
either attempted to escape
or been worked to death.

184
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,800
So far, the police have detained a woman
named Sasithorn, also known as Cindy.

185
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,600
She denied all charges,
claiming she wasn't the factory owner,

186
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,400
just someone who outsourced garment production
for Nira Fashion House.

187
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Unbelievable.

188
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,500
With all that evidence against her,
she still has the nerve to deny everything?

189
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,100
She's not the type to give up easily.

190
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,200
As for the unidentified body found days earlier,

191
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,400
forensic results have now confirmed
[Unidentified corpse indentity found]

192
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,800
that it belonged to Pae,
full name Santi Khokprasit,

193
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
a convict in the Dreamer arson case

194
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,200
who had previously escaped from the prison hospital.

195
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Who killed him?

196
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,800
Was he silenced?

197
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,900
I can't believe
Wasin and Cindy could be this evil.

198
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:10,820
Hey, don't forget
to read the PR script they emailed us.

199
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,251
Already did.

200
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:16,633
Once people hear the interview,
they'll understand Dreamer better.

201
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,233
Also...

202
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,900
Don't you think it's time you forgave Cream?

203
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,100
Can we drop this?

204
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,700
Why?

205
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,600
If Cream hadn't risked everything,

206
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,400
we wouldn't have gotten the evidence
to take down Wasin and Cindy.

207
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
Have you ever tried seeing the good in her?

208
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:39,282
I appreciate what she did for the company.

209
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:41,297
Forget the company.

210
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,800
I'm talking about you. How you really feel.

211
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,700
Can't you forgive her, even a little?

212
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,000
You know she had her reasons for lying.

213
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,700
I just need time.

214
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Just don't take too long.

215
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:01,900
Because right now,
everyone's told you the truth except you.

216
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,300
You're still lying to yourself.

217
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:12,600
If you love her, close one eye, forget what
she did wrong, before you lose her for good.

218
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,200
That's right. This is the kind of ending
criminals deserve. Jail.

219
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,300
Yeah, but about Mintra.

220
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,000
The police questioned her,
but they had to let her go. No charges stuck.

221
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,800
A snake to the very end.

222
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:44,500
Still, at least Tul and Dreamer
are finally free of those people.

223
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,600
They should be thanking you, honestly.

224
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,600
For helping catch the people
who tried to destroy Dreamer.

225
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
A little thank you for me won't hurt as well.

226
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,400
- I was asleep for over a month, remember?
- Yeah, yeah.

227
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,400
No, really. You deserve the biggest thanks.

228
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,100
Well, I only did it to make things right.

229
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,900
Once Fashion Week wraps up, I'll finally resign.

230
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:33,180
Cream.

231
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,057
Are you really going to give up on Tul?

232
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:38,836
I even backed off for you, you know?

233
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:43,174
I don't think I can let go of Tul.

234
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:46,609
But I have to own up to what I did.

235
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,800
I don't think I belong in his life anymore.

236
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,600
That's work. This is personal.

237
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,200
They're not the same thing.

238
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,600
I really think Tul must see how much good
you've done for him.

239
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:04,032
Yeah...

240
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:09,747
But while you've been focusing on me,
what about you and Pete?

241
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:11,890
Have you given him a chance?

242
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,107
I've always thought Tul was the perfect man.

243
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:19,675
He's everything I've ever wanted.

244
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,300
But Pete...

245
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,700
He's not that.

246
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,800
That's what's holding you back?
That he's not your dream guy?

247
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,400
Cake.

248
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,900
You've always been the most
down-to-earth person I know.

249
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,000
Why get stuck on something like that?

250
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,400
You can always build wealth together.

251
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,600
But finding a genuinely good person? That's rare.

252
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,200
Pete never left your side.

253
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,700
He cared for you, helped you in
every step of the way, until you got better.

254
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,400
A great guy is standing right in front of you.
Why aren't you grabbing the chance?

255
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,700
I don't know.

256
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:03,100
Honestly, I think Pete might turn out to be
even more than you ever dreamed of.

257
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,700
We now have solid evidence that the person
who tried to bring down Dreamer

258
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,400
was Wasin Songpaisan,
one of the company's own executives.

259
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
He collaborated with Cindy,
a key figure at Nira Fashion House,

260
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,300
and had been working to sabotage Dreamer
from within.

261
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,600
What kind of evidence? Can we see it?

262
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,100
Sorry, but we can't make the evidence public
at this time.

263
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,000
It might affect the legal proceedings,

264
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,100
but the reason I'm giving this interview today
is because I want everyone to know.

265
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,800
Panisa, or Cream, our Creative Director,

266
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,000
she is the one who gathered the evidence
to bring the criminals to justice.

267
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
She has always dedicated herself fully to Dreamer.

268
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:02,400
Are you just using this so-called evidence
to cover up the fact that you're a scammer?

269
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,600
I've already explained everything about my past.

270
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,900
The reason why I gathered the evidence to
help Dreamer, is because I love this place.

271
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,200
No matter what mistakes I've made,

272
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,400
Dreamer has always supported me
and recognized the value of my work.

273
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,800
So anything I can do to give back,
I'm more than willing to.

274
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,600
And what about P&Y?

275
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Will the negative publicity surrounding Dreamer
affect the contract?

276
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Absolutely not.
Dreamer is still part of the P&Y family.

277
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,200
A Thai brand ready to take on the world.

278
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,600
And lastly, thank you to everyone here.
I really appreciate all of you.

279
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,100
One more question, please.

280
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:46,000
Now that public opinion seems to be
swinging back in your favor, how do you feel?

281
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,900
Thank you to everyone,
whether you understood me or not.

282
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,029
But for me, a mistake is still a mistake.

283
00:20:55,029 --> 00:21:00,451
My job now is to do my best going forward.

284
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,090
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

285
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,700
The unit is in great condition, fully built-in.

286
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,900
The owner's selling
because they're relocating abroad.

287
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:17,181
Sure. What day would you like to
schedule a viewing? Great.

288
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,800
Before the date we agree on,
I will call to confirm one day in advance.

289
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,000
Perfect. See you soon, Somchai.

290
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,600
Goodbye.

291
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,500
Now that you've recovered,
you're throwing yourself into work.

292
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,200
Please let me work.

293
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,400
I've been lying around doing nothing for months,
it was driving me crazy.

294
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,200
You've got that press conference with Cream today,
right?

295
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,000
Already done.

296
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,600
So are you free this afternoon?

297
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,200
There's somewhere I'd like to take you.

298
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,200
Come on. I've never taken anyone there before.

299
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,000
And why me?

300
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,600
Because you're someone special to me.

301
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,100
Alright, I'm free.

302
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,400
Go take a seat first.

303
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,500
If you're hungry, just say so.
No need for all this "you're special" stuff.

304
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,400
Wait here a sec.

305
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:33,705
Mom.

306
00:22:33,705 --> 00:22:36,211
Oh, Pete.

307
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,722
Sit down, dear.
I'm just going to serve that table real quick.

308
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:41,941
- Okay.
- Alright, alright.

309
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:43,968
Here you go, Maew.

310
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,700
You didn't tell me we were meeting your mom.

311
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,900
Oh, my.

312
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,000
What, are you scared my mom won't like you?

313
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,400
Relax. She's always nice to my girlfriends.

314
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Your what now? You're ridiculous.

315
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,800
What?

316
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,100
Come on, don't be nervous.

317
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Here you go.

318
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,100
Iced roselle to cool you down.

319
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,200
Thank you.

320
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,000
You're really pretty, you know.

321
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm not his girlfriend yet.

322
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,400
Oh! She said "yet", so there's still hope!

323
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,900
Oh, I forgot to ask. Have you eaten?

324
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,200
- Are you hungry? I'll cook something.
- No, no, Mom, you don't have to.

325
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,400
Today I'm the chef.

326
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,300
You talk to Cake, I'll go cook.

327
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,900
Come on.

328
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:45,365
Pete's never brought anyone to meet me before.

329
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:47,253
You are the first one ever.

330
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:48,581
Really?

331
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:51,881
Of course. Pete's never had a girlfriend
since he was little.

332
00:23:51,881 --> 00:23:53,720
Don't believe me? Look at the photos.

333
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,164
Here they are.

334
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:00,807
This is Pete?

335
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,459
Yep.

336
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,575
He's always been a bright kid.

337
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:15,363
From childhood till now,
he's never once given me any trouble.

338
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:22,823
He studied hard, earned scholarships, then one day
he told me he wanted to study fashion.

339
00:24:22,823 --> 00:24:25,159
I couldn't help but worry.

340
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,800
Why were you worried?

341
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,300
Because I don't know a thing about fashion.

342
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,200
But more than anything,
I just wanted him to have a good job.

343
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,100
And to do something he loved.

344
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,600
And now, seeing what he's become,
I'm so proud of him.

345
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,276
Here we go.

346
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:47,471
Last call for fried rice express.

347
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:49,856
What kind of dish is this?

348
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:56,211
Let's see if my top student's cooking
passes the test?

349
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:58,302
Here, give it a try.

350
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:07,246
This is delicious!

351
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:11,811
- Whoever taught you did a great job.
- Who are you praising?

352
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,690
Myself, of course.

353
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,308
Here, try some.

354
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,900
Yes, let's eat together.

355
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,600
Do you like it?

356
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,800
- It's really good.
- Eat up. Have as much as you want.

357
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,200
- Come on, taste your own cooking.
- Why? I already know it's great.

358
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:34,488
Here, here. Let me feed you.

359
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,400
- How is it?
- As good as I expected.

360
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,700
Wow, someone's full of himself!

361
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:53,859
This one's for you.

362
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:56,828
Thanks.

363
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:01,268
Hey, don't run, you'll fall!

364
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:07,309
Here you go. Keep the change.
And one of each, please.

365
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:08,859
Sure thing.

366
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,800
- Here.
- Thank you.

367
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,400
Why are you smiling like that?

368
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:25,521
Didn't think you had this side to you.

369
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:27,152
What do you mean?

370
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,222
You didn't think I could buy ice cream for kids?

371
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,700
Here, take mine.

372
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,000
I haven't even had a bite.

373
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,600
You're not eating?

374
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,200
I've had enough of it as a kid.

375
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,400
Thank you.

376
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,600
You know, I used to sell ice cream like this
when I was little.

377
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,000
Wanted to make some money,
so I sold it at the temple.

378
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,400
It was sold out completely.

379
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,200
But I didn't make a single baht in profit.

380
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,800
Why not?

381
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,300
Because Cream spent all the money on snacks.

382
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:15,638
Cream.

383
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:20,732
Do you know why I brought you here?

384
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,600
To buy me ice cream?

385
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
I want to be serious with you.

386
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,400
I want you to see different sides of me.

387
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:37,647
I want a future with you.

388
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,900
Will you be my girlfriend?

389
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,000
I may not be the guy you've been looking for.

390
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,700
But if you give me a chance,
I promise I'll become that guy.

391
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:17,129
You've got yourself that chance.

392
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,100
Don't say things like that.
My heart skipped a beat!

393
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:27,409
My girlfriend.

394
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,300
Thank you for giving me the chance.

395
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,320
[Dreamer]

396
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,800
Everyone in the industry is gossiping.

397
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,400
Ever since Nira Fashion House got
into legal trouble,

398
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,800
no one's shopping there anymore.

399
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,600
Wait, does that mean Min lost her job?

400
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,000
Forget the job.

401
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,800
She should be more worried
about staying out of jail.

402
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,200
True.

403
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,600
Hey guys, have any of you seen Tul?

404
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,400
- No, haven't seen him.
- Nope.

405
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,200
Okay, thanks.

406
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,000
Come here.

407
00:29:28,944 --> 00:29:32,792
Do you think Cream's really going to quit?

408
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:35,920
Well, Tul's not talking to her at all.

409
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,938
If I were her, I couldn't stay either.

410
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,400
Everyone else has told you the truth.

411
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,600
The only one still lying is you, to yourself.

412
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,000
If you love her, then close one eye.
Forget some of the bad things she did.

413
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,600
Better that than losing her altogether.

414
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:04,510
Thanks.

415
00:30:24,877 --> 00:30:28,938
I wanted to ask
if you could help review something.

416
00:30:28,938 --> 00:30:32,232
I tried calling and texting Wine,
but she hasn't responded at all.

417
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:35,181
And I'm kind of in a rush,
so I'd like you to take a look first.

418
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:37,096
Of course.

419
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,828
This is the showroom
where we'll hold the fashion show in Paris.

420
00:30:48,828 --> 00:30:52,341
The central space will be the runway.

421
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:54,520
And I had an idea.

422
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:00,461
Normally, after the show,
the buyers look at clothes on hangers, right?

423
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:03,753
But this time,
I want the models to stay in the outfits

424
00:31:03,753 --> 00:31:09,131
so the buyers can view the pieces right on them.

425
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:10,787
Do you like it?

426
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,514
Yeah.

427
00:31:22,435 --> 00:31:23,715
Erm...

428
00:31:24,938 --> 00:31:26,345
Cream.

429
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:30,782
I've been thinking...

430
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:36,679
- I think...
- Tul, excuse me.

431
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:39,617
The lawyer's here to see you. It's urgent.

432
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:44,491
The police just granted bail for Cindy.

433
00:31:44,491 --> 00:31:45,574
What?

434
00:31:48,117 --> 00:31:51,397
Even with all the evidence we have?
How is that possible?

435
00:31:51,397 --> 00:31:58,473
Her lawyer claimed the evidence the police have
was obtained illegally.

436
00:31:58,473 --> 00:32:01,882
So he filed for bail
while the court evaluates the case.

437
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:06,367
Probably because of Cindy's connections, right?

438
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:12,812
As for Wasin's case,
the police opposed his bail request.

439
00:32:12,812 --> 00:32:17,862
Since he was already a suspect
in helping a prisoner escape last time.

440
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:22,798
So is there anything we can do about Cindy now?

441
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:24,795
We need more evidence.

442
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:28,686
Something that directly links her to the case.

443
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:31,074
Last time we nearly died doing this.
Are we really doing it again?

444
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,241
Where are we even going to start?

445
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,680
[Aunt Cindy]

446
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,207
- Aunt Cindy?
- Huh?

447
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:44,815
Just a moment.

448
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:48,640
Here.

449
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:54,106
So what's it?

450
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:57,399
Why do you sound like that?

451
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:00,578
Aren't you happy I made bail?

452
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:01,160
I'll be happy

453
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,131
when you face the consequences
of everything you've done.

454
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:06,083
That's cold.

455
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,544
I just called to say hi,

456
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:11,805
and maybe clear up some of our misunderstandings.

457
00:33:11,805 --> 00:33:15,572
I never had any intention
to destroy Dreamer, you know?

458
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:18,999
I don't fall for words that easily.

459
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,450
You can deny it all you want,

460
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,918
but I'm confident that no matter what you do,
you won't be able to bring Dreamer down.

461
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:29,688
Even breaking the law
didn't stop Dreamer's success.

462
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:31,989
You're recording this, aren't you?

463
00:33:32,932 --> 00:33:37,225
That's fine. I don't mind.

464
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:39,282
I've already said what I needed to say.

465
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:43,154
I never wanted to ruin Dreamer.

466
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:48,111
And don't forget to play this for the court.

467
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:51,102
Bye-bye Darling. I'll see you soon.

468
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:17,757
Mom, I'm heading back to Nakhon Pathom.

469
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:21,540
I just quit my job.
I'll tell you everything when I get there.

470
00:34:27,314 --> 00:34:28,941
Min.

471
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,176
Cream, Tul, what are you doing here?

472
00:34:32,176 --> 00:34:34,707
We came to talk to you.

473
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:36,115
Where are you going?

474
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,138
My business.

475
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:39,676
Min.

476
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,015
I wanted to ask you, would you be
willing to testify for Dreamer?

477
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,348
Just tell the police the truth.

478
00:34:46,348 --> 00:34:48,827
They can protect you as a witness.

479
00:34:48,827 --> 00:34:50,249
Protect me?

480
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:52,714
Do you even know how dangerous Cindy is?

481
00:34:52,714 --> 00:34:55,123
Everyone who knows too much ends up badly.

482
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:57,301
Who's going to protect me?

483
00:34:57,301 --> 00:35:00,730
I get that you're scared, but think about it.

484
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,956
Even if you do nothing or try to run,
do you really think you'll be safe?

485
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:08,957
If I were you,
I'd put Cindy behind bars as fast as I could.

486
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:12,671
Was Pae's death Cindy's doing?

487
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:19,366
Please trust me.
If you agree to testify for Dreamer,

488
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:22,185
Tul and I will do everything we can
to keep you safe.

489
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,611
No.

490
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:35,835
Cindy is a mafia boss hiding behind fashion.

491
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:37,370
No one can help me.

492
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,921
And you two better watch yourselves.

493
00:35:55,504 --> 00:35:56,519
Hey!

494
00:36:02,223 --> 00:36:04,149
Sitting alone, huh?

495
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:05,779
Feeling lonely, babe?

496
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:07,206
Get lost.

497
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,976
Get lost?

498
00:36:08,976 --> 00:36:11,316
Oh! Get lost?

499
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,285
You smell nice.

500
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:34,937
Yo, what's going on here?

501
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:36,362
Split up. Now.

502
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:38,529
Move!

503
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:43,137
Can't take my eyes off you guys
just for a second, huh?

504
00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:59,281
Wow. Must be fate.

505
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:05,868
What the hell do you want?

506
00:37:06,482 --> 00:37:08,156
Me? Nothing.

507
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:11,116
But the folks outside, they want something.

508
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:12,321
Hey!

509
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:25,204
Lift him more.

510
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:27,427
You awake yet?

511
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,480
[Dreamer]

512
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,120
[Dies in Custody]
[Fraud convict from major fashion brand case]

513
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,526
Poor Wasin's family.

514
00:37:56,526 --> 00:38:01,889
Sure, he did wrong,
but he didn't deserve to die like that.

515
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:12,193
Which means... Min could be next.

516
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:25,564
Trying to pin this on me now, officer?

517
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:27,649
I already told you.

518
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:29,984
I had nothing to do with any of this.

519
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:33,759
Please calm down. We're just doing our job.

520
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:36,349
According to the report from the prison,

521
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:42,276
just before Wasin died,
another inmate started a fight with him.

522
00:38:42,276 --> 00:38:44,050
That inmate had previously worked at your factory.

523
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,433
So what?

524
00:38:45,433 --> 00:38:48,082
He used to work for me, so what?

525
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:52,870
If he got into a fight, or killed someone,
that has nothing to do with me.

526
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,600
And the factory? It's not even under my name.

527
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,227
So how would I know anything about illegal labor?

528
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:02,028
Think carefully.

529
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:06,937
If you confess now,
your sentence could be reduced.

530
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:16,263
Threats like that are for criminals.

531
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:18,929
Not for innocent people like me.

532
00:39:34,684 --> 00:39:39,698
This will be the last time I waste my time
answering these ridiculous questions.

533
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:44,543
Finish this quickly.

534
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:46,153
Understood, Miss Cindy.

535
00:39:50,954 --> 00:39:53,220
Stick to the plan.

536
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,675
No mistakes.

537
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,960
[We do not work
with individuals involved in corruption.]

538
00:40:10,673 --> 00:40:12,076
Damn it...

539
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:26,018
Late last night, a prison inmate was found
under extreme stress.

540
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:29,436
He committed suicide in the prison bathroom.
[Prisoner found dead, hanging in bathroom.]

541
00:40:29,436 --> 00:40:33,218
He is later identified as Wasin Songpaisan,

542
00:40:33,218 --> 00:40:34,880
currently in the news

543
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,578
for his involvement
in the Dreamer corruption case.

544
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,923
It's Min.

545
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
[Min]

546
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,151
Yes?

547
00:41:03,151 --> 00:41:05,859
You saw the news about Wasin's death, right?

548
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:07,059
You have to help me.

549
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:10,309
Please, calm down first. Where are you right now?

550
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:13,408
I feel like someone's been following me
all the time.

551
00:41:13,408 --> 00:41:16,109
It must be someone from Cindy.

552
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:18,763
You said you wanted me to testify right? I agree.

553
00:41:18,763 --> 00:41:21,528
I have evidence that Cindy ordered someone
to kill Pae.

554
00:41:21,528 --> 00:41:24,264
But you have to guarantee my safety.
I don't want to die.

555
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:25,353
How about this?

556
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:29,885
We meet at the police station
and hand over the evidence together?

557
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:33,295
No. Even Wasin got killed in jail. What about me?

558
00:41:33,295 --> 00:41:34,719
I'm not doing that.

559
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:37,104
Can you come meet me instead?

560
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,431
Okay. Share your location with me.

561
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:48,054
No, Cream.

562
00:41:48,054 --> 00:41:50,497
I'm not letting you meet Min alone.

563
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:54,566
If she refuses to go to the police station,
then at least let her meet you somewhere safe.

564
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:56,977
But I really can go.

565
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:59,093
And what if something happens to you?

566
00:41:59,093 --> 00:42:01,132
I'm not taking that risk.

567
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:05,900
Let her come meet us.

568
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,421
Please.

569
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:40,058
Hello Cream, I'm in the parking lot already.

570
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,510
Hurry.

571
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,890
Where is she?

572
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:21,690
Has Min contacted you again?

573
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,362
No, not a word.

574
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:28,149
Poor thing. She came to us for help.

575
00:44:28,888 --> 00:44:32,697
Let's hope nothing happens to her.

576
00:44:38,748 --> 00:44:40,214
Min?

577
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:46,562
Min, are you okay? Are you safe?

578
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:49,562
I'm fine. Luckily, I managed to escape.

579
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:52,235
I'm so relieved you're safe.

580
00:44:57,435 --> 00:44:58,710
Sure.

581
00:45:01,246 --> 00:45:03,046
What did she say?

582
00:45:03,046 --> 00:45:04,590
She's safe.

583
00:45:06,493 --> 00:45:09,912
But she wants me to go get the evidence from her.

584
00:45:09,912 --> 00:45:11,727
Alone. She doesn't trust anyone else.

585
00:45:11,727 --> 00:45:13,496
No way. Absolutely not.

586
00:45:13,496 --> 00:45:15,960
It's not safe. I won't let you go.

587
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,960
Exactly.

588
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,160
For all we know,

589
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,560
Mintra might've switched sides to Cindy,
and is luring you out.

590
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,269
Don't go, Cream.

591
00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:26,104
But she really sounded scared.

592
00:45:26,104 --> 00:45:29,280
And if we get Min
as both a witness and source of evidence,

593
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,271
Cindy's done for.

594
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,541
I have to go.

595
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:55,714
Walk straight ahead.

596
00:45:57,363 --> 00:45:59,230
I'm here now.

597
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,231
I'm on your left. Keep going straight.

598
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:03,047
Left side. Your left.

599
00:46:03,047 --> 00:46:04,433
Your left side.

600
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:11,870
Thank you for keeping your promise.

601
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,590
Give me your phone. I'll send you the evidence.

602
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,440
[Bigbird]

603
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,605
This is a clip I secretly filmed.

604
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:31,992
Cindy picking Pae up from the prison hospital.

605
00:46:31,992 --> 00:46:35,629
After that, she had someone take him out.

606
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:40,246
I'm willing to testify.

607
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:42,051
But I need to be safe.

608
00:46:42,815 --> 00:46:44,836
I promise.

609
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:48,222
Tul and I will protect you. You'll be safe.

610
00:46:49,414 --> 00:46:50,949
Let's go find Tul right now.

611
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:52,125
Let's go.

612
00:46:56,796 --> 00:46:58,151
They're gone.

613
00:47:10,975 --> 00:47:12,391
Don't make a sound.

614
00:47:15,851 --> 00:47:17,185
Take her.
