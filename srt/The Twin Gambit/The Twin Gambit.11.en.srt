[Nighttime raid suspect arrested]

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,400
[Suspect believed to be
behind the Dreamer factory arson]

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
Sir, about the case, has there been any progress?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,400
We can't conclude anything yet.
The suspect denies all charges.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,200
Is there a possibility that someone hired him

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,400
to burn down Dreamer's factory
for some kind of hidden agenda?

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,500
- That's right, sir.
- Yes, sir.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,200
- Do you have any idea?
- It's possible. Excuse me.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,400
What's going on, sir?

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,600
- Sir, please!
- Sir!

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,800
Sir!

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,200
A case this serious,
and you're keeping me in the dark?

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,000
Exactly. Your guy is going to drag us all down.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I think we should all calm down.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,600
I've got this under control.

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,200
What are you even capable of handling, huh?

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,800
Pae is my guy.

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
He's been with me forever.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
He would never betray me.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,500
Did he say anything
about what secrets Cream's house might hold?

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,200
I haven't spoken to him.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,200
If we want answers, we need to get him out.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,707
Ms. Cindy.

24
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:11,200
Can you help him?

25
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:16,913
Didn't you say you'd take care of it yourself?

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Remember this.

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,000
If I go down because of this,
I am taking you down with me.

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,133
Ton, your legal team can get him out, right?

29
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:57,767
I'm filing for temporary bail now,
but it'll take some time.

30
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:00,687
Did Pae say anything?
About what he found in that house?

31
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,793
He refuses to say anything until he's out of jail.

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,400
And he's threatening if we don't help him,
he'll confess and drag you down with him.

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Damn it!

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Here is the deal.

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,600
I don't care how you do it, just get him out.

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,900
Got it.

37
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:28,400
Her condition has improved significantly.

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,373
But we'd prefer to keep her at the hospital
until she stabilizes further

39
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:33,007
before continuing recovery at home.

40
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:35,040
Got it. Thank you so much.

41
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,400
Pleasure is mine.

42
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:39,153
Thank you.

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,900
How are you feeling?

44
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,800
Still have a headache?

45
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:49,640
Okay.

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,200
Cake, I'm sorry I didn't take better care of you.

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,400
I promise no one will ever hurt you again.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,700
The person who attacked me...

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,800
is the same one who caused the car crash.

50
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
So it wasn't an accident?

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,000
It's the same person?

52
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:32,067
You remember now?

53
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,207
You remember?

54
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:35,580
Some things.

55
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:40,207
Oh wow, even that is amazing, sweetheart.
That's amazing.

56
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:45,800
I believe you'll be completely
back to normal soon.

57
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,600
Okay, so now we just need evidence
linking Wasin to Pae.

58
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Have they recovered the data
from the flash drive yet?

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Not yet. But once they do,
they'll call me right away.

60
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,800
And we'll hand everything over to the police.

61
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:05,507
Cake, don't worry.

62
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:07,560
Everything's going to be over soon.

63
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,840
We'll get our lives back.

64
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,800
Stay strong, okay?

65
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,040
Damn it! When are you going
to get me out of here?

66
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,693
Just be patient.

67
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:33,920
We're working on it.

68
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,647
Are you sure you're not pinning this all on me?

69
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:39,560
We'd never do that.

70
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,400
But if you don't want to wait,
tell us what you found in that house.

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,300
What did you find?

72
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,600
Then we can get you out faster.

73
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:53,260
You think I'm stupid, huh?

74
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,720
If I tell you, you'll kill me right here.

75
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,000
Fine. I'll find my own way out, then.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Guard.

77
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,333
Watch it.

78
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
- Pass it over.
- Nice!

79
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,947
Toss the ball to me.

80
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,900
What's your problem?

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No problem, bro.
I just like messing with you guys.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
- You little punk!
- Ouch!

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,800
Beat his ass!

84
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,400
Hey! Stop! Hey!

85
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,000
Down on the ground!

86
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,000
- Now!
- On the ground!

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,200
Down!

88
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,200
[Dreamer]

89
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,300
- Everyone, gather over here please.
- Yes.

90
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:18,153
Mook and Aom, I emailed you this morning.
Can you print that for me?

91
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:19,460
- Sure.
- Got it.

92
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,947
Last night, I already revised the pattern.

93
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:24,547
Both of you can go ahead
and make the final sample for me. Here it is.

94
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:26,787
Aren't you waiting for Tul
to approve the final draft first?

95
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:30,093
I already sent it to him last night.
This is his approved final. Go ahead and start.

96
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:32,187
Wow, Cream, you worked so fast.

97
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:33,773
Did you even get any sleep?

98
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:39,253
About the email you sent me this morning, I think
the colors in the fabric design look a bit flat.

99
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:40,900
Fix it and send me draft two as soon as you can.

100
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,980
- Got it.
- Sure.

101
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,160
Let's pick up the pace, everyone.
I have to pitch the collection to Tul tomorrow.

102
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,033
But Cream, why are we rushing so much?

103
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,800
I want to have time to revise things properly.

104
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
And if I'm not around,

105
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,847
I want everyone to be able
to keep going without me.

106
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:58,113
- Mook, Aom, are you ready? I mean, Prae.
- Yes.

107
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:00,040
Come upstairs and help me fix the finale dress.

108
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,840
Sure.

109
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:09,987
Is it just me
or did she sound like she's planning to resign?

110
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,800
Anyway, let's just focus on the work.

111
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Let's go, Prae.

112
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,000
I can't.
I have a meeting with the design department.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Wait, come on. It'll just take a minute, promise.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,700
Okay, okay.

115
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's go.

116
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:46,533
Huh? Where did Kae go?

117
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,733
Hey, Wine.

118
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,487
- Oh hey, Kae.
- Hello there.

119
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:51,840
I was about to ask
if you wanted to go grab coffee.

120
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,520
I have a "Buy One Get One" promo.

121
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,393
- Wanna join?
- I'm in. Good thing Wasin is running late today.

122
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:02,400
Let's go then.
Coffee break! I love coffee breaks.

123
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,800
[The path is clear.]

124
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,880
[How's Pete's side?]

125
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,840
[All set.]

126
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,833
[I'm going in.]

127
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,800
[Sure.]

128
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800
[Touch ID, please enter password]

129
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,300
- Is work hectic right now?
- Huh? Wasn't Wasin supposed to come in at 11?

130
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,700
Exactly.

131
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,700
- Kae.
- Hi there, Mr. Wasin.

132
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,400
- Where are you going?
- To grab coffee.

133
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,700
- And my folder?
- It's on your desk already.

134
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,000
[Wasin is here. Hurry and get out.]

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,200
[He's here, get out of there now!]

136
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,100
Thanks so much.

137
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,400
Hi there, Wasin.

138
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Perfect timing!

139
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,500
Pete is in the office today,
and he said he wanted to talk to you.

140
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Shall we go meet him now?

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
Sure, but can I finish something first?

142
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,100
- Of course. See you in a bit then.
- Excuse me.

143
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
He can't finish anything now.

144
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,800
- Wasin! Wait, wait!
- Oh, Wine!

145
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,300
- Not getting coffee after all?
- Nope. Come with me. Now!

146
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:42,280
Wasin, wait! Please!

147
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,100
What is it?

148
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,900
Could you show me
how to set the time on this watch?

149
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,400
- Your watch?
- Yes.

150
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
Forgot to put it on.

151
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,500
You need to rest more.

152
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,000
What is it?

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,900
Pae was beaten up and sent to the hospital.

154
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,200
Okay, I'll head there now.

155
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
These days, everyone uses social media.

156
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,700
My online marketing strategy will make

157
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Dreamer's collection debut go
globally and virally.

158
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,600
I agree with everything you said,
especially investing in micro-influencers.

159
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,400
But let me take this to P&Y's board first.

160
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay, so the marketing budget is approved.

161
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:10,987
- As for Paris Fashion Week...
- Everyone!

162
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:12,991
Everyone, come look at this.

163
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,700
Wait, that's Wasin in the photo.

164
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,900
Yeah.

165
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,960
The guy with the Illuminati tattoo.

166
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Is that Pae?

167
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,100
This confirms Wasin and Pae know each other.

168
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,673
Then I really think
Wasin is the mastermind behind it all.

169
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:50,207
But Tul, Wasin's been with the company
since your mom founded it.

170
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:51,613
Why would he betray us?

171
00:11:51,613 --> 00:11:53,240
Because of Aunt Cindy.

172
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,227
She wants to destroy Dreamer.

173
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:59,220
It wouldn't be hard for Wasin to side with her.

174
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,460
They've known each other since Dreamer started.

175
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,347
Cindy must've promised him a huge payoff.

176
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:06,974
That's why he'd betray you guys.

177
00:12:06,974 --> 00:12:08,560
It makes so much sense.

178
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,567
That's probably why we've never been able
to catch the culprit.

179
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:15,493
Not during the blueprint theft,
not during the sabotage at the fashion show,

180
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:18,540
- not even when our factory was burned.
- Yeah.

181
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,640
It must've been Wasin all along.

182
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,547
On the day of the fire,
he was one of the first to arrive.

183
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:31,093
Not to help us, but to help his own guy.

184
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:34,367
And we've suspected all along
that Min wasn't acting alone.

185
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:37,427
Wasin was the one behind everything.

186
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Oh my god...

187
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I can't believe I let him fool me.

188
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,400
He's been lying to us the whole time.

189
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:50,680
Everyone!

190
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:55,247
I need you to pack up everything
related to the Paris Fashion Week project.

191
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:57,180
Now.

192
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,907
From now on, we're going to work at my house.

193
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:01,187
Wait a second, what's going on?

194
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:02,720
I don't want any leaks.

195
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,521
But Min isn't even working here anymore.

196
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:07,280
So now, everyone's moving operations
to Tul's house.

197
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,040
You'll all work there from now on.

198
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,213
Alright.

199
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:13,467
It's okay to be confused.

200
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:16,893
But start packing now. Let's go, move!

201
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:19,147
Go! Go!

202
00:13:19,147 --> 00:13:21,053
See?

203
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:23,240
That wasn't so hard.

204
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,000
I already sent the photo of Wasin you found
to the police.

205
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,800
They said Pae got into a fight
with a top dog in prison

206
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,000
and is now being treated in the prison hospital.

207
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,800
When I was in Wasin's office,
I overheard him talking on the phone.

208
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,600
He sounded stressed, then left quickly.

209
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Could it be connected to Pae?

210
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,000
In the next board meeting,

211
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,600
- I'm going to propose suspending Wasin.
- Not yet.

212
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,900
Well, I just think we don't have enough evidence.

213
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,000
If we act now, he might catch on
and destroy everything.

214
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,700
Alright.

215
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,800
But why did you suddenly suspect Wasin enough
to search his office?

216
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,200
Lately, he's been acting off.

217
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Something just didn't sit right with me.
So I followed my instincts.

218
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,800
Pete helped cover for you, didn't he?

219
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,100
The exact time you were snooping in Wasin's office

220
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,900
was when Pete came to talk to me about the budget

221
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:37,827
Why didn't you tell me?

222
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,800
Tul, because I knew you'd never agree
with the way I handled it.

223
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
But it was risky.

224
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,700
What if you got caught?

225
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,200
I promise next time I'll tell you first.

227
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
At least tell me before you tell Pete, okay?

228
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,200
Hey!

229
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,600
Don't tell me you forgot it.

230
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,300
Kai, I told you to remind me.

231
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,000
We keep moving back and forth, no wonder I forgot.

232
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,400
You never remind me.

233
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,600
Then let's pick it up again tomorrow.

234
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,400
We're all tired.

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,200
Cream, can we continue tomorrow morning?

236
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,400
You all go ahead. I'm almost done anyway.

237
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
- What?
- Are you sure?

238
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:06,400
We feel bad leaving you here,
but if you said so...

239
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
- Goodnight, then. See you tomorrow.
- Night night,

240
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,100
- Keep fighting!
- Take care, everyone.

241
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,000
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

242
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,120
- Hi.
- Hello, Tul.

243
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,000
Aren't you going home with the rest of the team?

244
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:32,800
I'm almost done, heading out soon.

245
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,400
I talked to Pete.

246
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,200
He's fine with the pattern,
but wants to simplify the graphics.

247
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,800
Less clutter, more elegance.

248
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,000
Got it.

249
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,600
I'll revise and send it to you tomorrow.

250
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,600
Here. Something to listen to while you work.

251
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,200
For days I can't join you for BBQ,
at least it'll help you unwind.

252
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,000
Tul hates liars.

253
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:48,600
- Tul.
- Cream.

254
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,453
You don't need to send me files for approval
anymore.

255
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:53,980
Just send them directly to Pete.

256
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,820
It'll streamline the work flow.

257
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,693
You're pushing to get everything done fast, right?

258
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:00,820
Don't worry.

259
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:07,020
No matter how rushed I am,
I'll give it my all.

260
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,093
You're rushing...

261
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,200
because you want to move on
to work with Pete at P&Y, right?

262
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,900
Why would I do that?

263
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,000
So you can be close to him.

264
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,500
Without feeling guilty around me.

265
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,000
What do I have to say to convince you that
there's nothing going on between me and Pete?

266
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You don't need to say anything.

267
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,400
I believe what I see.

268
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,200
Then I guess there's no point in talking anymore.

269
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll head out.

270
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
It's about to rain.

271
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,000
Better book a car to take you home.

272
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
Thanks.

273
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:20,040
Please don't do this.

274
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,853
I don't know how else to explain
the Pete situation.

275
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:27,680
But there's really nothing going on between us.

276
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:29,720
Cream...

277
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:33,147
I'm angry I wasn't by your side.

278
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:35,287
I'm angry I couldn't protect you.

279
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,600
And maybe, I convinced myself...

280
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,700
- that I mattered to you.
- You do matter to me, more than anyone else.

281
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,000
Do you have any idea how much I care about you?

282
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
Everything I do, I do for you.

283
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,100
And I can't stand it if you end up hating me.

284
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,700
I love you so much, and I've never
loved anyone the same way like I do with you...

285
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,600
That many weight loss pills?

286
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,800
Here. Something to listen to while you work.

287
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,000
For days I can't join you for BBQ,
at least it'll help you unwind.

288
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,467
Start now.

289
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Usually, when you eat grilled pork, do you
always line up your dipping sauces like this?

290
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,300
Yes, so my hands don't get...

291
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,800
- Fresh, you okay?
- I am good.

292
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,600
Here you go.

293
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,140
When did your shortness of breath start?

294
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,447
It's been a while.

295
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:41,773
But it only flares up once in a while.

296
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,300
Like your mom said, right?
That if we do something with love and happiness,

297
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,400
we'll be successful.

298
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,600
But I never told anyone what my mom said.

299
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,800
I'm pretty sure I only ever told Fresh.

300
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,400
Thank you for letting me borrow the outfit.

301
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,800
Breakfast's ready.

302
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,800
Is something bothering you?

303
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,600
You seem stressed.

304
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,000
Well...

305
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,600
It's nothing, just something on my mind.

306
00:25:43,473 --> 00:25:46,780
I'm sorry that...

307
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,700
I'm overstepping, but honestly,
I am really worried about you.

308
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,200
Why are you taking so many weight loss pills?

309
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,660
Well...

310
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,840
I...

311
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm afraid of getting fat. And...

312
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:20,700
I was scared I wouldn't look good in the outfit,
so I've been trying to take care of myself.

313
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,300
This is really good.

314
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,400
Thanks.

315
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,500
Where did you get this music box?

316
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:03,100
I noticed it in your bag.

317
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,500
Sorry for snooping.

318
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,720
Where did you get it?

319
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,400
Auntie...

320
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:20,140
She gave it to me.

321
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,593
She said she found it while cleaning the house.

322
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,700
Is something wrong?

323
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:38,000
It just looks exactly like the one
I ordered for Fresh.

324
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,700
Well...

325
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,900
If you want it back, you can have it.
I'm guessing it belonged to her.

326
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,427
It's okay. You can keep it.

327
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,313
How are you?

328
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:33,733
Still alive.

329
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:35,740
Why did you pick a fight with them?

330
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,680
So Wasin would have an easier excuse
to get me out.

331
00:28:48,087 --> 00:28:54,547
If he doesn't come help me by tomorrow afternoon,
I'll spill everything.

332
00:28:54,547 --> 00:28:58,680
And this time, he's going down with me.

333
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,500
Another bite?

334
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,300
You already full?

335
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,900
Drink some water.

336
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:26,700
Okay.

337
00:29:28,353 --> 00:29:33,300
When you're fully recovered,
I'll cook something really good for you.

338
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,500
You can cook?

339
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,000
Wait, you don't remember?

340
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,200
You're teasing me, aren't you?

341
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,500
About you...

342
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,000
I remember everything.

343
00:29:55,733 --> 00:30:02,160
You know, when you were unconscious,
I thought Cream was you.

344
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,560
I even asked her to be my girlfriend.

345
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,107
- How are you feeling?
- Coming.

346
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,900
Can I sit down? Thank you.

347
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,487
- How is she?
- Oh wow, she looks much better.

348
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,440
Did she get good meds or just a good caretaker?

349
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,800
The doctor said

350
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,680
if she stays stable for a couple more days,
Cake can go home.

351
00:30:40,527 --> 00:30:41,967
About Pae...

352
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,400
The police called this morning.

353
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,600
He's still in the hospital,
but he hasn't said a word yet.

354
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,760
We just need to focus on recovering
the flash drive.

355
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,160
We'll nail him for sure.

356
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:01,500
Sorry, I forgot what was on that flash drive.

357
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,900
Don't worry about that.
What matters is you're safe now.

358
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,720
Exactly.

359
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,200
If Cake can talk this much already, should we let her give her statement to the police?

360
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,720
I think we should wait a bit.

361
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,187
Once we've got the flash drive data,
we'll have both witness and evidence.

362
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:22,567
No way Wasin and Pae can get out of it.

363
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,740
What do we do?

364
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,700
This is risky.

365
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,733
I have no choice.

366
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,360
I'll give him what he wants.

367
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,493
Tell him I agree.

368
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:47,940
And find someone immediately.

369
00:32:00,027 --> 00:32:02,300
Hello.
[Patient Room No. 2]

370
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,000
- What's that?
- Painkillers.

371
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,900
The suspect requested some for stomach cramps.

372
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,140
And that?

373
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,800
Soy milk. Want some?

374
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,600
Yeah, sure.

375
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:16,373
Help yourself.

376
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:27,453
Car's outside. The key's in the medicine cup.

377
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:29,953
When the lights go out, you go.

378
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,800
Wait...

379
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,600
My clothes?

380
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,600
- You good?
- Yeah.

381
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,300
My stomach hurts so bad.

382
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,700
Hey, can you take over my shift for a bit?
I've got serious stomach pain.

383
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:12,340
I can't hold it any longer.

384
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,500
Pat, I'm here now.

385
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,320
Power's out again?
Why is this happening so often lately?

386
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,180
Yeah, you're right.

387
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,300
Shit, the suspect's escaped!

388
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,667
- Radio it in!
- Suspect on the run. Move quick!

389
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,300
Did you manage to get Pae out?

390
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:24,153
No?

391
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:26,720
Someone else helped him escape before we could.

392
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,300
Damn it, this day just keeps getting worse!

393
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,700
Cindy.

394
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,133
Hey!

395
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,700
Grab him!

396
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:53,893
Let me go!

397
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,860
Ow... ow...

398
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,700
I beg you, Miss Cindy, let me go.

399
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,613
I swear I won't say anything about you.

400
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:12,013
What did you see when you snuck into
Cream's house?

401
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,100
I said, what did you see?

402
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,200
Ken.

403
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,100
Open it.

404
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:40,833
You choose.

405
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:49,540
Tell us Cream's secret and take the money,
or die with it.

406
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,600
Let go of me!

407
00:36:22,273 --> 00:36:24,500
Hey! Thief! Help!

408
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,200
Help me!

409
00:36:53,013 --> 00:36:56,013
- Hello?
- Mr. Wasin, it's Pae.

410
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,447
Pae? Where are you?

411
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:59,713
I'm at...

412
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Hello? Pae?

413
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,880
Can you hear me?

414
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:11,480
Hello?

415
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,300
Hello? Pae? Pae!

416
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,700
[Dreamer]

417
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,280
Okay, let's say I go along with your theory,
just roll with it.

418
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,567
If that's true, then it means Fresh lost weight
and became Cream, right?

419
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:56,100
But I'm confused.
Didn't you meet them both at the same time once?

420
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,900
Yeah, I did.

421
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:01,060
What?

422
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,520
Let me borrow this.

423
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,747
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Unlock code?

424
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,100
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a second.

425
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,887
Who are you calling?

426
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,800
Wonderful Slim, hello!
What would you like to inquire about?

427
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,240
Yeah, I'd like to know if Ms. Panisa Rattanawong

428
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,380
has ever used your services?

429
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,800
I'm sorry, but we can't disclose that information.

430
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,060
I just saw how effective her weight loss was, so I was wondering...

431
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,493
if she really went there. Thought I might try it too.

432
00:38:39,493 --> 00:38:45,240
Well, if you're interested,
I can share general info with you.

433
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:49,260
I just want to know if Ms. Panisa Rattanawong

434
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,120
actually came to your clinic.

435
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,540
I really can't say, sorry.

436
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,927
Okay, thanks a lot.

437
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:01,800
So was that good enough?

438
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,600
There's no proof she went.
I think that's enough, man.

439
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,280
No, I think she did.

440
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,913
If she hadn't gone,
they would've just said there's no record.

441
00:39:13,913 --> 00:39:15,700
And what did they say?

442
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,900
They said they couldn't disclose info.

443
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,900
That means there's a possibility
she really did go. Right?

444
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,633
Alright, fine. Let's say I believe you again.

445
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:31,400
Let's say Fresh did go there.

446
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Then who the hell is the Cream
we've been working with since day one?

447
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,200
This is the finale piece
from the ldentity collection.

448
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:53,260
It draws on themes of social difference
and diversity which inspired the design.

449
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,193
- These outfits you're seeing...
- Hold it right there!

450
00:39:57,453 --> 00:39:59,233
What is this?

451
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:02,727
This is an important meeting.
Why didn't you wait for me?

452
00:40:02,727 --> 00:40:04,440
I didn't think
we'd reached your part of the process yet.

453
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,307
Not my part yet?

454
00:40:07,307 --> 00:40:09,627
I'm on the board!

455
00:40:09,627 --> 00:40:12,400
I have a right to know every detail,
down to the last thread.

456
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,700
That's not how it works!

457
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,200
Let's stay calm, Mr. Wasin.

458
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,600
We're still making adjustments to the designs,

459
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,353
this isn't the final product. It's not something
the buyers need to see just yet.

460
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,833
Before you came here,
we never worked like this.

461
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:30,420
I have the right to know everything.

462
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,300
Tul.

463
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,500
You don't trust me?

464
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,960
Even your mother

465
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,860
- never did this to me.
- Please don't talk about my mother like that.

466
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,547
Tul, calm down.

467
00:40:43,547 --> 00:40:46,013
We have to present to P&Y in two days.

468
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:48,340
Let's not waste time fighting.

469
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,900
Please.

470
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,100
I am sorry.

471
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:59,000
Please excuse us.

472
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,087
- Are you Mr. Wasin?
- Yes, I am.

473
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:06,800
We'd like to question you
about the disappearance of Mr. Santi Kokprasert.

474
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,140
Please come with us.

475
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,080
What's this about?

476
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:30,280
Last night around 11 p.m.,
Mr. Pae stole a phone from another detainee.

477
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,200
The last number he dialed was yours.

478
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,400
There was an unknown number
that called me last night.

479
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,600
But this Pae person, I don't know him.

480
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,600
If you don't know him,
then how did he end up calling you?

481
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,740
Are the police accusing me of being
involved in a prison escape now?

482
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,900
How did you know it was an escape?

483
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:53,407
I never said that.

484
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,200
I only asked if you knew him.

485
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,400
I already told you I don't know him.
I know nothing about this.

486
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,407
Are you sure you want to stick with that story?

487
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:07,780
Because if we find proof that you were involved,
the charges will be serious.

488
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,947
It's you who's making baseless accusations.

489
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,947
I could sue you, you know.

490
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:17,460
If there's nothing else, I'll be going now.

491
00:42:32,707 --> 00:42:36,693
If Mr. Wasin denies it,
does that mean we can't do anything about him?

492
00:42:36,693 --> 00:42:40,407
Not unless we find evidence
or a witness connecting him to Pae.

493
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:44,253
The photo you gave us isn't enough, unfortunately.

494
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:46,893
If anything comes up, I'll keep you posted.

495
00:42:46,893 --> 00:42:49,700
Even after we got him locked up,
he still managed to escape.

496
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,600
These guys are incredibly good
at doing terrible things.

497
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,070
But if Pae called Wasin during the escape,

498
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,313
that could mean Wasin is the one who helped him.

499
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:02,560
- Yeah.
- Tul, what do you think?

500
00:43:05,487 --> 00:43:07,360
Give me a moment.

501
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,800
Wine, call HR.

502
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,460
HR? Got it.

503
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,673
Tul! Tul!

504
00:43:22,673 --> 00:43:25,300
What's going on?

505
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,600
We'll talk later, okay?

506
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,600
We're talking now!

507
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,453
Why did you suddenly issue
a suspension order on me?

508
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:35,147
- I'll explain back in the office.
- Why not here?

509
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:38,013
I want to know right now!

510
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,700
The reason I suspended you

511
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,920
is because the police suspect
you're involved in Pae's case.

512
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,000
I told you already,
I don't know anything about that!

513
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,800
I have no clue and what right
do you have to suspend me?

514
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
What right?

515
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,273
Both me and my mother trusted you.

516
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:03,480
And you betray us by being involved with people trying to destroy our company!

517
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,000
You lied to me.

518
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,853
You lied to everyone who believed in you.

519
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:09,700
I'm on the board.

520
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,000
You can't just suspend a board member
without board approval.

521
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,300
We're days away from presenting to P&Y,
and now you want to suspend me?

522
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,200
That's not going to help the company.

523
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,500
Don't worry about P&Y. I'll handle that.

524
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:28,440
And for the record,
everyone on the board agreed to your suspension.

525
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,973
The suspension takes effect now.

526
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:34,460
You are no longer allowed to attend any meetings.

527
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,680
- What's the next plan?
- Well...

528
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,687
Fai, I'm back.

529
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,767
You're home?

530
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:20,400
Miss Cindy.

531
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,580
Is there something you need?

532
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,800
Please, come in.

533
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:39,400
You helped Pae escape, didn't you?

534
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Where is he now?

535
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,300
He's somewhere where he can't talk anymore.

536
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,327
So you do know Cream's secret from him right?

537
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:04,640
That's exactly why I'm here today.

538
00:46:05,427 --> 00:46:11,600
I'm giving you a chance
to redeem yourself for your past failures.

539
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:16,200
And if you succeed,

540
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,800
it might just turn things around,
and allow you to stay at Dreamer.

541
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,000
What do you want me to do?
