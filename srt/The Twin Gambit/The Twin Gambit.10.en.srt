1
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:08,500
The person I met before. It was Cake, wasn't it?

2
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:11,553
Well...

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,787
Even though you two look identical,
do you know what's different?

4
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:16,480
Cake never had asthma.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,600
And more importantly, Cake had a birthmark on her side,

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
but you don't.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,713
Why did you do this?

8
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:35,700
I didn't mean for it to go this far.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,567
At first, I just wanted to work at Dreamer.

10
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:41,720
But there was a reason I couldn't apply myself,

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,500
so I asked Cake to go in my place.

12
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:47,033
What reason?

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,933
Okay.

14
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,120
If you don't tell me,

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,500
I'll tell Tul and everyone at Dreamer the truth about you.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,580
Wait, Pete.

17
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:06,200
I...

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,180
I...

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,880
Well...

20
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:17,547
Back in high school, Tul and I had some issues.

21
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:20,520
I didn't want him to see me again.

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,147
So I switched places with Cake
during the Young Designer Competition.

23
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:29,460
After I won, Tul wanted me to join Dreamer.

24
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,720
But when I found out Tul really hates liars,

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,640
I didn't dare tell him the truth.

26
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:42,373
So you had Cake working instead of you?

27
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:47,608
And also, while Cake worked there,

28
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,873
I worked on losing weight to match her,
and later I switched back and took her place.

29
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,580
What about the accident?

30
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:01,000
That part is true.

31
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:07,120
Cake's been in a coma here for a long time.

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,693
The day you and Tul came over,
I had to hurry you out.

33
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:14,680
Because I didn't want anyone to know
Cake was in a coma.

34
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:18,340
How is Cake now?

35
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:26,347
Cake, there's someone who wants to see you.

Cream.

- Tul.

- Are you looking for Cream?
- Yeah.

55
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:15,540
She already left.

56
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,487
Tul.

Hello, Tul?

58
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:33,140
Cream, where are you? It's dangerous, you know?

59
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,680
The caretaker called and said my relative
hasn't been eating much.

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,820
I was worried, so I went to check on them.

61
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,160
Stay right there, I'll come pick you up.

62
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,873
- Tul.
- Pun.

63
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:47,653
Tul.

64
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:54,847
Can you get my car keys from the room?

65
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:56,520
Okay, okay.

66
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,813
Auntie, Pete, I need to go.

67
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:01,540
Tul is on his way here.

68
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,187
Don't tell me Tul knows the truth as well?

69
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:09,187
Not yet. But if he comes here,
he'll definitely find out.

70
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:10,953
I'll go meet him outside first.

71
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:12,607
Alright.

72
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,340
Pete.

73
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,407
Please keep this a secret for now.

74
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,533
Alright.

75
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:24,807
But only if you let me help take care of Cake.

76
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,907
I really care about her.

77
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:39,013
Okay.

78
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,013
I have to go now.

79
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:02,473
- Cream, hello?
- Tul.

80
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:05,740
I've already left.
Let's meet at the house instead.

81
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,460
Okay.

82
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,600
Huh?

83
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,320
Where's Pete?

84
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,093
- Tul.
- Cream.

85
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:46,080
The police haven't caught the criminal yet.

86
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,203
You have to tell me if you're going somewhere.
I'll take you.

87
00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:51,900
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

88
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,353
I just thought I'd be quick.

89
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,040
I...

90
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,593
I'm really worried about you.

91
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:08,120
Anyway, let's go inside first.

92
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,840
Okay.

93
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,533
- Hello?
- Min, what's up?

94
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:40,900
Cream took Pete inside her house but left alone,

95
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,450
and rushed to Tul's place.

96
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:44,733
I think there's definitely some secret
between Pete and Cream.

97
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:47,200
I'll keep following them.

98
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,620
It's just...

99
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,280
I'm worried about my relative.

100
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:09,113
When I went back, they looked really stressed.

101
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,760
I...

102
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,453
I want to go back to take care of them.

103
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,380
What if the criminal comes back?

104
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,500
Don't worry.

105
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,520
Well, I already checked,

106
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,240
everything is fine at home.

107
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,540
Please, Tul.

108
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,260
Let me go back and take care of them.

109
00:08:37,753 --> 00:08:40,427
Alright, I'll take you there.

110
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:42,233
It's okay.

111
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:46,700
I can go home by myself.

112
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,687
I'll only let you go
if you allow me to drive you.

113
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:03,533
And please take good care of Cake.

114
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,587
Thank you so much.

115
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:12,547
I actually had one of my seniors
contact a top brain specialist for her.

116
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:15,953
No worries, he's one of the best in the country.

117
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:18,133
Thank you so much.

118
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,730
But as for taking Cake out of the house,

119
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,800
I can't decide that alone.

120
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,020
Cream has to agree too.

121
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,807
I'll tell Cream myself.

122
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:28,360
Okay.

123
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:30,680
Cake.

124
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,927
Hang in there, okay?

125
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:36,493
You'll get better soon.

126
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:40,840
Oh, Pete, there's something I want you to see.

127
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:46,420
Here.

128
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:50,527
Can you figure out what this picture is?

129
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:55,780
Me and Cream tried to guess,
but we couldn't tell what it was.

130
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:59,333
When did Cake draw this?

131
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,133
She started drawing a while ago,
when she was first able to move her hands again.

132
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:06,520
Has she done anything else besides drawing?

133
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,767
Well...

134
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:14,567
It's like she's trying to communicate something.

135
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:18,920
Cream thinks maybe the accident

136
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,680
wasn't really an accident.

137
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:27,300
Is it possible someone caused the accident
on purpose?

138
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,740
Why do you think that?

139
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:34,793
Because ever since Cream switched places
with Cake,

140
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:36,620
someone's been trying to hurt her.

141
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,920
Huh?

142
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,060
But they still haven't caught the criminal.
That's why I'm thinking...

143
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,920
maybe the accident that happened to Cake
was their doing.

144
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,733
What?

145
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,667
Oh dear...

146
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,060
Is that true?

147
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:57,913
Cream never told me anything about this.

148
00:10:57,913 --> 00:11:02,420
Auntie, she didn't want you to worry.

149
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,140
Dang!

150
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
This drawing is pointing to the person
who hurt her, isn't it?

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,520
Right, Cake?

152
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,233
Huh?

153
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,160
Yes, right?

154
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,380
She squeezed my hand, she's confirming it!

155
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,793
- Cake.
- What is going on?

156
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:35,253
Don't worry.

157
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:37,680
I'll try my best to help you.

158
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,327
And you'll be able to point out exactly
who hurt you.

159
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:42,800
I'll make sure they get put behind bars.

160
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:06,973
Tul, you can stop here.
I'm going to grab a few things.

161
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,760
Got it.
[Minimart]

162
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,693
Should I wait for you to finish shopping?

163
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:14,103
So I can drive you home?

164
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:17,320
No, it's okay. I'll be buying a lot.

165
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,113
Don't worry.

166
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,820
There are plenty of security cameras here.
It's safe.

167
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,927
Why does it feel like you don't really
want me to see where you live?

168
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:29,380
Is there something going on?

169
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,900
No, really.

170
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,880
That's nothing at all.

171
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,180
Okay then.

172
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,400
Please hurry back home after you're done.

173
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:42,133
Yes.

174
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:44,933
- Drive safely, okay?
- Thanks.

175
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,507
Oh, Cream.

176
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:50,780
Call me when you get home, please.

177
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,160
I will.

178
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,573
Cream.

179
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:11,100
Pete.

180
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:15,960
Did Cake squeeze your hand?

181
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:19,040
That means it's the same criminal, right?

182
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,647
Yes. And...There's something urgent I need to ask you.

183
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:27,693
I got a friend to arrange for a brain specialist
for Cake.

184
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:30,293
Would it be okay with you
if I take her for treatment?

185
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:31,493
Of course.

186
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:35,620
Anything to help Cake get better, I'll do it.

187
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,733
Alright then.

188
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,180
Once I get the appointment,
I'll let you know immediately.

189
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,700
But during that time, I'll have to take her out often,

190
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,630
and there's a risk someone might see.

191
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:48,173
It's fine. I'll take that risk.

192
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:52,060
If it helps Cake recover, I'll do anything.

193
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,493
And we'll finally figure out what Cake's drawing
really means.

194
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:56,920
Yes.

195
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:02,660
But until then, can you please keep Cake a secret?

196
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,680
Well, it might depend on my mood a bit.

197
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,527
You tricked me for so long,
it's not like I can suddenly stop being upset.

198
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:12,160
Pete.

199
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,120
I'm just teasing.

200
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,220
Let's get back quickly. I'm worried about Cake.

201
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,780
Okay.

202
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,440
[Dreamer]

203
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,847
This success will be
the driving force for Dreamer.

204
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:44,254
To continue developing products
that appeal even more to customers.

205
00:14:44,254 --> 00:14:46,120
Now for the final question.

206
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,127
After signing with P&Y,
what direction will Dreamer take?

207
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:53,650
And what are the plans

208
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,300
for launching the new collection at Paris Fashion Week?

209
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,793
Signing with P&Y is a tremendous opportunity
for Dreamer to expand globally.

210
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:04,247
After this, I plan to expand the business
even further.

211
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:06,730
Cut! Sorry, the audio didn't record properly.

212
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,800
Let's go again.

213
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:11,700
- One more time, please.
- Sure.

214
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,340
Thank you to both of you.

215
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,087
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

216
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,247
Cream.

217
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
You're finished?

218
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,847
Yes.

219
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:40,913
Is there something you want to talk about?

220
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:43,170
I have something I'd like to discuss with you.

221
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,820
Please, this way.

222
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:47,373
Okay.

223
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:00,760
I spoke with the specialist this morning.

224
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,513
He agreed to take Cake on as a patient.

225
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:04,067
- Really?
- Yes.

226
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,940
Thank you so much.

227
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,753
When can Cake see him?

228
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:10,870
He's checking his schedule now.

229
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,460
I'll let you know as soon as I hear back.

230
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,053
Where are you two headed?

231
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,567
Well...

232
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:28,500
Pete invited me to go check out
a new fabric agency.

233
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,720
Then why didn't you invite me too?

234
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:39,080
- I...
- I told Cream not to tell you.

235
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:46,453
I was afraid you'd use your position as CEO
to influence her creative decisions.

236
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:47,760
I never do that.

237
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,020
How would I know? I've never worked with you.

238
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,380
Fine. Seems like it's none of my business anyway.

239
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,973
Go ahead, have your meeting.

240
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:05,820
Tul. Tul...

241
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:15,240
Cream.

242
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:19,273
Honestly, I don't want to get involved.

243
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:21,193
But if you keep letting things stay like this,

244
00:17:21,193 --> 00:17:24,067
it's only going to make things worse
between both of you.

245
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,390
The longer he stays in the dark,

246
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,580
the more it's going to hurt when he finds out.

247
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:31,740
I know.

248
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:34,620
But if I tell him now,

249
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,560
he'll be furious and fire me for sure.

250
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:43,310
I was planning to wait until after Paris Fashion Week,

251
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,700
and then tell him everything.

252
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,607
And you realize what's going to happen
after you confess, right?

253
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:57,780
I'm prepared to accept whatever consequences come.

254
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:21,267
An ambulance has arrived to pick up the patient
at home.

255
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,853
Alright, follow them and send me the location
once you arrive.

256
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,440
Got it.

00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:34,820
- Miss Panitta, please.
- Yes?

259
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,353
- The doctor is ready for you.
- Thank you.

260
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:40,573
- Let me help you.
- Okay.

00:18:40,573 --> 00:18:42,667
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I am sorry.

262
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,467
Go ahead with it, Auntie.
I have an important call.

263
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:47,400
Sure, go ahead.

264
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:55,367
Alright.

I wasn't feeling well.

268
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,133
Is that so?

269
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,587
Then why did you look so shocked
when you saw me?

270
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:19,920
I just didn't expect to run into you here.

271
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,653
And what about you? Are you sick too?

272
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:24,053

275
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,433
The friend you mentioned, was it Cream?

276
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,233
What's wrong with her?

277
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,460
- Cream.
- She had food poisoning.

I'm so sorry.

00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:58,367
I rushed to tell you that the doctor
said to head straight to MRI.

281
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:01,480
I didn't realize someone Cream knows was here.

282
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,827
It's okay.

283
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,460
I think I should call her.

284
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:25,660
- Hello, Pete.
- Cream.

285
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,833
Don't go outside or let anyone see you for now,
okay?

286
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,207
Why, what's wrong?

287
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:33,060
Mintra saw me with Auntie bringing Cake to the hospital,

288
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,160
just like you said.

289
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:38,500
Does she suspect anything?

290
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,247
I'm not sure.

291
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:43,220
But for now,
I'll make sure she stays away from Cake.

292
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,293
That's all for now.

293
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:56,460

294
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,073
The patient's recovery is progressing well.

295
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:09,010
And regarding memory recovery,

296
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,170
what you're doing is exactly right.

297
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:14,760
Reading, solving math problems,
practicing with tools,

298
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,247
and frequent conversations
are all good brain stimulation.

299
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:21,200
But every time we talk about the past,

300
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,953
Cake seems to get severe headaches.

301
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:24,473
Why is that?

302
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:29,380
It's possible those are very important memories.

303
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,747
The frustration from not remembering them
can cause stress, leading to headaches.

304
00:21:33,747 --> 00:21:35,540
So if we stimulate the right memory,

305
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,010
there's a chance Cake's memory could return?

306
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:39,960
It's possible.

307
00:21:55,553 --> 00:22:00,833
The secret Cream mentioned, was it about cheating?

308
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,900
At first, I thought so too.

309
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,980
But after seeing Pete and Cream at the hospital,

310
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,300
I think it's something deeper.

311
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:11,790
Cream looked really sick,

312
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,030
not like someone with just food poisoning.

313
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,820
Food poisoning?

314
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:20,500
Then what was she doing
in the neurology department?

315
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,280

317
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,680
If I dig further, I might be able to use this

318
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,440
to drive a wedge between Tul and Cream.

319
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,673

about the Creative Director position,

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,960
You look a lot more lively today.

363
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,280
Totally different from yesterday.

364
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,947
Yesterday you looked like death warmed over.

365
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:23,093
Isn't that a bit much?

366
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:25,167
It was just food poisoning.

367
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,453
Was it?

368
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:29,360
Strange, though. If it was just food poisoning,

369
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,180
why did you go to the neurology department
for treatment?

370
00:26:37,407 --> 00:26:41,153
How I choose to get treated is my business.

371
00:26:41,153 --> 00:26:43,260
Pardon me.

372
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,813
Well, best of luck at your new job.

373
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:54,887
Let's go. Stay too long
and we might lose our mind.

374
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:01,607
Mintra is like a stubborn weed.

375
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:03,280
Always finds somewhere to cling to.

376
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,580
She even recognize that I look different
from the day before.

377
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,180
Huh. Suspiciously sharp isn't it?

378
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,673
Since Mintra isn't working alone,

379
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,973
if any of the others suspect you too,
then they're likely part of her team.

380
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:20,533
Right.

381
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:24,080
- Maybe we should test them?
- Huh?

382
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,367
If anyone here questions my story
about food poisoning,

383
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:30,300
then we'll know they're in cahoots with Mintra.

384
00:27:39,027 --> 00:27:42,160
Wow, Cream.

385
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,553
The smell of fermented fish sauce is so good.

386
00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:45,820
Can I have a bite?

387
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,090
Of course. I bought it for everyone.

388
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:51,000
Here, this is our weapon.

389
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,700
Really?

390
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,147
How is it?

391
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:57,647
- So spicy!
- Whoa, Cream.

392
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:01,127
You can really handle spicy food, huh?

393
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:03,707
Calm down.

394
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:05,793
Didn't you say you were sticking to clean food?

395
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:07,467
You keep eating that fermented fish sauce.

396
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:09,360
Hey, fermented fish counts as clean food too.

397
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,940
You know what they call this?

398
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,107
It's Thai salad.

399
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:15,900
See?

400
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:21,020
So tasty.

401
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,340
Here, try some.

402
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,207
It's really delicious.

403
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,427
Cream.

404
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,253
Have you eaten yet? What did you have?

405
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,420
Somtum with fermented crab and fish sauce.

406
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:39,100
Okay, see you in the meeting room.

407
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:47,170
You think our plan worked?

408
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,080
I don't know.

409
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,113
No one questioned my food poisoning story.

410
00:28:52,113 --> 00:28:53,873
That's true.

411
00:28:53,873 --> 00:28:55,800
Then who is it?

412
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,660
You said Cream looked awful,

413
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,740
but when we saw her, she looked perfectly fine.

414
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,190
Exactly.

415
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,380
When I saw her, she looked like a completely different person.

416
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,620
And the person Min sent to tail Cream and Pete

417
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,980
said that Pete has been going to
Cream's house a lot lately.

418
00:29:19,713 --> 00:29:21,600
I'll handle it myself.

419
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:30,950
Where are you now?

420
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,840
I'm still at Mae Sai.

421
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,707
Come back. I have a job for you.

422
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,340
Got it.

423
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,150
If Cake keeps doing physical therapy like this,

424
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,400
she's going to recover quickly.

425
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,800
Thank you so much, Pete,
for buying this device for Cake.

426
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,700
My pleasure.
I really want to see her get better soon.

427
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,100
Her hand muscles might get stronger

428
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,000
and she might be able to communicate with us.

429
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,200
I might be coming by to visit Cake more often.

430
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
You're always welcome.

431
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,400
You know, ever since you started coming around,

432
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,200
Cake seems much more lively and cheerful.

433
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,400
There's just one thing.

434
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,180
Whenever we try to stimulate her memories,

435
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,200
she gets severe headaches.

436
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,500
I have no idea what she's thinking or
if she's stressed about something.

437
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,100
Huh?

438
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Last time, you told me, right?

439
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,210
That when Dreamer's live stream announced the P&Y deal,

440
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,400
Cake had a headache?

441
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,900
Yes.

442
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,900
Maybe there's something about that event
that triggered her memory?

443
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:25,587
A... man.

444
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,800
Cake! You can speak?

445
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,700
A man? What about him?

446
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Wasin.

447
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,200
It's Wasin.

448
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,900
Is he the one who did this to you?

449
00:32:28,687 --> 00:32:30,860
Pillow.

450
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,487

00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:36,127

454
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
This one?

455
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:10,353
Cake is clutching this pillow so tightly.

456
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,600
What are you looking for, dear?

457
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,000
I think this is what Cake's been trying
to tell us.

458
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,300
- A neck pillow?
- Yes.

459
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,260
I'm so happy!

460
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,500
Let's go, Cake, let's see.

461
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,700
This one, Cake?

462
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,240
Let me help.

463
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:22,440
A flash drive?

464
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:27,280
What's inside it?

465
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,400
Maybe we should let Cake rest now.

466
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,300
We've already gotten a lot today.

467
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,900
It's okay. I'll try opening it myself.

No, it's not opening.

474
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,700
I think the flash drive must have gotten damp
when you washed the pillow.

475
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,900
I'll take it to a data recovery shop.

476
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,400
I'm sure whatever's inside
must be really important.

477
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,000
Otherwise, Cake wouldn't have hidden it
inside her pillow.

478
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,780
From what Cake's been trying to tell us,

479
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,400
I'm convinced it has something to do with Wasin.

480
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,600
Is it possible that Wasin
is behind Cake's accident?

481
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,700
When you met him, did he act suspiciously?

482
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,100
Cream.

483
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,800
Come talk to me.

484
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,600
Outside.

485
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,800
The doctor said your brain was injured.

486
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,200
I didn't think you'd recover fast enough
to get back to work so soon.

487
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,380
I'm doing really well, but just... some memories,

488
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,400
they haven't all come back yet.

489
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,100
Which memories?

490
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,600
I remembered something.

491
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,500
The first day I switched places with Cake,
Wasin was extremely suspicious of me.

492
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,900
I should have realized it then.

493
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,500
Maybe the information inside that flash drive
is connected to Wasin.

494
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,800
Yes.

495
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,830
Tul and I have suspected for a long time

496
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,700
that Mintra couldn't have been working alone.

497
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,300
Wasin must have been involved too,
trying to destroy Dreamer.

498
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,900
If it's really Wasin, then he's behind everything.

499
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:47,000
From all the incident at Dreamer,
including the attacks on you and Cake.

500
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And he's the one who ordered the man
with the tattoo to harm us.

501
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,700
But we don't have any evidence yet.

502
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,100
If we can recover the data from the flash drive,

503
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,800
it might become the key evidence we need
to bring them down.

504
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,200
I'll take Cake to see the specialist tomorrow.

505

00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,500

Cake is really lucky to have you.

508
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,600
Please tell her that often.
Maybe she'll warm up to me.

509
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,187
About Wasin...

510
00:37:30,187 --> 00:37:32,240
When will you tell Tul?

511
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,400
I will. But first, we need to get solid evidence.

512
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,900
Otherwise, Tul might not believe me.

513
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,000
Okay. You go inside first. I'll close the gate.

- Pleasure.

515

00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,413
and I want the patient to get some rest too.

543
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:56,880
Alright.

544
00:42:01,244 --> 00:42:03,059
It will be okay.

545
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,033
Hello?

546
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:12,140
Okay, I'll head over right away.

547
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,080
Let's go to the police station.

548
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,467
Go ahead, dear. I'll stay here.

549
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:20,060
It's okay.

550
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,153
[Police Station]

551
00:42:24,153 --> 00:42:26,100
Thank you so much for helping us.

552
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,713
If it weren't for you,
things would have been much worse.

553
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,620
But I still couldn't save Cake in time.

554
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,880
Please don't blame yourself.

555
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,100
Why did you go back to my house?

556
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,200
You go inside first. I'll close the gate.

557
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

[Mobile Electrical Maintenance Unit]

559
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,400
Electric company, right?

560
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,400
Did you send technicians today to
service the electric box around Ladprao 15?

561
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,200
Thank you very much.

562
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,600
There's a suspect right outside Cream's house.
Send the police urgently.

563
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,200
But don't worry.
Soon we'll find out who's behind all this.

564
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,200
- Okay.
- Let's go.

565
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,500
The suspect's real name is Mr. Santi Khokprasith,
nicknamed 'Pae.'

566
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,500
He has a record
of robbery, assault, and several other crimes.

567
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,100
From the investigation,

568
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,900
he claimed he only entered your house to steal
without any other intent.

569
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,740
That's not true, officer.

570
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,200
He definitely wasn't there just to steal.

571
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,200
I think he knew I was home
and wanted something from me.

572
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,690
Because he had attacked me before,

573
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:43,200
and he also set fire to the factory where I work.

574
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,700
- Are you sure it's the same suspect?
- I'm sure.

575
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,000
I recognize his face and his tattoo.

576
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,300
This one, I remembered.

577
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,100
- This tattoo, right?
- Yes.

578
00:43:57,153 --> 00:44:00,367
But we can't interrogate the suspect yet.

579
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:02,993
He requested to speak to his lawyer first.

580
00:44:02,993 --> 00:44:05,607
We'll have to wait until his lawyer arrives.

581
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:10,093
There's another thing.

582
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:12,420
We believe Pae wasn't working alone.

583
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,440
There was likely someone behind this.

584
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,900
And we suspect Wasin,
who is a member of the board at my company.

585
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,733
Do you have any evidence proving he's involved?

586
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:24,173
Not yet.

587
00:44:24,173 --> 00:44:26,553
Then we'll have to gather more evidence first.

588
00:44:26,553 --> 00:44:29,060
If we can prove a connection between the two,

589
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,240
then we can summon him for questioning.

590
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,347
For now, you all should head home.

591
00:44:33,347 --> 00:44:35,800
If there's any update
or if I need more information,

592
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,067
I'll contact you.

593
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:38,760
Pardon me.

594
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,500
Tul hates liars so much.

595
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,700
If we tell him the truth,

596
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,600
I'm afraid it won't just cost you your job,

597
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,287
but your entire future in the fashion industry.

598
00:45:29,287 --> 00:45:32,513
- Is it that serious?
- Yeah!

599
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:46,000
Cream? Is there something you want to tell me?

600
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,133
Tul.

601
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:52,800
The police caught the suspect
who set fire to your factory.

602
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,200
Really?

603
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,400
How did you find out?

604
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,400
He broke into my house today,
and the police managed to catch him.

605
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,700
So the same person who set fire to you factory,

606
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,200
and the one who attacked me is the same person.

607
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,600
You are not hurt right?

608
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,000
I am safe

609
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,900
but Pete was the one
who called the police and had him arrested.

610
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,800
So Pete went to your house again?

611
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,600
Cream. me ask you directly.

612
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,800
What exactly is going on
between you and Pete?

613
00:46:32,787 --> 00:46:38,213
There's nothing going on
between me and him, I swear.

614
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:42,107
Well...You can trust me.

615
00:46:43,627 --> 00:46:49,220
As for why Pete had to come to my house,
it's because...

616
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Because of what?

617
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,940
Cream.

618
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,220
Cream?

619
00:47:20,447 --> 00:47:22,280
Cream.

620
00:47:30,387 --> 00:47:32,060
Well...
