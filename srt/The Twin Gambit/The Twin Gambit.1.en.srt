355
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,420
Man, being born into money really is a blessing, isn't it?

356
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,667
You're still the same, you know?

357
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,673
Always judging everything from your own perspective.

358
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:05,253
Acting like you're the center of the universe.

359
00:32:06,753 --> 00:32:08,120
But I like that sharp tongue of yours.

360
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,627
Next time we meet, be sure to talk to me like this again, okay?

361
00:32:12,627 --> 00:32:14,407
See you around.

362
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:23,827
Next time?

363
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:36,907
Khun Tul is actually really nice.

364
00:32:36,907 --> 00:32:39,200
He looks even better in person than in photos.

365
00:32:40,207 --> 00:32:43,720
Hard to believe he was so cruel to you.

366
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:52,147
I don't know why, but back then, that's exactly how he treated me.

367
00:32:52,147 --> 00:32:53,467
Is this for me?

368
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:55,830
Since when do you eat like this?

369
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:59,867
I packed this for you.

370
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:08,620
Hey!

371
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,680
Wait, let me think for a second.

372
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,933
We just got a million baht. What should we do with it?

373
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,227
Don't forget my share.

374
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:21,547
Of course not.

375
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,800
Hello, Khun Wasin.

376
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,607
Are we ready to talk?

377
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,220
All right, see you tonight.

378
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:08,627
So what's the deal, Khun Wasin?

379
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:18,487
Will you really go through with this?

380
00:34:18,487 --> 00:34:21,760
If this gets out, we're all screwed.

381
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,393
Everything has changed.

382
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:26,240
Back when you ran the textile factory

383
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,293
and Dreamer was your client, we both made good money.

384
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,333
But now, Tul is cracking down on everything.

385
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:35,033
Your factory has gone under. What do I have left?

386
00:34:39,307 --> 00:34:41,788
Khun Cindy, the textile factory just reported

387
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:46,033
that a migrant worker being held on site has died.

388
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:49,020
Cover it up. Make sure no one finds out.

389
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,633
Yes, Ma'am.

390
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:00,200
Ten million baht to keep Nira Fashion House's reputation clean.

391
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,180
Honestly, that's a bargain, Khun Wasin.

392
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:11,033
What if I offer you something else instead?

393
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:16,060
I helped make you famous.

394
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,667
Why don't you make me happy as well?

395
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:19,767
Please, I don't want to do this.

396
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:23,440
- I'm not interested... please!
- Come on!

397
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,533
It's just a little bit.

398
00:35:32,953 --> 00:35:36,787
Drugs... exploiting minors...

399
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:38,760
This isn't your first time.

400
00:35:39,313 --> 00:35:45,120
No matter how skilled you are, you won't have a place to stand after this.

401
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:52,180
Khun Wasin, please tell Khun Cindy that I'm really sorry about everything.

402
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,160
I'll delete all the videos.

403
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,807
See? All files are gone.

404
00:35:56,807 --> 00:36:03,040
Please let Khun Cindy know that I promise not to do this again.

405
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:05,360
Please tell her we're even, okay?

406
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,680
Please tell her.

407
00:36:08,047 --> 00:36:09,460
Sure.

408
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:14,700
Thank you for not making this more complicated.

409
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,760
Really, thank you.

410
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,010
Khun Cindy, Khun Wasin is on the line.

411
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,000
Should I answer?

412
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,567
I'll take it myself.

413
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,176
It's all done, Khun Cindy.

414
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,400

415
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:05,400

[Scandalous Video]

There's a scandal involving a renowned designer, with leaked footage

419
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:27,300
showing inappropriate conduct with a model under the age of 18.

424
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,513
Don't do this to me!

Don't do it!

With this kind of scandal, you can't just do nothing, Tul.

439
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,927
I hate to see what we've built fall apart.

440
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:16,420
If you ask me, you should partner with me.

441
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,433
Sell me 60% of your shares.

442
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:22,166
And we'll change the name to "Dreamer by Pemika."

443
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,780
That's not a partnership.

444
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,407
That's a takeover.

445

Call it whatever you want.

446
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,440
Your image is in shambles.

447
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,460
I'm extending my hand to help you. Isn't that generous, Tul?

448
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:40,640
Generosity? From you...

449
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,467
or from Naa Cindy?

450
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:47,040
She sent you, didn't she?

451
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:52,727
You're so naive.

452
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:56,320
This is how the business world works, Tul. Why are you so sentimental?

453
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,073
You're supposed to be a young, savvy executive. Money should come first.

454
00:40:00,073 --> 00:40:03,000
I'll give you until the end of the month to decide.

455
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,607
Think carefully, Tul.

456
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:08,540
I've got to run. I have a meeting with the Minister.

457
00:40:15,127 --> 00:40:17,633
I just don't understand what's going on.

458

Tul,

459
00:40:24,647 --> 00:40:27,827
why didn't you accept Khun Pemika's offer? Huh?

460
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:31,353
At the very least, she might be able to save the company.

461
00:40:31,353 --> 00:40:33,713
She wants 60% of the shares.

462
00:40:33,713 --> 00:40:37,333
And she wants to rename the brand to "Dreamer by Pemika."

463
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,280
If she gets control, she'll definitely sell it off to Naa Cindy.

464

Isn't that still better than closing the whole company?

If we don't start the spring-summer collection now,

00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,760
we won't make it in time, Tul.

470

Tul, if we don't turn a profit with this spring-summer collection,

471
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:03,127
we'll post a loss for the second quarter in a row.

I have someone in mind.

478

She just won this year's Young Designer Competition.

479
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,280
Her name is Cream Panisa.

480
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,567
No way, Tul!

481
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:50,360
She has zero experience.

482
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,060
We're investing millions into this next collection.

483
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,987
Will you seriously put Dreamer's name in the hands of a rookie?

484
00:41:56,987 --> 00:41:59,253
If this fails, we're done!

485
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:02,460
We won't recover from it. It's really the end.

486
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,447
I want to take the chance.

487
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:10,480
If the spring-summer collection doesn't meet the target,

488
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,900
then I'll agree to partner with Pemika.

489
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:29,819
What should we eat, Dear? There's too much on the menu.

490
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:32,813
You choose, Bpaa. I'll pick later.

491
00:42:32,813 --> 00:42:36,333
Cake, what do you want, Dear? Grilled river prawns?

492
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,220

- Ai Cream!

00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,627

00:42:46,627 --> 00:42:49,173
Maybe later. Thanks.

You heard about Dreamer's old creative director, right?

500
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,267

501
00:42:56,267 --> 00:42:58,200
Who?

00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,240
Don't act happy just yet.

Remember the mess we made? What should we do? They think Cake is Cream.

Come on, it's not that hard, Sweetie.

507
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,800
Right? Just tell the truth.

508
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,339
Say it was a crazy situation and you had no choice.

509
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,247
Bpaa Su, it's not that simple.

510
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:27,580
Because... even if we come clean, that doesn't mean Khun Tul will give her the job.

511
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,893
Why not?

512
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:33,940
Because Khun Tul absolutely hates liars.

513
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,313
You sold defective clothes that didn't pass quality control?

514
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,893
You said you were going to donate them.

515
00:43:38,893 --> 00:43:40,873
You are fired.

516
00:43:40,873 --> 00:43:44,893
You said you took a vacation leave but snuck off for a job interview elsewhere.

00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:46,120
You are fired.

518

00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,460
You are fired.

00:43:50,307 --> 00:43:52,820
Give me your employee badge.

521
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:59,500
If he's that strict, then what would happen if we lied?

522
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,407
I'm worried it won't just be losing the job.

523
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:05,433
Your entire future in the fashion industry could be destroyed.

524
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,950
Is it that serious?

525
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,790
Yes.

I wanted to ask you something.

544
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,207
There was a contestant in the Young Designer Competition.

She lost a lot of weight but looked exactly like you.

Thank you.

624
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:35,800
I saw on your application that you want to focus on designing plus-size clothing.

625
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,600
Why are you interested in that?

626
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,600

That friend also had other overweight friends.

So I became interested in the market.

631
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:02,500
My friend has a lot of overweight buddies. That's why I chose this market.

632
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,800
And from a business perspective, the plus-size market is incredibly underserved.

00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:13,000
If I can capture that market early on, the growth potential is really high.

634
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,700
That's quite challenging.

00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:21,000
You have great design skills and a sharp business mindset.

00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,600
With that much praise, are you going to hire me on the spot?

The fashion industry needs to seriously address this issue.

People in the fashion industry really need to address the issue.
