You're doing great.

3
00:00:15,453 --> 00:00:16,920
Really great.

4
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:24,640
What's wrong? You look worn out.

5
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,733
You walked a lot today.

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,040
What is it?

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,867
I saw Tul.

8
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,080
He's been really mad at Wasin

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,507
ever since he found out
about the betrayal against Dreamer.

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,533
If one day Tul finds out that I lied to him,
he's gonna hate me for sure.

11
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:05,213
Maybe I might end up in deeper trouble.

12
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,240
You need to face the truth.

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,113
Yeah.

14
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:23,720
After I present the P&Y project,
I'll come clean and tell Tul everything.

15
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:32,487
While I was unconscious,
how far did you and Tul go?

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,320
Tul and I...

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,360
We're together now.

18
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:46,947
Well, we got close while you were asleep.

19
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,480
Cake, while you were unconscious,
Pete thought I was you.

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,920
He even confessed to me.
He said he really likes you.

21
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:08,527
Are you trying to push Pete onto me now?

22
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:10,387
I'm not pushing him on you.

23
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:13,246
I just want you to know.

24
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:14,567
You saw it too, right?

25
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:18,427
When you woke up,
Pete was so attentive and caring toward you.

26
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,560
Why not give him a chance?

27
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:28,760
I'm tired today.

28
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,600

Are you nervous?

36
00:03:30,353 --> 00:03:37,487
After I present for P&Y,
there's something I need to talk to you about.

37
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,080
What is it?

Great, looks like we're all here.

I'm here to protect Dreamer's interests.

I think maybe we should talk after the meeting.
You two can step outside for now.

No, this is something P&Y needs to know too.

Can you tell
who the woman in the picture looks like?

54
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,647
I think this is Dreamer's internal matter.

55
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:24,647
Let's discuss it after the meeting.

56
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:27,000
The overweight woman in the photo is Cream.

57
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:34,280
She lost weight and came to work here.

58
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,700
Cream has a twin sister, Cake.

59
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,800
She sent her sister to work in her place,
while she went off to lose weight.

60
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,000
Once she got the body she wanted,
they swapped again.

61
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,800
We've all been tricked. By Cream.

62
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,400
The files I sent show her weight loss history

63
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,200
from a well-known clinic in Chiang Mai,

64
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,300
and the personal histories of both Cream and Cake.

65
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,800
Cake's real name is Panitta.

She is actually a condo salesperson.
[Panitta Rattanawong, Excellent Sales Person]

67
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,700
She has no experience in fashion at all.

68
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,740
How did you even find out they switched?

69
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,501
After the accident, Cream came back to work,
but her behavior started changing.

70
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:39,120
The way she spoke, thought, acted...

71
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,160
Even her signature.

72
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,947
Moo, is that true?

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They switched after the accident.

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,800
How can someone like Cream, who lies so easily,

75
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,900
still be trusted by Tul to run Dreamer?

76
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:09,920
If this isn't true, just say it.

77
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,147
We're on your side.

78
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:15,500
Right, Cream? It's not true, right?

79
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,540
It's true.

80
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,053
I'm sorry, Tul.

81
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,213
Is this what you wanted to tell me?

82
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:42,380
How could you let someone like this
hold such an important position?

83
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,000
It's not Tul's fault.

84
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's just that I had some personal issues.

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,800
So I asked my sister to take over for a while.
But I'm the one who did all the actual work.

86
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,900
My sister was only the face for the presentation.
I really did do everything myself.

87
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,600
But you lied to everyone.

88
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,400
You worked here
without anyone knowing who you really were.

89
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
And what about the designs you claimed were yours?

90
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,200
Were they really your work?

91
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you just a scammer?

92
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,600
This whole thing could be part of Cream's scheme.

93
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,200
True. I was framed.

94
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,800
I've always worked hard for Dreamer.

95
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,400
And yet, she twisted things to force me out.

96
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,200
You can't trust a person like her.

97
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,000
No. You both betray the company.

98
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,500
You're a con artist.
Who's going to believe anything you say?

99
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,400
Everyone, let's all calm down for a moment.

100
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,800
I think we should just have
Dreamer verify Cream's past work history.

101
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,400
If she really did all the work herself,
then there shouldn't be a problem, right?

102
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,700
You knew everything all along, didn't you?

103
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,800
Everyone, Mr. Daniel is here.

104
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,600
Should we cancel?

105
00:08:58,907 --> 00:09:03,080
Thanks so much to both of you,
for helping Dreamer.

106
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,293
If there's nothing else, please step out.

107
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,180
We need to continue the meeting.

108
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,160
I don't think this is right.

109
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,467
We should cancel the meeting,
and launch an internal investigation.

110
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,820
There will be an investigation.

111
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,787
But I don't think there's a reason
to cancel the meeting.

112
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,947
Cream lying to all of us, including me,
that part may be true.

113
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,760
But the fact that she did
all the actual work herself, that's also true.

114
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,387
And I can vouch for that.

115
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:44,000
But if this story leaks out, are you
ready to take responsibility for the fallout?

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,560
I can take responsibility.

117
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,360
I've been working with Cream since
the first draft until this project came to life.

118
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,833
I've observed every single step she took.

119
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:58,187
I can personally vouch that all the work
was done by her, and her alone.

120
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,900
Min, Wasin, you can leave now.

121
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:09,167
Please let Mr. Daniel in.

122
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,733
- Hi there.
- Hi Mr. Daniel.

123
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,420
I have to apologize for keeping you waiting.

124
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,280
We are ready for the meeting.

125
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,480
Cream, you may begin your presentation.

126
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,000
Hello everyone. First of all,

127
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,100
I would like to thanks P&Y for choosing Dreamer
to be a part of global company.

128
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:45,820
Wine, push back today's appointments.
I need a break.

129
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,013
Tul, can you please just hear me out first?

130
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,780
Hey Tul. Wait a second.

131
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,727
Why not just hear her out first?

132
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:58,360
This is my company's matter.
I'm not allowing you to speak.

133
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:03,873
- Tul, please.
- Wait, Cream.

134
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:05,500
Give Tul some time.

135
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:39,273
Stay strong.

136
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,193
We talked about this. It was bound to happen.

137
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:45,547
You have to accept it.

138
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:48,040
I've been bracing myself for this.

139
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,793
But...

140
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:57,040
When I saw the disappointment in Tul's eyes,
I felt awful.

141
00:11:58,773 --> 00:12:01,487
How could I hurt him like that?

142
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:06,280
We can't change the past, dear.

143
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,200
But the fact that Tul didn't fire you on the spot,
that's already better than what we expected.

144
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Aunt Su's right.

145
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,500
At least now, you don't have to lie anymore.

146
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,900
And as long as Tul is still
letting you lead this project,

147
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,000
you've got a chance to clear things up with him.

148
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But he won't talk to me.

149
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,653
He won't even look at me.

150
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,913
Then you'll just have to work even harder.

151
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:38,787
Make up for what you've done.

152
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:43,480
Take Dreamer as far as you can, for Tul's sake.

153
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,400
Yes, Auntie.

154
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:13,400
What is it?

155
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:16,407
I wanna talk about Tul.

156
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,800
You said it wasn't fair,
and I think you're right.

157
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,400
Back then, I might've liked him a lot.

158
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:32,700
But now that I've been with Pete,
I feel more at ease. I can be myself with him.

159
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,000
And between Pete and you...

160
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,700
I don't have an answer yet. I need time.

161
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,147
I'm sorry, Cake.

162
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
For what?

163
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,300
About everything.

164
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,100
No need to apologize.

165
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,120
I chose to help you.

166
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:17,753
But I want you to think about Tul.

167
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:19,900
You did everything for him.

168
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,653
You're crushed because you hurt him.

169
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:30,467
That alone tells me
I could never love him the way you do.

170
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:38,200
I know you.

171
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,353
You're stronger than you think.

172
00:14:42,353 --> 00:14:47,540
You've been bullied your whole life, but you
fought through it to become who you are today.

173
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:55,040
I believe you'll win Tul's heart again.

174
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:03,440
Thanks, Cake.

175
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:41,140
- What's your name?
- Fresh.

176
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,900
That makes sense.
You live near my friend Fresh's place.

177
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,400
Aunt Su's niece?

178
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,100
She's your friend? Such a small world.

179
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
When I'm with Cream, it reminds me of the time
I used to spend with my friend.

180
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,400
She'd be happy to hear that.

181
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,000
How did you know I was talking about her?

182
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:11,220
Where did Cream get this music box?

183
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,860
Auntie gave it to me.

184
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,473
Said she found it while cleaning.

185
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:22,367
This music box looks exactly like the one
I custom-made for Fresh.

186
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:27,020
If you want it back, it's yours.
It probably belonged to her.

187
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:37,120
Mr. Tul, someone's here to see you.

188
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,507
I'm sorry, Tul.

189
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,200
- I'm not here to make excuses.
- Why did you lie to me?

190
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,200
I didn't want to.

191
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,600
I misunderstood.

192
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,900
I thought you hated me back in high school.

193
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:18,787
So I panicked every time I saw you.

194
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:25,420
At the Young Designer Competition,
my panic attacks came back.

195
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,320
They were so bad I couldn't go on stage.

196
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,500
So that's when you had your sister
pretend to be you.

197
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,200
It wasn't just that.

198
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,000
After the competition, I got to talk to you.

199
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,600
And realized I was wrong all along.
You didn't hate me.

200
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,500
And the panic attacks stopped.

201
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,300
Then why didn't you show up for the interview
yourself?

202
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,600
I found out from Wine that you hate liars.

203
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,900
So I was scared.

204
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,200
I was afraid I wouldn't get the chance
to work with you.

205
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,600
So I made a deal with Cake.

206
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,000
I would lose the weight
and then we'd switch again.

207
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,900
But you still chose to lie
instead of just explaining.

208
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,500
Did you think I wouldn't listen?

209
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,900
I was scared.

210
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:38,767
I was scared... I'd lose the job I loved.

211
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,407
So I made a stupid mistake.

212
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,120
I kept lying and now it's out of control.

213
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,440
I've been thinking about
all the lies you told me.

214
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:53,213
You must think I'm an idiot.

215
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,400
I never thought that.

216
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,000
Every time I lied, I felt horrible.

217
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
Then why didn't you tell the truth when I asked?

218
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,600
I don't know what to believe anymore.

219
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,800
Even when you said you loved me,
I don't know if that was true or just another lie.

220
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,267
As for work, I'll let you finish the project.

221
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,800
I'm professional enough
to separate personal feelings from work.

222
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,500
But once this is over...

223
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,000
don't ever show your face to me again.

224
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,480
[Nira Fashion House]

225
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,547
Normally, Tul wouldn't tolerate any lies,
even small ones.

226
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:34,687
But now he's letting Cream finish the job?

227
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,153
That's not like him.

228
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:42,247
The reason he can't cut Cream off
is because he likes her.

229
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:47,593
He even let her work at his house.
That's not just employer-employee stuff.

230
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,360
Then that means Cream is Tul's weakness.

231
00:20:57,347 --> 00:21:02,140
Tul, you're more naive than I thought.

232
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:07,620
Finally, a job well done.

233
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:13,647
Are you planning to use Tul's weakness...

234
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:19,547
If it means destroying Dreamer,
I'll do whatever it takes.

235
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:34,753
Wait.

236
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,587
You knew Cindy
back when she was still at Dreamer, right?

237
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,720
What happened?

238
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,753
Why does she seem so hell-bent
on taking Dreamer down?

239
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,547
Just stop being so stubborn!

240
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:54,620
Dreamer's profits this year
are down nearly half from last year.

241
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,267
If we keep going like this, we're going under.

242
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:01,193
But what you're suggesting isn't ethical, Cindy.

243
00:22:01,193 --> 00:22:04,133
And who decides what's ethical?

244
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:06,887
We do.

245
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:07,880
I founded Dreamer

246
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,907
because I wanted people
to have access to quality clothes.

247
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:13,560
And now you're telling me to cut costs
by lowering fabric quality.

248
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,467
I can't do that.

249
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:18,573
Oh, come on. Enough with the idealistic nonsense.

250
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:23,140
Ideals don't pay the bills.
Money solves everything.

251
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,427
Maybe for you.

252
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,780
But not for me.

253
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,270
Fine. If we're not cutting fabric quality,

254
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,547
then let's cut labor costs at the factory.

255
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:40,773
I know people who can get us cheap illegal labor.

256
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:43,027
Do you even hear yourself?

257
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:45,900
That's human trafficking.

258
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,860
No, it's giving people jobs!

259
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,240
God, stop living in your little fairytale.

260
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,307
I don't think we can work together anymore.

261
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,407
You're incredibly talented.

262
00:22:57,407 --> 00:23:00,973
But without a heart,
you're not the right fit for Dreamer.

263
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:06,580
Then I'll take this to a board vote.

264
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,253
Let's see who really doesn't belong here.

265
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:20,107
The board has reached a unanimous decision.

266
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:24,713
We do not agree to reduce the quality of materials
or use illegal labor.

267
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:26,436
Dreamer will continue
to follow its original policy

268
00:23:26,436 --> 00:23:30,193
on sourcing high-quality fabrics
and maintaining production standards.

269
00:23:30,193 --> 00:23:35,300
Furthermore, the use of illegal labor
is strictly prohibited.

270
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:45,233
After that, Cindy resigned from Dreamer,
and went on to found Nira Fashion House.

271
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:51,173
No wonder she's so determined to destroy Dreamer.

272
00:23:52,407 --> 00:23:57,773
You told me once
you saw Cream twin's in the hospital, right?

273
00:23:57,773 --> 00:23:59,580
Did she seem okay?

274
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:02,773
I'm not sure. Why?

275
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:06,067
Nothing. Forget it.

276
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:14,707
Hey, wait.

277
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,670
When you went to get the files from my office,

278
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,570
did you happen to see my flash drive?

279
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:19,840
- Flash drive?
- Yeah.

280
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,387
Oh!

281
00:24:21,387 --> 00:24:24,600
I bumped into Cream, and things fell.

282
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,100
I think Cream might've picked it up by accident.

283
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,680
[Dreamer]

284
00:24:43,587 --> 00:24:46,693
I'm sorry for lying to everyone.

285
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:52,500
But I swear every piece I created,
the ideas were all mine.

286
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,420
You don't have to say that.

287
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,620
We all know how talented you are.

288
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,240
That's right.

289
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:07,393
Cream.

290
00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:09,067
I'm not mad at you at all.

291
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:11,453
Honestly, we get it.

292
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:15,320
Tul is scary. One little lie and you're out.

293
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,340
Right guys?

294
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,140
It's okay.

295
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,393
Just don't pull off another bombshell
like that again.

296
00:25:23,393 --> 00:25:25,167
We were all shocked.

297
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,513
There won't be any more surprises.

298
00:25:27,513 --> 00:25:30,213
I already feel terrible enough.

299
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:34,527
Thank you all for still believing in me.

300
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:40,140
I promise I'll get Dreamer to Paris Fashion Week.

301
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:42,827
Yes.

302
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:45,320
Alright everyone, back to work.

303
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,880
Lets go.

304
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,327

Cream.

307
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,767
Tul asked me to tell you that
the fabric order you wanted, he approved it.

308
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:12,573
You can go ahead and talk to the supplier.

309
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:17,873
And is he coming into the office today?

310
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:22,867
He also said if you need anything, go through me.

311
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:25,127
You don't have to contact him directly.

312
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:31,900
Give him a bit of time, okay?

313
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,413
- I'll get back to work.
- Got it.

Hot social topic of the day.

327
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,880
The case involves Dreamer's creative director.
[Designer uses twin to secretly work in her place]

328
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,010
A fashion company recently announcing plans

329
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,080
to go global.

330
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,425
Their designer is revealed
to be a con artist who forged records,

331
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:42,627
and swapped places with her twin to get hired.

332
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:46,120
Truth is stranger than fiction, folks.

333
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,340
- Wine, what is it?
- Tul.

334
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,200
The board has called
an emergency meeting this afternoon

335
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,360
regarding Cream.

336
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,040
I'll be right there.

337
00:28:07,747 --> 00:28:10,587
- I'm really anxious about this.
- Just a second.

00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:12,367
Wait. What is going on?

339
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,613
Why is Wasin here? He's suspended.

340
00:28:19,613 --> 00:28:22,240
The board still believes
Wasin has valuable insight

341
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,700
given the current situation.

342
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,513
He was the one who exposed Cream's deception.

343
00:28:28,513 --> 00:28:30,213
He deserves to have a say.

344
00:28:30,213 --> 00:28:33,227
But Wasin is still under investigation
for arson at our factory.

345
00:28:33,227 --> 00:28:37,060
Not to mention other allegations
he hasn't cleared up.

And I won't. Because I don't need to.

00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,860
There's no evidence.

348
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,480
Let's leave Wasin's issues aside for now.

349
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,413
We need to address the Cream scandal first.

00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:57,280
Exactly.

351
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,933
People are using the Cream story
to attack our company.

352
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:07,640
If this continues,
P&Y might cancel their contract with us.

353
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,673
The damage could be massive.

354
00:29:10,673 --> 00:29:13,387
That's not going to happen.

355
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:15,820
How can you be so sure, huh?

356
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,927
You need to act now before this spirals further.

357
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,220
Here is the deal.

358
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,240
I have my proposal.

359
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,307
Remove Cream from her position
as Creative Director

360
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:33,760
to show the world our company
does not tolerate this kind of behavior.

361
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,813
Cream is not a con artist.

362
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:40,593
Yes, she lied about her personal life,
but her creative work is 100% her own.

363
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:42,307
See?

364
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:46,953
He's defending her this hard.

365
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:51,733
Are you sure there's nothing going on between the two of you?

366
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:54,067
Hey, now you're crossing a line.

367
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:56,927
Beware of your words.

368
00:29:56,927 --> 00:30:00,340
Tul's never mixed personal with professional.

369
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,287
I am just looking out for him.

370
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:08,060
Cream deceived all of us flawlessly.

371
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,660
She may have even manipulated Tul

372
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,900
into falling for her, just to use him for personal gain.

373
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,670
Thanks for your concern, but if Cream really did deceive me,

374
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,750
that's my problem, not yours.

375
00:30:19,753 --> 00:30:22,587
Regardless, you need to take action.

376
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,453
Yes.

377
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:26,140
Trust me.

378
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,000
If we want this to go away quietly,

379
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,367
remove her from the position of Creative Director.

380
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:33,973
No.

381
00:30:34,873 --> 00:30:36,487
I stand by what I said.

382
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:40,120
Cream will lead the Paris Fashion Week project
to the end.

383
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,240
And I'll have PR issue a statement that
every design is entirely her work.

384
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,113
The identity swap was a personal matter.

385
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,600
Our company does not support criminal behavior.

386
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Is it really worth risking the
company's reputation for one person?

387
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,607
Yes. Cream is crucial to our company.

388
00:30:57,607 --> 00:31:01,767
She's the one who can put Dreamer
on the global fashion map.

389
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,513
And what if she fails?

390
00:31:06,513 --> 00:31:09,487
Then I'll put my position on the line.

391
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:16,020
If Cream fails to deliver,
I'll resign as president.

392
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:26,567
What did you just say?

393
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:29,827
You'd better be ready to stand by your words.

394
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,487
Why's this meeting taking forever?

395
00:31:54,487 --> 00:31:57,760
I think we all should keep calm.

396
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Right? But honestly, if Tul says you stay on the project,

397
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,680
no board can stop him. I'm sure of it.

398
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,133
Look. He's coming.

399
00:32:16,153 --> 00:32:18,993
So, what did the board say?

400
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,500
- Majority voted to let you continue.
- Woohoo! Told you so.

401
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,580
But why?

402
00:32:31,293 --> 00:32:36,027
This scandal caused
such a huge hit to Dreamer's reputation.

403
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:37,380
You don't need to know.

404
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,520
Just focus on doing your job well.

405
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:43,153
From now on, more eyes will be watching you.

406
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:46,527
And I need your help with something.

407
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,613
You okay?

408
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:54,387
Hang in there.

409
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:56,020
You're almost there.

410
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,307
You're doing great.

411
00:33:01,307 --> 00:33:03,467
Did you know walking barefoot on grass

412
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:06,487
helps improve circulation
and stimulates your nervous system?

413
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:09,227
- How do you know that?
- Googling.

414
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:14,207
You tired? Want to head back inside?

415
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:17,453
If you can't walk, I will carry you.

416
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,467
Over reacting.

417
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:21,220
Come on. Let's go.

418
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,600
Take it slow.

419
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:28,000
Come and take a rest.

420
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,780
- Here. Drink some water to refresh yourself.
- Thank you.

421
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,447
How are things going?

422
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:34,330
Cake's doing so much better today.

423
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,913
At this rate, she'll recover completely soon.

424
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:39,067
That's great.

425
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:40,800
Oh, right. Pete.

426
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,487
What about your company?

427
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:46,347
How are they handling the situation with Cream?

428
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:49,067
Will they cancel the contract?

429
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:52,160
I can't say yet.

430
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,380
There's a board meeting in two days to discuss it.

431
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,353
Please help her.

432
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:01,307
I already spoke to the higher-ups.

433
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:03,840
They're waiting to hear
what Dreamer's board decides.

434
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,947
Don't worry. I'll speak up for you again.

435
00:34:07,947 --> 00:34:09,653
Thank you.

436
00:34:10,353 --> 00:34:13,080
This project means so much to her.

437
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,127
She risked everything because she loves this job.

438
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:20,700
Hey.

439
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,240
Someone's here to see you.

440
00:35:03,213 --> 00:35:04,627
How are you feeling?

441
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:07,827
Cream told me you were unconscious for months.

442
00:35:07,827 --> 00:35:09,667
You are okay now?

443
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,087
Pete's been helping take care of me.

444
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:16,040
My memory's completely back.

445
00:35:17,953 --> 00:35:20,133
I'm glad you're doing better.

446
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:22,773
Thanks for your concern.

447
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:25,687
You've worked with me before.

448
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:28,720
I can't be heartless to someone
who's been a colleague.

449
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,693
Thank you so much.

450
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:37,487
And also, thank you for not firing Cream.

451
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:41,060
Honestly, I thought you'd be too angry
and let her go.

452
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,813
Cream staying on the project
is purely a business decision.

453
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:45,887
It's got nothing to do with personal feelings.

454
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:49,693
Her work is important to Dreamer's future.

455
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:51,727
This is something that has to be done.

456
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:01,127
But everything Cream did, she did it
because she really wanted to work at Dreamer.

457
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,553
Then congratulations.

458
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,000
You've achieved your dream.

459
00:36:10,347 --> 00:36:13,000
Your dream job is yours now.

460
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:16,327
And it's all thanks to the faith
people had in you.

461
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:18,160
Including me.

462
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:27,240
Honestly, you two are so alike.

463
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,300
When I first realized I'd been tricked,

464
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,060
I thought I was a fool for not seeing the difference.

465
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:40,107
But now, seeing you both like this,
I understand.

466
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:44,080
How you managed to fool everyone
so convincingly.

467
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:53,260
I'm sorry, too.

468
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:58,013
I share some of the blame.

469
00:36:58,013 --> 00:37:01,340
I didn't act like a responsible adult.

470
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,040
Auntie.

471
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,867
Please don't blame yourself.

472
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:06,453
I have to, dear.

473
00:37:07,153 --> 00:37:12,820
Because I didn't step in and stop it
when I should've.

474
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:18,680
I didn't come here today for an apology
or an explanation.

475
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,593
I just wanted to see if Cake was okay.

476
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,350
From now on,

477
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:30,510
there'll be no personal involvement between me and Cream.

478
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:33,947
Only work. That's it.

479
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,120
Understood.

480
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:41,547
I'll do my best.

481
00:37:53,547 --> 00:37:55,800
Get well soon, Cake.

482
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,490
I'll be leaving now.

483
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,120
Goodbye.

484
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:09,887
Let me talk with him.

485
00:38:25,227 --> 00:38:27,120
Hey, Tul.

486
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,647
Wait up.

487
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:30,447
Cream really does feel guilty about all of this.

488
00:38:30,447 --> 00:38:32,247
And you knew about it for a while,
but didn't say a word.

489
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:35,313
- Why bring it up now?
- To get you to stop hating her.

490
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,233
If you choose to forgive her,
that's your decision. Don't involve me in it.

491
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,740
Hey, listen.

492
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,707
Just hear me out, okay?

493
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,660
I get that you're angry.
I was, too, when I found out.

494
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,387
I told Cream she had to come clean,
but do you know why she kept it from you?

495
00:38:52,387 --> 00:38:55,353
Because it had to do with Cake's safety.

496
00:38:55,353 --> 00:38:57,227
Safety of what?

497
00:38:57,227 --> 00:39:01,420
Her accident. It wasn't just an accident.
Wasin was behind it.

498
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,710
When Cake took Cream's place at your company,

499
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,840
she found out Wasin and Cindy were embezzling.

500
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,833
All the evidence is on that flash drive.

501
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:12,880
When Wasin realized Cake had it,
he sent Pae to silence her, causing the crash.

502
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,373
Why didn't Cream ever tell me?

503
00:39:14,373 --> 00:39:16,773
Calm down and let me explain.

504
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:19,307
At first, no one knew.
It looked like a simple accident.

505
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:22,940
But when Cake's memory came back,
everyone realized it was Wasin.

506
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,300
Cream was scared.

507
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,480
She didn't dare tell anyone because if Wasin
found out, he could try to hurt Cake again.

508
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,527
Come on!

509
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:33,040
You have every right to be angry. Be angry!

510
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,693
But let me say this.

511
00:39:34,693 --> 00:39:38,920
Cream did what she did partly for you,
and for Dreamer.

512
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,213
And the flash drive Cake found.

513
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:49,200
What's on it?

514
00:39:51,273 --> 00:39:52,980
We don't know yet.

515
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,707
They're trying to recover the data.

516
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:57,413
We'll let you know once we have something.

517
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:17,200
- Hey there.
- Hi auntie.

518
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:22,060
Got anything around here that'll cheer me up?

519
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,467
Oh.

520
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:28,467
If I had some, I'd be eating it first.

521
00:40:33,947 --> 00:40:38,273
Hey, I found out why you're still working.

522
00:40:38,273 --> 00:40:42,967
Turns out, in today's board meeting,
Tul and Wasin had a major fight.

523
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:45,560
Wasin pushed hard to have you removed.

524
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,480
- Wasin? But wasn't he suspended?
- Yeah.

525
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,787
But the board brought him back in.

526
00:40:51,787 --> 00:40:54,707
And guess what?

527
00:40:54,707 --> 00:40:56,190
The reason you're still on the project

528
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,220
is because Tul put his own position on the line.

529
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:04,247
If you fail, he agreed to resign from Dreamer.

530
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,200
He went that far?

531
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,395
Cream.

532
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,807
Hello, my name is Cream, Panisa Rattanawong.

533
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:39,807
I'm the Creative Director at Dreamer,

534
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:43,160
and probably the person many of you
have seen circulating on social media lately.

535
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,013
I've decided to go live today...
[Liars always show up after the damage is done.]

536
00:41:46,013 --> 00:41:50,000
because I want to explain the truth myself.
[Dreamer should sue this designer.]

537
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,160
I love being a designer.

538
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,867
It's always been my dream to work
for a company as great and talented as Dreamer.

539
00:41:57,867 --> 00:42:00,753
But on the day of the Young Designer Competition,

540
00:42:00,753 --> 00:42:06,220
I had a severe panic attack,
so bad that I couldn't go on stage.

541
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,393
[Sending support, Cream!]

542
00:42:07,393 --> 00:42:11,160
I begged my twin sister, Cake,
[Did any of y'all even wear her brand?]

543
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,120
to take my place.
[Twins from hell]

544
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,607
Looking back, I realize now how careless that was.

545
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:19,360
That one mistake led to a chain of lies.
[It was just a personal lie, not about her work.]

546
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,300
That's why I needed to continue the lie.

547
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,073
But I want to be clear.

548
00:42:25,073 --> 00:42:29,480
I never intended to deceive anyone at Dreamer,

549
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,807
or the people around me.
[We'll keep supporting Dreamer!]

550
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:37,920
About the accusation
that I faked my qualifications,

551
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,860
and have no knowledge of design concept, that's not true.

552
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,320
I have proof.

553
00:42:48,306 --> 00:42:50,920
Here it is.

554
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,939
Everything here was made by me,
with my own two hands.

555
00:42:57,947 --> 00:43:00,793
I really do.

556
00:43:00,793 --> 00:43:05,400
I didn't go live to ask for sympathy.

557
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,120
I want to make it clear

558
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,753
that Dreamer had nothing to do
with my personal mistakes.

559
00:43:11,753 --> 00:43:19,433
I now understand just how destructive lies can be.

560
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:23,713
They shatter the trust people have in you.

561
00:43:23,713 --> 00:43:29,353
They ruin the faith
of those who love and believe in you.

562
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:39,900
So I take full responsibility.

563
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,720
All of it is on me.

564
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,367
After the Paris Fashion Week project,
[Liar.] [Stay strong.]

565
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:49,440
I will resign from Dreamer.

566
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,160
[Fraud.]

567
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,580
[Delusional.]

568
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,240
[Such a liar. Total fraud.]

569
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,620
[We are rooting for you! Stay strong.]

570
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,760
[Some may believe you, but I don't.]

571
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,400
[An hour-long live just to say 99% lies.]

572
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,580
Stop attacking my sister.

573
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,700
Yes, we did wrong.

574
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,247
But today, she's standing up
and telling the truth.

575
00:44:30,247 --> 00:44:35,927
We both take responsibility for everything we did.

576
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:40,027
Please stop mocking just for fun.

577
00:44:40,027 --> 00:44:44,120
You might spend seconds typing those words,

578
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:48,393
but they can stay in someone's heart
for a lifetime.

579
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:49,887
We were wrong.

580
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,593
Maybe we deserve to be criticized.

581
00:44:52,593 --> 00:44:58,300
But hate without reason is still a form of abuse.

582
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,620
Thank you to everyone who's shown kindness,

583
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:14,367
who's shown kindness,
and given Cream a second chance.

584
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:21,860
We promise,
we'll do everything we can to fix this.

585
00:45:23,273 --> 00:45:25,340
Thank you.

586
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,820
Thank you so much.

587
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,847
Those people piling on...

588
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:12,427
If they're so brave,
they shouldn't be hiding behind fake accounts.

589
00:46:12,427 --> 00:46:15,060
So tough online, huh?

590
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,760
It's fine.

591
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,733
At least some of the comments are starting
to get what we were trying to say.

592
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:21,850
Look at this one.

593
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,400
It says people should focus on our work instead,

594
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,073
and treat the lies as a personal matter,
and just forgive us already.

595
00:46:27,073 --> 00:46:30,760
Now that's the kind of comment
that's worth reading.

596
00:46:39,533 --> 00:46:42,120
Thank you so much.

597
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:47,360
Really, you didn't have to go this far.

598
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,800
There's no way I was going
to let you take all the blame.

599
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,327
I was part of it too.

600
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:55,173
You didn't force me into anything.

601
00:46:55,173 --> 00:46:58,960
We made the choice together.
So we take the responsibility together.

602
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,640
And if I hadn't stood by you,

603
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,927
Mom and Dad would definitely show up in my dreams
and scold me.

604
00:47:12,053 --> 00:47:16,587
Even if no one in the world forgives you,
I always will.

605
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:21,107
No matter what you've done.

606
00:47:26,107 --> 00:47:28,140
Thank you.

607
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:30,780
And...

608
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:36,733
You have forgiven me, right? About me and Tul?

609
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:42,520
Cream, I already told you.
I could never love Tul the way you do.

610
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:44,660
So stop wasting time thinking about me.

611
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:49,800
You should be thinking
about how to fix things with him.

612
00:47:57,827 --> 00:48:00,013
About me and Tul...

613
00:48:00,953 --> 00:48:02,580
I think...

614
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,793
it might be too late now.

615
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,160
Mom...

616
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,387
should I forgive her?
