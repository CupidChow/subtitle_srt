1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,627
- P'Cream.
- What?

2
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:04,187
Khun Pete is waiting outside of the house.

3
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,162
Hello.

4
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:42,233
Do you have business here?

5
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,907
I went to your apartment today, but you weren't there.

6
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:47,260
I figured you might be here.

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,660
Your arm... What happened?

8
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,060
Last night, I ran into the guy with the Illuminati tattoo

9
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,480
we've been trying to track down.

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,807
Really?

11
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:00,420
Where?

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,600
Let's talk inside, shall we?

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,460
[Khun Cream]

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,520
[Tul]

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,400
[Khun Cream]

16
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,080
Khun Cream? Are you home?

17
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,460
I just wanted to bring the fabric updates to discuss with you.

18
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,447
I am heading there now.

19
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:52,387
Sorry, I really can't talk at home right now.

20
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:54,700
Where did you run into him?

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,280
At a bar last night.

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,790
At first, I caught up to him,

23
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,080
but there was a bit of a struggle and he got away.

24
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,307
Good thing it was just your arm.

25
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:07,947
If it was your face, I don't even want to imagine.

26
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:09,100
Right?

27
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,860
If something had happened to my face, you'd be devastated, wouldn't you?

28
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:18,627
Did you report it?

29
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:20,020
I did, last night.

30
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,013
The police said they'd check the CCTV in the area.

31
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:26,573
But there's one thing I'm pretty certain of.

32
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:28,720
The person who attacked you was trying to sabotage Dreamer.

33
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,907
Khun Tul and I suspected the same thing.

34
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:34,320
Why do you think that?

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,840
Because he's the same guy who messed with the power system

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,790
at Dreamer's fashion show that night.

37
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:42,220
I saw him that day, tried to follow, but he disappeared.

38
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,933
And if I'm right, before the competition between Dreamer and Nira Fashion House,

39
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,800
he'll strike again for sure.

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,947
Please be careful.

41
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:24,600
I'll head down for a second. Be right back.

42
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,249
- Hello.
- Hello.

43
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,127
Is Khun Cream home?

44
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:42,327
And you are?

45
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:43,560
My name's Tul.

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,380
I'm her supervisor from work.

47
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:49,460
I have some work-related things to discuss with her.

48
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,313
The project she's working on.

49
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:47,233
Thanks.

50
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:09,353
P'Cake.

51
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:11,060
Hey, you, Khun!

52
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,133
P'Cake!

53
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,700
P'Cake... Oh no!

54
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,833
- Gosh!
- What?

55
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,080
P'Cake!

56
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,720
- P'Cake!
- Khun?

57
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,080
Khun!

58
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:26,160
P'Cake!

59
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,280
Wait! Wait. Let me clean off the broken glass! Just a moment, okay?

60
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,740
Khun?

61
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:44,433
- P'Cake!
- Khun?

62
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,780
- P'Cake.
- Khun?

63
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,893
I am so sorry.

64
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:51,227
There's so much blood...

65
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,647
What is it, P'Cake?

66
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,653
Khun Tul.

67
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,760
Kaew.

68
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,640
I'm here now.

69
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:16,120
P'Cake, don't move yet, okay?

70
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,473
What do we do? Stay calm...

71
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:23,707
Khu-Khun Cream, maybe we should go check upstairs?

72
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:25,200
It's okay.

73
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,120
Khun Tul, what are you doing here?

74
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,153
I came to update the project with you.

75
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:32,800
But when I got here,

76
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,450
I heard glass shattering, and a kid from the house ran upstairs...

77
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:38,747
I'm sorry, Khun Cream, for coming in unannounced.

78
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:41,020
It's all right.

79
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:44,407
So... We should probably go up and check.

80
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,713
Isn't your sick relative upstairs?

81
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,980
P'Cream, P'Cream.

82
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:55,307
Everything's cleaned up now.

83
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,927
You go talk with your boss, P'Cream.

84
00:06:57,927 --> 00:06:59,220
Leave it to me.

85
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,620
Okay.

86
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:03,600
Right this way, Khun Tul.

87
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,107
Why are you here?

88
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:16,833
Why not?

89
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,067
If you can be here, why can't I?

90
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:20,307
Because this is Khun Cream's house.

91
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,660
Well, it's not your house either.

92
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,147
Did you even ask the homeowner?

93
00:07:23,147 --> 00:07:27,200
Maybe she wants me in her personal space, ever think of that, man?

94
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,487
That's enough.

95
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:38,580
Khun Pete just got a new lead on the person who attacked me.

96
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,727
Thank you.

97
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,280
Thanks.

98
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,173
I think the attacker might come after you again.

99
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:08,350
I'll find a safer place for you to stay,

100
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,730
at least while we're still tracking the guy down.

101
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:15,087
Why does that sound like you're trying to lock her up or something?

102
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:17,627
- This has nothing to do with you.
- Why wouldn't it?

103
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:22,600
Khun Cream is an important friend of mine.

104
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,890
And no matter what she's been through,

105
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,940
I've always been the one helping her, not you.

106
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,290
Well, so... Look, I know you're worried,

107
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:36,730
but I still have to go into the office to work.

108
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:39,213
We can't keep running forever, Khun Tul.

109
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:42,100
Then we have to catch the guy with the Illuminati tattoo.

110
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,753
That's the only way to trace back to whoever's behind it.

111
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:47,807
I think the most suspicious party is Nira Fashion House.

112
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:50,180
Do you have proof?

113
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,607
Or is this just a way to get P&Y to cut Nira Fashion House out of the running?

114
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:58,300
The more you talk, the more I think you're not as smart as you think.

115
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,020
If Nira's Fashion House really is the mastermind behind this, I want this competition even more.

116
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,260
I'll show them that no matter what dirty tricks they try,

117
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,410
they can't beat Dreamer.

118
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:10,420
You sound very confident.

119
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,760
Yes.

120
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:16,067
I believe in Khun Cream.

121
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:21,713
But I don't trust you.

122
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:25,700
You don't even realize that you're putting Khun Cream in danger.

123
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:34,320
I think... we should just leave it at that for today.

124
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,853
I need to check on my relative upstairs.

125
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:41,367
Sorry for the trouble.

126
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,360
If you're taking care of your relative here for a while,

127
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,600
I'll just come visit you here instead.

128
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:48,640
I'd rather you didn't.

129
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,853
It's just, I don't want anyone disturbing my relative.

130
00:09:58,227 --> 00:09:59,880
Please, go ahead and leave.

131
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,907
Both of you.

132
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,633
In that case, see you soon.

133
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,307
Good thing it's not a deep cut.

134
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:32,860
You'll be okay, Sweetie.

135
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,400
Next time you need to be more careful, all right?

136
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,947
Sure, Bpaa Su.

137
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:40,340
I'm really sorry.

138
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,100
It's just that Khun Tul came to see P'Cream

139
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,900
so I rushed downstairs.

140
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,113
But Cake can't even move on her own yet.

141
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:52,360
How did she fall off the bed?

142
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,207
I really don't know either, P'Cream.

143
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,967
When I came in, she was already lying on the floor.

144
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:01,233
And I was busy cleaning up all the broken glass.

145
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:05,507
I didn't notice there was one more shard near her hand.

146
00:11:05,507 --> 00:11:08,750
I think maybe Cake was thirsty,

147
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,667
and tried to reach for water on her own, then slipped off the bed.

148
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:16,070
Is that right, Sweetheart?

149
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,360
Are you thirsty? Want some water?

150
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,520
[Dreamer]

151
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:10,360
Khun Tul, do you have a moment?
- Sure.

152
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,160
This is the latest fabric pattern draft.

153
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:24,253
So how's your relative at home?

154
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:27,480
Getting better, thank you.

155
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,493
That's good to hear.

156
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,020
All right then, Khun Cream.

157
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,710
Go ahead and send this draft to the professor.

158
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:36,893
Ask him to have the weavers in Nan begin production.

159
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:38,320
Okay.

160
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,373
Actually, about what Khun Pete said about the attacker.

161
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:47,667
Do you think it might be connected to the competition?

162
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:51,127
Well... It's possible.

163
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:55,007
Then that means the fabric we're sending out might not be safe.

164
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,380
If you're worried about this,

165
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
I'll take care of it.

166
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,753
Thank you.

167
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,020
You received the fabric design, right, Professor Tom?

168
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,527
Yes, I did, Khun Cream. It's beautiful.

169
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:18,300
I'll send it to the weavers right away.

170
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:23,573
Let's move that knee today.

171
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:26,493
Your knee will start moving again, Cake, Dear.

172
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:28,100
All right, let's focus.

173
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,247
- Push through, sweetheart. Push through.
- You've got this.

174
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:36,120
No, no! Why do you keep giving me shit designs?

175
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,420
How could we win with these?

176
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,700
Redesign it!

177
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:44,320
The Thai fashion market is growing,

178
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,400
and P&Y's customer base is substantial,

179
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:54,980

Yes, I'll do my best.

Thank you.

182
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:04,313
I like it, but isn't the color a bit too dark?

183
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:12,267
- Khun Cream.
- Yes?

184
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:13,900
Here's your coffee.

- Push, sweetie. Good.

- Wow, great job.
- Five.

191
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:43,360
Here it is. I adjusted it just the way you told me.

192
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,680
Whoa, this is good.

193
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,727
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

195
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,353
I took out about an inch.

196
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:51,487
I really like it.

197
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:55,507
But could we maybe have a few more color tone options?

198

Yes, yes, yes.

204
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:18,480
Professor Tom just called.

205
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,980
He said two of the weavers got into a motorbike accident

206
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,380
and were badly injured.

207
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,240
That means the fabric won't be finished on schedule.

208
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,140
How much of the fabric is completed?

209
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,440
Seventy percent.

210
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,933
Then assign all the weavers to finish this piece right away.

211
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,880
Hello, Khun Tul.

- No, Khun Tul.

Please, come inside.

215
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,040
- Good afternoon, Professor.
- Good afternoon, Khun Tul and Khun Cream.

216
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,653
I'm really sorry for needing to assign people to guard the place.

217
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:07,560
This special jok-woven fabric is extremely important to us.

218
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,093
I understand, Khun Tul. We're working as fast as we can.

219
00:16:11,093 --> 00:16:13,733
Luckily, we've got extra help.

220
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:16,173
It'll definitely be done on time.

221
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,000
- May I take a look?
- Of course, Khun Cream. Go ahead.

- Hello.
- Hi there.

223
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:25,760
It's beautiful.

224
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,653
They're hurrying even though it's farming season.

225
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:33,487
Do you think the fabric will be finished on time?

226
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:35,380
- Yes.
- Okay.

227
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,630
Ou.

228
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,706
- Yes?
- If you see anyone suspicious, report to me immediately.

229
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:04,493
So this is what gives her the confidence that she can beat me.

230
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,920
Want me to order Ai Pae to take care of the fabric now?

231
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:16,080
Don't you see?

232
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,173
Tul's placed tons of guards around.

233
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:22,847
What can one of your guys even do?

234
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:29,260
I think we should wait until the fabric reaches Bangkok.

235
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,107
Then I'll find a chance to destroy it myself.

236
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,590
The closer we strike to the competition date,

237
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,920
the less time they'll have to find a replacement.

238
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,260
That makes perfect sense.

239
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,620
You should borrow some of Khun Mintra's brain.

240
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,140

342
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,720
He managed to get this deep into the factory.

343
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,893
And he knew the ins and outs of the place too well.

344
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,720
I'm certain he had help.

345
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:48,880
It's Khun Mintra.

346
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,040
Why do you think it's Min?

347
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,980
The only ones who knew where the special jok-woven fabric was stored

348
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,547
were you, me, and the design team.

349
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,500
But Khun Mintra is the most suspicious.

350
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,080
Because before this, she clearly didn't like me at all.

351
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,027
And then suddenly, she started being nice.

352
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:05,093
I'm not trying to accuse her without reason.

353
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,860
But I think everything she did was part of a plan

354
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,800
to make me drop my guard.

355
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,800
Then we need to keep a close eye on her.

356
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,900
If she's really behind this,

357
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,200
we might be able to trace it all the way to the person trying to destroy Dreamer.

358
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,400
And what about the special jok-woven fabric that was burned?

359
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,700
What should we do next?

360
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,553
Bpaa. You are still up?

361
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:54,287
I was worried about you. How are you, Dear?

362
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm okay.

363
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
Has Cake fallen asleep?

364
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,000
Yes.

365
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,800
Oh, when she was watching the factory fire from your tablet,

366
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,400
Cake had a severe headache.

367
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,030
I had to give her a sleeping pill.

368
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,613
And earlier, before you left, she was trying to draw something.

369
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,180
I couldn't make it out, Bpaa.

370
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,600
This one?

371
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Yes.

372
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,100
I was just looking at it myself.

373
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:28,213
It's like she's trying to tell us something.

374
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,280
[Dreamer]

375
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,819
Ladies and gentlemen, just after midnight last night,

376
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:46,300
a fire broke out at the Dreamer fashion factory.

377
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,573
Initial investigations show the fire originated in the fabric storage room,

378
00:28:50,573 --> 00:28:53,600
causing the flames to spread rapidly and intensely.

379
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,200
Emergency crews rushed in to contain the fire,

380
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,300
which took over an hour to bring under control.

381
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,300
There are no reports of injuries or casualties at this time.

382
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,900
What did the police say?

383
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,600
Any leads on the person who set fire to our factory?

384
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
As of this morning, there's been no update.

385
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,500
Last night, they said the fire started in the office wing.

386
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Damages are estimated in the millions.

387
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,393
But more importantly, the special jok-woven fabric we were going to use in the competition

388
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:21,680
was completely destroyed in the fire.

389
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,360
- Huh?
- Wait, wait, wait.

390
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
What's special jok-woven fabric?

391
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,400
It's a masterwork traditional textile from Nan Province.

392
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,800
And it was the key component we were going to use

393
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
in our outfit for the Iconic Thai Designer project.

394
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Yesterday, Khun Tul and I delivered it to the tailoring department,

395
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,700
that's why it got burned along with everything else.

396
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:42,833
So now what?

397
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:47,600
That fabric was so important, does this mean the company is finished?

398
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,200
Khun Cream, with the time we have left,

399
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,400
can we commission another piece of that fabric to be woven in time?

400
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:59,000
The traditional special jok-weaving technique takes more than a month.

401
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,800
Cream, Cream, what's the plan?

402
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,000
What are we going to do?

403
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,400
I honestly don't know.

404
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,500
If it's not the special jok-woven from Nan,

405
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,600
I really don't know what other fabric I could use for the competition.

406
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:32,760
One second, Girl.

407
00:30:34,113 --> 00:30:35,927
Hello?

408
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,800
Yes, I'm free.

409
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,800
Okay, I can meet at the office.

410
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,473
Okay.

411
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,000
Who was that?

412
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,600
Shining Agency, Girl.

413
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,800
They want to come show me some fabric catalogs.

414
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,600
Shining Agency?

415
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Hey, that's really huge.

416
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,300
They only work with a few elite brands.

417
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,600
How did you get in touch with them?

418
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,400
I didn't. They reached out to me out of the blue.

419
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,200
What?

420
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,700
You've got serious karma on your side, girl.

421
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,600
Awesome.

422
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:16,733
If there's a specific fabric or pattern you want, just let me know.

423
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,100
We'll source a specialty fabric just for you.

424
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,400
Oh, Thai textiles?

425
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,100
If you're looking for something traditional, we can source that too.

426
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,000
Let me take a look first.

427
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You're taking such good care of me.

428
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,400
Well, with your Spring-Summer collection getting so much attention,

429
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,700
every agency wants you as a client.

430
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:42,260
That was a while ago though.

431
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,880
Why are you only reaching out now?

432
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:47,620
Well...

433
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,190
We reached out after hearing the news

434
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,800
about the factory fire at Dreamer.

435
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,000
It's not a coincidence, is it?

436
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:59,467
Cream...

437
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,400
Is there something you haven't told me?

438
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,100
Well...

439
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,760
Because if you can't explain this,

440
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,600
then I won't be moving forward with this deal.

441
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,530
Khun Cream, please calm down. Khun Cream.

442
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,400
So...

443
00:32:15,453 --> 00:32:21,400
The truth is... We got your contact from someone... a well-meaning person.

444
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,320
But they didn't want to reveal their identity.

445
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:27,693
Who is it?

446
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,800
Khun Pete, Khun Cream is here to see you.

447
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,800
Khun Cream.

448
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,000
You came all the way here to see me.

449
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,200
Is something wrong?

450
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,000
Shining Agency came to see me.

451
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Oh.

452
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,600
Well, it's noon. Why don't we go have lunch and talk there?

453
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,500
Khun Pete.

454
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,600
Thank you so much for trying to help me.

455
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,300
But I can't accept your help.

456
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,300
It wouldn't be fair to Nira Fashion House.

457
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,400
Why not?

458
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,073
I'm just offering support because your factory just burned down.

459
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,800
There's a chance your fabric got damaged.

460
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,500
You really don't have to help me.

461
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,400
It's not like we're anything.

462
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,100
We're friends, right?

463
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,600
When a friend's in trouble, you help. Isn't it like that?

464
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,100
I think you're overthinking it.

465
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,300
Sure, fabric is important, but it all comes down to design.

466
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,860
If, in the end, you and your team aren't good enough,

467
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,800
you won't beat Nira Fashion House anyway.

468
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,200
Either way, I can't accept it.

469
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,600
Thanks a lot.

470
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,300
I've said what I came to say. I'll excuse myself.

471
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,800
Wait, Khun Cream.

472
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,800
You've really changed, you know that?

473
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,600
You've lost your memories, and now your way of thinking has changed too.

474
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,700
It's like you're a completely different person.

475
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,120
I'm still me.

476
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,100
Okay then.

477
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:14,000
I just wanted to help because the fire put Dreamer at a serious disadvantage.

478
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,940
Yesterday, Khun Tul and I were discussing

479
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,400
what fabric to use to replace the special jok.

480
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,800
Shining Agency reached out, and I've reviewed their samples,

481
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,800
they have some really beautiful Thai textiles available.

482
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,600
So Khun Cream and I think we'll use fabric from this agency

483
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,800
for the competition against Nira Fashion House.

484
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,880
But changing the fabric at this point,

485
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,300
will it even match the design we've created?

486
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:55,787
We had the "queen" of all textiles in our hands.

487
00:34:55,787 --> 00:34:59,187
And the pattern you designed was perfect.

488
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,700
Why did this have to happen?

489
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,400
Hey, Guys, stop already.

490
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,600
That's enough.

491
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,300
Don't make her feel worse than she already does.

492
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,000
She managed to secure premium fabric from a top agency.

493
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,600
That's already a solid solution.

494
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,600
So, have you decided which fabric to use?

495
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,000
About that, Khun Cream and I are still deciding.

496
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Let's not give up, everyone, okay?

497
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,400
I want to apologize to everyone, for having to start over.

498
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,900
But if any of you wants to back out, I won't stop you.

499
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,600
Just know Dreamer will lose its chance to go global.

500
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,600
There's no way we'd abandon Dreamer.

501
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,800
Me and the team, we're going all the way with you and Khun Tul.

502
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,500
Right, guys?

503
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,400
Yes!

504
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,100
Thank you, everyone.

505
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,200
So we push forward, right?

506
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
Yes!

507
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,000
[Khun Mintra, please call me back on this number.]

508
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,000
Excuse me a moment.

509
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,900
Hello, Khun Mintra.

510
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,500
Hello, Khun Cindy.

511
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,400
Is something wrong?

512
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,600
I just wanted to call and compliment you.

513
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,800
But to make it more official.

514
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,700
I'd prefer we talk in person.

515
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:53,093
Meet me for lunch today at noon.

516
00:36:53,093 --> 00:36:56,700
I'll give you your first payment.

517
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,440
Oh and... P'Wasin?

518
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,900
I don't want to talk to people who are useless.

519
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,600
You're the only one who's been truly helpful.

520
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,900
Don't disappoint me.

521
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,300
Yes, Ma'am.

522
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,300
I know that restaurant. See you there.

523
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,600
Are you really going to meet with Khun Cindy?

524
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,100
Yes.

525
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,100
Why didn't she tell me?

526
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,310
I don't know either.

527
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,600
Maybe I'm her new favorite now.

528
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,000
- Min...
- Well, what can I say?

529
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,200
You're the one who brought me in.

530
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,000
Thank you, by the way, for the career advancement.

531
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,400
But if you hadn't blackmailed me back then,

532
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,900
I wouldn't have had the chance to show my skills to Khun Cindy.

533
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,700
So what are you going to talk about?

534
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,800
Cream. Cream. Hold on a sec.

535
00:38:03,413 --> 00:38:04,700
Have you seen Khun Min?

536
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,800
Min?

537
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,800
I haven't seen her. Why?

538
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,433
Nothing.

539
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:12,313
- I will be right back.
- Huh?

540
00:38:12,313 --> 00:38:15,900
Well, it looks like Khun Cindy doesn't need you anymore, Phi.

541
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,400
Otherwise, she wouldn't have contacted me directly.

542
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,800
Please excuse me.

543
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,000
Wouldn't want to keep her waiting.

544
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,000
You're pretty gutsy, you know that?

545
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,000
Honestly, I could've just followed Khun Min alone.

546
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,400
I'm not letting you go by yourself.

547
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,500
What if she actually meets the guy with the tattoo?

548
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,700
Who's going to protect you then?

549
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:15,680
Thank you, Khun Tul.

550
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,600
[P'Wasin]

551
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,800
Just listen. Don't say anything.

552
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,700
Don't meet with Khun Cindy yet.

553
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,600
Tul and Cream are on their way to her.

554
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,400
Get out of there now.

555
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,500
I'm already at the restaurant. I'm here.

556
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,800
Why didn't anyone tell me they changed the place?

557
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,000
Okay, okay, I'm on my way. That's it.

558
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,500
There's definitely something going on.

559
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,100
Khun Cream, you think Min realized we were following her?

560
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,600
Maybe that's why she pretended to be looking at fabrics?

561
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
Then maybe we should head back to the original place.

562
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,200
Her contact might still be there.

563
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
I don't think we'll make it in time.

564
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
If Min realized we were watching,

565
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,200
whoever she was meeting probably knows too.

566
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,400
I think it's better if we regroup at the office.

567
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,300
Thanks.

568
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,600
That was close, Min.

569
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,900
If I hadn't stepped in to help you, how would you have gotten out of this?

570
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,200
Not even a thank-you?

571
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
I saved your ass.

572
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:36,400
Thanks for the help.

573
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,200
But don't go thinking you're so smart you can pull this off solo.

574
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,800
It won't end well.

575
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,400
Why are you still following me?

576
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,800
I have the right to know everything Khun Cindy asks for.

577
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,900
Even if she likes your work,

578
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,470
if she finds out Tul and Cream suspect you,

579
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,700
do you think she'll still trust you?

580
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
What are you going to do?

581
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,200
Nothing.

582
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,700
And I won't tell anyone.

583
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,200
Because you're still useful to me.

584
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,000
But don't try flying solo again.

585
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,400
You'll crash and burn, and drag me down with you.

586
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,600
Whether we like it or not, we need each other.

587
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,800
Eat a bit, Cake.

588
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,700
I know you're sick of this hospital food.

589
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,000
But you need to eat if you want to get better.

590
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:02,367
Do you remember Khun Pete?

591
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:06,547
I think he really likes you.

592
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,800
About Khun Pete, I know everything already.

593
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,000
Whatever you decide to do, that's your choice.

594
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,800
But I just want you to get better fast.

595
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,190
So you can talk to Khun Pete yourself.

596
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,000
Sound good?

597
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,300
Now.

598
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,400
Here, one more bite, okay?

599
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,000
You want to tell me something?

600
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,200
Here.

601
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,000
All right. Let's try again.

602
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,100
There.

603
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,500
You're doing great.

604
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,400
It's alright, Cake.

605
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:55,993
What are you drawing?

606
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,500
A pillow?

607
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,400
Do you want another pillow?

608
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:23,780
P'Cream, hello.

609
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:28,100
And beautiful P'Cake, I am here.

610
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,800
I heard from Bpaa Su you haven't been eating.

611
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,000
- Want to eat?
- She's not eating at all.

612
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,200
That won't do it, P'Cake.

613
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,000
If you don't eat, you won't have the energy for physical therapy, you know?

614
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,310
Or maybe let Kaew feed you instead?

615
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:43,600
Change of pace might help.

616
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,400
Just one bite, okay?

617
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,000
Please, my beautiful sister.

618
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,200
Just one bite?

619
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,300
Just one?

620
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,800
Why, Sweetie?

621
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,700
Okay, Bpaa, I'll go throw it away.

622
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:02,160
Not a single bite.

623
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,090
You know, Bpaa Su and I are both nurses.

624
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,700
We've looked after so many patients.

625
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,200
- But somehow, we still lose to our own family.
- Exactly.

626
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,800
Now that it's my own niece, I'm at a loss.

627
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,800
Can't even guess what she wants, what she feels like eating.

628
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
Oh! How about this?

629
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
Let's try a change of scenery.

630
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,200
Maybe if we take P'Cake outside for a walk, she'll be more willing to eat.

631
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,200
- No.
- No.

632
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,500
Your favorite dish.

633
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,200
I didn't know you were such a good cook.

634
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,800
You already asked me that.

635
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,000
My family used to run a restaurant, remember?

636
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Don't tell me you forgot.

637
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,700
I'd be crushed.

638
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,800
I just have a lot on my mind lately.

639
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,833
I just heard you had an accident.

640
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:32,307
Was it serious?

641
00:48:32,307 --> 00:48:33,393
I'm getting better now.

642
00:48:33,393 --> 00:48:35,753
You're okay, right?

643
00:48:35,753 --> 00:48:38,813
Yeah. I'm okay now.

644
00:48:38,813 --> 00:48:41,360
You are different.

645
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,400
You've really changed.

646
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,600
Nothing happened here, right?

647
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,300
You're not just forgetting things. Your whole perspective seems different.

648
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,400
Like you're someone else entirely.
