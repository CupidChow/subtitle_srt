00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,000
You've been smiling more too.

182
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,600
Really?

183
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,200
Yes.

184
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,300
It's just that some of the team once told me

185
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,900
you were like an ice prince.

186
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,500
Then I'll give you the credit for thawing me out.

187
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,000
I think it's not just the team that's more relaxed.

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,100
I am, too.

189
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,600
It's strange.

190
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,750
But when I'm with you,

191
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:47,400
it feels like when I used to be with one of my close friends.

192
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,520
When I was with that person, I felt completely like myself.

193
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,100
Fresh would be happy to hear that you still think of her.

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
How did you know I was talking about Fresh?

195
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,280
You talk about her all the time.

196
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:22,680
Well, what I meant is...

197
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,973
I talk about her as a friend.

198
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,067
There's nothing more than that.

199
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:30,547
Yes.

200
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,200
- Yes.
- Okay.

201
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
[Wat Phumin (Temple), Wiang Tai Subdistrict, Zone 1, Mueang District, Nan Province]

202
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,200
Inside this chapel is the world-famous Whispering Love mural.

203
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,100
I want everyone to study the wall paintings and the artwork.

204
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,200
You might get some ideas for your designs.

205
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
Got it, P'Cream.

206
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,100
I'll take lots of pictures for the mood board too.

207
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,500
Great.

208
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,400
Let's go.

209
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Why are you calling?

210
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,200
I already reported to Khun Cindy about the special weaving technique.

211
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
She praised you, you know.

212
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,800
I don't need praise. I need the money.

213
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,200
Take care of that for me.

214
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,500
And if there's nothing else, don't call again.

215
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,800
This is a painting by Naan Bua Phan, a Tai Lue (ethnic group northern TH, Laos, China) artist.

216
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,600
The outfit worn by Yaa (Grandma) Man is traditional Tai Lue formal wear,

217
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,200
while Puu (Grandpa) Man wears Burmese attire.

218
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,160
If we look closely at Granny Man's outfit,

219
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,800
the color palette uses red, blue,

220
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,700
dark brown, and black tones we often see in Thai woven textiles.

221
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,200
I think this painting

222
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,900
reflects the values and evolution of love stories through time beautifully.

223
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,600
They say if a couple wants their love to be strong and lasting,

224
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,860
the man should whisper his love to the woman

225
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,600
and make a wish in front of this mural.

226
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,000
You really know a lot about traditional art.

227
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,400
When I first joined, you teased me for only liking old stuff.

228
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,800
Now you know even more than I do.

229
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,600
True.

230
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,500
Well, I started learning when we began this project.

231
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,000
Right.

232
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,800
There are a lot of other corners and murals I want everyone to check out.

233
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
They might be useful details for our designs.

234
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,400
Hey, that spot over there looks beautiful.

235
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Take a photo there. Come on.

236
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,100
- P'Moo, hurry up!
- Okay.

237
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,573
Do you like this kind of artwork?

238
00:15:55,573 --> 00:15:59,890
I like artists who use art to tell love stories through their brushstrokes.

239
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,750
I like artists who use art to tell love stories through their brushstrokes.

240
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,187
It's kind of romantic, Khun Tul.

241
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:13,740
Pete.

242
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,940
[Khun Pete]

243
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,500
Ai Pete?

244
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes.

245
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'll answer him later. Let's focus on work first.

246
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,300
But about what you asked me yesterday...

247
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,200
why I suspected something was going on between you and Ai Pete.

248
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Because I like you.

249
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,347
Cake?

250
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:07,880
Cake.

251
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,180
Cake.

252
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,533
Cake, are you awake, Sweetie?

253
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,227
Cake.

254
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:16,933
Cake.

255
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm sorry for startling you.

256
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,140
I just wanted to be clear with you.

257
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,400
And I want you to know that I really do like you.

258
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,400
You don't have to worry about anything.

259
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,000
Nothing will change between us.

260
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,900
Just knowing that you know is already enough for me.

261
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:42,947
Khun Cream.

262
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,400
I'll let things unfold naturally.

263
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,100
I won't pressure you into anything.

264
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,000
Kaew, Kaew!

265
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,300
Your P'Cake is awake!

266
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,800
- Yes!
- Hurry up! Your P'Cake's awake!

267
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,200
P'Cake!

268
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
It's Kaew, P'Cake!

269
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,700
- Cake, Sweetie!
- P'Cake!

270
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,300
- Bpaa, P'Cake is awake!
- Cake!

271
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,967
- Kaew, Kaew, go get my phone, quick, Dear!
- Oh, right! I'm on it!

272
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,700
Cake...

273
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,300
I'm so happy, Sweetie.

274
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:27,947
- Yes, Bpaa?
- Cream.

275
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:30,527
Cake woke up, Sweetie.

276
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,467
Really, Bpaa?

277
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:34,693
Can I talk to her?

278
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:36,233
Not yet.

279
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:39,360
She just woke up, but she's still very dazed.

280
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,873
Her body doesn't seem fully responsive yet.

281
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,820
I tried talking to her just now,

282
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,100
but she can barely move or speak.

283
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,107
Is Cake paralyzed, Bpaa?

284
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:52,980
I'm not sure yet.

285
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,440
But tomorrow, I'll take her to the hospital for a full check-up.

286
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,620
Then can I come with you?

287
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,227
Wait, wait, would that be okay, Dear?

288
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,787
What if someone sees you?

289
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:09,093
I think it's safer if I go alone.

290
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:12,300
I want to hear the results for myself, Bpaa.

291
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,400
All right then.

292
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,900
Tomorrow, I'll have the ambulance come pick up Cake from home.

293
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,600
Okay.

294
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
See you, Bpaa.

295
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,447
What results are you waiting for?

296
00:19:35,147 --> 00:19:37,563
Is someone sick, Khun Cream?

297
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,893
A relative.

298
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:42,830
They're not feeling well,

299
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,320
and they don't have anyone to take them to the doctor.

300
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,680
Want me to come with you?

301
00:19:49,473 --> 00:19:51,340
It's okay.

302
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,220
You have so much to do; I don't want to bother you.

303
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,360
Thank you, though.

304
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,447
Shall we go take a look over there?

305
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:03,767
Let's go. This way, please.

306
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,500
Everyone, see you at the office tomorrow.

307
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,687
- Yes.
- Got it.

308
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,587
Khun Cream. Khun Cream.

309
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:28,733
Khun Pete? What are you doing here?

310
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,600
I need to talk to you about something important.

311
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,200
The police couldn't reach you so they called me about the case.

312
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,980
Thanks. I'll call them back myself.

313
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,370
Excuse me.

314
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:38,493
Khun Cream... Khun Cream, please.

315
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:40,407
- She said she has something to do.
- Hey!

316
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,067
What does this have to do with you?

317
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,647
This is between me and Khun Cream.

318
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,193
You're just an outsider. Stay out of it.

319
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:47,680
Khun Cream told me you lied.

320
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,427
She doesn't feel anything for you.

321
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:51,340
But I still do.

322
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,000
From then until now.

323
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,740
Ai Pete.

324
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:03,260
Hey, Wine.

325
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,113
Yes, I've arrived.

326
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:08,880
No need to cancel the board. I'll head back right after this.

327
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:16,547
Cake.

328
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,480
Cake.

329
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,887
Cake.

330
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm so happy you opened your eyes, Cake!

331
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,607
Cake.

332
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:27,280
It's okay, you'll get better.

333
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,940
You've always been strong.

334
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,260
I'll go grab something from the car, okay?

335
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,960
I'll be back in a sec.

336
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,460
Oh, I'll grab a blanket too. Just in case it's cold in the hospital.

337
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,233
Watch her for me, sweetie.

338
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,320
- Khun Cream.
- Khun Pete?

339
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,581
Did you follow me here?

340
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:59,353
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:02,080
I have something important I want to tell you.

342
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,373
When you were in Nan, I called you several times and you didn't answer.

343
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:06,347
And just now, your phone was turned off again.

344
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:08,680
The police have a lead on the person who attacked you.

345
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,520
They want you to come to the station.

346
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,120
Thank you so much, but could you head back first?

347
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,833
I'll go to the station myself.

348
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,893
And this house...

349
00:22:16,893 --> 00:22:19,620
- Whose is it?
- My relative's house.

350
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:22,940
- Let me help.
- No need.

351
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,787
I can handle it myself.

352
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:26,827
Please just go back.

353
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,420
Oh, what's going on here?

354
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,840
Oh dear.

355
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,320
Do you need help?

356
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,453
She must be hot. The patient must be really uncomfortable.

357
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:47,213
Are you okay?

358

[Bang Mae Nang Police Station]

369
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:31,020
We reviewed the CCTV footage from the crime scene to nearby areas.

370
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,733
We found that the suspect stopped to refuel at a gas station.

371
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:37,220
The station staff said the suspect never removed their helmet

372
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,040
so we couldn't get a look at their face.

373
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,980
As for the license plate, it turned out to be fake.

374
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:48,260
But even if we didn't see the suspect's face, we did get some other key evidence.

375
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,333
What kind of evidence?

376
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,320
The gas station staff said

377
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,273
the suspect had tattoos on the backs of both hands.

378
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:11,320
Have you ever seen those tattoos before?

379
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,567
No, I haven't.

As I said the last time I spoke to the police,

383

I've had some work-related issues with colleagues,

384
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:26,607
but I don't think they'd go as far as sending someone to hurt me.

385
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,790
But if I had to guess,

386
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,467
it might be a rival company trying to steal information.

387
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:36,647

I think it's a perfect fit to be showcased on a global level.

438

I plan to use this as the inspiration for our woven fabric design.

439

No wonder you were standing there looking at that painting for so long.

440

I'm okay with that.

441
00:28:42,707 --> 00:28:45,793
It aligns well with the Iconic Thai Designer concept.

442
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:51,020
But, P'Cream, I think the colors in the painting feel a little flat.

443
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,627
Shouldn't we tweak the tones a bit and make it more fun?

444
00:28:56,627 --> 00:28:59,487
I think the highlight of the special Chok woven fabric

445
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,507
is the variety of weaving techniques in a single piece.

446
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,500
So I believe we should carefully select both the patterns

447
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,253
and core colors to best reflect its identity.

00:29:09,253 --> 00:29:13,020

- I actually agree with Cream.

- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

534
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,400
Go back a bit. What's that?

535
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,140
[Wonderful Slim]

536
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,640
[Wonderful Slim]
[Body Cream Fit Slim - Slimming Cream]

537
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,393
What's that Wonderful Slim building?

538
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:40,340
The most famous weight loss clinic in Chiang Mai.

539
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,173
- Chiang Mai?
- Yes.

540
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:43,333
Does it have any other branches?

541
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,200
Only one, in Chiang Mai. Why?

542
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,600
Don't tell me you've been a client there.

543
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,147
Is that how your body looks so good? Got some help, did you?

544
00:34:54,147 --> 00:34:56,020
No, it's not that.

545
00:34:56,947 --> 00:34:59,680
I saw medication in Khun Cream's bag.

546
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,300
It's from this clinic.

547
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:05,287
If you're saying there's only one branch in Chiang Mai,

548
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:06,893
then where did she get the meds from?

549
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:08,247
What's so strange about that?

550
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:10,667
Can't she just order online?

551
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:15,367
Why are you so suspicious over something so small?

552
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:17,427
You really care, right?

553
00:35:17,427 --> 00:35:20,420
You got a crush on her?

554
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,940
Yes.

555
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,580
- I already told her I like her.
- What? (lit.: Are you crazy?)

556
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,320
So it's not a crush. You actually confessed?

557
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,340
- Yes.
- And? What now?

558
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,180
- She hasn't replied.
- Oh...

559
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,220
But I told her it's okay. No need to rush.

560
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,060
- I just...
- What?

561
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,093
I have this feeling.

562
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:40,687
As if she's hiding something from me.

563
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:42,380
Over some medication?

564
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,980
What are your suspecting her of?

565
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,213
Come on, she's a woman.

566
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:48,593
She probably just wants to keep in shape like everyone else.

567
00:35:48,593 --> 00:35:51,960
You're overthinking again. You're stressed from work, man.

568
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,600
- Yes.
- So?

569
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,533
Which location are you picking?

570
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:58,520
I'll decide later.

571
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,920
You're quick to confess your love, but slow to make work decisions, huh?

572
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:06,747
- Make sure to make it soon.
- Yes.

573
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:56,140
Everyone's gone home already?

574
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:59,160
Guess I'll head home too.

575
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,240
Khun Tul.

576
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,193
Want to grab dinner first?

577
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:19,493
I thought you'd gone home already.

578
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,980
I was just clearing some work too.

579
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,300
Ever since we got back from Nan, it's been piling up like a mountain, Khun Cream.

580
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,180
Here. Let's eat together.

581
00:37:30,353 --> 00:37:32,550
So you stayed this late not to work,

582
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,700
but to find someone to eat with?

583
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,640
There's still a lot left to do, you know.

584
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,933
So? What's in here?

585
00:37:42,787 --> 00:37:46,220
Normally, when you're busy like this,

586
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,780
don't you usually take your work home?

587
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,327
Okay, fine.

588
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:54,967
I just wanted to keep you company.

589
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:58,147
I've seen you working late several nights now.

590
00:37:58,147 --> 00:38:02,920
If anything happened again, who'd take care of you?

591
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,442
Thank you.

592
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:08,753
Here, let's eat, shall we?

593
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:12,287
Thanks so much,

594
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:17,780
I have to confess. After 6 p.m., I can't eat anything anymore.

595
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,913
Guess I'll have to eat it all myself, huh?

596
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:23,240
Still two full boxes.

597
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:30,320
I never realized you were so strict about food.

598
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:36,407
Before the accident, you weren't like this at all.

599
00:38:36,407 --> 00:38:40,070
Well, after I got discharged from the hospital,

600
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:43,130
my health hasn't been the same.

601
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:45,380
So I have to take better care of myself now.

602
00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:48,820
That's great, Khun Cream.

603
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:54,407
Also, when you fainted in Nan, I saw in your bag.

604
00:38:54,407 --> 00:38:57,147
You had a bunch of weight loss supplements from a slimming center.

605
00:38:57,147 --> 00:39:00,660
So when did you start the program?

606
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:06,140
I didn't actually join it.

607
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,900
It was a friend.

608
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:14,073
My friend did, and then she recommended it to me, and gave me a bit to try.

609
00:39:14,073 --> 00:39:19,520
When it worked well, I just kept ordering it.

610
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,980
Khun Cream, isn't that kind of dangerous?

611
00:39:29,127 --> 00:39:31,747
I'm sorry if I'm being a little too nosy.

612
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:38,147
But Khun Cream, you're not just important to the company.

613
00:39:44,413 --> 00:39:47,113
You're important to me, toom Khun Cream.

614
00:39:49,127 --> 00:39:51,340
I really worry about you.

615
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,380
Thank you.

616
00:40:07,307 --> 00:40:11,107
I... I'm heading home.

617
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:12,767
Okay.

618
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,880
See you tomorrow.

619
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,760
See you tomorrow.

620
00:40:18,967 --> 00:40:21,387
Make sure to finish it, okay?

621
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:23,800
Yes. Thanks.

622
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,120
Pete.

623
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:48,033
Katie.

624
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,240
Katie, what?

625
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,307
Pete, what's going on?

626
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,073
What do you mean?

627
00:40:56,073 --> 00:40:59,340
You're not usually like this.

628
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,993
Like what?

629
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,447
Sorry Katie, I'm not really up for it tonight.

630
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:07,833
Why don't you go hang out with your friends?

631
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:12,727
And next time, don't call me again.

632
00:41:20,053 --> 00:41:22,113
I've arrived, Khun Wasin.

633
00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:30,240
The gas station attendant said the suspect

634
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,260
had tattoos on the back of both hands.

635
00:42:49,913 --> 00:42:51,427
Gosh.

636
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,820
Did anyone recognize your face?

637
00:43:03,607 --> 00:43:05,347
I'm not sure.

638
00:43:05,347 --> 00:43:07,773
But the store had security cameras.

639
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:10,467
Then get out of there!

640
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:12,513
Don't come back until I say so.

641
00:43:12,513 --> 00:43:14,480
I'll handle this myself.

642
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:16,960
Yes, Sir.

643
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:33,707
Kamol. I need your help.

644
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,930
I really apologize,

645
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,290
but all the cameras in our store are broken.

646
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:43,533
Really?

647
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:45,600
Not a single one is working?

648
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,507
None. I'm really sorry.

649
00:43:50,013 --> 00:43:51,740
All right.

650
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,480
Thanks a lot, Khun Kamol.

651
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,027
Sure.

652
00:44:05,647 --> 00:44:08,220
All set, Phi.

653
00:44:08,227 --> 00:44:11,727
Thanks, Kamol. I'll transfer the money now.

654
00:44:21,113 --> 00:44:23,100
Clench your hand.

655
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,293
Open your palm.

656
00:44:25,293 --> 00:44:27,260
It's okay. Take it slow.

657
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,480
You're doing really well.

658
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:31,707
Clench your hand.

659
00:44:31,707 --> 00:44:33,800
Open your palm.

660
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,893
Very good.

661
00:44:36,893 --> 00:44:38,670
That's enough for today.

662
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,030
Let's not overdo it since we're just starting.

663
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:44,633
Something like this, okay? Try to keep doing this every day.

664
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:48,187
If I'm not on shift, I'll come help again.

665
00:44:48,187 --> 00:44:52,373
Thank you so much. Really, thank you.

666
00:44:52,373 --> 00:44:54,820
Let me give you a ride home today.

667
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,493
Looks like it's about to rain.

668
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,280
All right, let's go.

669
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,767
Thanks, Phi.

670
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:03,733
- Can you help close the gate, Dear?
- Okay.

671
00:45:05,927 --> 00:45:07,613
Cake.

672
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:11,933
You did amazing today. You were really great.

673
00:45:11,933 --> 00:45:15,680
If you keep this up every day, you'll recover in no time.

674
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:24,127
Do you want to tell me something?

675
00:45:24,127 --> 00:45:25,740
Well?

676
00:45:26,733 --> 00:45:28,753
No more training.

677
00:45:28,753 --> 00:45:31,440
You've done so much already. That's more than enough for today.

678
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,087
We'll do more another day, okay?

679
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:20,147
- P'Cream.
- What?

680
00:46:20,147 --> 00:46:22,540
Khun Pete's waiting outside the house.
