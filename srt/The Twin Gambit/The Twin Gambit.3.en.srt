00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:03,240
[Dreamer]

2
00:00:04,373 --> 00:00:08,047
We've long worked together without any leaks of company information,

3
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:11,873
but after you showed up, everything has leaked.

4
00:00:11,873 --> 00:00:13,867
Are you accusing me of selling designs to the competition?

5
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:15,793
Wow. Why are you so defensive?

6
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:16,933
Unless you really did it.

7
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,400
If you thought of it, maybe you're the one who did it.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,107
Enough, please.

9
00:00:23,793 --> 00:00:26,547
It might not be what you think.

10
00:00:26,547 --> 00:00:31,393
The thief who broke in that night could never have taken the leaked designs.

11
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:33,373
It's possible, Ai Tul.

12
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,180
- Wine.
- Yes?

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,833
- Contact the lawyer right away.
- Okay.

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,240
[Nira Fashion House]

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,233
Tul and his team are here, Khun Cindy.

16
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:16,960
Excuse me! Sorry, you can't go in.

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,300
- Do not go inside, please.
- I'm here to see your boss.

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,093
Show some respect for the place, Tul.

19
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:27,387
And what is this?

20
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,170
Did you bring your whole company here?

21
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,320
Are you here to congratulate me on my new collection?

22
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:35,527
I have proof that my creative director

23
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:39,180
designed the Jigsaw collection before Nira Fashion House did.

24
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:43,567
You underestimate me, right?

25
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,700
Ideas float through the air.

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,007
My designer could have come up with them herself.

27
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:53,360
Come up with the same idea? That is unlikely.

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,320
You sent your people to steal the designs from my office, didn't you?

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,680
Be very careful.

30
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:04,340
That is slander, you know.

31
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,653
I have proof that Khun Cream designed this collection herself.

32
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:12,473
From the initial sketching process all the way through development,

33
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:15,667
all the documentation is properly dated and signed.

34
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,507
Well, I have proof of the same thing.

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,190
["Collage"]

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,593
Upon examination, the evidence is clear and credible enough.

37
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:42,740
Taking legal action against them would be difficult.

38
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,673
As for the dates... Khun Cream, what do you think?

39
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:53,613
Their first idea was created before I even started working here, Khun Tul.

40
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:56,060
I have no idea how that is possible.

41
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,580
Dates and timestamps can be altered.

42
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:07,400
How can I be sure you're not lying?

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,573
Then go and find the evidence.

44
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,213
Don't merely voice accusations.

45
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:19,900
However, I'll sue you for defamation if you don't have the evidence.

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,607
So what will it be, Tul?

47
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:24,459
Will you press charges against me,

48
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,253
risk your company's reputation, and lose a lot of money?

49
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:28,580
Go ahead.

50
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,340
Or will you just go back quietly,

51
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,480
and I'll forget you barged in here uninvited?

52
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,640
Tul.

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,860
I'm not seeing you out.

54
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:15,027
We have a high chance of losing the case.

55
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:19,887
Proving who designed the clothes first is quite difficult.

56
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:23,453
About the thief at the company during that day,

57
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:28,027
police still have no evidence connecting Khun Cindy's company to the break-in.

58
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:30,640
If you insist on pressing charges,

59
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,767
we could be countersued for defamation and for filing a false report.

60
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:39,220
Even if we win, it will take a long time in court.

61
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,907
And if we insist on launching the Jigsaw collection,

62
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,827
it probably won't be good for our company, Tul.

63
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:46,907
Indeed, especially since they publicly announced it before us.

64
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:49,273
It'll be hard to convince people otherwise.

65
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:52,320
We could end up getting crushed again.

66
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
I've transferred the remaining payment to you.

67
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:05,828
Thank you, Khun Cindy.

68
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:08,446
This time, you did well.

69
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:11,740
If you can get Tul to sell Dreamer to me,

70
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,080
I'll let you run the company.

71
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:38,491
Is it loose?

72
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:41,301
I'll take in the waist a little.

73
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:49,580
Let me see.

74
00:05:51,862 --> 00:05:54,038
Make it perfect, okay?

75
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:55,771
The P&Y event is this Friday.

76
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:59,819
Oh, it'll be perfect, don't worry. We have time.

77
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,463
Wait a second.

78
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,819
By the way, how is your Spring-Summer collection coming along?

79
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,968
It has to be even better than Jigsaw.

80
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:14,684
Since our designs were stolen, Khun Tul has been so stressed.

81
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:18,124
He hardly smiled before, but now his face is permanently grumpy.

82
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:20,493
When I see that, I just want to invite him dancing.

83
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:24,638
What?

84
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:28,522
Lately, you've been talking about Khun Tul a lot.

85
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,040
Are you starting to get into work like me?

86
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:33,900
Maybe.

87
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,830
- All done, right?
- Yes.

88
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,200
Then I'm going to change now.

89
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:45,140
Pose.

90
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,577
Beautiful! Today's models are gorgeous!

91
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:06,966
Now, let's meet the people behind this amazing show.

92
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:12,794
Representing P&Y Group, Khun Pirapon Cholasathien!

93
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:16,880
Thank you. But first of all,

94
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,070
please give a round of applause

95
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,530
to Tsuyu from Japan and Julie Wong from China.

96
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:31,170
These are the two Asian brands that have

97
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,870
successfully signed contracts to join P&Y Group.

98
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:35,770
As everyone knows,

99
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,350
P&Y is a fashion empire that brings together world-class brands under its name.

100
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,360
And this year, P&Y is looking to select a Thai brand

101
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,540
with global potential to join our group.

102
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,120
A Thai brand must make it to the world stage.

103
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,884
Thank you.

104
00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:05,962
- Thanks a lot.
- Sure.

105
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,080
Can we take a picture?

106
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,277
- Khun Cindy.
- Yes?

107
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:12,763
I like the Spring-Summer collection ad from Nira Fashion House very much.

108
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:15,871
How did you come up with the "Collage" concept?

109
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,423
My designer is talented.

110
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:24,410
If P&Y chooses us, you won't be disappointed.

111
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,970
I see.

112
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,368
What about Dreamer?

113
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,133
How's the Spring-Summer collection coming along?

114
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:35,168
Careful! You might fall behind competitors if you conceal it.

115
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:36,750
You don't have to worry about that, Khun Pete.

116
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,507
Dreamer operates with integrity.

117
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:42,693
Everything we produce will be good quality.

118
00:09:42,693 --> 00:09:45,022
Isn't that right, Naa Cindy?

119
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:49,442
Let's see if you can back that up, Khun Tul.

120
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:54,204
Because this collection will determine which brand will join P&Y.

121
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:58,638
But from what I can see, Nira Fashion House has the upper hand over Dreamer.

122
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:02,822
This might make my decision much easier, Khun Cindy.

123
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:05,571
- Thank you so much, Khun Pete.
- Sure.

124
00:10:06,349 --> 00:10:09,457
I'll take my leave now. Please excuse me.

125
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:12,420
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

126
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,772
I think Khun Pete was really trying to humiliate you.

127
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,480
Please excuse me.

128
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,678
Thank you so much.

129
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,971
Thank you.

130
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:57,560
What a perfect outfit, fitting for a designer who...

131
00:10:58,406 --> 00:10:59,853
Excuse me for a moment.

132
00:10:59,853 --> 00:11:01,540
I'll be right back.

133
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,720
It seems...

134
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,190
you have something to say to me.

135
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,760
I never thought you'd be this kind of person.

136
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:13,156
What kind of person?

137
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:16,890
Someone who doesn't respect potential partners for your company's future.

138
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,486
Oh, I was just being straightforward.

139
00:11:19,486 --> 00:11:20,867
"Straightforward"?

140
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:24,100
There's a fine line between being straightforward and being rude.

141
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,987
You purposely humiliated my boss in front of our competitors.

142
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,655
Someone in your position should know what is appropriate and what isn't.

143
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,570
You're a representative of P&Y,

144
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,150
but you already took sides before seeing the work.

145
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,905
That's not very professional.

146
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,406
Wow. You're defending him this much?

147
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:42,920
I don't like unfair things.

148
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,810
You do know who I am, right?

149
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,960
Yet you still dare to speak to me like this?

150
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,809
Aren't you afraid of having problems with me?

151
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,110
You should be smart enough

152
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,430
not to let personal bias affect your work.

153
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,682
Wow. Okay.

154
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,660
Then I give up.

155
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,530
How about this? After the event,

156
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,870
may I invite you for a drink to make up for my rude behavior?

157
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,486
No need.

158
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:08,520
Just don't do it again.

159
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:12,196
I knew you wouldn't dare.

160
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:17,404
Honestly, the first time I met you, you were way more interesting.

161
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,732
Hey.

162
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:38,400
We've been together for a long time now.

163
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,462
Promise me you won't lie to me this time.

164
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,272
Understand?

165
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,063
Not even a little bit.

166
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:01,200
[78 kg]

167
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,610
I lost 2 kilos!

168
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,744
Nice! This time, no lies.

169
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:15,411
Cake! Cake...

170
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:16,949
Cake, Cake!

171
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:18,523
Cake...

172
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:21,540
I lost weight.

173
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,876
Cake!
[Cake!]

174
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:27,760
I lost weight, 2 kilos finally.

175
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
[2 kilos finally]

176
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,715
Why hasn't the old text been read yet?

177
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:47,626
Is something wrong?

178
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:04,266
Did you invite me here to stare at me from a distance?

179
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:06,540
You look beautiful tonight.

180
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,073
Excuse me. She is my girlfriend.

181
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,180
Oh. Sorry, s-sorry...

182
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:55,129
You enjoy the party.

183
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:56,650
I'll wait at the bar.

184
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,130
Wait.

185
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:01,547
You just chased my dance partner away.

186
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:04,156
Now you have to take responsibility.

187
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:06,200
Ladies, come on.

188
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,421
Yes!

189
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,042
I'll say it again.

190
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,667
You look beautiful tonight.

191
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,670
Say something I don't already know.

192
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,402
I like you.

193
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:41,430
Did you already know?

194
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,289
I could guess.

195
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,500
But before you start liking me,

196
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,240
why don't we get to know each other better?

197
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,040
Sure.

198
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,707
Why did you go to work at P&Y?

199
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:02,838
I got my Master's degree in fashion in America.

200
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,994
Then I went to manage several brands under P&Y.

201
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:10,436
The CEO of P&Y liked my work, so he made me his assistant

202
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,057
and sent me to oversee the project here.

203
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:15,093
That's fast.

204
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:18,601
You're already the CEO's assistant after working just a few years.

205
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,127
It's been a bit exhausting.

206
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,080
I'm not like Ai Tul,

207
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,780
who had his mother's company waiting for him to manage after graduation.

208
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,899
And you?

209
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,403
What do you want to know?

210
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:34,583
A lot of things.

211
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:38,346
I think we should find a better place to talk, don't you?

212
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:40,360
Interesting.

213
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,691
- Hey...
- But not tonight.

214
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,084
It's late.

215
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:50,524
I'll head home now.

216
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,680
Drive safely.

Yes, Khun Tul?

00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,345
Hello, Khun Fresh?

223
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:50,464
Are you home?

224
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:52,839
I happened to be running errands near your place.

225
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:56,909
If you're free, how about we go eat at the buffet?

226
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,822
Well... I'm not free. I'm really busy right now.

227
00:18:03,846 --> 00:18:06,263
Sorry, Khun Tul.

228
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,360
Khun Tul?

229
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:18,270
Well, I'll ask you again some other time.

230
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,130
Dinner's ready.

231
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,460
Khun Tul, are you all right?

232
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,110
I'm just a bit stressed,

233
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,020
but it's fine. I'll deal with it.

234
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,974
Anyway, I won't bother you anymore.

235
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:37,773
That's all for now.

236
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,578
Khun Tul...

237
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,900
I can go and eat with you

238
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,320
but only for a short while, okay?

239
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,700
Sure.

240
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,758
I am parked near the minimart.

241
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,280
I'll wait for you in front.

242
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,855
See you, Khun Fresh.

243
00:18:57,855 --> 00:18:59,452
All right.

244
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:05,987
If Cake finds out, she'll be angry again.

00:19:05,987 --> 00:19:09,324
But... his voice didn't sound good, Bpaa Su.

246
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:12,320
I'll be quick.

247
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,150
Oh, dear.

248
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,310
Oh, Cream.

249
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,210
Cream, please listen to me.

250
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,937
I have to go.

251
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:25,480
She never listens to a thing I say.

252
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,580
My words mean nothing to her.

253
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,929
You're really organized, aren't you?

254
00:19:56,057 --> 00:20:00,600
Every time we eat together, you always line up the sauces like this.

255
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,137
It's not really about being organized.

256
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:07,964
But it helps keep our hands from getting in each other's way like this when we eat

257
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:11,915
since we're food lovers who enjoy delicious food and eat fast.

258
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:14,349
More importantly, it's a secret tip.

259
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:15,960
Want to know what it is?

260
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,057
- Here!
- Wow.

261
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:18,503
Oh, let me put it down first.

262

Here it comes again.

263
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,960
Let me have some, too.

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,069
A lot, please because... we paid for it!

265
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:32,175
Wow, that's a lot.

266
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,534
What's wrong, Khun Tul?

267
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:54,020
I just noticed that you look thinner lately.

268
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,421
Really? This part is starting to shrink, right?

269
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:03,930
But the thinner you get, the more you look like the person I mentioned before.

270
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,010
She's the new creative director at my company; her name is Cream.

271
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,939
But now...

272
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:26,497
Not so much anymore.

Hey! Why didn't you come to the class reunion?

- Come here.
- Ouch!

278
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:45,859
Oh! Ai Tul, what's wrong with you?

279
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:49,420
I just wanted to ask why you didn't come to the reunion.

00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:52,824
Hey, Ai Tul!

281
00:21:52,824 --> 00:21:56,065
Are you still angry with me? It was only a few hundred thousand baht.

282
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,756
The money isn't the problem.

283
00:21:57,756 --> 00:22:02,255
You told me your mom was sick, but you used the money to spoil some girl.

00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:04,640
You know I hate liars.

285
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:08,677
Yes, I'm sorry for lying to you.

286
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:11,200
I've already apologized to you so many times.

287
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,449
- Just leave.
- Just forgive me already.

288
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:14,990
Go away.

289
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,410
Fine, fine.

290
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,329
I'll leave.

291
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:19,829
See you around.

292
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:37,236
Khun Tul...

293
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:38,636
Yes?

294
00:22:39,712 --> 00:22:42,385
The truth is...

295
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:45,200
the Cream you met at the company...

296
00:22:48,057 --> 00:22:50,378
Her name is actually Cake.

297
00:22:50,926 --> 00:22:53,012
She's my twin sister.

298
00:22:53,012 --> 00:22:57,177
I asked her to take my place at work.

299
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:00,692
Then why didn't you tell me the truth?

300
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:03,140
You know I hate liars!

301
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:06,140
Khun Tul...

302
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,678
- Khun Tul...
- Khun Fresh?

303
00:23:11,394 --> 00:23:13,021
Khun Fresh?

304
00:23:14,396 --> 00:23:17,188
- Khun Fresh...
- Hey! I am so sorry, Khun Tul!

305
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,560
Sorry.

306
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,271
Are you okay?

307
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:29,288
I'm okay.

308
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:32,213
Oh, no!

309
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:34,651
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay, Khun Tul.

310
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:36,531
I'm heading to the bathroom.

311
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,880
Oh, okay.

312
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:50,040
Hey, Cream.

313
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,304
Cream? Cream! Cream!

314
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,775
- Goi?
- Yes!

315
00:23:57,775 --> 00:23:59,691
How have you been? It's been so long!

316
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:03,994
I saw you walking out of that barbecue place and just knew it was you!

317
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:07,048
Wait, have you lost weight?

318
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:08,280
How much did you lose?

319
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,780
Just a little.

320
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:14,077
Sorry, I have a call.

321
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,722
Hang on, I'll be right back so we can catch up.

322
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,224
I've missed you!

323
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,865
Just a second, okay?

324
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:25,960
If a chatterbox like Goi sees Khun Tul, she'll ruin everything.

325
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:34,118
Khun Tul, I-I'm full. Should we get the bill now?

326
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:36,368
But there's still so much left.

327
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:38,124
Yes. Look at my belly...

328
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:40,840
- There you are!
- Whoa!

329
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:43,960
Who's that?

330
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,720
He's handsome! Is he your boyfriend?

331
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,948
No, he's not!

332
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:49,197
- Hello there.
- Hello, hello.

333
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,368
I'm Goi, a friend of...

334
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:54,200
Wait a second.

335
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,621
Can you go sit at the table first? I'll come chat with you.

336
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,031
Why are you sending me away like this?

337
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:00,880
- That's not how you treat me.
- Let's just go!

338
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,556
- Who?
- Just give me some room.

339
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:04,460
Fine, fine.

340
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,754
Eat first, okay?

341
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:09,309
I'll go talk to my friend really quickly and be right back.

342
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:11,817
- Okay, hurry back.
- Okay.

343
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,710
Wow, you didn't even let me talk to your guy.

344
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,680
- Are you jealous or what?
- No.

345
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,091
He's not my guy. He's my relative.

346
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:26,541
And... he's suffering from depression.

347
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:29,007
Don't go talking to him.

348
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:32,061
I know a good doctor.

349
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:34,057
- I can recommend someone for him.
- No, no, no.

350
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:35,846
He already has a doctor.

351
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:38,802
He just doesn't really like talking to strangers.

352
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:41,772
All right, fine, I won't talk to him.

353
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:44,120
- I am heading off then.
- Okay.

354
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,127
Hey, Cre—

355
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:53,888
- Is your number still the same?
- Yes.

356
00:25:53,888 --> 00:25:56,749
- I'll call you; be sure to pick up.
- Sure, sure, okay.

357
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:58,198
No need to call my name anymore, right?

358
00:25:58,198 --> 00:26:01,086
- Okay.
- All right. Bye.

00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:10,710
I'm back, Bpaa.

360
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,836
Come on, come here, quickly.

361
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:15,725
The food is ready, Dear.

362
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:17,760
- Are you hungry?
- You didn't have to cook.

363
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,097
Wait. I just sold two apartments. I was planning to treat you to omakase.

364
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:23,922
I'm so happy for you, Dear. Is that true?

365
00:26:23,922 --> 00:26:25,305
- Yes.
- Let's go then.

366
00:26:25,305 --> 00:26:27,901
But it's okay; you've already made food.

367
00:26:27,901 --> 00:26:29,870
I'll go upstairs and call Cream to come eat with us.

368
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,149
Wait, wait, wait, Dear...

369
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:34,203
Your sister isn't here.

370
00:26:34,203 --> 00:26:36,160
Where did she go?

371
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:41,702
After eating barbecue,

372
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:43,941
are you feeling better now?

373
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:45,890
I do feel better.

374
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,834
And are you sure you don't want me to take you home, Khun Fresh?

375
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,350
It's fine.

376
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,780
In that case, I'll be heading off for my errands then.

377
00:26:59,145 --> 00:27:01,020
Khun... Khun Fresh?

378
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,154
- Yes?
- Did you forget something?

379
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:08,003
I don't think so.

380
00:27:13,286 --> 00:27:15,481
No, it's not mine.

381
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,767
Let me hold it for you.

382
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:36,745
You can listen to it while working.

383
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:39,520
So if there's a day I can't eat barbecue with you,

384
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,758
you'll have a way to relax.

385
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:51,813
Thank you. That's really sweet of you.

386
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,080
Cream...

387
00:28:40,747 --> 00:28:43,080
You went to see Khun Tul again, didn't you?

388
00:28:44,328 --> 00:28:47,759
Cake... I...

389
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,072
I'm sorry for breaking my promise.

390
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:56,090
This time, Khun Tul seemed really troubled.

391
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,060
I just felt sorry for him.

392
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,350
Stop making excuses.

393
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,620
Just admit it.

394
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,600
You care more about chasing him than about your secret being exposed.

395
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:09,232
Why do you have to be so angry?

396
00:29:09,232 --> 00:29:12,080
Because if you're worried about the secret getting out,

397
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,712
you don't have to be.

398
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,139
Khun Tul doesn't suspect anything at all.

399
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:19,202
I'm not worried. I'm possessive.

400
00:29:19,202 --> 00:29:21,840
I like Khun Tul.

401
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,766
Since when?

402
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:33,518
Since the first day I met him and started working in your place.

403
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:36,461
Khun Tul is exactly my type.

404
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:37,985
Really?

405
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,823
Yes.

406
00:29:39,823 --> 00:29:41,570
Why?

407
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:48,848
I like Khun Tul, too.

408
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:50,440
What?

409
00:29:51,383 --> 00:29:53,566
Then why didn't you ever tell me?

410
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:57,254
You always tell me everything, right?

411
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:00,090
Because this time, I was too scared to say it.

412
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,274
Cream, so what do we do now?

413
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:07,701
I like Khun Tul. Thus, I must keep moving forward.

414
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:12,051
But I met him before you.

415
00:30:12,051 --> 00:30:14,280
Are you saying you'll compete with me for him?

416
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,000
Here.

"Wonderful Slim, Chiang Mai"?
[Liposuction Surgery]

418
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:34,204
Go lose weight. Then hurry back to do your part at Dreamer.

419
00:30:34,204 --> 00:30:37,440
Let's see whom Khun Tul will choose between you and me.

420
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,500
And if I refuse to go?

421
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,200
If you don't go, I'll tell him you've been lying.

422
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,000
You know I'm really tired of doing all this.

423
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,500
And you also know how much he hates liars.

424
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:53,991
Fine.

425
00:30:53,991 --> 00:30:57,846
Within three months, I'll lose enough weight to be as slim as you.

426
00:30:57,846 --> 00:31:02,050
But if you still can't make him fall in love by then, you must step back.

427
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:06,269
Cream, it's been almost a month, yet you've lost only 4 kilograms.

428
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:10,057
If you want to be as slim as me, you need to lose another twenty.

429
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:12,385
By that time, I'll probably already be dating him.

430
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:14,956
If you're that confident, then accept my challenge.

431
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,990
All right.

432
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,600
If you come back and we aren't together,

433
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,300
I'll step back for you.

434
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,900
Deal.

435
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,800
Deal.

436
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,810
♫ You make me hot, hot, burning inside my heart ♫

437
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,160
♫ You fire me up until my heart just melts ♫

438
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,300
Do you really have to go all the way to Chiang Mai, Dear?

439
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,040
Yes, Bpaa.

440
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,800
It's a good idea to let the clinic help me lose weight and become beautiful.

441
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,700
I can slim down quickly, return beautiful, and give Cake her life back.

442
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,500
But I think you should just stop this crazy plan.

443
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,000
The more you lie, the worse things will get.

444
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,200
And look, you're spending so much money.

445
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,800
Can you really afford all of this?

446
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,960
I still have some of the prize money left from the competition, Bpaa.

447
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,860
Investing it in myself like this is the best use.

448
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,200
I know you're worried about me.

449
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,700
But when it comes to Khun Tul, I really can't back down anymore.

450
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,180
I'll come back beautiful.

451
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,533
Cake? She'll be nothing.

452
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,500
Are you sure you've checked everything properly?

453
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,200
Did you pack your asthma and allergy medicine?

454
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,000
Yes, I packed them already, Bpaa. Don't worry.

455
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:55,580
While I'm gone, make sure to sleep with Bpaa Su, okay?

456
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,253
Okay.

457
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:03,500
And also, don't worry about the company.

458
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,200
If anything happens, I'll call you right away.

459
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,600
Have a safe trip, Dear.

460
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:14,127
You can do it.

461
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,400
I'm off.

00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,833
Whoa!

467
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:52,560
Sorry.

468
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,760
Are you selling your apartment?

469
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:59,427
I'm selling it to move closer to the office.

470
00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:01,160
Oh.

471
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,846
Is there something you need, Moo?

472
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:05,900
I just brought the department's equipment requisition documents for you to sign.

473
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,600
Here you go.

475
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,200
Here you go.

476
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,393
I've been meaning to say this so many times.

477
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:22,100
Your signature is so beautiful!

478
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,520
Did you get a fortune teller to help you design it?

479
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,451
No. But if I do, I'll let you know.

480
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:30,120
Oh, thank you so much, P'Cream!

481
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,000
It's so gorgeous.

482
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,987
Khun Tul.

483
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:56,487
Do you have any plans after work today?

484
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,200
No. What's the matter?

485
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Well, there's this barbecue buffet place having a promotion: pay for one, get two.

486
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I thought maybe I could invite you to eat together.

487
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,600
A barbecue buffet?

488
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,150
Thank you for inviting me,

489
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:16,000
but I happen to have some business today, so I might not be available.

490
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,800
Maybe next time.

491
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,800
- That's all right.
- Pardon me, then.

492
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,500
I almost believed that you got the creative director position due to your talent.

493
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,200
Jealous?

494
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,673
You tried but didn't get any attention, right?

495
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,200
- I don't downgrade myself like that.
- Oh?

496
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,800
And what you're doing now seems really dignified.

497
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,400
You know, instead of wasting your time trying to tear others down,

498
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,800
why not focus on coming up with good ideas?

499
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,700
Maybe then you'd get promoted too.

500
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:51,080
Is this really the Khun Cream I know?

501
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,207
Why do you seem so down today?

502
00:36:53,207 --> 00:36:56,240
If you're here to bother me, just go.

503
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,518
I want to be alone.

Excuse me, Nong*.

Sorry, could you help by sitting and chatting with me?

509
00:37:20,513 --> 00:37:24,600
You see, she's not talking to me, and I'm lonely.

510
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,760
- Please?
- You'd better go. He's drunk.

511
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,486
Yes, Ma'am.

512
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,700
What are you doing?

513
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,500
Well, you wouldn't talk to me, so I got lonely.

514
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,800
You said you were going to cheer me up.

515
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,100
I made you stop feeling down and got you irritated with me instead.

516
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,600
See?

517
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,200
Let me tell you something, Khun Pete.

518
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,300
You are not the kind of man I'm looking for.

519
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,200
I'm looking for someone who already has everything.

520
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,400
You're still building.

521
00:38:04,727 --> 00:38:06,747
You're good...

522
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,300
but not good enough.

523
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,780
Not here. One thing you need to know:

524
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,600
I'm the one who controls the game.

525
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,200
Your place looks beautiful.

526
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,400
One thing you should know:

00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,600
I control the game.

- Yes, it's fine.

If you need anything or something's missing, feel free to let me know.

530
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,200
Yes.

531
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,400
This area here is the treatment room.

532
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,000
In our program,

533
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,400
