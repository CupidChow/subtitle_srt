00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,533
Khun Cream, would you like some coffee?

3
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,980
- Oh, I-I...
- No need.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,460
What would you like, Khun Cream?

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,067
Americano, no sugar, please.

6
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,473
Don't you usually like it sweet?

7
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:30,413
The Doctor... The doctor recommended I cut back on sugar.

8
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:34,420
Wow, that's good to hear.

9
00:00:38,153 --> 00:00:40,860
One hot Americano, no sugar.

12
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,870
It's kind of cold so I feel a little chilly.

13
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,987
But you're sweating a lot.

14
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:02,207

15
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:03,567
Come here.

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,660
- It's okay now.
- All right.

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:27,100
I guess my body's still adjusting after being discharged.

18
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:30,213
So you wanted to talk about the fitting day, right?

19
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:32,280
Yes.

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,747
On that day, I want everything kept completely confidential.

21
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:39,273
So I'd like to know, how do you plan to manage it?

22
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:41,894
I've thought it through. Here's the plan.

23
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:46,613
On that day, I will instruct everyone no phones allowed in the fitting room.

24
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:49,480
Models will be split into three groups, one hour per group.

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,540
Each model will be accompanied by a pattern maker and a designer.

26
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,560
If there are any issues with the outfits,

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,907
I'll send them for immediate alteration so it'll be ready in time for the show.

You're smiling. What is it?

You've changed.

30
00:02:15,347 --> 00:02:17,560
Usually when I ask you something,

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,880
you either say you'll think about it or get back to me later, but today...

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,200
you... answered right away.

33
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,400
Maybe while I was lying in the hospital, I had too much free time

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,173
so I prepped a lot of work.

35
00:02:36,173 --> 00:02:37,927
I see.

36
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:44,440
And when I had the accident, my phone broke,

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,930
so I haven't had time to sort out my old number yet.

38
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,150
So I just got a new SIM card.

39
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:55,868

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,520
- Khun Cream.
- Yes?

43
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:17,280
Khun Pete is the assistant CEO of P&Y.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,120
But he doesn't get along with Khun Tul. They've been rivals since their school days.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,160
But Khun Pete also has a say in deciding which Thai brands get into P&Y.

46
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,220
Then Khun Tul's under a lot of pressure.

47
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,093
Not only does he have to compete with Nira Fashion House,

48
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:35,467
but he also has to win over a competitor like Khun Pete, right?

49
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,127
Yes.

50
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:39,840
Oh, Khun Pete, hello.

51
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,947
I just heard you were in an accident.

52
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:43,513
Was it serious?

53
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:45,480
I'm better now.

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,327
You're okay, though, right?

55
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,840
Yes, I'm all right now.

56
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,613
Oh, you seem different.

57
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,353
You're not hurt here, are you?

58
00:03:56,353 --> 00:04:00,640
Well, actually, after the accident,

59
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,567
some of my memory might not be the same.

60
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:08,540
Oh, wait, wait, wait. You didn't forget about us, did you?

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,100
- Us?
- Yes.

62
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,573
Were you here to see someone? I can go get them.

63
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:23,567
I came to see you. I missed you, and I was worried.

64
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,560
- "Worried'?
- Yes.

65
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,320
Then how come I couldn't reach you?

66
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,993
I messaged and called, but your phone was off.

67
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:34,760
When the accident happened, my phone got wrecked.

68
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,690
So I had to get a new number.

69
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,687
Then can I get your new number?

70
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:40,593

What are you doing here?

76
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:11,760
Obviously, I'm talking business with Khun Cream.

77
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,880
Do I have to report to the company president or something?

78

81
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,460

82

00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,680

00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:18,700
I think he came specifically to see you.

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,187

180
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:38,380
All right, let's hear the brief from KhunCream.

181
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:40,700
Honestly, everyone walks beautifully.

182
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,090
I'm not worried about your experience.

183
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:46,460
But this collection is called Memories.

184
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,593
It's about good memories.

185
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:50,587
You all represent our customers.

186
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:54,007
And when they wear these clothes, I want them to feel joy.

187
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,100
So I'd like you to add more smiles

188
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,513
and carry the belief that every piece we wear is part of a beautiful memory.

189
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:01,640
All right, let's do one more round.

190
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,150
- Got it.
- Thank you. Let's go.

191
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,780
Let's go! Go, go, go! This time-smile.

192
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,833
Smile. A soft one.

193
00:14:25,787 --> 00:14:29,720
When I see a customer smile while wearing something I made,

194
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,840
it makes me so happy, Tul.

195
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,760
If our clothes bring people joy,

196
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,570
that joy multiplies for the ones who create it.

197
00:14:52,873 --> 00:14:55,080
Why are you grinning so much?

198
00:14:58,487 --> 00:14:59,900
Well?

199
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:22,080
You didn't went home yet?

200
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:24,147
Not yet.

201
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:27,720
I wanted to make an adjustment to the finale piece.

202
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:31,320
What about you, Khun Tul? Are you not going home yet?

203
00:15:32,187 --> 00:15:34,800
I'm just checking to make sure everything's in order.

204
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,700
So why are you fixing it yourself?

205
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,427
You could've asked the team to help.

206
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:44,947
I just felt like something was missing

207
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:47,107
so I wanted to try it myself.

208
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,360
Want to try it on?

209
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:56,640
I can help see what's still off.

210
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,340
A dress only looks complete when it's on a hanger.

211
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,887
But I don't think I'm a very good hanger.

212
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,840
I disagree, Khun Cream.

213
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,760
Try it on.

214
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,640
Khun Tul...

215
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:56,107
Here, let me help you.

216
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:57,720
Thank you.

217
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,960
Thanks.

218
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,720
Now do you believe me?

219
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,787
That the dress becomes complete only when it's on a hanger.

220
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:19,980
Wait, is the mic still on the speakers?

221
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:46,020
I'm okay now. Thank you.

222
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,220
You've surprised me in a few different ways.

223
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,722
Oh?

224
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:57,340
At the office, you were already such a capable leader.

225
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,607
But I never realized how passionate you were.

226
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:04,980
Now, I see you really love this, and you're having fun with it.

227
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,913
Everything'll turn out amazing.

228
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:12,927
Thank you.

229
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:17,273
Though I still wonder if it'll be enough for P&Y.

230
00:18:19,107 --> 00:18:22,253
When you briefed the models during the run-through,

231
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:24,933
telling them to think about the joy of the wearer...

232
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:29,340
If that's what you believe, then it's more than enough.

233
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:33,593
Thank you.

234
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,600
I'm going to go change now.

235
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,113
Oh, sure.0

236
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,160
This venue looks great, Ai Tul.

237
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,167
Now I'm curious to see this new collection of yours.

238
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,560
Don't worry, Ai Pete.

239
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,833
This collection will get Dreamer into the P&Y brand family.

240
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,273
I love your confidence.

241
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,113
And Khun Cream is backstage, isn't she?

242
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:37,567
Yes.

243
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,940
But I don't think you should go in right now.

244
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,960
She needs to focus.

245
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,860
Yes, I get that.

246
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,060
We'll see each other after the show anyway.

247
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:51,180
This wine's really good. Have you tried it?

248
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,727
Excuse me for a bit.

249
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,093
This show is unmissable, Khun Cindy.

250
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,400
Oh, fabulous! Fabulous!

251
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,000
P'Cream! The guests have started arriving.

252
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,520
The show starts in about 15 minutes.

253
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,753
Let's pick up the pace, everyone!

254
00:20:24,753 --> 00:20:27,507
Please get the models ready to standby in 15 minutes.

255
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:29,447
- Okay, P'Cream!
- Let's move faster.

256
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:31,487
- A bit faster.
- Hey!

257
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:33,787
- I really like this version of P'Cream.
- Indeed.

258
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:35,827
She looks very professional.

259
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:38,553
Active, sharp, and ready to work.

260
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:40,313
- Oh my!
- Oh no!

261
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:42,960
- P'Cream.
- What's the matter, Moo?

262
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,560
The beads fell off.

263
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,913
Look, P'Cream!

264
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,573
They must've come off during transport.

265
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,380
What should we do?

266
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,260
Let me see.

267
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,900
I can stitch it back in five minutes.

268
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,920
You go run the rest of the show. There's barely any time left.

269
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,800
This collection is just as important to me as it is to you.

270
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,840
But don't mess it up.

271
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,593
Okay, everyone, let's keep going.

272
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:17,673
- Let's go. Got it.
-Okay.

273
00:21:17,673 --> 00:21:21,107
Everyone! Ten minutes left. First group of models, please stand by.

274
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:24,240
Let's go. Please double-check everything.

275
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,327
Let's prepare.

276
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,207
I'll handle this part. Go check the others.

277
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:30,427
Don't forget to take out the clips.

278
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,820
Hey, Pae. Where are you?

279
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,493
I'm already inside.

280
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:41,340
Once the show starts. Follow the plan.

281
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,927
Got it.

282
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,920
[Electrical Room]

283
00:22:58,633 --> 00:22:59,967
- Just a second.
- Ready, everyone.

284
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:02,080
It's the last.

285
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,620
- Go now, Sweetie.
- Go on, good luck!

286
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,480
[Danger: High Voltage]

287
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,793
- Why did the lights go out?
- What?

288
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,967
We lost power. The cause is unknown.

289
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,400
Hello?

290
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:41,767
Eak, get out now.

291
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:43,460
Gong, check what's going on.

292
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,447
Okay, I'll look into it.

293
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,894
P'Cream, we only had the finale look left. It was the last outfit.

294
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:03,447
- Oh no!
- Is this really how our show ends, Phi?

295
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:05,767
- No way.
- What do we do?

296
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:08,880
- It's pitch black!
- I won't let it end like this.

297
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,120
[Electrical Room]

298
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,207
Hey, P'Sin!

299
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:15,373
P'Sin?

300
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:17,440
P'Sin, are you okay, Phi?

301
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,940
Heading to the power room.

302
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,747
Why's the power out?

303
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:26,573
Check on Sin.

304
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:29,367
- He's passed out! Someone help!
- Wait.

305
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:32,620
Aren't you going to help?

306
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:36,353
Have they fixed it? What's the status?

307
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:38,500
I had to check something outside.

308
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,540
Sorry!

309
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:26,587
Did Gong call back? Any news on the outage?

310
00:25:26,587 --> 00:25:28,280
Not yet.

311
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:33,760
I found out someone sabotaged the main power control system.

312
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,233
Even the backup generator isn't working.

313
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,920
What?

314
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:43,140
It's over, Tul. The whole thing's ruined.

315
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,460
I think we should cancel the event.

316
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,920
What?

317
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,760
Trust me.

318
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:54,080
Otherwise it'll get even more chaotic.

319
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:26,040
Everyone, can I ask you all to help me?

320
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:33,820
Everyone...

321
00:26:40,173 --> 00:26:44,193
Please take out your phones and point the flashlight toward the runway.

322
00:26:44,193 --> 00:26:49,220
Let's all be part of the finale show for the Memories collection.

323
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,527
Can you hold this?

324
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:31,640
Thank you. Thank you so much.

325
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:11,040
Ai Tul, I've got the team taking care of the guests. Don't worry.

326
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,420
Did you find the culprit?

327
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,433
We haven't reviewed the footage yet.

328
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:19,487
And the people who fainted and the staff, none of them saw the attacker.

329
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:27,300
Why does this feel exactly like when someone broke into our office?

330
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,793
Or do you think... Could it be Khun Cindy?

331
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,927
Right?

332
00:29:38,353 --> 00:29:40,080
Could be.

333
00:29:41,353 --> 00:29:43,310
If they pulled off something like this,

334
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,873
they definitely had help from someone inside.

335
00:29:45,873 --> 00:29:47,360
Yes...

336
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,960
That last look was perfection.

337
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,713
Anyway, I'll take my leave now.

338
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:01,660
- Sure, thank you. Thanks.
- See you soon.

339
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,187
Khun Cream.

340
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:07,773
Congratulations on turning this disaster into a success.

341
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,520
You were so quick to react. It's seriously impressive.

342
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,027
- Thank you.
- Khun Cream.

343
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,493
What were you two talking about?

344
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,280
Khun Cream, thank you so much for everything today.

345
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,433
I really mean it. Thank you.

346
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:26,453
Thank you so much, Khun Tul.

347
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:29,787
Cream, now that the event's done, how about we go hang out?

348
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:36,593
It's been a long day. I think I need to rest.

349
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:38,607
Wait, are you serious right now?

350
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:41,347
You? Tired and wanting to rest?

351
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:42,847
Well...

352
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:45,240
Yes.

353
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,660
Please excuse me.

354
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,440
- Of course. Take care.
- Thanks.

355
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,627
Khun Cream.

356
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,260
So that's it, isn't it? I've been dumped.

357
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,120
You're seeing Tul now, aren't you?

358
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,367
The way you've been acting around me, it's different.

359
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:21,560
It's obvious now.

360
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,907
You're together with him.

361
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:25,080
Gosh... it's

362
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,980
Okay, Khun Cream.

363
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,693
I'm sorry.

364
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,747
But I never thought of you as just a friend with benefits.

365
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:35,080
I know you like Ai Tul.

366
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,340
But can you at least be fair with me?

367
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,107
Let me fight for you.

368
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,140
Be my girlfriend.

369
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,753
Hey! Hey!

370
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,540
Sorry.

371
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,580
Excuse me.

372
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,260
Khun Cream!

373
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:18,693
- Bpaa!
- Yes, you're back, Dear?

374
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:20,167
Not asleep yet?

375
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:24,780
No. I wanted to hear how your fashion show went.

376
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,913
It was almost a disaster, Bpaa Su.

377
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:28,610
But luckily, it worked.

378
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,620
I solved the problem just in time.

379
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,593
My smart girl!

380
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:37,067
A lot of people love it! I'm so happy, Bpaa.

381
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:39,407
And I'm so proud of you.

382
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:41,373
You did great, Sweetie.

383
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:43,247
What are you doing?

384
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:46,333
Oh, the doctor said Cake's condition is stable now.

385
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:50,320
They're going to let us bring her home to care for her.

386
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:53,647
Really, Bpaa?

387
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:54,907
That's such good news!

388
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:56,760
What can I do to help?

389
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,747
Come help me set up her bed, come on.

390
00:32:58,747 --> 00:33:00,693
- Here?
- Yes.

391
00:33:00,693 --> 00:33:02,773

your Dreamer supporters, and those who love this collection?

395
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,320
Thank you so much to everyone

396
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,876
for the amazing response to the Memories collection.

397
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:27,353
I hope it becomes an inspiration to all of you.

398
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:29,840

Thank you so much for rushing over like that.

408
00:34:22,153 --> 00:34:25,387
No problem. I wasn't scheduled for a shift tonight.

409
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:27,587
And don't worry about the payment for caring for P'Cake.

410
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:30,427
I'll make sure you get compensated like any other patient.

411
00:34:30,427 --> 00:34:34,193
It's really fine, P'Cream. She is like a big sister to me too.

412
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:36,787
Even my mom told me to take extra good care of her.

413
00:34:36,787 --> 00:34:38,920
Thank you so much, Kaew and Bpaa Khing too.

414
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,147
Of course.

415
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:44,240
But about keeping it a secret that she's at home...

416
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,800
I'm not very good at lying.

I don't want to get you in trouble.

418
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:51,647
If anyone asks, just avoid answering. That way you're not lying.

419
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:53,213
Okay.

420
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:58,300
She will take good care of you, Cake.

421
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:03,793
Dreamer did really well with this Spring-Summer great sales and reception.

422
00:35:03,793 --> 00:35:06,200
But I don't think we should rush our decision.

423
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,230
Even though Dreamer won this season,

424
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,280
Nira Fashion House has consistently delivered in the past.

425
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,080
Exactly.

426
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,733
We can't make a billion-baht decision based on just one collection.

427
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,973
But Head Office is pressuring me already.

428
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:26,120
If we don't judge based on this collection, what else can we go by?

429
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:29,707
Well, I have a proposal.

430
00:35:36,273 --> 00:35:38,220
- Cheers!
- Thank you so much!

00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,100

Hey.

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,233
Tul.

00:36:24,073 --> 00:36:25,710
What are you doing sitting here?

436
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,290
Everyone's celebrating inside.

437
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:33,053
I'm just relieved. Our collection made a profit.

438
00:36:33,053 --> 00:36:35,833
The board can't push Pemika anymore.

439
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:39,220
And from now on, our Khun Cream will finally become

440
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,860
our full Creative Director.

441
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:48,080
Which means our chance of joining P&Y

442
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,500
is right within reach now.

443
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,660
Hey!

444
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,250
This is supposed to be a celebration.

445
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,560
Why are you sitting here all serious? What's going on?

446
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,607
I really don't want my suspicions to be true.

447
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,213
You saw it, right?

448
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:07,327
I just can't imagine who would dare betray our company.

449
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:09,533
When it comes to money, anything's possible.

450
00:37:09,533 --> 00:37:13,053
Whoever did this probably got paid off by Khun Cindy.

451
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:19,500
But... If you really think it's an inside job,

452
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,440
who do you think it is?

453
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:26,820
I honestly don't know.

454
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,693
Well... And where's P'Wasin anyway?

455
00:37:33,693 --> 00:37:36,730
Oh yes, he said his wife was dizzy or something,

456
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,040
so he canceled and didn't come to the party.

457
00:37:43,353 --> 00:37:46,900
Well dude, come on. We should be enjoying ourselves.

458
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,200
This is a time of happiness.

459
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,513
A time to celebrate.

460
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:57,807
We should be glad we finally beat Nira Fashion House for the first time in years.

461
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,433
- True.
- Let's celebrate.

462
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:00,907
- Celebrate.
- Let's celebrate.

463
00:38:00,907 --> 00:38:02,727
Let's raise our glasses.

464
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:09,093
Tonight, we drink to the Best Creative Director of Dreamer, Khun Cream!

465
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,200
Bottoms up, Girl. Come on, bottom up!

466
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,200
- Khun Cream, can you go to the restroom with me?
- I don't need to go.

467
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,400
But I do. I really need to go.

468
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,800
I really need you to come with me.

469
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,200
Oh girl, Ai Cream.

470
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,000
Come on. That was tequila just now. Not water.

471
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,700
When you're drunk, you keep on yapping. What if the truth comes out?

472
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,800
I'm not drunk.

473
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,600
Didn't you say Cake always drinks every round at company parties?

474
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,000
Well, I'm trying to make it convincing.

475
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,300
"Actress?"

476
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,000
Look at yourself. Do you really think you look like Cake?

477
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,360
I'm not drunk, okay?

478
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,055
I took a B-complex vitamin. 13 kinds!

479
00:38:55,055 --> 00:38:58,347
It keeps me fresh all night. No drunkenness.

480
00:38:58,347 --> 00:39:01,193
You better go back before people start getting suspicious.

481
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,400
How about take some now?

482
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,000
- Whoa!
- Yes, I am going.

483
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,400
Afterward, I will be as fresh as ever.

484
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,000
Yes, Officer?

485
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,800
- Where's the next shot?
- Well?

486
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,400
You're so very happy, aren't you? Stealing the spotlight all for yourself.

487
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,193
You're drunk.

488
00:39:33,193 --> 00:39:35,560
I've been working under P'Ben, putting up with everything.

489
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,387
Even though I never liked him.

490
00:39:37,387 --> 00:39:39,710
All because I hoped one day Khun Tul would see my value,

491
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,180
and choose me to be the Creative Director.

492
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,213
- But you...
- Enough.

493
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,100
Hey, come here.

494
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,400
Where are you going?

495
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,100
I can't do this anymore.

496
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,800
You can't? It should've been me.

497
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,100
I'm the one who deserves to be Creative Director.

498
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,500
Not you. Got it? Do you understand?

499
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,520
I can't hold it anymore!

500
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,120
Min.

501
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,400
Did you just throw up?

502
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,200
Khun Cream, it's better if you wait outside.

503
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,300
Go clean yourself up a bit.

504
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,100
Are you okay, Cream?

505
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:49,627
- Khun Cream.
- I will take care of it.

506
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:51,040
- It's fine, really.
- Got it.

507
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,720
Careful, careful.

508
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,120
Watch your head.

509
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,153
Ouch, ouch. Slowly, please!

510
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:07,653
Slowly please.

511
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,300
Sorry.

512
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,800
Hey, Khun Cream, where do you live?

513
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,900
Same place as always.

514
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,200
And where is that?

515
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,800
Ladprao, Soi 15... you know.

516
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,100
Ladprao...

517
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:31,627
Ladprao 15.

518
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:32,807
So then what?

519
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:34,207
Right there.

520
00:41:34,207 --> 00:41:38,807
When you get there, you'll see this cute little minimart.

521
00:41:38,807 --> 00:41:41,940
Then you turn right, and then turn left,

522
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,290
and then you'll see my house.

523
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,627
Wait, so is it right or left?

524
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:50,200
Turn right, then left...

525
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,180
Just go.

526
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:55,660
Sir, what do we do?

527
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,200
Just follow her instructions.

528
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,700
Got it.

529
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,200
Khun Cream, your phone.

530
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,600
Your phone is ringing.

531
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,300
Answer it for me.

532
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,900
Okay, I'm picking it up.

533
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,000
Hello?

534
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,400
Cream, where are you? Passed out drunk already?

535
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,800
It's me.

536
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,200
Khun Tul!

537
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,393
Why are you answering Cream's phone?

538
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:43,100
Well...She's really drunk.

539
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,300
I'm taking her home.

540
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,600
Whose home?

541
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,200
Her home, of course.

542
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,200
I got the address already. Don't worry.

543
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,500
Once I've dropped her off, I'll head back to the event.

544
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,000
See you there.

545
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,800
Oh my god. They totally hooked up.

546
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,700
Cream's house?

547
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,400
Wine, get a grip. Pull yourself together.

548
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,800
Who... Who should I call?

549
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,600
Bpaa Su!

550
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,100
Battery is dead.

551
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,700
Anyone with a charger?

552
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,500
- Boy scout!
- No!

553
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:34,200
- Boy scout!
- Do good for the community!

554
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,300
Stop it! Does anyone have a spare charger?

555
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,200
She means a power bank.

556
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,000
Oh! I've got one!

557
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,320
[Minimart]

558
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,400
We're here now.

559
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,800
This is your house.

560
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,600
Cream.

561
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,900
It's completely dark...

562
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,380
Khun Cream, do you have your house key?

563
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,889
Key...

564
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,200
Pink.

565
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,100
The pink one.

566
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,800
Okay, I'll open your bag then.

567
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:46,907
Pink...

568
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,887
Khun Cream...

569
00:44:57,307 --> 00:44:58,600
Are you okay?

570
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,193
- I'm fine.
- If not, let me help you.

571
00:45:00,193 --> 00:45:02,740
No need. I can walk.

572
00:45:03,307 --> 00:45:04,788
Careful.

573
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:06,780
Careful, careful, careful.

574
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,800
I'm fine, I can walk.

575
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,000
Careful. Easy there.

576
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,800
Let me help you, okay?

577
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,000
Hang on a second...

578
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,100
Got it open. Come on in.

579
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,400
Yes it's unlocked.

580
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,500
You're in the way...

581
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,400
Here, have a seat.

582
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,200
- One step forward, three steps back.
- This way.

583
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,300
Did you hurt yourself?

584
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,900
Are you okay?

585
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,900
Hey... hey, Khun Tul!

586
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,800
What?

587
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,100
How did you get in here? Well?

588
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,200
Well, you were drunk, so I brought you home.

589
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,800
And, you gave me your key, remember?

590
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,300
- I did?
- I'll turn on the lights.

591
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,400
Hey! Don't go further. Don't.

592
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,600
How are we supposed to see anything if the lights are off?

593
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,270
No need to see.

594
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:50,100
What?

595
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,000
There's nothing you need to see.

596
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:59,447
Hey, hey, hey... Wait, hold on. Just a sec.

597
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,960
Hey!

598
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,620
Where are you going?

599
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,600
Hold on, I'll get you some water.

600
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,800
Wait. It's okay.

601
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,300
Okay, if you say so.

602
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,000
Gosh, Cream, Sweetie?

603
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

604
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,400
You're Fresh's aunt?

605
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,000
Yes, nice to meet you.

606
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,200
I'm...

607
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,800
- Fresh's aunt.
- Fresh's aunt.

608
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,100
Right...

609
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,700
Hello, Bpaa.

610
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,600
Hello there.
