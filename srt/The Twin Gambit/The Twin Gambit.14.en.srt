1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:01,705
Let's go find Tul.

2
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:02,804
Go.

3
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,077
They're gone.

4
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:15,263
Quiet.

5
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:19,267
Take her.

6
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:28,830
- Stop! Police!
- Hey! Back off! Hurry!

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,493
- Where are you going?
- Stop! Put the gun down!

8
00:00:30,493 --> 00:00:32,297
Drop your weapon.

9
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:33,162
- Put it down!
- Come here.

10
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:34,565
Put it down!

11
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:37,063
I said drop it!

12
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:37,759
- Now!
- Drop it!

13
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,799
- On your knees!
- Now!

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,122
Take them in.

15
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:46,534
Get down!

16
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:49,335
Don't resist. Stay still.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,560
[Police]

18
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:21,853
Once Cindy found out the truth from Pae,
she pretended to let him go.

19
00:01:21,853 --> 00:01:24,411
Then she had someone kill him to silence him.

20
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:26,546
I was with her when it happened.

21
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:28,851
I heard everything.

22
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:31,349
I need to inform you first.

23
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,000
Knowing everything from the beginning,

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,386
but still working with Cindy
without notifying the police,

25
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:40,799
it means you were complicit.

26
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,910
It's a charge of premeditated murder
as an accomplice.

27
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:49,117
But if your testimony helps the case,
the court may consider reducing your sentence.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,781
And how serious is the punishment?
What's the maximum?

29
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,945
The highest penalty is the death sentence.

30
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:06,887
But the more useful your testimony
is to the investigation,

31
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:10,187
the more likely the court
will lessen your sentence.

32
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,852
Okay, okay.

33
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:16,758
I'll tell you everything.

34
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:19,600
About the arson. About the illegal workers.

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,080
There are other things too
that Cindy's been hiding.

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,153
I'll take you to all of it.

37
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:28,073
Just please make sure she can't hurt me.

38
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:47,137
Please open this room.

39
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:54,707
- Is there another room over there?
- Yes, sir.

40
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,952
Open it.

41
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:30,749
I'm okay.

42
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:37,368
I just want Mom to hear it from me
before it hits the news.

43
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:42,948
I'm sorry, Mom. For disappointing you.

44
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,562
I'll see you soon.

45
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:18,485
Min.

46
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:36,723
Tul.

47
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,692
I'm sorry for everything.

48
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:45,711
I have no excuse.

49
00:04:47,302 --> 00:04:49,714
Thank you too.

50
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:52,010
Thank you for agreeing to testify.

51
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,932
You did the right thing.

52
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:55,859
Coming forward like this.

53
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:58,614
It's your chance to start again.

54
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:11,060
But the one I really owe an apology to, is you.

55
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:19,087
I did everything I could
to steal the Creative Director position from you.

56
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,973
But in the end, I realized I could never beat you.

57
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:29,951
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:48,738
Stay strong, Min.

59
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:52,724
I believe in you.

60
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:54,943
You'll get through this.

61
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:23,263
I am here.

62
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,840
Cindy slipped out before the police got to her.

63
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:29,204
Unbelievable.

64
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:32,254
She's probably out of the country by now.

65
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:35,948
I think she knows there's no way out of this.

66
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:38,123
The evidence is overwhelming.

67
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:40,512
It's alright.

68
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:42,819
The police are tracking her down as we speak.

69
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:47,882
And thank you.

70
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:50,262
For helping us take Cindy down.

71
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:54,798
Congratulations, Tul.

72
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:58,266
From now on, nothing can hold Dreamer back.

73
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:59,480
That's great.

74
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,660
Now you can finally wrap up
the Paris Fashion Week project.

75
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:13,422
Anyway, I'll excuse myself now.

76
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:14,960
Take care.

77
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,484
See you.

78
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:18,251
Watch over the office for me.

79
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:25,443
Cream.

80
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:27,330
When do you leave for Paris?

81
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,596
Next week.

82
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,450
So after that,
you're really not coming back to work, huh?

83
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,080
That's a bit hard to swallow.

84
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,521
Dreamer won't be the same without you.

85
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:43,986
What if you just don't quit?

86
00:07:45,193 --> 00:07:50,985
I feel the same way,
but I honestly think this is for the best.

87
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,573
Come on in.

88
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:20,800
Cake.

89
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,160
I thought you took your meds
and went to bed already.

90
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,512
I just finished a work call.

91
00:08:25,512 --> 00:08:26,767
And you?

92
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,325
Still up?

93
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,399
Just overthinking stuff.

94
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:44,908
You'll be in Paris for two whole weeks.

95
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:49,176
Maybe you can find a chance to talk to Tul,
and patch things up?

96
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,236
I don't know what's waiting for me over there.
I don't know if I'll even get the chance.

97
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:02,016
But still, wouldn't it be better to at least try,
than regret not doing anything?

98
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:04,976
This could be your last shot.

99
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,408
Yeah.

100
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:16,973
I'll try to find the right moment.

101
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:21,688
And...

102
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,996
What about you and Pete? How's that going?

103
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:30,209
Well, I don't really know where it's going.

104
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:34,314
But I did meet his mom already.

105
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,429
Are you serious?

106
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:42,217
That's lightning speed!

107
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:43,432
Did she like you?

108
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,727
You'll have to ask her that yourself.

109
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,204
But yeah...

110
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:50,337
Pete and I are officially together now.

111
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:51,918
Wait, really?

112
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:57,561
I'm so happy for you!

113
00:09:57,561 --> 00:10:00,304
Thank you.

114
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:03,658
What you said to me that day.
It really got through to me.

115
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:06,692
I figured why not give it a try?
What did I have to lose?

116
00:10:06,692 --> 00:10:09,751
And you don't give up just yet.

117
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:14,429
I still believe there's a way for you and Tul
to get back to what you had.

118
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:04,046
Cheers!

119
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,719
That was fun!

120
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:22,471
Cream.

121
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:24,003
Congratulations.

122
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:26,392
You've done it.

123
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:29,148
Thank you.

124
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:34,058
Thank you so much to Dreamer
for helping me get to this moment.

125
00:12:35,702 --> 00:12:37,900
Thank you too.

126
00:12:44,952 --> 00:12:47,002
- Tul, Cream.
- Huh?

127
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:48,740
There's news about Cindy.

128
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:54,760
We've just received updates on Sasithorn,

129
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,400
also known as Cindy, owner of Nira Fashion House.
[Nira Fashion House CEO flees across border]

130
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,705
She's a suspect in the abuse of migrant workers

131
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:03,885
as well as several other serious charges.

132
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:07,148
Right now, she's believed to be hiding
in Betong district, Yala Province,

133
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:11,148
and authorities suspect
she's planning to flee the country.

134
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:15,819
As soon as she's apprehended,
we'll report further updates.

135
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,040
[Dreamer's second-generation heir
takes the lead in a bold new vision.]

136
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:37,400
That's such a shame.

137
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,128
I really thought
you'd have a proper talk with Tul by now.

138
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:44,234
If it were me, I'd drag him under the Eiffel Tower
and make him talk it out.

139
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:45,560
Honestly, the fact that he stuck it out

140
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,496
and worked with me
all the way through Paris Fashion Week.

141
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:49,281
That alone means a lot.

142
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:55,931
Cake...

143
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:58,525
Have you been doing any treatments lately?

144
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:00,450
Your hair's super dry.

145
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,819
Here, take this. You can use it at home.

146
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:10,234
My hair was fried too, and after just one mask,
it looked amazing.

147
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:11,425
Really?

148
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:12,460
Yup.

149
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:18,647
Thanks, girl.

150
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:20,878
I'm off to mask my hair.

151
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,080
[Dreamer]

152
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:30,972
Cheers!

153
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,969
Cheers!

154
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:35,440
A big thank-you

155
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,716
to our president
and our incredible creative director!

156
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:42,550
For bringing Dreamer to where it is today.

157
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,972
Merci beaucoup.

158
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:46,805
Salute!

159
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:48,458
Ooh, very international!

160
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:54,143
I just want to say, thank you to everyone
for your dedication to our company.

161
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:58,746
Without all of you, there would be no Dreamer.

162
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:07,162
With a collection this amazing,
you can't leave us now.

163
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,499
Don't hesitate anymore. Stay with us.

164
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:15,011
- Please, Cream.
- You have to stay.

165
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:16,826
- Stick around.
- Please.

166
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:17,858
Please, Cream.

167
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:21,183
- Please...
- Hey, I'm not leaving today.

168
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:23,234
There's still plenty to get done.

169
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:25,365
Let's just celebrate tonight.

170
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:27,541
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

171
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,947
Cheers!

172
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:04,234
- Excuse me for a second.
- Sure.

173
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,115
Tul...

174
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:15,328
When you were in Paris,
did you and Cream ever really talk things out?

175
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:18,279
We were working nonstop. I barely slept.
When was I supposed to talk?

176
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:21,203
Lame excuse. What's that supposed to mean?

177
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:25,284
Are you saying you'd be okay
if Cream actually quit?

178
00:17:25,284 --> 00:17:30,432
When we toasted earlier,
I kind of told her she's important.

179
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:31,670
She probably got it.

180
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,598
"Kind of"? Who would get it from that?

181
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:39,798
You're such a cold-hearted prince.

182
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:42,360
You say you want to win her back,
but you can't even speak from your heart.

183
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,603
And right now, Cream's a hot commodity.

184
00:17:45,603 --> 00:17:48,280
You remember that live stream?

185
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,067
She made it public.
After Paris Fashion Week, she's resigning.

186
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:56,036
And now other companies are lining up
to recruit her.

187
00:17:56,036 --> 00:18:02,452
If any of them actually sees her worth,
she'll leave for sure.

188
00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:08,448
But just now she said
she's not leaving today or tomorrow.

189
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:10,314
So maybe, maybe not?

190
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:13,998
Why are you like this, man?

191
00:18:13,998 --> 00:18:17,483
Use your heart. Say what you really mean.

192
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:24,165
Or is it that the reason you haven't apologized,
is because you still haven't forgiven her?

193
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:26,511
- I have forgiven her, okay?
- Oh.

194
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:29,614
I saw how hard she worked for Dreamer.

195
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:32,288
And I know she genuinely regrets what she did.

196
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:33,785
Here is the deal.

197
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:37,080
After the sponsor thank-you party,

198
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,120
I'm going to do whatever it takes
to make her stay.

199
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,038
Deal?

200
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,012
You said it.

201
00:18:43,696 --> 00:18:46,280
You know, the reason I've been so worried

202
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,427
isn't because Dreamer might lose
a talent like Cream.

203
00:18:50,427 --> 00:18:52,947
I'm worried about you.

204
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:56,320
Finding someone who clicks with you
both professionally and personally

205
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,909
is hard, man.

206
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:59,373
You're not exactly easy.

207
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,914
So please...

208
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:05,047
Listen to me. Trust me.

209
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:07,724
Don't let her go.

210
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:09,028
Got it?

211
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:37,347
A riverfront condo, right?

212
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:40,906
Got it. Thanks so much for the referral.

213
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:43,398
Okay, I'll hang up now.

214
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:46,061
Just have them call Cake directly, okay?

215
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,293
Sure.

216
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:50,025
If I close the deal, drinks are on me.

217
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:52,337
Thanks.

218
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,067
Pete?

219
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,359
Hello? Got out of work?

220
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:05,095
Nid told me to give you a call.

221
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,046
About the riverside condo.

222
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:14,790
What are you up to?

223
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:18,263
Can I take a look?

224
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:25,857
Wow, it's beautiful.

225
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:30,263
- Perfect for a honeymoon suite, don't you think?
- Stop it.

226
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,177
You didn't have to go this far.

227
00:20:33,177 --> 00:20:35,371
Why not? Be honest.

228
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,139
Don't you like it?

229
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:39,667
I do, but it's so expensive.

230
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,539
I'm not comparing you to anyone anymore.

231
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,277
You really don't have to go this far.

232
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,938
But this is your dream condo, isn't it?

233
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:50,193
And I was planning for it to be our future home.

234
00:20:54,073 --> 00:21:02,386
Usually when people propose,
there's a ring and someone kneels down, right?

235
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:13,341
Like this?

236
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,646
I promise.

237
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:19,328
I'll take care of you.

238
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:24,324
And I'll make your life everything
you've ever dreamed of.

239
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,348
I trust you. And I know...

240
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:36,928
you'll take good care of me.

241
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,702
Let's make our dreams come true, together.

242
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:48,085
Thank you, for believing in me.

243
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:23,466
Cake! Congratulations!

244
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:29,172
I think we need to throw a big party for this.

245
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:32,883
Right? Cake's finally found a good guy.

246
00:22:32,883 --> 00:22:36,710
And Cream's work is blowing up right now.

247
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,333
You've been getting tons of packages, you know.

248
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,769
From which brands, Auntie?

249
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:43,498
All the top fashion brands.

250
00:22:43,498 --> 00:22:46,350
Looks like they're all trying to recruit you.

251
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,272
You're in high demand now.

252
00:22:51,753 --> 00:22:55,266
But are you really going to resign?

253
00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:01,674
From the bullied chubby kid to this,
you've come so far.

254
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:10,170
But seriously, why didn't you talk things out
with Tul when you were in Paris?

255
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:14,028
I just felt like it wouldn't change anything.

256
00:23:14,028 --> 00:23:16,485
All I could really say was "I'm sorry."

257
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,219
I think I'm going
to submit my resignation tomorrow.

258
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:26,693
Cream, getting here wasn't easy.

259
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:29,282
Are you really ready to give up on your dream?

260
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,567
Don't cry.

261
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:50,763
If you miss me, just call and come out for dinner.

262
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,978
It won't be the same.

263
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:58,466
I can't even imagine this office without you.

264
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:01,380
You've been such a great leader.

265
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,599
But to me, you weren't just my boss.

266
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:12,061
You were like a big sister.

267
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:25,221
And all of us,
you're like a real sister to me too.

268
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:27,491
Don't forget.

269
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:29,976
We're not just selling clothes.

270
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:36,474
We're helping our customers feel happy,
and confident when they wear them.

271
00:24:37,158 --> 00:24:41,239
Don't forget to pour your love and care
into every piece we create.

272
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:45,676
Because when we do, our customers can feel it.

273
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:47,171
We will.

274
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:51,890
We'll do everything you taught us.

275
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,331
We love you.

276
00:25:01,331 --> 00:25:03,839
Good luck, Cream.

277
00:25:19,265 --> 00:25:21,042
I'm here to resign.

278
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:26,672
And to return this music box to you.

279
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:30,579
I shouldn't keep it.

280
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:34,072
Why?

281
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:37,347
That music box...

282
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:40,992
It represents your sincerity toward me.

283
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,538
But I lied to you.

284
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:48,381
I don't deserve it.

285
00:25:50,518 --> 00:25:52,048
I...

286
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,197
Thank you...

287
00:25:55,197 --> 00:25:59,063
For everything you've done for me.

288
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:10,070
Good luck, Tul.

289
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,067
Wait...

290
00:26:25,943 --> 00:26:27,855
Why isn't Eak answering?

291
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:35,613
Tul...

292
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,460
Why did you bring me to your mother's house?

293
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,398
I think we should go in.

294
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,170
Let's go.

295
00:27:08,854 --> 00:27:10,169
Mom.

296
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,699
We've done it.

297
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:16,844
Dreamer is finally being recognized.

298
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,404
And it's all thanks to Cream.

299
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:26,734
She's not just important to Dreamer.

300
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:29,056
And...

301
00:27:32,728 --> 00:27:34,818
She's important to me too.

302
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:41,316
The reason I brought her here today...

303
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:45,718
I wanted you to know who she really is.

304
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,071
She started by lying to me.

305
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:59,473
But she did everything she could
to show me how sorry she truly was.

306
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:03,161
Cream.

307
00:28:07,107 --> 00:28:08,985
I...

308
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:12,698
That's enough. No love confessions right now.

309
00:28:12,698 --> 00:28:14,527
Cindy?

310
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:17,432
Because today will be the day you all die.

311
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:33,022
Back up.

312
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:35,088
Now!

313
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,596
Tie up your hands.

314
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:41,475
Quickly!

315
00:28:50,503 --> 00:28:53,937
- Take lots of pictures at the party, okay?
- Will do, Auntie.

316
00:28:53,937 --> 00:28:54,721
Let's go.

317
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:56,932
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

318
00:29:03,904 --> 00:29:05,349
Wine.

319
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:07,247
What is it?

320
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,385
Cake, have you been in touch with Cream?

321
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:12,724
I've been trying to call both Tul and Cream,
but neither of them is picking up.

322
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:13,683
Really?

323
00:29:13,683 --> 00:29:16,754
Well, Cream came into the office this morning
like usual.

324
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:19,496
But Tul took her out afterward.

325
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:22,695
I told them to be back before four,
but they're still not back.

326
00:29:22,695 --> 00:29:25,100
The board is already here,
and they keep asking where Tul is.

327
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,202
I don't know what to tell them.

328
00:29:27,202 --> 00:29:31,373
Alright. I'll try reaching Cream again
and call you back.

329
00:29:31,373 --> 00:29:32,410
Sure.

330
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:35,010
Something wrong?

331
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,422
Wine can't reach Cream or Tul.

332
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:46,300
No need.

333
00:29:47,226 --> 00:29:48,523
Turn around.

334
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,160
[Cake]

335
00:29:56,615 --> 00:29:59,205
I'm going to answer this call.

336
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:03,702
And you're going to say everything's fine.

337
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:06,873
If you mess this up, Tul dies.

338
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:15,360
Cream, where are you?

339
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,540
Everyone at the office is looking for you.

340
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,925
We are just about to head back to the office.

341
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,214
Then why didn't you answer when Wine called?

342
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,655
What was that noise?

343
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:30,709
Cream. Are you okay?

344
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:34,157
I knocked over a picture frame, that's all.
I have to go now.

345
00:30:34,157 --> 00:30:36,017
Tul's about to leave the house.

346
00:30:37,264 --> 00:30:38,808
Cream?

347
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:40,174
Cream?

348
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:44,523
You don't have to rush.

349
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:46,523
You're dead by the end of today anyway.

350
00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:52,817
- Something's wrong, Auntie.
- What is it?

351
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:56,022
Cream's voice... it sounded really strange.

352
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:58,534
Do you think she and Tul are fighting?

353
00:30:58,534 --> 00:31:01,960
No, it didn't sound like a fight
or someone crying.

354
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,174
It sounded like...

355
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:06,664
She was scared
like she was worried about something.

356
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,461
There was a loud noise too,

357
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:10,720
and when I asked her about it, she didn't answer.

358
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,242
She just hung up quickly.

359
00:31:12,242 --> 00:31:16,209
I know something's wrong, Auntie.

360
00:31:20,636 --> 00:31:22,419
Hello? What's the latest?

361
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:25,691
Wine, can I get the number of Eak,
the guy who takes care of Tul's mom's house?

362
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:27,660
Oh, sure. I'll send it to you now.

363
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,396
Cream's not answering at all.

364
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:46,917
And Eak isn't either.

365
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,942
Wine gave you the right number, right?

366
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:49,640
Yes, she did.

367
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,264
I called his personal number and his LINE.
Nothing.

368
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:58,296
- Let's go to Tul's mom's house. Right now.
- Sure.

369
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:01,257
Auntie, you stay here.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.

370
00:32:01,257 --> 00:32:03,426
- Please keep me posted, dear.
- I will.

371
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:06,592
Tul.

372
00:32:07,221 --> 00:32:08,894
Auntie, please calm down.

373
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:10,753
Don't make things worse than they already are.

374
00:32:10,753 --> 00:32:13,058
Listen to me, Auntie. You can still run.

375
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:16,109
If you leave now, I promise.
I won't tell the police anything.

376
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:18,131
Oh, I'll run.

377
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:20,458
But only after the two of you are dead.

378
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:29,985
I won't let you both walk away smiling
while I've lost everything and hit rock bottom.

379
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:33,691
Cindy, you don't need to do this.

380
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:35,462
Yes, I do.

381
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:36,951
You stupid girl.

382
00:32:36,951 --> 00:32:40,385
Because of you,
Nira Fashion House had to shut down.

383
00:32:40,385 --> 00:32:42,320
If it weren't for you,

384
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,205
I would've been the one
to sign that deal with P&Y!

385
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:47,907
Please listen to me.

386
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:51,164
I never meant to destroy Nira Fashion House.

387
00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:55,807
All I wanted was to build Dreamer
into the brand my mom always dreamed of.

388
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,627
Your mom's dream?

389
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:01,656
And what about mine?

390
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:06,047
Do you know how long it took for me
to get to where I am?

391
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:10,392
I am Cindy of Nira Fashion House.

392
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:18,992
It was your mom who told me to be myself,
who said I'd find my place in this industry.

393
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:23,198
But when I finally was myself,
no one could accept it.

394
00:33:23,198 --> 00:33:28,844
But you, a liar and a fraud...
Everyone forgives you.

395
00:33:28,844 --> 00:33:31,551
There's nothing wrong with being yourself.

396
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,720
But it shouldn't come
at the cost of hurting others.

397
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,850
It shouldn't destroy lives.

398
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,153
And what about your lies? Didn't they hurt anyone?

399
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:40,451
They did.

400
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,547
That's why I'm taking responsibility by resigning.

401
00:33:43,547 --> 00:33:46,146
Because I can't keep living with that guilt.

402
00:33:46,146 --> 00:33:47,973
But you...

403
00:33:47,973 --> 00:33:51,293
you're still doing harm,
even knowing it hurts people.

404
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:52,814
That's what makes it wrong.

405
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:55,142
Don't lecture me.

406
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:58,037
You hurt me.

407
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,814
So now, I'm going to hurt you back.

408
00:34:00,814 --> 00:34:02,871
Wait, Cindy.

409
00:34:02,871 --> 00:34:04,842
There's something you need to know.

410
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,094
Tul's mother had something she wanted to tell you.

411
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:09,715
I read her journal.

412
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:16,441
She wrote about you.
I know now why you hate Tul and Dreamer so much.

413
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:19,219
It's because of what she did to you.

414
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:22,854
Don't you want to know why she did it?

415
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:25,126
Please let me show you.

416
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:27,342
So you don't end up regretting it forever.

417
00:34:29,229 --> 00:34:31,541
Where's the notebook?

418
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:33,012
It's in that room.

419
00:34:33,012 --> 00:34:34,382
Go get it.

420
00:34:35,888 --> 00:34:37,157
Cream.

421
00:34:38,004 --> 00:34:41,664
Don't speak. Just move. Get up!

422
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:45,888
Go!

423
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:06,981
Go.

424
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:08,242
Where is it?

425
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:22,060
Where is it?

426
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,236
Hold on, it's not where I left it...

427
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:26,760
Hurry!

428
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:35,783
Hurry!

429
00:35:39,803 --> 00:35:41,167
Found it yet?

430
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:54,153
Tul.

431
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,799
- Cream, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

432
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,379
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

433
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,607
- Cream, come on.
- Tul.

434
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:15,991
Tul, help me!

435
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:17,104
Eak!

436
00:36:24,962 --> 00:36:26,430
Are you okay? Come on, I'll help you.

437
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,634
I can't go on. Tul, you need to get out of here.

438
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:34,786
- Go hide. I'll get someone to help.
- Okay.

439
00:36:34,786 --> 00:36:36,562
- Cream, this way.
- Let's go.

440
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:47,573
- Tul.
- Yes?

441
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,763
Just now, Cindy...

442
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:51,296
Let's go. Now.

443
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,594
Cream!

444
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:00,430
Now you understand, don't you?

445
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:05,470
What it feels like to lose the thing you love.

446
00:37:07,131 --> 00:37:09,844
You have to hurt more than I ever did!

447
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:11,151
Don't do this, Cindy!

448
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:14,219
Please put the gun down.

449
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,672
I'm telling you, drop the weapon now.

450
00:37:21,942 --> 00:37:23,649
Please don't do this.

451
00:37:23,649 --> 00:37:25,105
Stay back!

452
00:37:25,105 --> 00:37:27,515
I said put it down! Now!

453
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,954
Give up, Cindy.

454
00:37:30,954 --> 00:37:33,083
Don't make things worse than they already are.

455
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:36,600
Why should I give up? He ruined me!

456
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:41,254
I won't warn you again.

457
00:37:41,254 --> 00:37:42,685
Drop the gun now!

458
00:37:42,685 --> 00:37:45,397
Why do I have to lose?

459
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:48,614
Cream?

460
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:50,512
Cream, Cream!

461
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:51,705
Cream!

462
00:37:52,663 --> 00:37:54,967
Trust me. Please put it down.

463
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:56,320
Just drop it.

464
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:00,704
Cindy, please, quickly!

465
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:09,703
Go in. Clear the room!

466
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,952
Cream!

467
00:38:11,952 --> 00:38:14,672
Cream, Cream!

468
00:38:14,672 --> 00:38:15,923
Cream!

469
00:38:15,923 --> 00:38:17,599
You're going to be okay, alright?

470
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,982
Cream... Cream... Cream!

471
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:23,492
Quick take her to the hospital.

472
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,711
Cream!

473
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:28,720
Cream!

474
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,093
Cream!

475
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,013
Take her away.

476
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,845
Cake.
[ICU - Intensive Care Unit]

477
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:11,626
How's Cream doing?

478
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:15,192
The doctors removed the bullet.

479
00:39:15,192 --> 00:39:18,315
But she lost a lot of blood.
She still hasn't regained consciousness.

480
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:25,016
And the shooter? What are the police saying?

481
00:39:25,016 --> 00:39:27,004
Cindy's getting her wounds treated.

482
00:39:27,004 --> 00:39:29,811
Police are watching her. She'll be charged.

483
00:39:34,897 --> 00:39:35,915
Hey...

484
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:39,603
Are you okay?

485
00:39:43,935 --> 00:39:45,784
The question.

486
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:47,506
Shouldn't you be asking my sister?

487
00:39:47,506 --> 00:39:49,121
Cake...

488
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:52,672
I can't keep quiet anymore, Auntie.

489
00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:56,881
All this time, have you never once thought
of forgiving my sister?

490
00:39:57,566 --> 00:40:01,169
Do you even realize what she sacrificed for you?

491
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:03,481
She had panic attacks because of you.

492
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:05,109
She lost weight for you.

493
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:06,800
She resigned from her dream job for you.

494
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,911
Do you even understand
how much she loved this job?

495
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:12,171
Now she's lying there like that,
and you still can't forgive her?

496
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:18,066
I honestly feel sorry for Cream,
for loving a man like you.

497
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,289
That's enough, dear. That's enough.

498
00:40:28,587 --> 00:40:31,039
I am apologizing on behalf of her.

499
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:34,329
No need to apologize, Auntie.

500
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:38,677
Everything Cake said is true.

501
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:43,866
It's my fault. I kept everything bottled up...

502
00:40:45,975 --> 00:40:48,522
and never told Cream how I really felt.

503
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,103
If something happens to her...

504
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,493
I'll never forgive myself.

505
00:41:31,685 --> 00:41:33,972
Don't give up, my dear.

506
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:36,513
You have to come back to Auntie, okay?

507
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:43,352
I'm right here next to you.

508
00:41:45,077 --> 00:41:47,281
You hear me, right?

509
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:54,014
Wake up, Cream. Everyone's waiting for you.

510
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:04,303
Cream...

511
00:42:07,253 --> 00:42:09,757
I know this might be too late.

512
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:15,097
But I forgive you.

513
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:17,217
I don't know what I was thinking...

514
00:42:19,773 --> 00:42:21,759
But when you said you loved me...

515
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:25,646
I know now it was real.

516
00:42:29,295 --> 00:42:31,280
And I love you too.

517
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:36,126
Please come back to me.

518
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:56,363
Should we head out now?

519
00:42:57,328 --> 00:42:59,400
Cream needs rest.

520
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:06,221
She really does.

521
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:15,108
Let's go.

522
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,333
Cream...

523
00:43:55,158 --> 00:43:58,200
You're awake?

524
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,125
Cream!

525
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:03,548
You're awake. Does it hurt? Are you in pain?

526
00:44:03,548 --> 00:44:06,732
Stop yelling, I'm trying to sleep.

527
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:08,625
Cream!

528
00:44:09,454 --> 00:44:11,153
You idiot...

529
00:44:12,418 --> 00:44:14,645
I heard your voice.

530
00:44:16,408 --> 00:44:18,073
Thank you...

531
00:44:18,898 --> 00:44:20,675
For forgiving me.

532
00:44:22,172 --> 00:44:23,695
Cream.

533
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:27,656

541
00:45:13,665 --> 00:45:15,061
Cream.

542
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,970
Special thanks to our language moderators and their teams.

544
00:46:12,941 --> 00:46:15,983
The Supreme Court ruled on Cindy's case today.

545
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:18,008
She's been sentenced to life in prison.

546
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:28,831
Let's hope that during her time in jail,
she reflects on what she's done.

547
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:42,109
Mom, Dreamer's about to open a branch in France.

548
00:46:43,145 --> 00:46:44,781
Are you proud of me?

549
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,537
I promise.

550
00:46:50,722 --> 00:46:54,963
I'll never lose sight
of the happiness our clothes bring people.

551
00:46:54,963 --> 00:47:00,410
And I'll always be honest with our customers,
just like you taught me.

552
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:14,862
You don't have to worry about me anymore.

553
00:47:14,862 --> 00:47:18,956
Because now I have Cream by my side.

554
00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:27,857
No matter how hard things get,
the two of us will make it through.

555
00:47:29,464 --> 00:47:34,326
I promise I'll always stay by your side.

556
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:37,531
I'm never leaving you.

557
00:48:14,176 --> 00:48:16,532
Oh no! Auntie! The pork's burning!

558
00:48:16,532 --> 00:48:17,489
- Need a tissue?
- What?

559
00:48:17,489 --> 00:48:19,589
- A tissue, Auntie?
- It looks delicious though.

560
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:22,167
- Oops!
- Can I get some scallions, please?

561
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,860
- Coming!
- A whole bunch of scallions, coming up.

562
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,900
- Sticky rice too, sweetie?
- Perfect for us!

563
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,476
Here's the bacon.

564
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:34,008
No way, Tul. I've gained weight.
I can't eat bacon.

565
00:48:34,008 --> 00:48:35,666
If you can gain it, you can lose it.

566
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:38,451
Don't forget.
You've eaten way more than this before.

567
00:48:38,451 --> 00:48:43,977
But honestly, no matter your size,

568
00:48:44,597 --> 00:48:46,412
I don't care. Because you're still you.

569
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:52,978
What does that mean?
You'd still love me if I got fat?

570
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:54,709
Absolutely.

571
00:48:56,711 --> 00:48:59,491
- Auntie, I want to gain weight too.
- Bacon, bacon!

572
00:48:59,491 --> 00:49:04,453
If gaining weight means a guy will still love me,
bring on the buffet!

573
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,360
Here it is. The special dish you ordered.

574
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,672
Wow...

575
00:49:09,672 --> 00:49:12,395
What's this?

576
00:49:12,395 --> 00:49:13,958
Cream...

577
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:15,909
- Cream.
- Yes?

578
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:18,463
This is the special dish I ordered for you.

579
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:21,302
This is a lot. I'm already full.

580
00:49:21,302 --> 00:49:24,050
But this one is extra special. Open it.

581
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:31,760
Is it...

582
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,087
Is it...

583
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:34,161
Is it...

584
00:49:34,161 --> 00:49:35,410
- Is it...
- Is it?

585
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:37,027
- Is it...
- Is it?

586
00:49:38,865 --> 00:49:40,595
A proposal?

587
00:49:40,595 --> 00:49:43,320
We may have started off on the wrong foot,

588
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,246
but we were lucky enough
to grow from it and start over.

589
00:49:48,594 --> 00:49:50,663
And now I'm sure.

590
00:49:50,663 --> 00:49:53,204
You're the person
I want to spend the rest of my life with.

591
00:49:55,147 --> 00:49:56,323
Cream.

592
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,245
Will you marry me?

593
00:50:00,245 --> 00:50:02,206
Yes.

594
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:14,849
Gentle now, gentle!

595
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:23,498
- Oh my god!
- This is too much!

596
00:50:26,379 --> 00:50:28,659
You've all known for a while, haven't you?

597
00:50:30,414 --> 00:50:34,969
From now on,
you two aren't just "friend with buffet,"

598
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:37,838
you're fiancé with buffet.

599
00:50:43,703 --> 00:50:46,076
May your live happily ever after,
with unlimited refills.

600
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,636
Same goes for you.

601
00:50:50,282 --> 00:50:52,683
Auntie's barbecue is all burned!

602
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,678
That's enough, now.

603
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:55,906
More pork, please!

604
00:50:55,906 --> 00:50:58,945
Shall we toast?

605
00:50:58,945 --> 00:51:02,048
Cheers!

606
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:11,020
Thank you for watching "The Twin Gambit".

607
00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:21,585
At long last,
I finally get to fasten the first button again.

608
00:51:21,585 --> 00:51:26,395
And this time, I won't get it wrong.
