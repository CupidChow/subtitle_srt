Xiaoying.

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
You don't need to say anything.

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,199
I know why the Nine Heavens

31
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
treated you like this.

32
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,879
Don't worry.

33
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,319
I'm here.

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,560
Let's find a place to heal.

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,639
Come.

36
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,240
Slowly now.

37
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,159
Here.

38
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,199
Come.

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,159
Be careful.

40
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:54,560
Here.

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,400
Sir,

42
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,599
one premium room.

43
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,979
Why are you two here?

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
All rooms are occupied.

45
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:02,419
Try another inn.

46
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,340
Out! Get out now!

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,419
But your sign clearly shows vacancies.

48
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,219
That was earlier.

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,800
None left now.

50
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,199
You know full well if rooms exist.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,639
Should I check every room myself?

52
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,599
Can't you get what I'm saying?

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,680
Everyone, come witness this injustice!

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,599
Bai Xiaoying uses her dark magic

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,479
to threaten us in my place!

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,120
Nonsense!

57
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,759
Let me tell you all the truth.

58
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,360
Bai Xiaoying

59
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,120
was born a demon witch!

60
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,840
Every elder in Su City knows it.

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,759
We've known for decades!

62
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,759
She bullied others when she was young!

63
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,479
How dare she show her face here?

64
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,439
Disgusting!

65
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,639
Consorting with the Night Clan!

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,560
Nothing but filth!

67
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,800
This man she brought

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,560
is her master

69
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,840
who always protected her crimes!

70
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:54,460
Look at his wretched state now!

71
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,800
That's evil reaping its due!

72
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
Exactly!

73
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,520
We won't share a place

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,400
with these demons!

75
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,408
- Out!
- Out!

76
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,080
- Out!
- Out!

77
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,599
Shut up!

78
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:03,744
Get out!

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,240
Ungrateful wretches!

80
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,439
Immortal Yunya saved countless lives!

81
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,719
And this is how you repay him.

82
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,240
Pathetic!

83
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,080
Saving us?

84
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,879
The Nine Heavens protected us!

85
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,680
The Immortal Lord himself!

86
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,959
He just followed the orders

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,160
and did his duty.

88
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,360
Now, he's exiled from the immortal sect,

89
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,480
consorting with this...

90
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,000
Right.

91
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,040
This demon witch!

92
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,759
He's no good thing either!

93
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,040
Get lost!

94
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,680
- Out!
- Out now!

95
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
Go!

96
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,000
- Get out of here!
- Out!

97
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,240
(These people
have no idea of the truth,)

98
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,360
(but they spew nonsense here.)

99
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,800
(Doesn't this infuriate you?)

100
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,040
(Look at their hideous faces.)

101
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,519
(Don't you want to tear them apart?)

102
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,360
(I can make it happen.)

103
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,680
Xiaoying.

104
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,319
Xiaoying.

105
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,819
Xiaoying.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,759
Let's leave.

107
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,319
I won't waste time arguing today.

108
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,439
If I hear more slander
against my master,

109
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,552
you'll face consequences!

110
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,192
Enough! Out!

111
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:21,408
- Go away!
- Get lost!

112
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,279
I never expected

113
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,879
when I became worthless trash,

114
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,319
only you'd stand by me.

115
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,139
Forget that.

116
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,639
Are you feeling warmer now?

117
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,720
(Every hardship he endures
is for my sake.)

118
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,199
(When he seized the sword.)

119
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,000
(This time too.)

120
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,959
(Whatever the cost,)

121
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,800
(I'll save him.)

122
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,399
Bai Xiaoying
has fully succumbed to darkness,

123
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,740
aiding the Night Clan against us!

124
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,120
Then we will

125
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,480
strike first

126
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
and eliminate her

127
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,600
before she causes more harm!

128
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:01,839
My lord,

129
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,920
shouldn't we investigate

130
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,600
why the War God
suddenly turned against us

131
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,519
before doing that?

132
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,839
My lord,

133
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,240
her words make sense.

134
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
We require evidence to kill

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,639
the War God.

136
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,839
Perhaps the War God
has compelling reasons.

137
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,160
Bai Xiaoying's defection
to the Night Clan

138
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,480
is witnessed by all.

139
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,439
The evidence is solid.

140
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,680
There's no room for doubt.

141
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,600
This discussion is over.

142
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,720
She's left the Snowfall Valley
for the Mortal Realm.

143
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,639
This is our chance
to eradicate the Snowfall Valley.

144
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:34,720
Everyone,

145
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,720
follow me.

146
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,120
Xiaoying.

147
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,759
Don't drain your spiritual power
for me anymore.

148
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,319
How do you feel now?

149
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,079
Now, I have

150
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,199
less than 30% of my power.

151
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,079
I'm practically useless.

152
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,319
No.

153
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,680
At dawn, I'll take you
back to the valley.

154
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,720
Rest there,

155
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,399
and you'll recover within days.

156
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,519
How did you find me?

157
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
You already know

158
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
everything?

159
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,519
I don't know the full details.

160
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,559
I received Wanyan's message
in the valley

161
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,080
and learned of your thing.

162
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,600
This helped me

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,879
locate you.

164
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,519
You've kept it all this time?

165
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,080
Of course.

166
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,580
It's the first gift you ever gave me.

167
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,480
I treasure it dearly.

168
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
So...

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,399
what exactly happened to you

170
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,039
in the Nine Heavens?

171
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
The past

172
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,899
isn't worth mentioning.

173
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,399
From now on,

174
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:33,259
I have no ties to the Nine Heavens.

175
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,320
I can stay by your side forever.

176
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,840
It's time.

177
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,720
Let's return to the valley.

178
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,399
Snowfall Valley...

179
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,240
Oh no.

180
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,000
They'll attack the valley!

181
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,480
What?

182
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,360
Little Stone,

183
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:45,919
are you alright?

184
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,519
Can you hear me?

185
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,399
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,679
War God.

187
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,799
I failed to protect
the Snowfall Valley for you.

188
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,559
Nothing.

189
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,120
Don't speak.

190
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,419
Let me heal your wounds.

191
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,919
Leave me.

192
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,299
Rourou was captured by a group.

193
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,419
Hurry.

194
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,299
Little Stone.

195
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,299
Little Stone.

196
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,899
Master.

197
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:33,860
Stay here.

198
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,659
I'll rescue Rourou.

199
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,200
Xiaoying.

200
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:52,736
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

201
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:53,568
Kill her!

202
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,919
She's the follower of Bai Xiaoying,

203
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,419
the Night Clan witch!

204
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,500
This is what she deserves!

205
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,299
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

206
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,379
Tell us.

207
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,100
Where's Bai Xiaoying?

208
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,000
As long as you say it,

209
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,879
we'll release you.

210
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,379
In your dreams.

211
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,259
I'd rather die

212
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,460
than betray her.

213
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:14,220
You...

214
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,620
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

215
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,340
Do you know how many villagers here

216
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,740
lost family to the Night Clan?

217
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,460
The blood on you

218
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,659
belongs to those victims!

219
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:30,624
- Bring him up!
- Go!

220
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:35,899
Are you another
of Bai Xiaoying's followers?

221
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,620
No!

222
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,740
I'm not!

223
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:40,740
That traitor Bai Xiaoying deceived me!

224
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,740
I had no choice

225
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,659
but to join them to survive!

226
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,419
She betrayed the immortals!

227
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:46,419
A despicable wretch!

228
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,740
She's no War God!

229
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:49,740
I want to tear her flesh

230
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,659
and drink her blood!

231
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,980
Okay.

232
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:53,820
You've awakened.

233
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,019
Let him go.

234
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:00,100
Your turn.

235
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:01,820
Speak.

236
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,139
What kind of person is Bai Xiaoying?

237
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,620
She's the finest person in this world.

238
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,299
She sacrificed herself

239
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:11,820
to save all of you.

240
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:13,220
Talking nonsense!

241
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,899
Shut your lying mouth!

242
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:17,179
One last chance.

243
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,220
Say it!

244
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:20,100
- Say it!
- Say it!

245
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,460
- Hurry up!
- Confess!

246
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,019
You all witnessed it.

247
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:31,139
Still defiant when death approaches.

248
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,779
Truly bewitched by that demonic woman.

249
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,620
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

250
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,820
You deserve your death!

251
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,816
Kill her!

252
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:44,448
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

253
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:54,259
You...

254
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:57,980
Rourou,

255
00:13:58,779 --> 00:13:59,580
are you okay?

256
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:01,700
Hold on a little longer.

257
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:02,620
Xiaoying,

258
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,740
you came.

259
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:05,980
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,100
I might not be able to stay with you.

261
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,580
Rourou.

262
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:11,940
Rourou.

263
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,220
Rourou.

264
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,100
Rourou.

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm taking you home.

266
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,860
This is Bai Xiaoying
who killed your families.

267
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,112
- Stop her!
- Stop her!

268
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:40,224
Stop her!

269
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:42,779
Witch!

270
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:45,059
A life for a life!

271
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,408
- Kill her!
- Die!

272
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,302
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

273
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,568
You die!

274
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,424
Witch!

275
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:00,460
Witch?

276
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,220
Let me show you a real witch.

277
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:14,912
Run!

278
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,419
What?

279
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,860
Don't you recognize me?

280
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,879
Feng Changgeng.

281
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,820
These refugees

282
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,379
are truly courting death.

283
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,100
But blame yourself

284
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,659
if you must.

285
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,419
1,500 years have passed.

286
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,539
You're just a vessel.

287
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:48,820
An imprisoned vessel.

288
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,139
Over these 15 centuries,

289
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:54,860
without the sacrifices
of me and Ye Chenyuan,

290
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,340
the Three Realms
would've perished long ago!

291
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,700
All your suffering

292
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:03,179
was orchestrated by your own mother.

293
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:05,740
Even your birth mother
saw you as a tool.

294
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,620
Your joys, sorrows and desires.

295
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,340
No one truly cares.

296
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,580
That's not true.

297
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,299
I still have Ye Chenyuan.

298
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,659
Ye Chenyuan.

299
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,500
Ye Chenyuan grew weary

300
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,659
of this three-century cycle with you.

301
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,820
He'd rather end himself

302
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,740
than remain bound to you.

303
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,059
It wasn't like that.

304
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,740
It wasn't like that.

305
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:35,460
You're lying!

306
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Let me reveal another secret.

307
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,460
Your parents Xi Wu and Jibai's plan

308
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,620
wasn't just to seal the Night Deity
with you as a vessel.

309
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,539
They intended to erase both you

310
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,259
and the Night Deity.

311
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,019
What?

312
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,259
Realms stabilized.

313
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,379
With my energy.

314
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,299
Heaven and earth as blades.

315
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:04,019
- Seal!
- Seal!

316
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,980
Immortal Changgeng,

317
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,099
I thought you were wise.

318
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,819
Do you really intend
to kill me alongside them?

319
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
You should've vanished long ago.

320
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:20,539
As the Sword Master,
I'll personally end you.

321
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,099
This is my duty

322
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,819
as a cultivator of the Nine Heavens.

323
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,420
Nine Heavens?

324
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,299
You crave fame and glory,

325
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,819
wanting to be the hero of this world

326
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,579
to make the immortal sect eternal.

327
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,819
But don't forget.

328
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:39,099
For every night, there's dawn.

329
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,980
For darkness, light exists.

330
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,700
Killing me

331
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:45,579
will only earn fleeting praise.

332
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,140
To make the Three Realms
depend on the immortal sect

333
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,940
and worship you eternally,

334
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,380
Immortal Changgeng,

335
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:54,019
you need me.

336
00:17:58,539 --> 00:17:59,339
I know

337
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,819
you're an intelligent man.

338
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:03,980
How about

339
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,339
we make a deal?

340
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:12,779
Changgeng,

341
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:15,576
Xi Wu has transformed
into the Divine Sword.

342
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,619
I will become its spirit.

343
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,059
You must personally

344
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:23,460
kill the Night Deity.

345
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,019
Changgeng,

346
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,700
why?

347
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,980
Without a sword spirit,

348
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,660
I can still kill the Night Deity,

349
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,500
but he will resurrect
alongside the dead baby

350
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,900
three centuries later.

351
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:52,420
When that happens,

352
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,779
I'll eliminate him again
with the spiritless Divine Sword.

353
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,500
This cycle will repeat endlessly.

354
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,099
The Night Deity revives every 300 years,

355
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,099
making all mortals

356
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,660
perpetually fear him,

357
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,220
need our immortal sect,

358
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,380
and worship

359
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:16,380
the Nine Heavens ruled by me.

360
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:41,259
Jibai, you wretch!

361
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,579
Severely wounding me,

362
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,180
leaving me unable
to wield the Divine Sword.

363
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,819
(Seems I must select a new Sword Master)

364
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,299
(to use the Divine Sword
to kill this child.)

365
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,779
Now you understand?

366
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,539
Thinking only through your suffering,

367
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:12,259
could we imprison the Night Deity?

368
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,059
You and Ye Chenyuan were merely pawns

369
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,140
in my grand scheme

370
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,779
for 1,500 years.

371
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,220
I'll kill you.

372
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,180
I'll kill you.

373
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,980
Your suffering meant nothing.

374
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,140
Still fancy yourself the world's hero?

375
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,460
But they curse your name.

376
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,220
Hear this.

377
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,019
(She's no Divine Maiden.)

378
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:42,220
(She's cursed.)

379
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:44,140
(Anyone she touches dies.)

380
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,259
(That's the little beast
containing the Night Deity!)

381
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:49,059
(She killed my father!)

382
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:50,059
(I'll kill her)

383
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,420
(to avenge my father!)

384
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,140
Your daughter is clearly a monster.

385
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:54,940
She'll get us all killed!

386
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,140
(You are the biggest threat to me.)

387
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,420
(No matter what,)

388
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,059
(you can't remain here.)

389
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,339
(Staying here for over a decade,)

390
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:04,859
(I've never done any wrongdoings.)

391
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:06,660
(I never want to ruin the world,)

392
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,460
nor did I choose to be the vessel.

393
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:10,059
Why must I bear this burden?

394
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,940
So...

395
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,380
So, this is the truth.

396
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,259
All my endurance meant nothing.

397
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:35,299
My life's been a joke.

398
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,519
Those I loved

399
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,400
and wished to protect

400
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,279
all died because of me.

401
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,759
The world has abandoned me.

402
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,279
If the world needs me not,

403
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,480
why should I need it?

404
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,400
After coexisting
with the Night Deity so long,

405
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,319
have you considered,

406
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,359
Bai Xiaoying,

407
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,200
you are the Night Deity?

408
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,400
I am the Night Deity.

409
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,079
This world's beyond saving.

410
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,720
If salvation is impossible,

411
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:33,119
let us all perish together.

412
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,420
The Night Deity descends!

413
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:50,819
Rourou,

414
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,380
I'll make the entire world

415
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,700
your funeral offering.

416
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,059
The Night Deity.

417
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,180
Now, Xiaoying

418
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:11,619
will only go to two places.

419
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:25,140
My lord.

420
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,579
Having left the Nine Heavens for days,

421
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:30,700
I finally understand your dedication.

422
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,740
I've deeply reflected.

423
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,339
I'm sorry for my past immaturity.

424
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Grant me another chance

425
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:40,099
to serve you

426
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:41,259
and redeem myself.

427
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:48,339
Father.

428
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,019
Previously,

429
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:57,619
I merely sought to discipline you,

430
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:00,099
never expecting such defiance.

431
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,819
You refused to submit or apologize

432
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,500
before all the elders
and upper immortals,

433
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,339
publicly humiliating me.

434
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,059
I know.

435
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,539
You rule the Nine Heavens.

436
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,980
I continued to err without repentance.

437
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:18,299
How could you show favoritism?

438
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,819
Do you know?

439
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,140
Though Bai Xiaoying
became the Sword Master,

440
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,420
in my judgment,

441
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,220
the most qualified candidate

442
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,220
remains you.

443
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:48,660
Yunya,

444
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:50,779
if you truly reform yourself,

445
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,660
I'll treat you as before.

446
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:56,099
From this day onward,

447
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,819
you'll be the Sword Master.

448
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,900
Thank you, my lord.

449
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:21,420
Bai Xiaoying.

450
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,839
What are you...?

451
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,500
Exactly.

452
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,619
I'm now the Night Deity.

453
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,980
Starting today,

454
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:34,259
I'll restore the Night Clan's glory.

455
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,140
Though you helped us before,

456
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,940
without a reason,

457
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:41,140
we won't submit to you.

458
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:58,579
I hear you all respect only strength.

459
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:00,259
The winner takes it all.

460
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,500
Submit?

461
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:09,380
I submit.

462
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:12,059
I'll follow you.

463
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,980
Any objections?

464
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,460
- We'll follow you.
- We'll follow you.

465
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:25,500
- We'll follow you.
- We'll follow you.

466
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,039
Do you want

467
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,319
to pay back

468
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:33,819
every insult?

469
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,180
- Yes!
- Yes!

470
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,140
With your loyalty,

471
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:43,940
we'll conquer the Three Realms.

472
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:46,119
Everyone,

473
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:48,700
follow me

474
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,500
- to assault the immortal sect!
- Assault!

475
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,960
- Rule all!
- Rule all!

476
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,500
- Assault!
- Assault!

477
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,839
- Rule all!
- Rule all!

478
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,240
- Assault!
- Assault!

479
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,519
- Rule all!
- Rule all!

480
00:26:58,539 --> 00:26:59,900
- Assault!
- Assault!

481
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,279
- Rule all!
- Rule all!

482
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:09,420
Yunya!

483
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,980
Are you there?

484
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:18,460
State your business.

485
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:24,339
Stabilizing Pill.

486
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,420
It enhances one's cultivation.

487
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,140
Your severe injuries

488
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,099
could've damaged your foundation.

489
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:32,660
Your cultivation might regress.

490
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,500
My father bears responsibility.

491
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:50,900
I apologize on his behalf.

492
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:53,660
I've mostly recovered.

493
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,779
No need for concern.

494
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,019
You still resent my father?

495
00:27:58,619 --> 00:27:59,940
Or perhaps me

496
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:02,059
for not rescuing you?

497
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:06,700
I blame no one.

498
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,980
You overthink.

499
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,940
But you clearly...

500
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:13,500
Disturbance!

501
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:14,940
I'll go check.

502
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,079
Alert the others.

503
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,420
That's Bai Xiaoying.

504
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:39,059
She became the Night Deity.

505
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:43,019
Yunya.

506
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,619
Will you oppose me too?

507
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,059
Never.

508
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:52,339
I vowed

509
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,140
never to harm you.

510
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:04,420
When all abandoned me,

511
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:06,019
you remained.

512
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:08,579
If the Three Realms oppose you,

513
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,319
I'll stand by you.

514
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:14,599
Yunya.

515
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,460
Do you know what you're doing?

516
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:18,220
Of course.

517
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,539
No counsel needed.

518
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,660
You betray the sect too?

519
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,779
Okay.

520
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,539
Form the array!

521
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:27,019
The Immortal Lord?

522
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:28,740
When we arrived,

523
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,980
he was already not here.

524
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,180
He must've heard the news and run.

525
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:36,220
How noble. Escaping like rats.

526
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:38,460
Clearly,

527
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:40,700
your lives matter less

528
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,440
than his own.

529
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:43,700
Lies!

530
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:47,740
My father will save us.
