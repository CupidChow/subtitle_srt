27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,200
As a prince,

28
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,599
you should set an example.

29
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,799
If even late for lessons,

30
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,799
how can you shoulder anything important?

31
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
You speak wisely.

32
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,280
I will remember.

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,239
Sit.

34
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,120
Let's begin today's lesson.

35
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,319
Of all in the world,

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,239
humans hold great value.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,760
Among human virtues,

38
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,480
none surpasses filial piety.

39
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,240
This means that in all creatures,

40
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,840
humanity is most precious.

41
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,520
Among all human actions,

42
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,319
none matters more than filial duty.

43
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:20,919
I have a question.

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,280
Speak.

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,560
Following your teaching,

46
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,639
if one's parents

47
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,759
abandoned them from childhood,

48
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,879
allowing others to abuse them,

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,719
should such parents

50
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,719
deserve filial devotion?

51
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,659
This question

52
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,099
escapes my knowledge.

53
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,419
May you enlighten us?

54
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:45,819
In my view,

55
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,419
forced filial piety

56
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,020
can't compare to heartfelt affection.

57
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:52,659
Love parents,

58
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,780
love children,

59
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:56,939
and teachers.

60
00:02:58,699 --> 00:02:59,819
What do you think?

61
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,180
Your reasoning

62
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,419
is quite unconventional.

63
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:08,460
If children feel parental love early,

64
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:10,860
they'll love in return.

65
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:13,379
It makes sense.

66
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,099
Worthy of thinking.

67
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,699
Today's lesson ends here.

68
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:24,860
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

69
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,620
Wait.

70
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,139
Anything else?

71
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,419
How dare you!

72
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,900
I'm your teacher.

73
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:42,379
How dare you do this?

74
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:44,740
I'm just curious

75
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,139
about your fragrance.

76
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,780
It resembles women's scented ointments.

77
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,180
As a man,

78
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,259
why would I have that?

79
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,620
You must be mistaken.

80
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:58,939
Is that so?

81
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Continue this insolence,

82
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:06,699
and I'll tell the Emperor

83
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,539
about your misconduct

84
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,819
and expel you from class.

85
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:13,780
You think my misconduct

86
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,620
would incur imperial punishment?

87
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,020
Or that your disguise,

88
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:19,459
a capital deception crime,

89
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,620
would enrage His Majesty more?

90
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:26,779
Seems I guessed right.

91
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:29,939
What's your aim?

92
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:31,779
I'm a woman.

93
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:33,579
So what?

94
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,744
Can't women have aspirations

95
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,459
or ambitions?

96
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:40,459
What's this to your Jin Kingdom?

97
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:51,860
Calm yourself.

98
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,459
I meant no offense.

99
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,980
I merely sought confirmation.

100
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,779
Though born female,

101
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,420
you possess profound knowledge

102
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,300
surpassing even that of men.

103
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,439
I harbor no improper intentions.

104
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480
I'll reveal your secret.

105
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,120
I just want

106
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
to fulfill my vow of loving my teacher.

107
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,959
And I hope you too can

108
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,199
love your student.

109
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,000
Why are you being so kind?

110
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,199
What do you want?

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,079
My demand is simple.

112
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,920
You must

113
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,160
tutor me privately every day.

114
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,279
That's all I ask.

115
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,920
I merely admire your intellect,

116
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,519
so I had to do this.

117
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,560
Please don't take offense.

118
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,199
Starting tomorrow,

119
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,040
come to my study hall after class.

120
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,759
This way,

121
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,319
our interactions will be deemed proper.

122
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,839
Now, rewrite from memory

123
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,560
everything we learned today.

124
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,639

can't compare to you.

193
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,120
Speak plainly.

194
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,259
No need for concern.

195
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,340
His Majesty remains unaware.

196
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:31,580
Given his advanced age,

197
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,379
he may depart anytime.

198
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,299
So I kept this thing quiet.

199
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:39,179
Is that a threat?

200
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,019
How could I threaten you?

201
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:46,460
Let's make a simple deal.

202
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,379
Help me ascend the throne,

203
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,940
and today's affair vanishes, okay?

204
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:56,740
I'll never

205
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,539
aid tyranny.

206
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:06,379
You pedantic scholar.

207
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:09,220
So obsessed with outdated morals!

208
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,379
You don't know what's best for you.

209
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:16,980
Fine.

210
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,220
Well then,

211
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,340
join my brothers in death.

212
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:27,980
Father,

213
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:30,700
Mother,

214
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,019
I fear

215
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,899
I'll never fulfill my ambitions.

216
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,940
Zhaolie?

217
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,500
How did you...?

218
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,539
Come with me.

219
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:02,500
We're safe here.

220
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,580
No pursuers for now.

221
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Who exactly are you?

222
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:17,700
The Nine Heavens' Sword Master,

223
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,539
Wan Guchen,

224
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,740
disguised as Prince Zhaolie

225
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,139
to travel in the Mortal Realm.

226
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,940
So you're an immortal.

227
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:28,980
No wonder you can use spells.

228
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:33,139
Can you save my students too?

229
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:34,299
They're innocent.

230
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,379
I can't interfere
in your political struggles.

231
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,980
Nor can I alter their fates at will.

232
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:43,700
Then why did you save me?

233
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,899
Wasn't that

234
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,139
meddling in mortal affairs?

235
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:49,940
Because...

236
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:55,220
you're different

237
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,700
to me.

238
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,179
So you could help

239
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,340
but choose to watch coldly.

240
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,580
Making me watch them die.

241
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,659
How is that any different
from killing me?

242
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,220
How could you know
the pain of killing your beloved

243
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:23,299
with your hands?

244
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,139
No matter what,

245
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,500
I will save them.

246
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,740
If you stand in my way,

247
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,980
we'll become strangers from now on.

248
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,299
The late emperor has passed away.

249
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,860
The new emperor ascends the throne.

250
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,779
By His Majesty's decree,

251
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,580
due to Bai Jinshu's escape,

252
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,259
all princes shall be executed

253
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,419
as punishment.

254
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,539
Do it.

255
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,620
Stop. They're waiting to capture you.

256
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:07,740
Go.

257
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,840
(Bai Jinshu,)

258
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,679
(watching your students
die before your eyes.)

259
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,919
(Do you feel powerless?)

260
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,080
(You couldn't even save them.)

261
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,919
(And you're their teacher?)

262
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,039
(If I were you,)

263
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,799
(I'd kill the emperor)

264
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,240
(to avenge them.)

265
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,840
- Long live the Emperor.
- Long live the Emperor.

266
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,639
Rise, everyone.

267
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

268
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,600
How dare you sit on this throne

269
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,840
after murdering your own brothers?

270
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I didn't capture you,

271
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,559
but you deliver yourself to me.

272
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,360
Since you insist on joining my brothers

273
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,799
on the road to the underworld,

274
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,600
I'll grant your wish.

275
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,879
Take him down!

276
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:45,879
Jinshu.

277
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,799
Jinshu.

278
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,080
Did she...?

279
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,120
I was wrong.

280
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,559
I was really wrong.

281
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,679
I'll give you anything!

282
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,759
Anything you want!

283
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,039
Please don't kill me.

284
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,200
Sir,

285
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,840
for the sake
of our student-teacher bond,

286
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,799
please spare me.

287
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:07,960
You...

288
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,919
Jinshu!

289
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,919
I've killed people.

290
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,480
My sins are unforgivable.

291
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,480
I can feel it now.

292
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,559
This energy within me

293
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,039
is slipping beyond my control.

294
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,599
As your teacher,

295
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,839
I'll assign you one final task.

296
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,519
That is...

297
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,920
Kill me.

298
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,640
Why does it always end this way?

299
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,880
Why is this my destined path?

300
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,039
My hands

301
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,160
are stained with blood.

302
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,079
Even if I survive,

303
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,400
my remaining days will be torture.

304
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,759
I beg you...

305
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Grant me this release.

306
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:19,920
Jinshu!

307
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,240
Jinshu.

308
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,759
Little fox,

309
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,359
do you know where Wan Guchen is?

310
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,960
If you do,

311
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,480
lead us to him.

312
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:34,500
(Fifth Life)

313
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,539
Who are you?

314
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,900
Why did you come here?

315
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,259
This fox has no idea
who she's talking to.

316
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:42,420
We're immortals from the Nine Heavens,

317
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:43,940
sent by the Immortal Lord

318
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:45,339
to recall the War God.

319
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:47,460
If you know Wan Guchen,

320
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,819
make him come out

321
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:50,140
and meet us.

322
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,380
So you're the hypocritical immortals

323
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,660
my master warned me about.

324
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,059
Provincial as expected.

325
00:20:57,779 --> 00:20:58,819
My master won't see you.

326
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,859
Your master is Wan Guchen?

327
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:04,099
Yeah.

328
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,900
How do you know he will not

329
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:07,299
see us without even asking him?

330
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,180
Since he's your master

331
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,380
and we're his fellows,

332
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,180
you little fox

333
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,339
should treat us with respect.

334
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,299
You don't look like decent people.

335
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:22,380
Be smart

336
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,819
and leave immediately.

337
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,259
This beast

338
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:26,420
speaks insolently!

339
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,220
Let me teach you a lesson.

340
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,099
Master.

341
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:47,660
Master?

342
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,539
You two,

343
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,019
she's been with me for centuries.

344
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,819
She's like family to me.

345
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,420
Why would you harm her?

346
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:55,380
And

347
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,539
report back to your lord

348
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,859
that I've resolved never to return.

349
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,380
Yeah.

350
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:02,539
Did you hear that?

351
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,019
My master won't see anyone.

352
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,819
If you refuse to return

353
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,019
but keep the title of War God,

354
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:09,500
how can this be tolerated?

355
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:13,980
If you have objections,

356
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,980
just strip me of this hollow title.

357
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:19,339
Enough.

358
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:20,660
Let's return

359
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,420
and report to the lord.

360
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:23,539
Tell him

361
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,180
someone fancies himself

362
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,299
and doesn't care for
the War God position.

363
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,380
Stop.

364
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:35,539
You frightened her earlier.

365
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:37,140
Apologize to her.

366
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,700
This is absurd!

367
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,299
We're Upper Immortals
from the Nine Heavens.

368
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:47,299
You want us to apologize to a beast?

369
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:48,339
Never!

370
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,460
She is my treasure.

371
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,339
She was playing

372
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:53,339
until you disturbed her.

373
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,779
If she's unhappy,

374
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,619
I become unhappy too.

375
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,660
What are you doing?

376
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,900
What's the meaning of this?

377
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,779
Let me go!

378
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:07,460
What's happening?

379
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,220
Forgive us, Great Fox Immortal.

380
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,539
We were wrong.

381
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:13,339
We were wrong.

382
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:14,420
We...

383
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,180
Please forgive our ignorance.

384
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,099
Great Fox Immortal,

385
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:18,339
please be magnanimous

386
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:19,859
and spare us.

387
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,259
Yes, please have mercy!

388
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:25,380
Well, Great Fox Immortal,

389
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:26,819
are you satisfied?

390
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,220
Yeah, pleased.

391
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:31,180
I don't want to see them anymore.

392
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:31,859
Master,

393
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:32,940
let them leave.

394
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,019
I'll listen to you.

395
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,579
I knew you'd always be good to me.

396
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:44,339
You...

397
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:46,099
No more acting recklessly.

398
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,099
What if you get hurt?

399
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:50,859
With you here, why should I fear?

400
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:13,220
Don't just eat meat.

401
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,259
Eat vegetables.

402
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:19,059
Master, feed me.

403
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,819
Drink less.

404
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,140
You'll wander off drunk again.

405
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:45,940
Understood.

406
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,099
I'll stop drinking.

407
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:06,019
I only drank a little.

408
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,579
I want more.

409
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:32,339
You're the best person in the world.

410
00:25:57,579 --> 00:25:58,380
Master.

411
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:01,259
The plum blossoms
in the courtyard are blooming.

412
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,339
Stop practicing.

413
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:03,660
Go see the plums with me.

414
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,099
You can go by yourself.

415
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,259
I don't want to.

416
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:10,140
I want you to accompany me.

417
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,140
What's so great about this sword?

418
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:16,339
I'll take it away.

419
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:17,019
What will you do?

420
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,660
Are you okay?

421
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,700
It's nothing.

422
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,819
Where are we?

423
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,380
Why are we here?

424
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,099
This is inside the Divine Sword.

425
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,019
We must have triggered
something accidentally

426
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:03,579
and got pulled in.

427
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,059
So beautiful!

428
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,940
The outside world is breathtaking.

429
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,579
Tell me whenever you want to go out.

430
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:16,900
I'll take you out.

431
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,380
Thank you.

432
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,579
Without you,

433
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:26,099
I'd never see
such beauty in my lifetime.

434
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,220
Those people mirror us completely.

435
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,599
There's someone

436
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,599

440
