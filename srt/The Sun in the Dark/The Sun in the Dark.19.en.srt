Bai Xiaoying, you...

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,680
Wanyan,

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,780
do you remember
how you beat me back then?

32
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,819
How does

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,439
it feel?

34
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,219
Bai Xiaoying,

35
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:17,319
what I regret least

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,419
was beating you, a wretch.

37
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,879
- Wanyan!
- Wanyan!

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,800
In your world,

39
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,919
you can do whatever you want.

40
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,960
Then in mine,

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
you'll taste what it's like

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
to be trampled beneath someone's feet.

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,560
Bai Xiaoying,

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,800
you're just a madwoman!

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,439
Even at my maddest,

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,919
I couldn't match a ten-thousandth
of your father's madness.

47
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:57,580
Your beloved father

48
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,860
disgraced his immortal lord title.

49
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:02,860
He's more despicable

50
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:04,659
than even that Night Deity!

51
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,439
- Wanyan!
- Wanyan!

52
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,259
Bai Xiaoying.

53
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,099
You're insane!

54
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,060
I remember you.

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,259
Among those who beat me,

56
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:22,840
you had a part too, didn't you?

57
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,539
So today, why don't you

58
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,539
experience it yourself too?

59
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,259
Master!

60
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,539
Master, help!

61
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,020
Master!

62
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:39,099
Master, help!

63
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,699
- Senior! Senior!
- Senior.

64
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,099
Wanyan!

65
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
You two

66
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,500
have committed your share of evils.

67
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,979
I'll leave them for you to handle.

68
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:58,939
Master!

69
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,180
Master, we are your disciples!

70
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,860
Master!

71
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,419
Master, spare us!

72
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,460
We've remained in the Nine Heavens.

73
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,099
We never went to Snowfall Valley!

74
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,460
Master, have mercy!

75
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,580
Don't do this, Master!

76
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,899
Spare us!

77
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:23,699
You won't show mercy now, will you?

78
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:26,819
Don't forget

79
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,779
when the Immortal Lord tortured you,

80
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,459
none of them

81
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:34,500
pleaded for mercy on your behalf.

82
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,740
That's not true, Master.

83
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,980
That's not true!

84
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,639
- Stop!
- Yunya!

85
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,420
You're a dignified immortal lord.

86
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Yet you willingly
became the Night Clan's lapdog,

87
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,839
even harming your own sect members.

88
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,019
You disgrace the immortal sects!

89
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,579
Who are you to speak?

90
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:02,420
Did you also participate

91
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,459
in the massacre of Snowfall Valley?

92
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:08,980
Enough.

93
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,819
What?

94
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,699
Do even you think I'm wrong?

95
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,180
Of course not.

96
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:25,699
Whatever you do,

97
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,980
I'll support you.

98
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,860
But if this continues,

99
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,899
they might all die.

100
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,899
Let's keep them alive

101
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,699
to torture them later.

102
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,180
It'd be more amusing.

103
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,699
Don't you agree?

104
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,620
Well said.

105
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:48,660
Guards!

106
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,779
- Yes?
- Yes?

107
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,540
Take them to the prison.

108
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:53,740
Guard them closely.

109
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:54,540
- Understood.
- Understood.

110
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,180
Senior?

111
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,060
Senior?

112
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,699
Senior.

113
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:04,100
I heard those
who joined Snowfall Valley earlier

114
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,980
were all slaughtered.

115
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,519
Bai Xiaoying imprisoned us here.

116
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,740
Does she plan to avenge them

117
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,860
by killing us all?

118
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,060
She's the Night Deity now.

119
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,740
Even without revenge as a motive,

120
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:14,939
when she decides to kill,

121
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,060
she needs no reason.

122
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,660
I wonder where the Immortal Lord hides.

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,439
But

124
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,060
he'll surely return to save us.

125
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,819
Today he didn't even
save his own daughter.

126
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,899
Don't expect him to save us.

127
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,839
That's not true.

128
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,199
Maybe something urgent came up.

129
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,899
Yunya.

130
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,259
Immortal Lord.

131
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,420
Traitor.

132
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,060
Are you here to kill me
for Bai Xiaoying?

133
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,139
You left the Stabilizing Pills
in my room.

134
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:02,819
I'm returning them.

135
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:05,300
A stable foundation

136
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,459
will make your injuries heal faster.

137
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,060
Yunya,

138
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,079
about what happened today,

139
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,720
don't you have anything to say?

140
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
What should I say?

141
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,579
Will you keep indulging Bai Xiaoying

142
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,740
to be so cruel

143
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,040
and watching us being tortured to death
without intervention?

144
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,100
What you did to her back then

145
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,860
was far worse than her actions today.

146
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,100
She almost died several times
because of you.

147
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,680
How can you call her cruel now?

148
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,079
Yunya, how could you say that about me?

149
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,620
That day I risked my father's punishment

150
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,019
to inform Bai Xiaoying to save you.

151
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,259
Am I really so disposable in your eyes?

152
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:14,459
Even if I bullied Bai Xiaoying before,

153
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,980
didn't you always protect her

154
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,459
and always oppose me?

155
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,579
Why do you react differently
when everything is reversed now?

156
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,300
She's tormenting me like this,

157
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,100
yet you aid her tyranny

158
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,180
and turn a blind eye?

159
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,779
If I truly turned a blind eye,

160
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,779
I wouldn't have come.

161
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,299
Enough!

162
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,039
Stop crying, Wanyan.

163
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:44,139
Stop crying.

164
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,500
You came.

165
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:20,419
I couldn't find you.

166
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:21,460
I knew you'd be here.

167
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:23,220
I came only

168
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:24,940
to see you.

169
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,600
This place remains the same

170
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:29,919
as it was before.

171
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:34,860
Yes.

172
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:38,700
But the immortal sects
aren't the same anymore.

173
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,620
You visited the prison?

174
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,659
I just went to teach them a lesson

175
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,940
to tell them

176
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,220
that your actions now

177
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,220
are retribution for what they did

178
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,059
and that they should reflect

179
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:54,419
and stop opposing you.

180
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,000
Yunya,

181
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,039
you've turned to me publicly.

182
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,299
It was a betrayal to the immortal sects.

183
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,639
Yet now you pity them?

184
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:08,980
What do you truly want?

185
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:13,419
I want to do

186
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,980
what I believe is right.

187
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:18,460
What's right?

188
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,740
Balancing factions

189
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,220
and weighing options?

190
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,659
Or being loyal to the Immortal Lord,

191
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:29,019
yet can't bear seeing me suffer
in the Nine Heavens?

192
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Or perhaps

193
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,320
having chosen me,

194
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,100
you now think
I shouldn't be this ruthless?

195
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,220
So tell me,

196
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,259
what right thing

197
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,019
will you do next?

198
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:51,059
I want the Xiaoying
from Snowfall Valley back.

199
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,539
Let's turn here

200
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,139
into Snowfall Valley together.

201
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,700
Don't mention that place!

202
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,820
This world doesn't need Snowfall Valley

203
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,580
or deserve Snowfall Valley.

204
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
Yunya, listen to me.

205
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:06,580
Face reality.

206
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,620
The person before you now
is the Night Deity.

207
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,460
Between me and them,

208
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,659
you must choose one.

209
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,940
I knew it.

210
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,460
You can't make the choice.

211
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,419
You always play the peacemaker,

212
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,899
leaving room for both sides.

213
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,820
You once saved me,

214
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,179
so I won't harm you.

215
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:42,980
Leave

216
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:44,740
and don't come back.

217
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,139
I told you

218
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:54,899
no matter what happens,

219
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,580
I'll always stand by you.

220
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,539
Actually, I don't enjoy killing.

221
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,259
Nor do I take pleasure in torture.

222
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,860
But I've just
conquered the Nine Heavens.

223
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,500
Many across the Three Realms
still resist me.

224
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:17,899
Moreover,

225
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,620
we haven't captured Feng Changgeng yet.

226
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,980
If I don't assert authority,

227
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,460
those people will think
they can trample on me.

228
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,220
I understand.

229
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,139
Whatever you need me for,

230
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,580
I'll do it for you.

231
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:35,379
I need

232
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,899
the Three Realms to know

233
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:40,340
who truly holds their fates

234
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,379
and who their real master is.

235
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,340
Okay.

236
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,179
This delicate Nine Heavens lady's skin
is too tender.

237
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,019
We dare not beat her.

238
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:06,360
She'd break too easily.

239
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,820
Lord has decreed

240
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,340
this task falls to you.

241
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,500
Now that everyone's present.

242
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,620
Let's begin.

243
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,580
Immortal Yunya,

244
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,340
if you don't do it,

245
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,259
I'll do it for you.

246
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,500
Yunya!

247
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:43,659
Bai Xiaoying has gone mad.

248
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,139
Do you truly intend to aid a tyrant?

249
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,460
(I'm doing this)

250
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,379
(to protect all your lives.)

251
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,299
Enough for today.

252
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:15,899
Don't damage them completely.

253
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:17,940
We'll savor their torment slowly.

254
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:26,700
Tie them by the Golden Light Gate

255
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:29,460
and guard them closely.

256
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:31,936
- Understood.
- Understood.

257
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,679
My lord.

258
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:30,179
Truly remarkable.

259
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,580
Even with just one soul and one spirit,

260
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,019
you can perform like a puppet.

261
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,500
It seems I

262
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,340
will meet him soon enough.

263
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:51,879
I failed.

264
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,860
No traces of the Immortal Lord
were found.

265
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,500
Useless!

266
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,019
The Night Clan's Right Envoy

267
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,860
can't handle such a simple task?

268
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:05,539
Please calm down.

269
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,380
Grant me more time.

270
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,859
I will retrieve the Immortal Lord.

271
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,500
If everyone offered such excuses,

272
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,859
how could I rule the Three Realms?

273
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:18,819
Xiaoying,

274
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,059
I've completed what you requested.

275
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,819
The Night Deity's name

276
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,859
and Feng Changgeng's flight
from Heaven's Gate

277
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,740
echo through realms.

278
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,380
His pride stings most.

279
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,579
He'll make his move.

280
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,779
I've bound Wanyan and the others

281
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,059
outside Golden Light Gate.

282
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,900
They may lure him out.

283
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,299
None but Immortal Yunya
shares my burdens.

284
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:39,299
Report!

285
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:43,900
Immortal Lord is near Golden Light Gate.

286
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,559
He's likely here for his daughter.

287
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,700
I see.

288
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,180
Keep vigilant watch.

289
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,140
Dismissed.

290
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,120
Understood.

291
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,660
Yunya has drawn out
Feng Changgeng for me.

292
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,259
He merits reward.

293
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:06,859
Hear me, Night Clan!

294
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:07,859
- Yes.
- Yes.

295
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:09,619
Henceforth,

296
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,599
Yunya's word is my command.

297
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,500
His every decree

298
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,420
shall be your law.

299
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,740
Disrespect towards him

300
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,299
is treason against me.

301
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,700
Understood?

302
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:23,460
- Understood!
- Understood!

303
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:29,740
Yunya,

304
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:32,859
having newly claimed the Nine Heavens,

305
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,180
I need capable allies.

306
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,740
Stay by my side.

307
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,140
Anything you want.

308
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,279
Name it,

309
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,059
and I'll get it for you.

310
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,140
In that case,

311
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:47,500
I'll ensure your worth is rewarded.

312
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,359
My lord.

313
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:04,500
Wanyan

314
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,059
is tied at Golden Light Gate.

315
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,220
I think

316
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,880
it's a trap to lure us in.

317
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:10,519
They're baiting us.

318
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,819
Their defenses are impenetrable.

319
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,059
With just five of us,

320
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,619
escaping unscathed seems impossible.

321
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,960
But abandoning her

322
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,460
would make us the realms' laughingstock.

323
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,859
They come fast.

324
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:40,819
Enough debate.

325
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:43,220
Today I'll reunite you all in death.

326
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,500
You destroyed my Snowfall Valley.

327
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,039
Prepare to die today!

328
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,940
Ye Chenyuan?

329
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,940
Is it really you?

330
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,099
How did you come back?

331
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:23,980
When did you come back?

332
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:26,940
Why didn't you tell me?

333
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,619
(Kill her.)

334
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:36,819
(She's the Night Deity.)

335
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,180
(Kill the Night Deity now.)

336
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,799
(Kill her!)

337
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:47,019
Xiaoying!

338
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,420
Xiaoying!

339
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,500
Yuan?

340
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:04,819
Why?

341
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:10,339
Don't you recognize me anymore?

342
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,660
Feng Changgeng,

343
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,140
this is your doing!

344
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:24,740
What did you do to him?

345
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,480
Nothing much.

346
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:29,380
I revived him.

347
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:32,859
I never imagined
you cared so deeply for him.

348
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:35,619
Pity he only retains
one soul and one spirit now.

349
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,140
He has no memories

350
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,220
or consciousness.

351
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,119
He only obeys my commands.

352
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,420
Tell me.

353
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,059
How can he be fully revived?

354
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,900
You want to completely revive him?

355
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:54,579
There is a way.

356
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,700
Accelerate his reincarnation cycle

357
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,500
and restore
his other two souls and six spirits.

358
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,259
If you submit to my authority,

359
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:06,180
this becomes easily achievable.

360
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:08,099
Otherwise,

361
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:10,980
I can have him perish anytime.

362
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,339
Don't believe him.

363
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,119
He just wants to use him,

364
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,940
whether human or ghost, to control you.

365
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:21,248
Immortal sects indeed manage
reincarnation across Three Realms.

366
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:23,059
But it needn't be him.

367
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:30,660
Yuan,

368
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,259
what's wrong?

369
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:33,140
Yuan?

370
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,900
Where's the pain?

371
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:39,339
Yuan?

372
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:40,779
Well?

373
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:42,779
Does it ache your heart?

374
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,700
Is it agonizing?

375
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,779
If you obey me from now on,

376
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:49,940
I'll stop immediately.

377
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
How about it?

378
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,380
If I hear correctly,

379
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,039
you're threatening me?

380
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,619
Haven't measured your own worth?

381
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,440
What gives you the right

382
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,819
to dare bargain with me!

383
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,500
Release Ye Chenyuan's restraints now!

384
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,740
Or I'll kill you this instant!

385
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:37,819
I

386
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:39,420
agree.

387
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:48,180
But during his revival,

388
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:51,339
you shouldn't kill my sect members.

389
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,380
Also,

390
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,299
I need to revive him
in the Reincarnation Gate's chamber.

391
00:23:58,299 --> 00:23:59,700
No disturbances allowed.

392
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,900
Deal.

393
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,900
Jiaotu, Hua Yuying,

394
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,259
keep Feng Changgeng watched.

395
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,339
Take all other sect members

396
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,259
to the prison.

397
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,220
- Understood.
- Understood.

398
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,539
Yuan,

399
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,059
let's go.

400
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,940
Let's go home.

401
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:32,090
(Huiyue Abode)

402
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:35,599
Do you know?

403
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:38,259
After you left,

404
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,960
every time I visited places

405
00:24:41,248 --> 00:24:42,880
where we shared memories,

406
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,240
my mind was filled

407
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,559
with your image.

408
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,140
I opened Snowfall Valley

409
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,940
not just to shelter the displaced.

410
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,440
I needed to stay busy

411
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,220
and occupied

412
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,099
so that

413
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:13,220
I could briefly forget

414
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,740
the pain of losing you.

415
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,339
I thought I'd never see you again.

416
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,380
Thankfully you returned.

417
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,579
Thankfully you came back to me.

418
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,700
Yuan,

419
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,500
after all we've been through,

420
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,460
you won't easily forget me, right?

421
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,339
(Kill the Night Deity.)

422
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:58,299
Yuan?

423
00:25:58,339 --> 00:25:59,740
(Kill the Night Deity.)

424
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:03,619
(Kill the Night Deity.)

425
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:06,500
(Kill the Night Deity.)

426
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,220
Yuan!

427
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,180
It's me!

428
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,420
Why has it come to this?

429
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,660
Ye Chenyuan!

430
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,660
I'm not the Night Deity
you want to kill.

431
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,819
I'm Bai.

432
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,140
Yuan!

433
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,819
I beg you.

434
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,220
Please remember quickly.

435
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:58,019
I beg you.

436
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,940
(Kill the Night Deity.)

437
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:09,779
(Kill the Night Deity.)

438
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:11,420
(Kill the Night Deity.)

439
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,180
(Kill the Night Deity.)

440
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:14,619
Do you hate me so much?

441
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:17,980
(Kill the Night Deity.)

442
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,672
- (Kill the Night Deity.)
- Are you so eager to kill me?

443
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:21,696
(Kill the Night Deity.)

444
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:23,539
(Kill the Night Deity.)

445
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,180
(Kill the Night Deity.)

446
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,720
(Kill the Night Deity.)

447
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,380
(Kill the Night Deity.)

448
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,539
(Kill the Night Deity.)

449
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,940
Why does Ye Chenyuan remain like this?

450
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,460
He even wants to kill me.

451
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,579
You promised to fully revive him.

452
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,180
Have you done anything these past days?

453
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,819
He only has
one soul and one spirit left.

454
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:03,740
Yet he still believes himself
an immortal sect member

455
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:05,140
and that you're the Night Deity.

456
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:06,940
That's why he wants to kill you.

457
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,759
I've exhausted all methods
to hasten his revival.

458
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,079
You know I used Immortal Attendants'
blood for acceleration.

459
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,660
But if we kill them all,

460
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:17,579
the Reincarnation Gate
will cease functioning.

461
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,619
That's not my concern.

462
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:27,220
That's your problem to solve.

463
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:29,660
There is one solution.

464
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,660
Night Deity's power.

465
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:35,339
Your blood

466
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:37,380
is more effective than that of

467
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:38,859
100 Immortal Attendants.

468
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,420
But if we do this,

469
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,900
wouldn't the Night Deity's power
return to him?

470
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:51,579
Then it depends on

471
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,619
whether you want him dead

472
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:55,859
or alive.

473
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,660
It's up to you.

474
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:29,579
He only has
one soul and one spirit left.

475
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:32,420
His memory loss is natural.

476
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:35,440
How can I blame him?

477
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,039
I should find ways

478
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:40,859
to help him remember.

479
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:48,339
Jiaotu.

480
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:53,420
Yes, my lord?

481
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,759
Order everyone

482
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:56,128
to rebuild Snowfall Valley

483
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,059
with haste.

484
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,420
