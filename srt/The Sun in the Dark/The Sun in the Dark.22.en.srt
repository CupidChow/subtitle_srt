If you take these off again,

30

Wear these for our wedding ceremony.

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,419
I never knew you looked so great in red.

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,340
We'll need more red garments
in your wardrobe.

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,939
What's with that look?

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,300
Our wedding approaches swiftly.

38
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,219
You should smile more.

My Lord,

40
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,460
the wedding arrangements are complete.

41
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,699

If I may make one final wish,

49
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,580
it's to become your bride.

50
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:35,300
Okay.

51
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:39,379

die.

61
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,459
When striking,

62
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,500
steady your hands.

63
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,660
Keep your stance rooted.

64
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:53,740
What brings you here?

65
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:54,500
Halt.

66
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,939
Yunya,

67
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,300
why are you here?

68
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,339
Relax. I came alone.

69
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:09,500
Bai Xiaoying and I
follow divergent paths now.

70
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,060
From now on,

71
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,300
I'll no longer serve her interests.

72
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:16,620
Yunya,

73
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,779
you aided Bai Xiaoying's assault
on the immortal sects

74
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,060
and then helped her
slaughter our members.

75
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,860
Now you come crawling like a stray dog,

76
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,139
seeking our sanctuary?

77
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,920
Why should we trust you?

78
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,459
My intimate knowledge
of their operations

79
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,660
and this blade at your throat.

80
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,459
You!

81
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,560
Yunya,

82
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:45,899
stop.

83
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:47,819
Elder Kongming,

84
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,899
I vouch for him.

85
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,139
Given our current strength,

86
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:53,779
he gains nothing through deception.

87
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:55,060
Moreover,

88
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,540
we need him more than he needs us.

89
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,620
They endured Bai Xiaoying's

90
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,660
unspeakable torments.

91
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,939
Their wariness is understandable.

92
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,259
Pay it no mind.

93
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,420
Let's discuss this outside.

94
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,939
During our immortal sect days,

95
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,860
you smuggled medicine to me.

96
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,600
That's how I knew

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,180
your honor still burned bright

98
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,939
and loyalty persisted.

99
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,060
Immortal Xiyuan
is gathering forces covertly.

100
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,379
During Bai Xiaoying's wedding,

101
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,620
we'll storm the Nine Heavens

102
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,819
and save my father.

103
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,720
Attacking during the wedding is wise.

104
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:58,540
But my true aim

105
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
isn't the Immortal Lord

106
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,779
but Bai Xiaoying herself.

107
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,300
Do you plan to kill her?

108
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:14,579
I'd never do that.

109
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,579
I mean to claim her

110
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:20,060
and make her mine alone.

111
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,300
You know my feelings for you.

112
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,939
Why torture me with these words?

113
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:29,740
Yes.

114
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:32,939
I've long known
your infatuation with her.

115
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,819
That's why I hate her so much.

116
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,019
But you've broken from her faction.

117
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,779
Why cling to this obsession?

118
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:44,860
Obsession?

119
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,500
Irony drips

120
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:51,459
hearing this from you of all people,
who kept pestering me earlier.

121
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,180
Yes.

122
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,779
When desperate efforts

123
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,899
can't match a rival in love's
casual gesture,

124
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:00,100
madness becomes sanctuary.

125
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,819
So you're joining us
just to use our forces

126
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,139
for your conquest of her?

127
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,860
Aren't you afraid I'll expel you?

128
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:16,040
That would doom your scheme.

129
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,339
Do as you will.

130
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,819
But only through me

131
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,100
can your father be saved.

132
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,519
The choice is yours.

133
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:51,779
What's wrong?

134
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,460
What?

135
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,820
You rarely show concern for me.

136
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,580
Yet you overreact to a single cough?

137
00:08:59,179 --> 00:08:59,379
I...

138
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:00,659
Do you want me unwell?

139
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,659
So no one will force you to marry?

140
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,659
Just to be clear, I'm fine.

141
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,179
Your wish won't come true.

142
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,340
You're irritating me now.

143
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,220
Get out.

144
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,860
(In his heart,)

145
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,899
(I'm just an irredeemable demon.)

146
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:34,460
(Why would he ever care about me?)

147
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,700
(I should be used to this.)

148
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:55,620
I made this soup.

149
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,620
Drink it while it's warm.

150
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:01,899
I never asked you to do this.

151
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,980
I did it because I wanted to.

152
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,779
I was just scolding you.

153
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:12,820
Aren't you angry?

154
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,940
Certain images keep appearing in my mind

155
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,620
with you in them.

156
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,139
But I don't understand why

157
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,340
I keep thinking of you.

158
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,980
(He's regaining
some spiritual awareness?)

159
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,259
Then feed me.

160
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,299
And I'll tell you.

161
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,980
(I can't reveal
the full truth to him yet.)

162
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:07,100
Actually,

163
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,379
we met long ago.

164
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:13,259
To put it simply,

165
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,659
we were lovers in past lives.

166
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,779
I knew you felt familiar.

167
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,259
What happened between us then?

168
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,139
I don't remember clearly.

169
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,059
But none of that matters.

170
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,259
What's important between us

171
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,379
isn't our past

172
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,100
or our future,

173
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,340
but the present.

174
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:46,940
If we cherish every current moment,

175
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,500
that's enough.

176
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:10,779
In three days,

177
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:12,700
it's Bai Xiaoying's wedding ceremony.

178
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,019
We'll seize this chance
to storm back to the Nine Heavens

179
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,220
and save our lord.

180
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,139
Are you prepared?

181
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,299
- We are!
- We are!

182
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,179
What's wrong?

183
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,019
I'm fine.

184
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:43,980
It's been a long day

185
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,740
and I'm truly tired today.

186
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,259
Why not carry me to the hot spring?

187
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,379
We're not going today.

188
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,019
I've realized

189
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,019
you're not actually torturing me.

190
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:58,220
You're helping me recover.

191
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,740
If this harms you,

192
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:02,940
I don't want it.

193
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,899
But I'm willing.

194
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:10,500
Your full recovery is my greatest wish.

195
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,259
Besides, I know my own condition.

196
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Take me there.

197
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:15,980
No.

198
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:51,659
In strategy,

199
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,220
you still have much to learn.

200
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:56,700
You must stop this.

201
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:00,580
For your sake,

202
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,460
I'll do anything.

203
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,740
Two days' rest will restore me.

204
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:10,419
Don't worry.

205
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,379
How could I not worry?

206
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,340
Today's the lantern festival.

207
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:24,832
Let's release lanterns
in the Mortal Realm.

208
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,100
- It's the Night Deity.
- Let's go.

209
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,460
Seems on this Qixi Festival,

210
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,500
we're the only ones floating lanterns.

211
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,700
Come.

212
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,980
I'll teach you.

213
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,980
First, close your eyes

214
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,340
and make a wish.

215
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,379
This feels so familiar.

216
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,860
There was someone beside me then.

217
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,700
It was you.

218
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,139
Whether in the past

219
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,379
or present times,

220
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,019
the person by your side

221
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:17,179
has always been me.

222
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,539
Though my memories remain unclear,

223
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:30,860
whenever

224
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,899
I'm with you,

225
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,700
certain images surface in my mind.

226
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,460
It makes me

227
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,779
believe you must be
someone important to me.

228
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:46,740
I hope someday

229
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:48,980
you can

230
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:51,620
tell me everything completely.

231
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,899
That day will come.

232
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,779
When it does,

233
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,980
I'll tell you everything.

234
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,700
What wish did you make just now?

235
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:17,339
I hope you can let go of your hatred

236
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,380
and let the world have peace.

237
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:30,980
What if I refuse?

238
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,299
If you could only choose one

239
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,180
between world peace and me,

240
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,339
what would you choose?

241
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,940
I choose world peace.

242
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,619
Because I know

243
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:51,539
that's the real you.

244
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:55,500
Turn back now.

245
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,180
But there's no turning back for me.

246
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:10,980
Listen.

247
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,819
Even if you give up on yourself,

248
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:16,140
I'll never give up on you.

249
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:50,539
It's time for their wedding ceremony.

250
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,579
Aren't you going to act?

251
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,380
The auspicious hour has arrived.

252
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,380

To the bridal chamber.

262
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:13,099
Wait.

263
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:16,299
Going to the chamber now

264
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,460
would be too dull.

265
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,299
Since this is my wedding day,

266
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:23,180
we'll follow my rules.

267
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:24,700

isn't that right?

269
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:28,420
Yes.

270
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:30,140

Xiaoying,

281
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,180
what have you done to me?

282
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:45,539
Don't worry.

283
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:47,220
Just a suppressant.

284
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,460
It won't harm you.

285
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,140
What's with all the scheme?

286
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:04,500

290
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,779
Xiaoying, no!

Xiaoying, you're my wife.

No!

can't give me what I want,

00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,940
Bai Xiaoying, where is Immortal Lord?

337
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:13,900
Release him at once

338
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:15,180
to atone for your sins.

339
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,619
To atone for my sins?

340
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:19,819
You people of Nine Heavens,

341
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:22,019
how dare you preach this to me?

342
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:25,539
Haven't you committed enough vile deeds?

343
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:26,900
What did you say?

344
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:28,980
Do you know

345
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,700
the Night Deity should've perished
completely over a millennium ago?

346
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:36,180
Your father
destroyed the Divine Sword's spirit,

347
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,140
causing the Night Deity
to revive every three centuries

348
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,740
and plunging the Mortal Realm
into suffering for 1,500 years.

349
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,740
All was just to make people worship him

350
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,180
and your Nine Heavens.

351
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,779
Is this your so-called
'protecting the Three Realms'?

352
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:52,819
Impossible!

353
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,019
My father didn't do that.

354
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,220
You're falsely slandering him.

355
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,740
I needn't slander him.

356
00:25:58,339 --> 00:25:59,740
Now that Yuan has revived,

357
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,660
Feng Changgeng

358
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,579
has no reason to remain in this world.

359
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,619
I'll kill him myself

360
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:07,299
in mourning for all the dead
he had caused.

361
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,859
Bai Xiaoying!

362
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:09,700
Form the array!

363
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:22,579
Xiaoying?

364
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:25,299
Kill the Night Deity now!

365
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,380
Yunya, you!

366
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,380
If you kill her now,

367
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,136
how do we save the Immortal Lord?

368
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,859
Your energy was drained.

369
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:46,900
You must have used Night Deity's power
to revive Ye Chenyuan.

370
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,460
Then the Night Deity's power

371
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,980
must be within you now.

372
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:53,819
Yuan,

373
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:54,980
are you alright?

374
00:26:58,539 --> 00:26:59,420
His magic is weak.

375
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,019
He has no Night Deity's power.

376
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
(How is this possible?)

377
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,339
Beings of the Three Realms,

378
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:22,099
from this day forward,

379
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,059
I am

380
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:25,500
the Night Deity!

381
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,180
The Night Deity's power.

382
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,980
Father!

383
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:56,339
Father,

384
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:58,099
the energy surrounding you...

385
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:00,500
is demonic energy?

386
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:21,819
Without the Divine Sword

387
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,859
to seal the Night Deity's power,

388
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,460
the Night Deity

389
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,859
will never vanish.

390
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:30,819
That's right.

391
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:32,980
I am the Night Deity.

392
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,740
The Divine Sword is destroyed.

393
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,339
Nothing remains

394
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,180
that can threaten me now.

395
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,180
So Bai Xiaoying
was telling the truth all along.

396
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,019
Judging by your look,

397
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:52,420
you've only just figured it out,
haven't you?

398
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:54,099
You planned this from the start!

399
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:56,740
You used Yuan's revival

400
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,299
to channel the Night Deity's power
through me.

401
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,420
Yet I've kept my word.

402
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,059
Haven't I revived Ye Chenyuan?

403
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,700
Pity that

404
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,140
you're now useless and worthless trash

405
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,700
in my eyes.

406
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,819
Therefore,

407
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,900
I must dispose of you.

408
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:17,339
You'll not harm our Lord!

409
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:18,619
Your Lord?

410
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,619
I am the Night Deity.

411
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,579
I'm your true Lord.

412
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,500
From this moment onward,

413
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,940
the Night Clan obeys only my commands.

414
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,099
Kill them.

415
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,980
And I may still employ you.

416
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,339
That's right.

417
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:37,940
The Night Clan

418
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,900
follows the strongest.

419
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,500
The weak either die

420
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,140
or submit.

421
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,099
But I despise hypocrites most
in this life.

422
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,539
And you're one of them.

423
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:55,019
I only acknowledge Ye Chenyuan
and Bai Xiaoying as my masters.

424
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,619
And you?

425
00:29:56,779 --> 00:29:57,700
Dream on!

426
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,500
Stubborn fool!

427
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:11,940
You cur!

428
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,420
Kill me if you dare!

429
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:17,299
Be shattered now!

430
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,259
Hua Yuying!

431
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:36,539
Lord Night Deity.

432
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:40,339
Hua Yuying betrayed Lord Night Deity,

433
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:41,980
so she ended up like that.

434
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:43,900
It serves her right.

435
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,500
Those who wish to live

436
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,019
shall follow me now

437
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:50,859
in serving Lord Night Deity.

438
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:52,539
Jiaotu,

439
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:53,259
you!

440
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
My loyalty lies with the Night Deity.

441
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,019
Whoever holds that title

442
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,619
gains my allegiance.

443
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,339
Now that the mantle has shifted,

444
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,000
my service naturally

445
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,500
transfers accordingly.

446
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:09,779
Wisdom favors the adaptable.

447
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,299
I appreciate clever souls like him.

448
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,819
Bai Xiaoying,

449
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,940
your vital essence is depleted,

450
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:18,460
and you're dying.

451
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,460
Let me hasten your journey.

452
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:21,980
