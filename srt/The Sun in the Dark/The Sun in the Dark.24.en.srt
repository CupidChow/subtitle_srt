Come out!

105
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,480
Let's settle this!

106
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,879
Xiaoying.

107
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,319
I'll hold them off.

108
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,699
You go first.

109
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,620
No way.

110
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,860
Your cultivation can't withstand them.

111
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,100
Deal with them before proceeding.

112
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,800
Deal with them before proceeding?

113
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,120
It'd waste a lot of time.

114
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:34,959
Exactly.

115
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,639
Leave them to me.

116
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,319
Why are you here?

117
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,519
Yunya is my friend.

118
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,680
He pleaded for my release back then.

119
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:43,839
Now,

120
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,319
he's been turned into
a soulless killing puppet.

121
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,720
I have to do something.

122
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,220
Sick of the Night Deity's
resurrection games!

123
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,259
This time,

124
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,060
I'll ensure him to die completely.

125
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,040
They say

126
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,699
high-level cultivators are needed

127
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,860
to be the Divine Sword
and the Sword Spirit.

128
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,540
Let me be it.

129
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,980
Count me in.

130
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,920
Guys!

131
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,779
Clear the path for the War God!

132
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,680
- Go!
- Go!

133
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:33,100
A day apart feels like years gone by.

134
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,200
Are you two so eager to meet your end?

135
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,539
Feng Changgeng.

136
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,539
You meddled with the very fate of
the Three Realms for 15 centuries.

137
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,440
Today,

138
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,879
I'll end all this.

139
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,720
So bold!

140
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:51,700
I advise you

141
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,639
to assess your situation

142
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,539
before making a bold speech.

143
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:00,919
Go ahead.

144
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,500
You are really of something.

145
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:15,980
Jiaotu.

146
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:21,620
Lord Night Deity.

147
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,879
Just give the command,

148
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,539
I'll kill them on the spot.

149
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,039
Then kill them.

150
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,899
Make it swift.

151
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,700
Don't let their filthy blood

152
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,899
defile the Moonview Terrace.

153
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,100
Understood.

154
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,419
Jiaotu.

155
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:01,139
You betrayed me?

156
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,059
I never swore to be loyal to you.

157
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,980
How can you say so?

158
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,120
You're abandoned and cornered.

159
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,379
Surrender now

160
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,539
and we might spare your life.

161
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,299
Master.

162
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,320
You all conspire against me?

163
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:46,340
Yunya.

164
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,220
Kill them all.

165
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,600
Yunya.

166
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,500
I once went astray too,

167
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:11,600
but you didn't give up on me.

168
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:14,100
And now I won't abandon you either.

169
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,279
Wake up, Yunya!

170
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:35,620
Yunya.

171
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:36,899
Do it!

172
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,539
Have you forgotten

173
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,419
everything we've gone through?

174
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,419
The Clear Spirit Ring.

175
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,779
Don't you remember it?

176
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,379
Master.

177
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:30,299
Xiaoying.

178
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,100
Right,

179
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,460
I'm Xiaoying.

180
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:39,779
The girl you picked up

181
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,379
and raised carefully

182
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,340
at the immortal sect.

183
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:50,460
Master.

184
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,100
Xiaoying.

185
00:12:59,539 --> 00:12:59,980
I...

186
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:01,539
Master.

187
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,220
You finally remembered.
