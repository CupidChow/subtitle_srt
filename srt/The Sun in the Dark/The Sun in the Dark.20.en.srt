You're going to attack me again?

Come.

29
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,420
I'll show you something.

30
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,419
Do you remember this place?

31
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,020
Xiaoying.

32
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,860
What's wrong?

33
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,500
I interrogated Feng Changgeng.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
Ye Chenyuan attacked you

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,240
because his soul and spirit left

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,020
remember himself as an immortal.

37
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:55,780
You're the Night Deity.

38
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,939
That's why he hit you.

39
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:58,900
I knew this long ago.

40
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:01,099
Yesterday, I questioned him.

41
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,139
You've already seen him?

42
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:04,060
Then you...

43
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,340
This part is drawn wrong.

44
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,300
You remember this valley?

45
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,460
Feng Changgeng told you...?

46
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,379
Don't speak.

47
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:22,379
See what he's doing.

48
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:44,699
Okay.

49
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:46,539
It's wrong.

50
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,979
Change it however you want.

51
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,020
- Xiaoying!
- Don't come!

52
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,080
He's just playing with me.

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,139
I know you didn't want

54
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,500
things to be like this.

55
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,919
Do what you want to.

56
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,919
I won't stop you.

57
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:26,459
(In the past,)

58
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,420
(you saved me
countless times from danger.)

59
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:32,279
(Now, it's my turn to help you.)

60
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,819
Did Feng Changgeng tell you

61
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,139
to use your blood to save Ye Chenyuan?

62
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,860
You mustn't agree.

63
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,860
There's definitely a trick.

64
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,639
I know what I'm doing.

65
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,420
You may leave.

66
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:56,980
(It seems)

67
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,120
(the Night Deity's power
truly aids his recovery.)

68
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,060
(Never mind.)

69
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,079
(As long as he can revive)

70
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,879
(and return to me,)

71
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,439
(I'll pay any price.)

72
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,480
This place holds many memories of us.

73
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,180
Do you remember?

74
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,620
No.

75
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,759
I was preparing
to become the Night Deity.

76
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,259
You stormed in to take me away.

77
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,560
You left with me.

78
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,779
Right?

79
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,160
Yes.

80
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,279
How do you know?

81
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,759
I just felt you'd follow me.

82
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,899
Xiaoying.

83
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,360
Are you hurt?

84
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,920
I'm fine.

85
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,180
I'll put him into the prison.

86
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:14,019
Wait!

87
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:17,939
This isn't his fault.

88
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,360
You misunderstood.

89
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,699
Having him stay by your side

90
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,259
will only harm you.

91
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,500
He cared for me tirelessly before.

92
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,459
Even in his current state,

93
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,699
I'll never abandon him.

94
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,540
But he doesn't even remember you.

95
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,300
Keeping someone like this close

96
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,019
isn't wise.

97
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,579
Hand him over to me.

98
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,899
Stop!

99
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,699
Yunya,

100
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,180
our matters are none of your concern.

101
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,560
Though you were once my master

102
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,259
and I remain grateful,

103
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,420
don't forget your current standing.

104
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,079
I'm not interfering in your affairs.

105
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,680
I'm just worried

106
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,899
about your safety.

107
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,160
With a soul and a spirit,

108
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,139
he can make you lose your reason.

109
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:22,939
These past days,

110
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,740
you've neglected all the affairs.

111
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:25,839
Enough!

112
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,019
This isn't the Yunxiu Pavilion.

113
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,100
You're no longer my master.

114
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,059
I don't need your lectures.

115
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,980
Right now,

116
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,460
Ye Chenyuan is my top priority.

117
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,700
Whether I lose my reason

118
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:46,379
or get killed by him,

119
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,740
I'll never let anyone harm him.

120
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,500
That includes you.

121
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:11,460
Still here?

122
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:30,980
Nothing in this world matters

123
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,419

you'd comfort me like this.

164
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,299
You try it.

165
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,620
It's okay.

166
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:08,860

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,399

172
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:38,720

173
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,259

You're crying.

176
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,340
I'm in pain.

177
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,100
Since you at least feel bad about it,

178
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,019
I'll reluctantly forgive you.

179
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:20,259
Lord.

180
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:22,700
The valley has been restored.

181
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:24,860
I got it.

182
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:26,500
Leave us.

183
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:29,179
Yes.

184
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,899
Would you like to see it?

185
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:51,328
(Falling Snow)

186
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,859
Did you remember something?

187
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,200
This feels familiar.

188
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:18,180
Your memories are returning.

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,019
Exactly.

190
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,099
This was where we lived together.

191
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:25,779
Our home.

192
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,900
After all these years,

193
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,579
we've finally returned here.

194
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:01,980
You may feel cold.

195
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,500
But I still feel cold.

196
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:12,480
What do you do?

197
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:20,416
♪Three sips of wine,
nine parts intoxicated♪

198
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:25,760
♪I watch splendor fade,
leaving solitude♪

199
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:30,528
♪Even crescent moons find fullness♪

200
00:18:30,624 --> 00:18:34,203
♪But shattered mirrors never mend♪

201
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:39,895
♪I don't know
whether to forget or remember♪

202
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,968
♪Borrowing a full moon from heaven♪

203
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:47,520
♪Cradling moonlight like broken glass♪

204
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,559
Watch out.

205
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,819
Follow me.

206
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,400
I've been here before.

207
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,380
Of course.

208
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,460
This is where you and I
used to stay together.

209
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,099
Seems your memories
are gradually recovering.

210
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:25,688
♪Night winds
stir the city's drifting catkins♪

211
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,673
♪By the embankment,
willows still sway tenderly♪

212
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:36,859
This clay figure was made
by us at the lantern festival.

213
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,259
Look.

214
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:44,352
♪Scene sparks words, I can't articulate♪

215
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:49,344
♪Even crescent moons find fullness♪

216
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:53,019
♪But shattered mirrors never mend♪

217
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:58,336
♪I don't know
whether to forget or remember♪

218
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:03,072
♪Borrowing a full moon from heaven♪

219
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:04,819
Are you okay?

220
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,539
I saw you there.

221
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:11,779
(His memories)

222
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,299
(are indeed slowly returning.)

223
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,299
As long as you're fine.

224
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:17,980
Take it easy.

225
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,220
Let's take it slow.

226
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,680
This remote place

227
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,220
is free from disturbances.

228
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:30,599
♪Borrowing a full moon from heaven♪

229
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,859
Only you and me.

230
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,039
Just us two.

231
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,700
Inside here.

232
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,779
Why did you shield me earlier?

233
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,220
I didn't want you hurt.

234
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:24,339
Don't worry.

235
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:26,420
I was merely caught off guard.

236
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,779
These enemies aren't worth fearing.

237
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,140
Are you okay?

238
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,799
Yes.

239
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,740
Some rest will suffice.

240
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,900
You protected me.

241
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,940
It made me happy.

242
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:09,900
Your joy

243
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,500
brings me joy.

244
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,799
(Controlling so many puppets at once.)

245
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,579
(That familiar aura about them)

246
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,160
(and their familiar moves.)

247
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,880
(You fool)

248
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,579
(shouldn't have done this.)

249
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,660
Xiaoying.

250
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,759
I know it was you.

251
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,799
I knew I couldn't hide from you.

252
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:41,980
Nor did I want to.

253
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:44,059
I never expected

254
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,400
we'd come to this day.

255
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,220
You betrayed me.

256
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,259
I didn't betray you.

257
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,420
Everything I've done

258
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:54,700
is for you.

259
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:57,019
Can't you see that?

260
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,660
Your power has waned.

261
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
The former you

262
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,660
wouldn't have been hurt by puppets.

263
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,740
I haven't.

264
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,779
Ye Chenyuan's become a monster now.

265
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,539
He survives on your blood.

266
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,759
If this continues,

267
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,039
you'll lose your life.

268
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:15,619
I'd rather play the villain and kill him

269
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,519
than let harm come to you.

270
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,079
How many times must I say it?

271
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:22,700
My matters with him
are none of your concern.

272
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,900
How dare you act without telling me?

273
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,779
Who do you think you are?

274
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,579
Do you truly respect me as your master?

275
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:33,440
Respect you as my master?

276
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,980
Bai Xiaoying.

277
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,640
Don't you understand
my feelings for you?

278
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,980
In my heart,

279
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,680
Ye Chenyuan can never compare to you.

280
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:46,019
You can abandon everything

281
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,460
for him.

282
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,380
If you listened to my words,

283
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,380
would I resort to
such desperate measures?

284
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,660
(He doesn't respect you
like he respected the Immortal Lord.)

285
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,779
Xiaoying.

286
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:00,299
(You trust him as your right hand,)

287
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:02,339
(but he defies your control.)

288
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,740
(He'll break free from you)

289
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:05,940
(and betray you.)

290
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:06,660
Xiaoying.

291
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,880
What's wrong?

292
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:14,819
Yunya.

293
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:17,940
You're too self-righteous.

294
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,819
Always trying to change me

295
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:24,220
instead of submitting to me.

296
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,519
Xiaoying,

297
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,819
calm down.

298
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,279
Don't get influenced.

299
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,460
You claim I neglect all matters,

300
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,940
but I ordered you
to conquer the Three Realms,

301
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,779
to uplift our clan's prestige.

302
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:45,700
Have you done it?

303
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:46,779
Xiaoying,

304
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:47,500
I...

305
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,880
You constantly oppose me.

306
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,140
Do you think I'm still
that low-level disciple at your mercy?

307
00:24:59,099 --> 00:24:59,779
Fine!

308
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:02,380
Since that's how it is,

309
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:05,859
you'll regret

310
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,460
your choices.

311
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,500
Xiaoying.

312
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:12,859
Xiaoying.

313
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,900
Issue my command!

314
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,180
Gather all warriors immediately

315
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,799
for battle!

316
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
- Yes!
- Yes!

317
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:54,180
No!

318
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:56,420
Xiaoying!

319
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:57,579
Don't!

320
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,259
Xiaoying!

321
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:06,099
Have you forgotten how they treated you?

322
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,420
Only by killing them

323
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:14,779
will your suffering end.

324
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,720
Angry?

325
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,880
Desperate?

326
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,079
This is my power now.

327
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,400
None can stop me

328
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,380
destroying what I wish to!

329
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,920
I'm no longer

330
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,880
the helpless Bai Xiaoying!

331
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,920
No.

332
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,339
Xiaoying.

333
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:50,900
This isn't your true nature.

334
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:52,660
The Night Deity controls you.

335
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,200
Can't you see this?

336
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,259
I am the Night Deity.

337
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,839
The Night Deity

338
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,880
is me.

339
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,146
(Falling Snow)

340
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,920
Lord.

341
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,319
Say it.

342
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,240
All captives are in the prison,

343
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
awaiting your judgment.

344
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:10,480
Perfect.

345
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,119
Let's enjoy something amusing.

346
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,759
Come.

347
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,759
I come today

348
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,920
to discuss a minor matter.

349
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,680
As you all know,

350
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,839
the Nine Heavens now
submit to the Night Clan.

351
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,440
From today onward,

352
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,960
if you pledge allegiance
to us and honor me

353
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
as your lord,

354
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,640
you may leave now.

355
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,160
I agree! I agree!

356
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:00,839
Please spare me.

357
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,720
And I'll return

358
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,559
to destroy all immortal temples

359
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,279
and worship only you!

360
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,859
Good.

361
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,599
Swallow this pill,

362
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,480
and obey henceforth.

363
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,720
- I'll take it!
- I'll take it!

364
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,480
This way.

365
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,400
We meet again.

366
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,680
I never imagined you two

367
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,759
would end up like this.

368
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,039
Well?

369
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,039
Must I take your pill too

370
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,559
to gain freedom?

371
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,519
Your friendship was with Ye Chenyuan,

372
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:50,559
not me.

373
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,319
Unfortunately,

374
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,799
he's forgotten you now.

375
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,839
Why look at them?

376
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,599
They can't even protect themselves.

377
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,480
Expecting their rescue? How naive.

378
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,279
Fine.

379
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,000
I'll take it.

380
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,200
We take this pill

381
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,519
and you'll let us go?

382
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,920
Exactly.

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:39,599
Pah!

00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,119
Bai Xiaoying.

385
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,880
Don't think we all fear you.

386
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,039
Listen.

387
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,319
We immortals would rather

388
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,660
die than submit!

389
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,819
Kill me if you dare.

390
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:50,380
Fine.

391
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,119
I'll grant your wish.
