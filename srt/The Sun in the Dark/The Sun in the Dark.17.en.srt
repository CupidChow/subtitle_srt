I knew you'd be here.

47

Master.

48
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:45,939
Your body...

49
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,219
I'm fine now.

50
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,580
If not for me,

51
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,539
you wouldn't have become like this.

52
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:58,780
It's not your fault,

53
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:00,219
but Ye Chenyuan's.

54
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,500
I know

55
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,939
your bond with him was special.

56
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:14,539
But the dead cannot return.

57
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,939
I understand what you mean.

58
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,579

59
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,379
wasn't that evil

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,699
as people claim.

61
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:33,579
On the contrary,

62
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,420
he was the most righteous
and gentle person

63
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,420
I've ever met.

64
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,420
Xiaoying,

65
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,819
no matter what happens,

66
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:51,620
I will always be by your side.

67
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,939
Whenever you need me,

68
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:55,459
I'll be there.

69
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,899
Thank you,

70
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,139
Master.

71
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,220
Don't hit me!

72
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,259
Don't hit me!

73
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:10,980
That's Rourou's voice.

74
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,860
I'll go check.

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,152
I'll go with you.

76
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:16,699
Don't hit me!

77
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,100
Senior, I didn't mean to.

78
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,500
Stop!

79
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:23,660
Wanyan.

80
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,579
What's wrong?

81
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,459
Master.

82
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,459
I was just teaching her a lesson.

83
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,339
Who knew she's this fragile?

84
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,959
Are you okay?

85
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,079
Xiaoying.

86
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,720
I didn't mean to.

87
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,060
Wanyan,

88
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,259
why did you hurt Rourou so badly?

89
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:52,379
How imposing you are when angry!

90
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,860
Listen.

91
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,879
She deliberately fell on me

92
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,560
and stained my dress.

93
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,379
This dress

94
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,220
is one of a kind in the Nine Heavens.

95
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,540
She can't compensate it.

96
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,899
I just gave her a minor punishment

97
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,540
as a warning.

98
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,959
As expected,

99
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,980
low-ranked disciples

100
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,259
are worthless in your eyes.

101
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,560
The Nine Heavens

102
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,959
isn't worth staying for.

103
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,199
Rourou,

104
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,779
leave with me.

105
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:35,104
Okay.

106
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:36,759
Stop!

107
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,540
Stop now!

108
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,379
Think you can leave?

109
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:38,779
Wanyan.

110
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,660
You can't stop them.

111
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,180
Don't embarrass yourself.

112
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,600
Just let her go.

113
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,600
This is...

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,560
This is

115
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,540
where he and I lived.

116
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,220
(This was our home.)

117
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,000
(You're gone.)

118
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,939
(I'll wait for you instead.)

119
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:35,019
(Maybe after 300 years,)

120
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,639
(you'll return like I did.)

121
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,740
(This is the only thing
my mother left me.)

122
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:24,060
When scared,

123
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,819
I feel her watching over me.

124
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,060
I want you to have it.

125
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,939
This way,

126
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,660
even when I'm gone,

127
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,100
it'll keep you safe.

128
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:40,820
(Take this figurine.)

129
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,460
(Consider this a memento of me.)

130
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,500
If my time runs short,

131
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,299
I'll allow you

132
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,785
to love someone else later.

133
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:06,496
- She's out.
- She's out.

134
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:07,648
She is War God, right?

135
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,120
Are you the heroine
who killed the Night Deity?

136
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
Why are you here?

137
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,659
The Night Deity destroyed our homes.

138
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,259
Our families perished,

139
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,460
and we became refugees,

140
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,820
so we had to survive by begging.

141
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,820
We had no idea how to go on living

142
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:32,580
until you slew the Night Deity.

143
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,019
Please take pity on us.

144
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,620
Grant us a shelter,

145
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,179
so that we can live on.

146
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,419
I'm begging you.

147
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:42,500
- I'm begging you.
- I'm begging you.

148
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,340
War God. I'm begging you.

149
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,419
If you truly have nowhere else,

150
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,620
you may stay here.

151
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,100
But you must sustain yourselves.

152
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,259
Thank you for sheltering us.

153
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,139
Thank you.

154
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,340
We finally have a home.

155
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,860
We won't be afraid
of being bullied by others.

156
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,100
Thank War God now!

157
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,240
Thank War God now!

158
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,940
No need.

159
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:07,039
Please rise. No need for this.

160
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Thank you, War God.

161
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,480
Let's go.

162
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,860
- Thank you, War God.
- Hurry.

163
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:15,659
Thank you, War God.

164
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,740
Thank you, War God.

165
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:28,980
What's wrong?

166
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,259
Why don't you go in?

167
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:33,440
Miss.

168
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,360
Are you an immortal?

169
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,059
I'm just an ordinary person,

170
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,080
like all of you.

171
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,940
Then why would you

172
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:47,019
take in homeless people like us?

173
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,960
Because a man once taught me to do so.

174
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,820
I want to become like you.

175
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,259
Okay. You will someday.

176
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,019
I swear

177
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,340
that I'll protect our home for you!

178
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,100
Okay.

179
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:07,220
Good child.

180
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,539
Let's go in.

181
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,259
Hmm.

182
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:16,352
(Falling Snow)

183
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,039
My lord,

184
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,879
since the Night Deity died,

185
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,679
the world enjoys peace

186
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,240
and people live prosperously.

187
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,879
What a joy!

188
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,600
What about today's offerings?

189
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,039
Have they increased?

190
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,200
Offerings remain sufficient,

191
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,360
but are decreasing day by day.

192
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,279
The Night Deity died,

193
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,399
and people live securely,

194
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,879
so they needn't make daily offerings.

195
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,700
This is their blessing

196
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,240
and immortal sect's fortune.

197
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,639
I understand.

198
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,759
You may leave.

199
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,519
Yes.

200
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,980
Luckily, I have a backup plan.

201
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,080
Keeping you alive is really useful.

202
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,000
(Bai Xiaoying.)

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
(Bai Xiaoying.)

204
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,840
(Bai Xiaoying.)

205
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,980
(Bai Xiaoying.)

206
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,500
(Bai Xiaoying.)

207
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,000
Why do I still dream of the Night Deity?

208
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,480
My lord,

209
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,080
do you need my help?

210
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,080
Yes.

211
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:16,580
It's a cushy job

212
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,840
that will make your name.

213
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,519
Thank you.

214
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,580
Seems I need more.

215
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,620
But before that,

216
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,740
I must make more preparations.

217
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:05,659
Go ahead!

218
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:08,899
Xiaoying.

219
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,179
Try this. It's sweet.

220
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,899
True.

221
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:31,720
Look!

222
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,620
Aren't those War God Bai Xiaoying
and Night Deity Ye Chenyuan?

223
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,139
Why are they so intimate?

224
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
How could the War God
and Night Deity be lovers?

225
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,919
Impossible!

226
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:44,159
The War God can't be a lover
to that ancient evil.

227
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,159
The Night Deity was evil!

228
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,460
Look over there!

229
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,100
It's really her.

230
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,679
They were lovers.

231
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:57,940
Who did it?

232
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,940
It's obvious

233
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:02,779
that the War God and Night Deity
were lovers.

234
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,460
Unbelievable!

235
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,740
Who could have imagined

236
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,050
the War God who should
protect the Three Realms

237
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,340
would collude with the Night Deity.

238
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,080
Disgusting!

239
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,740
You!

240
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:18,539
War God.

241
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,840
Are you feeling guilty?

242
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,419
If this weren't true,

243
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:24,580
why did you shatter
the evidence quickly?

244
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,779
- Exactly!
- Absolutely!

245
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,700
Guilty, right?

246
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,820
So it's all true.

247
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,940
I wondered how a young girl

248
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,019
became the War God.

249
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,940
So there's a huge secret!

250
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,139
Exactly.

251
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,179
Silence, all of you!

252
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:39,240
Xiaoying.

253
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,159
Don't mind it.

254
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,059
Let's go.

255
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
She's definitely guilty.

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Next,

257
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,399
the Night Clan.

258
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,879
(Bai Xiaoying.)

259
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,399
(Bai Xiaoying.)

260
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,120
(I'm right here.)

261
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,480
Night Deity?

262
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,000
Why are you here?

263
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,539
You summoned me here.

264
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,240
Bai Xiaoying.

265
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,639
You must feel indignant.

266
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,799
I don't understand.

267
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,360
You must be agonizing.

268
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,919
You simply loved Ye Chenyuan.

269
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,480
Why would others hinder you?

270
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,019
Have those foolish humans disliked you?

271
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:52,980
It's their problem,

272
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,799
not mine.

273
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,960
Do you really think that way?

274
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,480
Don't you care
even if the Snowfall Valley

275
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:03,899
perishes?

276
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,279
Shut up!

277
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,839
(Why do I keep dreaming
of the Night Deity?)

278
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,920
(There must be a reason.)

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,559
(I think the Night Deity died.)

280
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,039
(Is Ye Chenyuan)

281
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,880
(still alive?)

282
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,640
(But if he is,)

283
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,000
(why doesn't he come find me?)

284
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,160
(Perhaps,)

285
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,440
(the Night Clan knows something.)

286
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,359
Bai Xiaoying? Why are you here?

287
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,759
I only came to inquire
about Ye Chenyuan.

288
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,200
Ye Chenyuan?

289
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,079
Didn't you kill him?

290
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,059
I have no time for you today.

291
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,960
Immortal sect?

292
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,200
(Why is Xiaoying here?)

293
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,960
(I must keep her safe.)

294
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,039
Bai Xiaoying.

295
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,559
Didn't expect you're here.

296
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,119
Now I understand.

297
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,579
You really collude with the Night Clan.

298
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,640
Very well.

299
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:29,000
Today, the Nine Heavens
shall uphold justice

300
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,200
and eradicate you all.

301
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,960
Why are you attacking the Night Clan?

302
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,960
Xiaoying.

303
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,079
The Night Clan and us are at odds.

304
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,400
Stay out of this.

305
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,240
Leave now.

306
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:41,059
Look!

307
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,920
Bai Xiaoying,

308
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,839
do you truly protect the Night Clan?

309
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,319
Oh my.

310
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
What's War God Bai Xiaoying doing?

311
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:50,460
She's aiding the Night Clan!

312
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,660
I've been so blind.

313
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,839
I'll never trust her.

314
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:55,072
- Pah!
- What a liar! I'll never trust her!

315
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:57,500
You got me wrong.

316
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,119
I wonder

317
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,759
there might be

318
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,579
alternatives besides war.

319
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,819
Nonsense!

320
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,259
If it could solve problems,

321
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:08,880
why has the Night Clan

322
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,759
been doing evil deeds all these years?

323
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,279
Bai Xiaoying,

324
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,200
you've failed my trust.

325
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,039
You're such a disgrace
to immortal sects!

326
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,200
What a noble speech.

327
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,440
Ridiculous!

328
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,500
Who needs peace with you

329
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,039
wretched immortal sects?

330
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,359
Enough talking!

331
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,200
Whoever invades the Night Clan

332
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:31,920
dies!

333
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,119
(Why)

334
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,960
(can't we find the solution)

335
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,880
(after thousands of years' conflict?)

336
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,799
(What's the point of this?)

337
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,779
(And I haven't figured out
what happened)

338
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,279
(to Ye Chenyuan?)

339
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,059
(I have to stop them.)

340
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,640
Xiaoying.

341
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,440
Get out.

342
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,000
Master.

343
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,200
Sorry.

344
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,440
Bai Xiaoying.

345
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,640
It seems you're determined
to side with the Night Clan

346
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,839
to oppose the Nine Heavens.

347
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,680
Yunya.

348
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,160
Let's go.

349
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,940
Offerings have grown since that matter,

350
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,480
but Bai Xiaoying is now
colluding with the Night Clan.

351
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,440
They will become a major threat.

352
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,119
We should eliminate them now.

353
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,480
No!

354
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,559
Xiaoying only seeks peace.

355
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,920
She doesn't try to betray us.

356
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,519
My lord, please show mercy.

357
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:07,059
I know what's on your mind.

358
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,980
You brought her into the immortal sect

359
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,420
and repeatedly defended her.

360
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,579
I tolerated all this

361
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:14,960
because I think highly of you.

362
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,559
But now she colludes
with the Night Clan.

363
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,640
Are you still trying
to ignore the truth?

364
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,900
I am not defending her.

365
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,929
She wouldn't collude
with the Night Clan.

366
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,519
Please allow me to investigate

367
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,440
before taking action.

368
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,700
The evidence is clear,

369
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,680
yet you still try to deny it?

370
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,960
Are you buying time for her?

371
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,279
No more discussion needed.

372
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,559
I have to wipe out Snowfall Valley.

373
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,720
Please think it over.

374
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,559
As long as I'm here,

375
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,519
none shall harm her.

376
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,079
Yunya.

377
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,279
Yunya.

378
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,559
Yunya.

379
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,079
Yunya.

380
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,019
Please calm down, Father.

381
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:13,400
Yunya.

382
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,299
Apologize to Father now!

383
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,299
Yunya.

384
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,960
Tell me,

385
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,960
do you admit your fault?

386
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:33,960
My lord,

387
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,000
please spare Bai Xiaoying.

388
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,140
Calm down, Father.

389
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Move, Wanyan!

390
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,119
Drag her away.

391
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,000
No, Father!

392
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,079
No, Father!

393
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,519
Father, please calm down.

394
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,359
Calm down, Father.

395
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,519
Calm down, Father.

396
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,039
I've been so lenient to you

397
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,220
that you've forgotten the Nine Heavens,

398
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,039
your duties,

399
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,920
and even me.

400
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,359
Today I'll give you punishment

401
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,079
until you know your fault.

402
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
No!

403
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,559
Yunya.

404
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,779
Apologize to Father now,

405
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,980
or you'll die.

406
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:30,500
Father.

407
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,539
Father.

408
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:38,660
Father.

409
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,920
Please think it over.

410
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,380
Father.

411
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,299
Stubborn fool!

412
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:21,819
P...

413
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:23,859
Please

414
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,420
think it over.

415
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:33,500
- Father!
- You've disappointed me.

416
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,819
I invested in you so much

417
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:39,700
and cultivated you carefully.

418
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,579
This is how you repay me?

419
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:45,680
Guards!

420
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,660
Throw him out of the Nine Heavens!

421
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,940
Don't let him stay here.

422
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:51,539
No, Father!

423
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:52,460
Father!

424
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:54,180
Don't, Father!

425
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,980
Don't, Father!

426
00:25:00,224 --> 00:25:01,859
(Yunxiu Pavilion)

427
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:03,420
Where are you going?

428
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:04,779
Father.

429
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,779
I'm just bored,

430
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:10,859
and going for a walk.

431
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,980
I know what's on your mind.

432
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,259
You admire Yunya.

433
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,700
But for Bai Xiaoying,

434
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,980
he's become blind to reason.

435
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,819
He no longer deserves you.

436
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,980
Don't

437
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,220
care about him anymore.

438
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,559
I will find another man

439
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,839
who deserves you.

440
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:36,500
Rong.

441
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:38,819
Escort Wanyan back to her chamber.

442
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,059
Yes.

443
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:48,660
I am back.

444
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,579
Stop following me.

445
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,539
The Immortal Lord worries about you,

446
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,980
so I'm ordered to attend you.

447
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,660
(He claims he's worried about me,)

448
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:01,779
(but it's just a watchdog detail.)

449
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:03,140
Fine.

450
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:04,779
Make me some tea then.

451
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:05,779
Yes.

452
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,460
So hot. I can't drink it.

453
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:19,940
Useless!

454
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:20,929
Can't even make tea.

455
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:22,859
Please calm down, Miss!

456
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,180
Clean this place.

457
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:26,180
Besides,

458
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,420
don't come in
until you learn how to make tea.

459
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,380
Get out!

460
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:30,460
Yes.

461
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,859
I don't want to seek Bai Xiaoying,

462
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:50,059
but only she can save Yunya now.

463
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,819
Let's go.

464
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:01,880
Don't go.

465
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,940
Let's go.

466
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:03,779
Don't go.

467
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:05,619
Just go. Go.

468
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:07,259
Don't go.

469
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,180
Don't go.

470
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,819
Now in Snowfall Valley,

471
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:15,299
everyone except us

472
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,759
has already left.

473
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,559
Who would know the Nine Heavens
would be this despicable,

474
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:21,940
framing you with fabricated accusations?

475
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,839
We can't read one's mind.

476
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,160
And this is not my first time
experiencing this cruelty.

477
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:32,660
Xiaoying, don't worry.

478
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:34,700
I'll stay with you forever.

479
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,700
Rourou.

480
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:41,420
Thank you.

481
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,460
Xiaoying.

482
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,259
Look!

483
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,380
The Immortal Sect message orb.

484
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,490
(Wanyan: Yunya has been expelled
after severe punishment, now missing.)

485
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,900
Wanyan says

486
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,579
Yunya might be in danger.

487
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,420
But Wanyan is ruthless,

488
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:00,339
and always tries to eliminate us.

489
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:01,539
Can we trust

490
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:02,779
what she says?

491
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,380
Master is really in trouble.

492
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,380
Rourou,

493
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,859
you stay here.

494
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,940
I'll go find Master.

495
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:16,500
