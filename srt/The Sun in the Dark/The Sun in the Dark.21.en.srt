and you'll let us go?

Exactly.

00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:46,420

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,840
Bai Xiaoying.

Don't think we all fear you.

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,760
Listen.

34
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,159
We immortals would rather

35
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,480
die than submit!

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,719
Kill me if you dare.

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,280
Fine.

38
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,920
I'll grant your wish.

39
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:09,719
Zili.

40
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,979
You killed Elder Zili?

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,400
Rest assured.

42
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,580
As long as you sincerely submit to me,

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,759
I won't harm you naturally.

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,560
Not a chance.

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Immortal cultivators

46
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,039
will never become Night Clan's lackeys!

47
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,400
Good.

48
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,199
I do have time to wear you down,

49
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,680
but I'm afraid you'd break first.

50
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:05,099
(Is that you?)

51
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,379
(Who are you?)

52
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,159
(Sword Master.)

53
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,259
(Your duty)

54
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:17,139
(is to destroy the vessel
sealing the Night Deity)

55
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,699
(and eliminate the Night Deity.)

56
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,300
(Kill her.)

57
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,539
(Only by killing her)

58
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,979
(can we stop the Night Deity's reign
over the Three Realms.)

59
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,099
(Ye Chenyuan.)

60
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:34,280
(You're of the immortal sect,)

61
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,419
(the Sword Master of the Three Realms.)

62
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,819
(You must protect the world)

63
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,060
(from the Night Deity's reign.)

64
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,340
(Kill her.)

65
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,439
Those immortal cultivators

66
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,620
still refuse to submit.

67
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:52,500
Then keep torturing them

68
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,060
until they beg for mercy.

69
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:57,020
If we continue,

70
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,300
they might die.

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,560
That's not your concern.

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,460
Just do what I say.

73
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,599
Yes.

74
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:17,920
If you had recovered,

75
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,139
staring at me like this

76
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,019
would make me think you had evil plans.

77
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,420
What are you...?

78
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:48,920
Stop being so stern.

79
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,079
You could try smiling.

80
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:07,699
I once said

81
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,540
the same words to you.

82
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,399
Now,

83
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,660
you're the one telling me this.

84
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:20,300
Do you remember why I said these

85
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,560
to you?

86
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,459
I only remember the words

87
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,800
and saw you are upset,

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,939
so I repeat them to you.

89
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,480
I've been occupied,

90
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,920
feeling troubled.

91
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,819
But I feel better

92
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,339
seeing you.

93
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,259
Ye Chenyuan.

94
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,980
Do you know what you're doing?

95
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,220
Combing your hair.

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,399
Do you know?

97
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,459
When a man combs a woman's hair,

98
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,779
it means he'll marry her,

99
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,620
to stay together

100
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,860
until their death.

101
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,180
I don't.

102
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,860
But I can ask.

103
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,139
What's there to ask?

104
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:37,220
Since you've combed my hair,

105
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,220
you are mine now.

106
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,620
In that case,

107
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,000
you must grant me a wish.

108
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,779

00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,860

new ways to torture us.

Go back and tell Bai Xiaoying

142
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,659
we're not afraid.

143
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:50,659
Time's running out.

144
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,139
Leave now.

145
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,340
You don't kill us,

146
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,179
but let us go?

147
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:02,659
You serve Bai Xiaoying.

148
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,460
Why let us escape?

149
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,500
Just kill us.

150
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,220
Exactly.

151
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,940
They've definitely set a trap,

152
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:12,620
waiting for us to fall into it.

153
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:14,139
We won't take the bait.

154
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,940
Don't trust him.

155
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,980
I don't know who I am.

156
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,940
I'm releasing you

157
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:22,899

158
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:24,419

159
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:26,100
it's up to you.

160
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:33,419
Leave.

161
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,019
No matter what,

162
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,139
give it a try.

163
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:36,899
Exactly.

164
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,220
Immortal Xiyuan is right.

165
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,539
We have to give it a try.

166
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:41,580
Let's go.

167
00:10:42,944 --> 00:10:43,520
Let's go.

168
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:50,059
Ye Chenyuan.

169
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,500
Maybe only you

170
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,179
can save Bai Xiaoying.

171
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,100
At midnight,

172
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,639
you're not asleep.

173
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,740
What did you do?

174
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:26,679
I...

175
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,559
I...

176
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,379
Why would you defy me?

177
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:39,580
You think I've done wrong too?

178
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,340
Do you know how those people treated us?

179
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:46,259
We've suffered much.

180
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,039
It's all their fault.

181
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,580
Fine.

182
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,019
I've been too lenient with you.

183
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,620
Since you let them go,

184
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,559
then you shall

185
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,759
atone for their sins.

186
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,379
You should

187
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,179
be familiar with this place.

188
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,740
But this time,

189
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,340
it'll be different.

190
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,379
What comes next

191
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,259
is my grand gift for you.

192
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,620
This herbal bath was special for you.

193
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,620
You defied me.

194
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,620
I bet this small pain

195
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:07,500
would be nothing to you.

196
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:12,860
Does doing this

197
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:15,059
bring you joy?

198
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,899
Of course.

199
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:24,580
Why not?

200
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:27,419
Everything

201
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,779
I've done

202
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,820
is all for you.

203
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,580
I've done so much for you,

204
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,460
just to be with you,

205
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,179
yet you betrayed me!

206
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:44,100
Listen.

207
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,379
You are mine.

208
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,100
From now on,

209
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:51,820
don't even think of defying me.

210
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,500
First bow to heaven and earth!

211
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,179
Second bow to the parents!

212
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,259
The couple bows to each other!

213
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,620
Then why

214
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,220
have I already married?

215
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:11,539
I-I saw

216
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,259
the cabin in Snowfall Valley.

217
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,419
I was performing wedding rites.

218
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,419
Yes.

219
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,100
We married.

220
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:25,019
You remember now?

221
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:30,220
Pity

222
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:34,820
we didn't complete the rites.

223
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,860
But that's fine.

224
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,019
After we properly hold the wedding,

225
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,419
from then on,

226
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:47,299
we'll be a legitimate couple.

227
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:33,700
Look at me.

228
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,019
(Yunya was right.)

229
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,980
(My body won't last long.)

230
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,139
(But Ye Chenyuan has only retrieved
some of his souls and spirits.)

231
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,620
(I can't wait any longer.)

232
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,980
I've already arranged it.

233
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,580
In ten days,

234
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,139
we'll hold the wedding.

235
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:46,500
I didn't agree.

236
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,340
I'm here to inform you,

237
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,659
not to seek your approval.

238
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:56,032
(Wedding Invitation)

239
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,099
Here, this is yours.

240
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:20,900
Take it slow.

241
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,500
Chief, everything is ready.

242
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,380
Good. Go ahead.

243
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,660
Sorry for bothering you.

244
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:31,980
By the way,

245
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:33,539
I've brought you the antidote.

246
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,539
Ye Chenyuan stole it from Bai Xiaoying.

247
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,240
Thank you.

248
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:52,500
We should be thanking you.

249
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,259
If you hadn't taken us in,

250
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:56,660
we'd have been captured
by Bai Xiaoying long ago.

251
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:00,619
I think it's because

252
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,220
Bai Xiaoying and Ye Chenyuan
will hold the wedding in ten days.

253
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,619
They probably

254
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,059
don't have time

255
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:10,779
for you now.

256
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,900
So,

257
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,259
in ten days,

258
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,619
it will be our best chance
to rescue the Immortal Lord.

259
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:33,900
Hurry up.

260
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,799
The Lord's wedding is in ten days.

261
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,019
Be careful of everything.

262
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,960
Be quick.

263
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,380
Rest assured.

264
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,619
Weakening Powder makes you weak,

265
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,859
but won't physically harm you.

266
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,579
After our wedding,

267
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,140
you'll get the antidote.

268
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:55,380
Stop this.

269
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,019
It's still not too late.

270
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:03,140
Never.

271
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,900
Take a rest here.

272
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:12,861
I'll check on our wedding attire.

273
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,559
This revised one looks better.

274
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,380
Come try it.

275
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:48,700
Ye Chenyuan!

276
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,920
Find him.

277
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,259
He can't have gone far.

278
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:00,700
Search every corner of the Three Realms

279
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,299
to bring him back to me.

280
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,140
- Understood.
- Understood.

281
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,160
Ye Chenyuan.

282
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:25,960
Why?

283
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,839
I drugged you,

284
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:29,960
and you can't escape.

285
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,759
Why still try to escape?

286
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,460
Do you hate me that much?

287
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,279
Would rather die than marrying me?

288
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,440
You

289
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,839
will regret this.

290
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Let's see

291
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,000
whether I

292
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,700
or you will regret this.

293
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,079
It's you.

294
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,579
I came to congratulate Xiaoying,

295
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:24,920
but she's not here.

296
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,559
So I came here.

297
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,759
I didn't expect

298
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
you let the Nine Heavens people go

299
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,039
and tried to escape.

300
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,079
Moreover,

301
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,000
despite all this,

302
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,440
she still insists on marrying you.

303
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,279
It seems

304
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,680
everything I've done

305
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,039
to protect her

306
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,200
is just like a joke.

307
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,200
But you

308
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,319
will harm her.

309
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,799
Why?

310
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,200
To make you remember her

311
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,440
and retrieve all your souls and spirits,

312
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,119
she gives all her power to you,

313
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,039
yet she is growing weaker.

314
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,039
Can't you see that?

315
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,759
Everything Xiaoying is doing now

316
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,960
is out of desperateness.

317
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
She's venting,

318
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,240
indulging, and retaliating.

319
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,359
She disregards anything,

320
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,400
with no rationality.

321
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,079
She is destroying herself.

322
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,279
You're telling me this

323
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:32,880
t-to get me to stop her?

324
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,480
No one can stop her.

325
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:37,799
And you

326
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,119
will be the final nail in her coffin.

327
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,200
Why?

328
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,059
Why?

329
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,359
Because fate determines

330
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,880
she must be killed by you.

331
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,414
She's long realized

332
00:22:57,414 --> 00:22:58,464
when you're fully revived,

333
00:22:58,464 --> 00:22:59,324
it will be her doom.

334
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,759
So, she indulges herself

335
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:02,720
like a mad person.

336
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,400
When it happens,

337
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,960
her end will please everyone.

338
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,460
You won't feel guilty

339
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,640
over her death.

340
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:15,740
What should I do?

341
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,960
With you here,

342
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,680
Xiaoying would act recklessly.

343
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,759
Only when you truly vanish

344
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,039
can all of this truly end.

345
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,680
Why am I even telling you this?

346
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,000
Tomorrow is your grand wedding day.

347
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,480
Congratulations.

348
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,400
Xiaoying should be back soon.

349
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,000
I'll go check.

350
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,940
Ye Chenyuan!

351
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,559
Ye Chenyuan!

352
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:17,480
Ye Chenyuan.

353
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,640
You're joking, right?

354
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
I made you upset by locking you up,

355
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,019
so you're doing this to punish me.

356
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,240
I was wrong.

357
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,119
I was wrong.

358
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:39,720
Please wake up.

359
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,240
Just wake up.

360
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,759
I'll agree to anything you say.

361
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,359
Ye Chenyuan.

362
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,079
Ye Chenyuan.

363
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,099
Do you think this is your escape?

364
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,880
I won't let you leave me.

365
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,359
What?

366
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,720
Disappointed that you're alive?

367

Ye Chenyuan.

384
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,640
You've hurt me,

385
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,839
defied me,

386
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,440
and I kept tolerating
and accommodating you.

387
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,319
Yet you kept pushing my boundaries

388
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,279
and challenging me.

389
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,039
But this time,

390
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,039
you've crossed my bottom line.

391
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,039

I want you to remember this feeling.

including your life,

is under my control.

Yet you didn't behave,

409
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,160
and tried to ask him
to kill himself under my watch.

410
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,000
Do you want to die?

411
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,079
I do.

flirt in front of me

For you, I lost my left arm,

417
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
betrayed my sect,

418
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:16,359
and joined the Night Clan.

419
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,960
I don't care all the blames.

420
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,319
But now,

421
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,599
you're this heartless to me?

422
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,200
You love me,

423
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,160
yet I never care for you.

424
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,680
Can't I be heartless to you?

425
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:34,519
Why?

426
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,680
Is everything I've done

427
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,880
for you just a joke?

428
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,839
Xiaoying.

429
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,759
I know

430
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,759
you didn't say it from your heart.

431
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,400
But the Night Deity controls you.

432
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,279
Right?

433
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,400
