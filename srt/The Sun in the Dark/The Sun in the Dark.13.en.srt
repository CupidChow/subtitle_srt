I'll vanish completely.

29
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,480
Right?

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,040
Is there any way

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,599
to eliminate the Night Deity within me?

32
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,640
Only the Sword Master
with the Divine Sword

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,599
can oppose him.

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,319
Are you saying

35
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,840
that if I lose control then,

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,120
you'll have to kill me personally?

37
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,280
I'll never let my life

38
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,879
lie in someone else's hand.

39
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,800
I refuse to believe

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,280
there's no other way

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,919
to suppress him
in the vast Three Realms.

42
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,159
Nor do I.

43
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,080
We'll find a solution.

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,560
Yes.

45
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,599
Right.

46
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,319
I heard

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,439
that descendants of Shennong
and those from Kunlun Ruins

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,000
possess many mystical arts.

49
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,599
Let's go look.

50
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,240
No need to rush.

51
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,000
Heal your injuries first.

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,400
I won't travel with dead weight.

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,599
Rest properly first.

54
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Our leader's not back.

55
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,159
Please stay here for two days.

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Once the leader returns,

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,919
I'll summon you both.

58
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,800
Thank you.

59
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,960
Suit yourself.

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,159
Let me do it.

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,159
Legends say the Shennong Clan nurtures
a thousand-year-old Fireflow Fungus

62
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,599
that can suppress demonic energy.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,719
But its growth requirements
are extremely specific,

64
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,159
and there's been no trace of it
in recent years.

65
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,400
I'm afraid...

66
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,080
Afraid of what?

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,159
You claimed

68
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,719
you wouldn't let your life

69
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,840
lie in someone else's hand.

70
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,039
We haven't even met them yet,

71
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,199
but you're already doubting yourself.

72
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,840
I'm not.

73
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,379
Right.

74
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,379
On that street earlier,

75
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,060
I saw a pastry shop

76
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,300
with treats I've never tried.

77
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:28,100
Go buy some for me.

78
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:30,339
Let's go.

79
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,019
It's too far. I don't want to go.

80
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,180
Fine. To thank you,

81
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,420
I'll cook tonight.

82
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,259
How's that?

83
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,500
I want fish.

84
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,620
Got it.

85
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:45,420
Just wait.

86
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:10,660
Back off!

87
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,860
Whatever you are,

88
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,180
I won't submit!

89
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:31,500
Chuli?

90
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:33,300
Chuli?

91
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,139
Chuli?

92
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:36,139
Chuli?

93
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,180
Chuli?

94
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,420
What's wrong?

95
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,779
Chuli?

96
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:43,819
How was that?

97
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,420
Just kidding.

98
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:48,339
Scared you, didn't I?

99
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,740
My acting was convincing, right?

100
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,459
That was silly.

101
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,899
What's silly about it?

102
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,899
I just wanted to see if you care.

103
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,620
The more you care,

104
00:05:58,819 --> 00:05:59,819
the more you love me.

105
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,339
The more you love me,

106
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,300
the happier I am.

107
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:24,220
Smile.

108
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,100
Stop frowning all the time.

109
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,740
Didn't you want my care?

110
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,259
That was before.

111
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,459
Now I've changed my mind.

112
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,459
I'm difficult to please.

113
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:39,379
So what?

114
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:40,819
Don't you like that?

115
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:42,939
I do.

116
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,660
I love every part of you.

117
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,399
I'm already aware

118
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,920
of your purpose here.

119
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,560
This young lady

120
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,879
has been invaded by demonic energy.

121
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,519
The Fireflow Fungus could suppress it,

122
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
but unfortunately

123
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,600
it became extinct

124
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,399
eight centuries ago.

125
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,220
However,

126
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:33,980
I heard

127
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,300
the Black River Grass
unique to Kunlun Mountain

128
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,420
can suppress demonic energy.

129
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,420
It might be worth trying.

130
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,740
So bitter.

131
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:04,939
Black River Grass is indeed bitter.

132
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:10,819
Well?

133
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:15,660
How do you feel?

134
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:20,060
Some of the demonic energy
within me has been suppressed.

135
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,139
This medicine works.

136
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,540
(This medicine has minimal effect.)

137
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,500
(It can't cure her at all.)

138
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,379
I must not have drunk enough yet.

139
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,980
This medicine is unbearably bitter.

141
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,179
feed it to me.

142
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:08,740
It's no longer bitter.

143
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,419

I mean before me.

192
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,899
Answer truthfully.

193
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,940
Before you?

194
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:22,940
Yes.

195
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,580
It was still you.

196
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,860
I never knew you were so smooth-tongued.

197
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,139
Fine.

198
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:36,139
I won't press if you won't tell.

199
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,940
Mystery makes you
more intriguing anyway.

200
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,740
I'm not lying.

201
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,019
Centuries ago, I told you I loved you.

202
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:50,179
But you forgot.

203
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,340
Alright.

204
00:12:59,019 --> 00:12:59,899
I believe you.

205
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,980
At least we didn't miss each other.

206
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,980
Let's not miss each other ever again.

207
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:14,580
We won't.

208
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:17,899
Whether in the past,

209
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:19,539
present,

210
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,019
or future,

211
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,980
I'll always find you

212
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:29,259
and fall for you again.

213
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,419
Young lady, care for a clay figurine?

214
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:55,620
Sure.

215
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,500
Sir,

216
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,220
make one in my likeness.

217
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:04,379
Got it.

218
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:11,700
So tiny.

219
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,220
It's done.

220
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,700
Careful.

221
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,779
Thank you.

222
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,419
Thank you.

223
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,539
Thank you.

224
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:30,299
Doesn't resemble you.

225
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,500
What do you mean?

226
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,340
It's quite good.

227
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:44,139
Take this figurine.

228
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,179
Keep it safe.

229
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,580
For me?

230
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,340
Yes.

231
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,779
I don't know

232
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,659
if my body will ever heal fully.

233
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,100
Consider this a memento of me.

234
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,419
If someday

235
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,919
I'm truly nearing my end,

236
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:15,539
I'll allow you

237
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:17,179
to love someone else later.

238
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:28,100
However,

239
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,779
I have one condition.

240
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:33,899
That is,

241
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,779
you must never forget me.

242
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,700
Normally,

243
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,740
you can keep it stored away.

244
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:48,779
No need to display it publicly.

245
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,059
And no need to think of me daily.

246
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,419
Just

247
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,539
when you occasionally see it,

248
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,179
remember me then.

249
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:11,700
How's that?

250
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:23,899
I promise.

251
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,500
I won't forget

252
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,820
anything that happened between us.

253
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,100
But you...

254
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:46,899
When we meet again,

255
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:49,740
don't make me wait too long.

256
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,500
(Medicine)

257
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,100
How is it?

258
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,320
(Falling Snow)

259
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,900
Tomorrow we'll head to Chaos Valley.

260
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,420
There must be a way to save you there.

261
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:37,059
Do you know

262
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,180
that in my heart

263
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,019
you're actually unique

264
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,180
and potent medicine?

265
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:50,688
A Night Clan member?

266
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,859
I've never seen you before.

267
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:56,220
Hua Yuying, Night Clan's Left Envoy.

268
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,259
Please return with me, Night Deity.

269
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm an ordinary Night Clan member
without demonic bone.

270
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,019
You've got the wrong person.

271
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,859
I won't return with you.

272
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:09,980
Under Demon Heart Hall

273
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,740
lies our clan's sacred spring

274
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,819
called Asura Spring.

275
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,339
It has healing properties.

276
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,900
Miss Bai, even if you refuse
to become the Night Deity,

277
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,900
you can still enhance your power

278
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,019
and recover there.

279
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,259
In that case,

280
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,619
let's go.

281
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:30,259
It's Night Clan's place.

282
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
It's dangerous.

283
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,420
While there's any hope,

284
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,099
we mustn't give up.

285
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:37,180
And with my cultivation level,

286
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,380
I've nothing to fear.

287
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,380
Then I demand he accompanies me.

288
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:51,019
And you must guarantee

289
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:53,099
we won't be separated.

290
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:55,180
Of course.

291
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,059
Hail the Night Deity!

292
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,208
- Hail the Night Deity!
- Hail the Night Deity!

293
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:20,259
I'm not the Night Deity.

294
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,059
My name is Bai Chuli.

295
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,779
Don't mind it, Miss Bai.

296
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,220
This is Jiaotu, our Right Envoy.

297
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,259
He'll escort you to Asura Spring.

298
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,019
Hold.

299
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,359
He cannot go.

300
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:40,940
Why?

301
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,940
We agreed beforehand

302
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,299
we wouldn't be separated.

303
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:47,140
You must understand, Miss Bai.

304
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:49,779
Asura Spring is our sacred site.

305
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,299
No outsiders may enter.

306
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:54,460
I'll take this immortal to rest.

307
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,259
Just follow Jiaotu, Miss Bai.

308
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:58,700
It'll be fine.

309
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:03,660
Please, Miss Bai.

310
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,579
Immortal, this way, please.

311
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:22,019
Miss Bai, please.

312
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,328
- Hail the Night Deity!
- Hail the Night Deity!

313
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,180
What are you doing?

314
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:51,299
Get up quickly!

315
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,819
For centuries,
Night Clan lacked leadership

316
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,339
and suffered Nine Heavens' oppression.

317
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:00,299
Now that the Night Deity returns,

318
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,660
our power shall soon multiply.

319
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:06,059
Miss Bai, we implore you
to lead us against Nine Heavens.

320
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:09,619
Didn't I clarify before coming?

321
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:11,380
I'm only here to recuperate.

322
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,180
If you break our agreement,

323
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,779
Chen and I will leave.

324
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:24,900
You can't leave as you wish.

325
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:29,339
What do you mean?

326
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,460
No.

327
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,019
Chen!

328
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,660
You distracted Chuli

329
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:46,660
just to ambush me?

330
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,579
Worthy of being Sword Master.

331
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:51,539
But unfortunately,

332
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,259
you won't survive tonight.

333
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,779
Cease your futile efforts.

334
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,940
Chuli will never agree
to become Night Deity.

335
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:00,859
I'm taking her away now.

336
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,619
You can't take her away.

337
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,259
Sword Master, don't you want to know

338
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,660
why we dare challenge you

339
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:14,380
despite this vast power gap?

340
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:19,180
You used such underhanded tactics!

341
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,700
The Sword Master is poisoned.

342
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:22,740
Attack him!

343
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,339
I know

344
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:28,299
the Night Deity's return

345
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:30,900
can empower the Night Clan.

346
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,180
So you've elaborately schemed this.

347
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,900
But if I die now,

348
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,980
you'll gain nothing.

349
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:51,559
Chuli.

350
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,539
Chuli,

351
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:58,220
what are you doing?

352
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,539
We finally reunited.

353
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,539
Don't abandon me.

354
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,420
Were you captured and forced

355
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,380
to say this?

356
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,740
No.

357
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:10,420
Mr. Right Envoy treats me well.

358
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:11,980
He said

359
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,619
Chuli would return

360
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:17,740
as the Night Clan's Night Deity.

361
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:24,180
Then I could gain power

362
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,940
and heal my body.

363
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,019
Ling,

364
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,619
but Chuli

365
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:36,660
refuses the Night Deity mantle.

366
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:38,859
Why?

367
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:42,480
Doesn't Chuli want to live with us?

368
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,859
Where's Chen?

369
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:51,776
Let me see him.

370
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,819
Wait!

371
00:23:58,579 --> 00:23:59,099
Chen!

372
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,140
Mr. Wan Guchen!

373
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,900
Sir!

374
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:05,220
Chen?

375
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,180
Chen, wake up. Don't scare me!

376
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,380
Lord Night Deity,

377
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,859
this man is Nine Heavens' Sword Master,

378
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:13,980
our sworn enemy.

379
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,900
He can't live.

380
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,740
While he's unconscious,

381
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:18,779
we should kill him.

382
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,980
He's under my protection.

383
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,420
How dare you touch him?

384
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,019
We wouldn't dare.

385
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,900
But we wonder

386
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,779
by what authority you command us?

387
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,019
Unless you are the Night Clan's leader,

388
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,259
we needn't obey.

389
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,059
Don't kill Mr. Wan Guchen.

390
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,940
He's a good man.

391
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:42,359
He saved us.

392
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,299
Ling,

393
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,579
if Chuli agrees

394
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,140
to be the Night Deity,

395
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,660
we'll spare him.

396
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,339
(I don't know what they'll do to Chen.)

397
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:59,660
(My current strength)

398
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,880
(can't confront them directly.)

399
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,180
(Besides, my fate)

400
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:07,180
(dooms me to die by Chen's hand anyway.)

401
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:09,920
(Perhaps becoming Night Deity)

402
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,240
(will fulfill destiny.)

403
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:16,579
Very well.

404
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,539
I'll assume the Night Deity mantle.

405
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,819
From now on,

406
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,339
all obey my orders.

407
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:24,619
Wan Guchen

408
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:26,500
is not to be harmed.

409
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,880
As you command, Lord.

410
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:39,099
But Wan Guchen remains

411
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,339
a member of Nine Heavens.

412
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,059
His presence here

413
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,099
endangers our clan.

414
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:46,980
What should we do?

415
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:48,880
My Lord,

416
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:50,420
please advise.

417
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:26,940
No.

418
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:38,579
Chuli.

419
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,180
Chuli!

420
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:43,500
You're awake, sir.

421
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,500
Good.

422
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:45,819
I'll leave you now.

423
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,140
Where am I?

424
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,779
Why am I here?

425
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,660
Well,

426
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,539
some strange people
brought you here last night.

427
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:57,700
They paid me

428
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:58,500
to watch over you

429
00:26:58,539 --> 00:26:59,700
until you awoke safely.

430
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:12,380
Hail the Night Deity's return!

431
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,339
Salute!

432
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,420
Wan Guchen?

433
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:48,339
Chuli!

434
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:49,740
Come with me.

435
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:54,880
Wan Guchen!

436
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,720
You've agreed to become
the Night Deity of the Night Clan.

437
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:04,779
You must sever all ties with those
from the Nine Heavens.

438
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,980
Today marks your coronation ceremony.

439
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,960
We must see it through.

440
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,059
You agreed to become their Night Deity?

441
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:16,900
Yes.

442
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,539
I did agree.

443
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,019
Leave now.

444
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,680
Why?

445
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,859
They forced you, didn't they?

446
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:31,339
Come with me.

447
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:34,180
Chen,

448
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,140
we've exhausted every option.

449
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,980
This is the only path left.

450
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:41,299
Isn't it?

451
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:47,740
I'm tired.

452
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,460
Tired of clinging to hope,

453
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:52,339
only to see it shatter.

454
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:55,220
They've sworn not to harm you.

455
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,660
Leave quickly.

456
00:28:57,099 --> 00:28:57,900
I won't leave!

457
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,099
Clinging to hope,

458
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,839
only to see it shatter repeatedly.

459
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:07,059
I have been living like this
for three centuries.

460
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:09,140
Don't become the Night Deity.

461
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:12,980
Don't abandon me, please.

462
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,660
Chuli?

463
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:18,259
I've made up my mind.

464
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:21,339
Today is my ascension as Night Deity.

465
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,059
If you don't leave now,

466
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:25,339
I'll have no choice but to act.

467
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:26,259
I won't go.

468
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,220
When I was against
the entire Nine Heavens,

469
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,980
I never retreated an inch.

470
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:37,019
Today,

471
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:39,940
I won't retreat either.

472
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,059
Are you mad?

473
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:45,980
If you don't leave now,

474
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,619
they will kill you.

475
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:48,940
What does it matter?

476
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,339
Without you,

477
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,460
I have nothing left.

478
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,299
The hour has come.

479
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,660
Night Deity,

480
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:06,180
please accept the rites.

481
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:29,220
Chuli!

482
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:35,700
Chen?

483
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,339
What was that?

484
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,539
You promised not to kill him!

485
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,259
If I spare him,

486
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,619
you can't complete your ascension.

487
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,059
Even if it means death,

488
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,900
you won't yield an inch?

489
00:30:58,339 --> 00:30:59,140
Without you,

490
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,619
my existence has no meaning.

491
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,180
Stop them!

492
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,619
Don't let them escape!
