Whoever holds

29
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:45,980
that title gains my loyalty.

31
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,299
my service naturally

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,819
transfers accordingly.

Wisdom favors the adaptable.

34
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,620
I appreciate clever people like him.

35
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,180
Bai Xiaoying,

36
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,299
your vital essence is depleted,

37
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,780
and you're dying.

38
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,780
Let me hasten your journey.

39
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:07,219
Die!

40
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:09,379
Go!

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,979
Master.

42
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,979
Go now!

43
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:20,580
Father, stop!

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,740
Please don't harm Yunya.

45
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,419
He released our enemy,

46
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,699
and you're pleading for him?

47
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:28,780
Step back now!

48
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:29,699
Father,

49
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:32,460
why did you become the Night Deity?

50
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,780
Tell me this isn't true.

51
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,740
Father,

52
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,500
return with me.

53
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,819
As my daughter,

54
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,139
you cower like a mouse

55
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:42,580
and whimper endlessly.

56
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,580
Get away!

57
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,860
Father,

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,460
as the Immortal Lord
of the Nine Heavens,

59
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,259
you've always opposed the Night Deity.

60
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,379
How could you become what you hated?

61
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,699
I don't believe it.

62
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,460
Father,

63
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,699
I beg you to stop this madness.

64
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:56,300
Father,

65
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,900
please stop doing this.

66
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,060
I have carefully schemed,

67
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:02,659
using Ye Chenyuan

68
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:05,099
to extract the Night Deity's power
from Bai Xiaoying.

69
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:07,580
Why would I stop now?

70
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,900
I only regret not realizing sooner

71
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:14,180
Night Deity's power could be converted
to serve my purpose over a millennium.

72
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,699
Now that I've achieved godhood,

73
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:20,219
I'll no longer need

74
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:21,539
the Night Deity's power

75
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,979
to balance Three Realms!

76
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,979
Three Realms shall obey me now!

77
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,259
The universe
will be unified under my rule!

78
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,460
Good child,

79
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:00,219
dry your tears.

80
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:04,539
Though I'm now the Night Deity,

81
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,860
I remain your father.

82
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,099
You're still my beloved daughter.

83
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,340
Nothing changes that.

84
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,100
I'm the ruler of the Three Realms,

85
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,259
and you'll be revered as my princess.

86
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:20,699
Why weep?

87
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:23,019
You should rejoice.

88
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,100
You don't recognize your own father?

89
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:38,139
Your public defiance today

90
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,980
will be forgiven

91
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,100
as first offense.

92
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:50,779
But repeat this insolence, and you'll
cease to be my cherished daughter.

93
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:53,060
Understood?

94
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,420
I

95
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,579
understood.

96
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,139
That's my good girl.

97
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,939
Whether daughter of the Night Deity

98
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:12,819
or daughter of the Immortal Lord,

99
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,500
obey me faithfully,

100
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,540
and my favor will never waver.

101
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,339
Yunya,

102
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:53,139
you were my disciple before.

103
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,540
Releasing Bai Xiaoying was unforgivable,

104
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,379
but leading the assault
against immortal sect

105
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,339
redeemed you.

106
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,660
From now on,

107
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,060
pledge loyalty to me alone.

108
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,459
Thank you for your mercy.

109
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,579
I freed Bai Xiaoying

110
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,620
to repay her favor.

111
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,860
Now that her heart
belongs to Ye Chenyuan,

112
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:21,540
I'll show

113
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,699
no mercy next time.

114
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,379
Good.

115
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,220
In that case,

116
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:30,620
I'll arrange a wedding.

117
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,500
Wanyan is of marriageable age.

118
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,339
She admires you deeply.

119
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,939
You're my most trusted person.

120
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:39,860
Having you marrying her

121
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:41,819
brings me peace.

122
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,300
Thank you, my lord.

123
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,100
Don't forget

124
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,620
I have raised you up.

125
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,240
and taught you martial arts.

126
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,819
Every move and technique you know

127
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,379
was personally taught by me.

128
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,579
Everything you possess

129
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,379
is my bestowment upon you.

130
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:25,819
Everything I have

131
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,139
was earned through righteous means.

132
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:30,920
But can you say the same?

133
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,459
Without my favor

134
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,100
and efforts to elevate your status,

135
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,060
how could someone as young as you

136
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,019
ascend to Upper Immortal?

137
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,060
I only chose you

138
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:47,060
because you followed

139
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,980
every command of mine.

140
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,019
That's why you were selected.

141
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,860
If I'd known earlier,

142
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,500
I should have acted like this earlier.

143
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,980
You were always submissive.

144
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,459
I didn't expect you'd betray me.

145
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,500
Do you know the best punishment

146
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:11,939
for a traitor like you?

147
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,060
To turn you into a mindless puppet

148
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:20,139
who serves me faithfully.

149
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:41,820
Yunya.

150
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,659
Will you betray me again?

151
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:51,019
I will never betray you, Master.

152
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,860
Good.

153
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:57,500
You remain my favorite disciple.

154
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,179
This place is secure.

155
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,580
We'll rest here temporarily.

156
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,679
I made your favorite dishes.

157
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:19,639
Try them.

158
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,360
It smells wonderful.

159
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,179
I'm craving some fruits.

160
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,740
How about

161
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,740
you go pick some?

162
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:34,500
Alright.

163
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,539
(My body can't hold on)

164
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,860
(much longer.)

165
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:23,899
(Now,)

166
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,580
(my father has grown crazier,)

167
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,019
(but I remain powerless to stop him.)

168
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,139
(I don't know what he's done to Yunya.)

169
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,419
(What should I do?)

170
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:46,279
Check out my daughter's dowry.

171
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,860
Such magnificent bridal treasures.

172
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:51,019
Well?

173
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:52,460
Do you like them?

174
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,360
Wanyan.

175
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,899
Ask for anything else you desire.

176
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,120
I'll grant all your wishes.

177
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,059
Everything you prepared

178
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,940
is to my liking.

179
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,899
That's my good daughter.

180
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:12,100
I've always said

181
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,019
if you obey me faithfully,

182
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:15,539
anything you want

183
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,179
shall be yours.

184
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:22,279
I understand.

185
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,220
Within this immortal sect,

186
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:25,779
with you

187
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,019
and Yunya by my side,

188
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,460
I am truly blessed.

189
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:33,980
Father,

190
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,379
I want to personally select
items for our marital house.

191
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,980
May I?

192
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,220
If you want to do it,

193
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,659
this shows your genuine happiness.

194
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,100
I shall grant this request.

195
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,879
But don't overexert yourself.

196
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:04,539
So

197
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:06,580
take Rong with you

198
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,100
when you go out.

199
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,539
She'll attend to your needs.

200
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,419
This will ease my concerns.

201
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,100
Thank you, Father.

202
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,059
Xiaoying.

203
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,139
What are you doing?

204
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,500
You misunderstood.

205
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,539
I wasn't trying to die.

206
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:03,299
Release me.

207
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:03,740
No.

208
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,899
I'm afraid.

209
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,539
Don't leave me.

210
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:15,980
Don't worry.

211
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,860
I'll stay with you.

212
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,100
Don't worry.

213
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,700
I'm fine.

214
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:24,539
Truly.

215
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:25,899
Yeah.

216
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:33,580
(Perhaps that thing)

217
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,100
(could help Xiaoying find peace.)

218
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,740
(I should return to the immortal sect.)

219
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:51,700
- Senior.
- Senior.

220
00:14:59,059 --> 00:14:59,980
It hurts!

221
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,620
What's wrong?

222
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,700
I have sudden abdominal pain.

223
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,100
Go fetch Immortal Xiyuan.

224
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,340
Maybe it's better

225
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:08,220
if I help you go together.

226
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,139
I'll worry if you are

227
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,059
left alone here.

228
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Who's the master here?

229
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,379
I'm in such pain.

230
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,419
I can barely move.

231
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:15,019
Going with you

232
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,259
might make me die on the way.

233
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,580
Besides,

234
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,860
we're in the sect.

235
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
I'm the lord's daughter.

236
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,419
No worries here.

237
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,299
Go now.

238
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:23,940
I understand.

239
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,740
The Divine Sword fragments
are hard to find.

240
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,860
It was clearly destroyed here that day.

241
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,399
Ye Chenyuan.

242
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,440
It's you again?

243
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,080
It's me. Looking for what?

244
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,519
Back off.

245
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,679
The Divine Sword
was used to kill your father.

246
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,559
Now, only fragments remain.

247
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,799
Why do you need them?

248
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,740
I just want to find something

249
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
that can save my father.

250
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,559
My father isn't the Night Deity.

251
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,100
He's just temporarily misguided.

252
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:29,919
I will save him.

253
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,919
Our suffering through lifetimes

254
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,159
now falls upon you.

255
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,039
My father

256
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,440
has led the immortal sect
for over 1,500 years.

257
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,080
He once said,

258
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,440
"Killing the Night Deity"

259
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,519
"is our duty."

260
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,960
As my father's daughter

261
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,440
and the Immortal Lord's heir,

262
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,840
I swear I'll make it.

263
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,919
Yunya!

264
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,599
He seems off,

265
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,400
like being controlled.

266
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,000
No wonder he didn't oppose our marriage.

267
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,640
I see.

268
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,279
Immortal sect fugitive.

269
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,759
I'll show no mercy.

270
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,960
Take the fragment and go!

271
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,319
And you?

272
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,759
Don't worry.

273
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,000
Yunya won't harm me.

274
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,200
Yunya!

275
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm Wanyan.

276
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,079
Wake up, Yunya!

277
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,039
I'm Wanyan.

278
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,480
Yunya,

279
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,400
you were once the most uncompromising

280
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,079
of the Nine Heavens.

281
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,000
Do you realize what you've become?

282
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,079
Yunya, wake up now!

283
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,039
Can you hear me, Yunya?

284
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,920
I'm Wanyan.

285
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,880
Yunya, wake up!

286
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:03,960
Yunya.

287
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,799
Yunya.

288
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,980
I know you can hear me.

289
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
Isn't that right, Yunya?

290
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,400
I'm Wanyan.

291
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,599
Wake up.

292
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,839
I'm Wanyan, Yunya.

293
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,839
I know you're suffering,

294
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,359
but I'll stay here with you.

295
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,279
I won't leave.

296
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:18,759
I'm not going anywhere, Yunya.

297
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,880
Wake up.

298
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,319
Wake up, Yunya.

299
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:22,759
Yunya.

300
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,359
I beg you to wake up.

301
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,799
I know you can break this control.

302
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,279
I know you can do it.

303
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,480
I've always admired you.

304
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,599
Yunya, you can do this.

305
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,559
You won't lose.

306
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,359
I never expected

307
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,339
I'd die by your hand.

308
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,240
Yunya,

309
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,920
how cruel you are.

310
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,440
Wanyan,

311
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,779
I don't know what happened.

312
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,119
Hold on.

313
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,900
You'll be fine.

314
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
This is the first time

315
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,559
I've seen you so panicked

316
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,220
for me.

317
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,759
Stop talking.

318
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,319
I'll take you to Immortal Xiyuan.

319
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,559
She'll save you.

320
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,119
Yunya,

321
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,559
you can't lose.

322
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,920
Don't let the Night Deity defeat you.

323
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,519
I'm happy

324
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,940
that I'm the Immortal Lord's daughter.

325
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,500
I did what needed to be done.

326
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,000
But

327
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,519
when I think about

328
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,140
our wedding ceremony in three days,

329
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,119
I still feel somewhat

330
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,559
unwilling.

331
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,680
Only...

332
00:19:58,259 --> 00:19:59,140
Only

333
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:00,900
three days remain.

334
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:09,420
Wanyan.

335
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,619
Wanyan!

336
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:13,539
Wanyan!

337
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:15,779
Wanyan!

338
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,539
Wanyan!

339
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:48,940
Why?

340
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,140
Why?

341
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,259
Why

342
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,900
didn't you listen to me?

343
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,940
Who has bewitched you,

344
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,220
making you oppose me at every turn?

345
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,460
You killed your own daughter.

346
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,579
How dare you ask that question?

347
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,660
It was you

348
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:14,740
who killed your daughter!

349
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,619
Master.

350
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:30,980
Go.

351
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,339
Mobilize our forces immediately.

352
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,900
Capture Ye Chenyuan
and Bai Xiaoying at all costs.

353
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,380
I will avenge

354
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:39,619
my daughter!

355
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:41,460
Yes.

356
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,799
Xiaoying.

357
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:10,599
Look what I found.

358
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,099
This is

359
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,819
a fragment of the Divine Sword.

360
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:18,500
Right.

361
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,299
It might help restore you.

362
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,099
So you knew all along.

363
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,859
It doesn't matter.

364
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:38,099
Surviving by chance like this

365
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,539
and having these extra days

366
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,579
are more than I could ask for.

367
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,380
Don't worry about me.

368
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:47,500
Promise me

369
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,400
you'll keep being happy.

370
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:50,680
Okay?

371
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:03,579
Yunya?

372
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,500
I'll kill you two.

373
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,819
This is revenge for Wanyan.

374
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:25,460
This is inside Divine Sword.

375
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,140
How can I still enter here?

376
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,500
Oh no! Ye Chenyuan is still outside.

377
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,359
You are

378
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,700
Divine Maiden Xi Wu?

379
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,460
Yes.

380
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,740
But

381
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:57,619
I perished 1,500 years ago.

382
00:23:58,299 --> 00:23:59,740
Only this wisp of my spirit remains

383
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,500
within the Divine Sword.

384
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:03,339
Now, I understand

385
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,779
it was to see you again.

386
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:07,180
My daughter.

387
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:11,099
Daughter...

388
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,880
Such a distant word.

389
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,559
I've long forgotten
what maternal love feels like.

390
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,339
So

391
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,019
you're the one who made me

392
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:28,960
the Night Deity's vessel?

393
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:31,299
I'm sorry.

394
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:33,420
If heaven had permitted,

395
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:35,180
I would have watched you grow up.

396
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,980
Sealing the Night Deity within you

397
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:41,500
was the only way to save humanity then.

398
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,480
It was only in that moment

399
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:45,099
that I understood

400
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,640
what fate demanded of me.

401
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,000
I had to harm my own child,

402
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,839
the person I loved most in this world.

403
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,859
You and Ye Chenyuan

404
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,420
have endured six lifetimes.

405
00:24:58,859 --> 00:24:59,740
In each lifetime,

406
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:02,140
he was forced to kill you.

407
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,420
If you understand his pain,

408
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,740
then you know

409
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,440
how I suffered.

410
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,339
How deep could your pain be?

411
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:15,920
You don't actually think

412
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,779
this would make me forgive you?

413
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,259
I'm filled with shame

414
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:23,900
for making you bear such a fate

415
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,180
and endless cycles of suffering.

416
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,460
Ying,

417
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:30,900
I don't seek your forgiveness.

418
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:32,539
I just hope

419
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,839
you'll give me a chance to make amends.

420
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:42,220
Now,

421
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,019
the only thing I can give you

422
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,619
is my final divine power

423
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:50,420
sealed within the Divine Sword.

424
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:54,339
I only wish for you
to protect yourself well

425
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,299
and live this life
in peace and happiness.

426
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,099
What's happening to you?

427
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:27,819
Ying,

428
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:31,339
this is the last time I can see you.

429
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:33,380
You must walk

430
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,759
the road ahead alone.

431
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,119
If fate allows,

432
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,460
I hope you'll forgive
my willful decisions.

433
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,099
And I hope

434
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,779
that you'll find peace within yourself.

435
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:50,660
Mother!

436
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,779
Mother!

437
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,440
(This is)

438
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,359
(the Divine Sword.)

439
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,519
Immortal sect fugitive.

440
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,579
I'll show no mercy.

441
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:25,180
Leave now.

442
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,119
Go back and tell him

443
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,779
our lives

444
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,660
will never be his to take.

445
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,000
But I will personally

446
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,980
take his life.

447
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:55,900
Yuan,

448
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,539
only now do I understand

449
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:08,420
my mother has been watching
over me and protecting me

450
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,740
in her own way.

451
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,779
That's why only my blood
can let me enter Divine Sword.

452
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,599
Every time I entered,

453
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:23,460
she was speaking to me.

454
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:28,859
But I foolishly believed
Feng Changgeng's lies.

455
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,000
In the end,

456
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,460
the devastation across the Three Realms

457
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,299
is all my doing.

458
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:46,019
Let's settle this
with him once and for all.

459
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,339
As long as I'm with you,

460
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,440
I can accept

461
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,359
any outcome.

462
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:58,700
Since we've made our choice,

463
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,940
let's have no regrets.

464
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,099
Every time we tried to marry before,

465
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,259
we were interrupted.

466
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:09,380
Let's marry once more.

467
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:13,380
This time,

468
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:16,039
no one will disturb us.
