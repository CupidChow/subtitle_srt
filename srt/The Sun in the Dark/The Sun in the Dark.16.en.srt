27
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,239
Now, I understand.

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
The prophecy states

29
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,879
the Night Deity must be sealed

30
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,120
into the purest soul vessel,

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,199
where a powerful cultivator

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,328
transforms into the Divine Sword
and its spirit,

33
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,504
allowing the Sword Master
to slay the Night Deity.

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,439
(Moreover, someone
with supreme cultivation)

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,479
(can absorb the sealed Night Deity)

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,719
(from the soul vessel into themselves,)

37
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,039
(converting Night Deity's power)

38
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,800
(into their own.)

39
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,680
(This must never
fall into malicious hands.)

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Then what?

41
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,240
What's written after this?

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,919
(His ambition
and killing intent run deep.)

43
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,599
(Better keep this hidden
from him for now.)

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,400
That's all there is.

45
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,620
(So the Night Deity's power)

46
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,759
(can be transferred to another's body.)

47
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,479
Yusheng.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
I remember now.

49
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,759
I remember everything.

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,000
Why is this happening?

51
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,000
Will this lifetime end the same way?

52
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:41,800
In the end,

53
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,240
I'll lose all my memories again.

54
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,280
You won't.

55
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
For twelve hundred years,

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,919
I've finally found a way to save you.

57
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,800
What way?

58
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,599
You'll no longer

59
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,199
be the Night Deity's vessel
if I transfer

60
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,942
Night Deity's power
from your body to mine.

61
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,800
Transferring it into you?

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,960
What then?

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,240
Then I'll pass
all my cultivation to you.

64
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,639
Passing it all to me?

65
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,040
You want me to kill you?

66
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,680
Don't even think about it!

67
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,040
I'll never agree to this.

68
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
This is the only way.

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,199
Your consent doesn't matter.

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,319
I must proceed regardless.

71
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,160
I refuse!

72
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,879
There must be another way.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Let's find another way together.

74
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,439
There has to be another way.

75
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,639
We'll think of something. I refuse.

76
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,040
- No.
- We've searched Three Realms.

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,199
This is the only way.

78
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,439
I'm your master.

79
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,939
By my command,

80
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,939
from this day forth,

81
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,319
you'll cultivate here

82
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,139
without leaving even once.

83
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,600
Chen!

84
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:33,959
Chen!

85
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,839
What's wrong?

86
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,040
Are you hurt?

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,920
What's wrong?

88
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,439
What's happening?

89
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,519
Don't scare me like this.

90
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,720
You're scaring me.

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
What's happening?

92
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,439
I won't let you die.

93
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,839
I won't let you die.

94
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,800
I won't let anything happen to you.

95
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,399
I'll keep you safe.

96
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,199
(Why am I lying here?)

97
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,060
(Could it be...?)

98
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,860
(Yusheng.)

99
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,379
Yusheng.

100
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,639
The Night Deity's power
awakened far earlier.

101
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,519
Night Deity!

102
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,339
Wan Guchen.

103
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:04,180
The nine-tailed fox demon
loved you to madness.

104
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,079
To prevent your plan from succeeding,

105
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,939
she offered her body to me long ago.

106
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,339
How utterly gullible she was.

107
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:13,620
Night Deity,

108
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,620
didn't you hate me most?

109
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,139
Get out of her body now.

110
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,379
You can use my body as a vessel.

111
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,899
That's an intriguing proposition.

112
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,620
But

113
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,459
I have no interest in your body.

114
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,740
I prefer watching
you torment each other.

115
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:37,420
I'll make you suffer for eternity.

116
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:09,779
Yusheng.

117
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:14,720
Master,

118
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,740
kill me quickly.

119
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,379
I refuse to kill you again.

120
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,500
If you won't do it,

121
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,659
I'll have to...

122
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,460
No!

123
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,500
I transferred all my spiritual power

124
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,379
and demonic energy into the nine tails.

125
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,019
With the tails severed,

126
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:59,139
I can no longer harm you.

127
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,019
Why would you do that?

128
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,620
Do you know that losing your tails

129
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,220
means losing all your cultivation?

130
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,179
To me,

131
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,379
you matter more than anything.

132
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,100
Trying to expel me from your body?

133
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,792
Don't even think about it!

134
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:50,740
Yusheng?

135
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:01,920
- Master.
- Yusheng.

136
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:03,419
Kill me quickly.

137
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,139
I don't want to be controlled anymore.

138
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:09,179
Kill me now!

139
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,340
I beg you.

140
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,299
I beg you.

141
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,580
I beg you!

142
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:26,179

170
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:05,860
(the other party's consent.)

171
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,768

178
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:52,259
Wan Guchen,

179
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,299
you've caused immense turmoil.

180
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,019
What's your true intention?

181
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,139
From this day forth,

182
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,899
I relinquish

183
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,100
my position as Sword Master

184
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700

185
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,779
Henceforward,

186
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,220
I'm no longer an immortal sect member.

187
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,620
All these years,

188
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,620
we've treated you well.

189
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,340
Yet you obsess
over Bai Yixi's reincarnation.

190
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,820
I gravely misjudged you.

191
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:22,419
All these years,

192
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,419
I kept every promise
regarding the Night Clan

193
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:27,299
and Night Deity.

194
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,539
For the next three centuries,

195
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,179
handle it yourselves.

196
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,940
To complete the divine-demon exchange,

197
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,620
the only way

198
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,259
is to transform myself
into the Night Deity.

199
00:15:59,179 --> 00:15:59,779
Yixi,

200
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,019
in this lifetime,

201
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,019
let me suffer in your place.

202
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,020
(I'll endure three centuries
of heavenly thunder)

203
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:19,159
(to destroy my immortal bones.)

204
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,240
(I'll bear three centuries
of the Night Energy's searing pain)

205
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,940
(to rebuild my flesh and bones.)

206
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,259
(I'll endure three centuries
of Night Fire consuming my heart)

207
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,320
(to reforge my veins.)

208
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,460
Ye Chenyuan, why are you doing this?

209
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,500
Ye Chenyuan!

210
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,740
No!

211
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:47,179
No!

212
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:54,299
No!

213
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,419
No!

214
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,559
(Three centuries of Night Fire
reshaped my appearance.)

215
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,640
(Henceforth,)

216
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,660
(no one in this world
will recognize Wan Guchen.)

217
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,519
(Only the reviled Night Deity
scorned by the Three Realms,)

218
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,839
(Ye Chenyuan, remains!)

219
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,119
(Three centuries have passed.)

220
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,000
(My plan shall now unfold.)

221
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:46,660
(The first step
to break this cursed fate)

222
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:50,220
(is when the next
three-century cycle arrives,)

223
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,608
(I shall become the new Night Deity.)

224
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:53,579
Who dares trespass

225
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:54,940
in the Night Clan's place?

226
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,339
My identity matters not.

227
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:01,408
You just need to know

228
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:04,384
that I am the future master
of the Night Clan

229
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:06,420
and your sovereign lord.

230
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:15,099
This is the Night Deity's power!

231
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:20,539
Welcome your return, Lord Night Deity.

232
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,859
- All hail the Night Deity!
- All hail the Night Deity!

233
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,819
(Thus begins the second step)

234
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,680
(of seizing the sword crystal)

235
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,819
(to manipulate
the future Sword Master's actions.)

236
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:33,940
Halt!

237
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,180
Audacious demon!

238
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,859
You dare breach our forbidden area?

239
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,819
You're audacious

240
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:42,319
to show disrespect
before the Lord Night Deity.

241
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:43,660
Night Deity?

242
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:49,140
I've dealt with Night Deity
for fifteen centuries.

243
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:52,380
Do you think me easily deceived?

244
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,960
(As expected,
none recognize my visage now.)

245
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,160
The Night Deity's power!

246
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,680
You are the Night Deity!

247
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:21,799
Remember,

248
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,200
my name is Ye Chenyuan.

249
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,839
From now on, this sword crystal

250
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,279
belongs to the Night Clan.

251
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,559
When I obtain the Divine Sword,

252
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,359
no one can pose a threat
to the Night Clan.

253
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,000
I

254
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,319
shall lead the Night Clan

255
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,119
to dominate all Three Realms.

256
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,839
- Dominate the Three Realms
- Dominate the Three Realms

257
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,359
- for eternity!
- for eternity!

258
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,880
- Dominate the Three Realms
- Dominate the Three Realms

259
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,240
- for eternity!
- for eternity!

260
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,680
(All proceeds according to plan.)

261
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,720
(The third step)

262
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,480
(is waiting for you.)

263
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,380
(Get out of Su City!)

264
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,559
I've finally found you.

265
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:41,539
(So)

266
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,420
(it was I who killed my mother.)

267
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:51,779
Mother!

268
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:53,619
Mother!

269
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,180
Mother, wake up!

270
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,420
Mother!

271
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,140
(Forgive me.)

272
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,339
(In this lifetime,)

273
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,420
(I can't protect you.)

274
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,059
(I must make you hate me.)

275
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,140

(Forgive me.)

(In this life, I must be the person
you hate the most.)

280
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:27,472
(To absorb the Night Deity's power
within her,)

281
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,859
(we must stay close for some time.)

282

(The Soul-Binding Rope)

283
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,220
(provides the perfect means.)

284
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,779
(Let me absorb
all the Night Deity's power from you.)

285
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,500
(This time, I'll bear all this.)

286
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:42,500

but absorbing
the Night Deity's power within me.

292
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,019
(I must absorb the demonic energy
within you faster.)

293
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,336
(You'll obtain the Divine Sword,)

294

(Is that true?)

336
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:19,136
So at the Lantern Festival
ten years ago,

337
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,559
you never went to Su City

338
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,119
nor killed my mother.

339
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:24,880

00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,559
if it's true or not?

341
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,200
The world has accused me
of countless crimes.

342
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,359
I don't care at all.

(Ye Chenyuan,)

344
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,680
(you've learned nothing
in fifteen centuries.)

345
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,500
(You chose to deceive her.)

346
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,016
(But her not loving you upsets you.)

(Before awakening the Divine Sword,)

348
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,279

352
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,900

358
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,819
(Hate me.)

359
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,299

360
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,259
(Let everything end.)

361
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,740
So you've planned everything

362
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:46,539

363
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:49,859
No.

I won't let you do this.

365
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,000
Were you planning

366
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,279
to hide all this from me
until your death?

367
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,279
I'm sorry.

368
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,240
In this lifetime,

369
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,759
I deceived you.

For six lifetimes,

371
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,160
you waited alone
for fifteen hundred years

372
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
until you turned yourself

373
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,279
into the wicked Night Deity
people revile.

374
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,920
Was it worth it?

375
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,039
I know exactly what I'm doing.

376
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,559
I'm the true vessel of the Night Deity.

377
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,200
This is my fate.

378
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,319
Not yours.

379
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I don't need you bearing it for me.

380
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,000
You have no idea.

381
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,445
It kills me, watching
the demonic energy take you,

382
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,359
helpless to stop it.

383
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,680
Watching you die in front of me,
over and over,

384
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,079
powerless to change it.

385
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,480
This time,

386
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,559
I won't suffer that again.

387
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,279
I'm sorry.

388
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,319
Sorry.

389
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,319
Ye Chenyuan,

390
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,559
don't leave me alone again.

391
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,640
Don't.

392
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,839
Bai Xiaoying,

393
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,000
this final step

394
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,440
must be done by you.

395
00:27:59,119 --> 00:27:59,920
Kill me.

396
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,160
No.

397
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,720
After all we've been through,

398
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,400
now that I've finally
remembered everything,

399
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,000
how could I possibly kill you?

400
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,839
If you don't do it now,

401
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,480
the demonic energy
will consume me completely.

402
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,559
And all our previous efforts

403
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,000
will be wasted.

404
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
The Three Realms
will drown in bloodshed.

405
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,720
Is this what you want to see?

406
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,759
No.

407
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,160
But I don't want to see you die either.

408
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,359
If it requires sacrificing you

409
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,400
to save all living beings,

410
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,200
I would rather abandon the Three Realms.

411
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,279
Xiaoying,

412
00:28:59,039 --> 00:28:59,759
I'm sorry.

413
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,680
Only through my death

414
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,559
can you survive.
