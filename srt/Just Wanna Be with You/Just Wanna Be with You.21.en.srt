It's been a while,

14
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,040
my old friend.

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,640
I've been in a slumber
for a thousand years.

16
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,480
And you managed to recognise me

17
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,560
in this new body.

18
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,439
Goddess.

00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,319
Demon Lord.

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,719
You're all here.

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,400
Then you can all perish together.

22
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,439
I don't care

Yan Luo.

28
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,319
Master.

29
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,319
I can only atone

30
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,319
