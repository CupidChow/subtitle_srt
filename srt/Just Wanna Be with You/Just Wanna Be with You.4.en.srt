(Cangyun)

14
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,519
Sister.

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,480
It's alright now.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,120
Ying.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,319
I'm glad you're here.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
In this Cangyun,

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,840
you're the only one
I can't bear to leave.

20
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,079
Master.

21
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,599
The first moment I stepped into Cangyun,

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,799
I saw someone

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,920
who looked exactly like you.

24
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,439
Was it you who called me here?

25
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
Seal the gate.

26
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,879
Let no one enter.

27
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:15,840
Yes.

28
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,199
Junior Sister.

29
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,400
Where is the Goddess?

30
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,240
She's already turned in for the night.

31
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,800
Is it improper to disturb her this late?

32
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,680
Liar.

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,479
Sneaking into
the Goddess's residence at night,

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,080
even if you serve the Sovereign,

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,159
you've overstepped.

36
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,759
Creeping around
while the gates are sealed.

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,039
What are you really after?

38
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,360
Didn't the Sovereign
tell me to train diligently?

39
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,439
How am I supposed to cultivate
if my sleep is disturbed?

40
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,439
Jiang Zhiyu.

41
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,439
Before we're married,

42
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,000
you are not to leave this room.

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,000
Focus on your cultivation here.

44
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,879
Don't play tricks on me.

45
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,800
Ying.

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,680
Sister.

47
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,919
What are you trying to do?

48
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,520
The less you know, the better.

49
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,120
You're in a hurry.

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,840
Where is the Goddess going?

51
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,599
How dare you.

52
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,520
Since when do you
get to question my whereabouts?

53
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,240
My brother was seriously injured
by Nangong Xiao.

54
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,240
Please, Goddess...

55
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,479
Forget about him.

56
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,240
For the sake of the fox tribe,
for Cangyun,

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,240
please stop clinging to him.

58
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,039
I have my own plans.

59
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,720
(Nangong Xiao,
you are not worthy of the spirit stone.)

60
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,519
(Much less to rule the three realms.)

61
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,920
Jiu, what are you doing here?

62
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,759
Are you feeling better?

63
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't worry.
The spell I've been practicing

64
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,480
will help me recover.

65
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,480
No, it's too dangerous here.

66
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,279
You have to go.

67
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,759
Yu.

68
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,800
I won't let you face danger alone.

69
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,320
You can't defeat Nangong Xiao.

70
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,480
The spirit stone is sealed
with a spirit-locking device.

71
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,199
You can't open it.

72
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,240
Go now.

73
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,879
Let me try.

74
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,800
Jiu.

75
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,759
Yu, we're finally free.

76
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,720
What secret technique did you practice?

77
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,360
You could even shake
the spirit-locking device.

78
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,560
What I practiced...

79
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,480
Oh, no.
The spirit-locking device was disturbed.

80
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,759
They'll find out soon.

81
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,720
Let's go, now.

82
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,240
(I once wished to become a bird,)

83
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,920
(to soar by your side.)

84
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,000
(And once wished to become a fish,)

85
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,720
(to swim with you together.)

86
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,160
Sovereign, the spirit stone
has been stolen.

87
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,279
They used some unknown method

88
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,760
to unlock the spirit-locking device.

89
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,279
Jiang Zhiyu,

90
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,680
so you really did betray me.

91
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,680
Jiang Zhiyu has consorted
with that foxfolk for a hundred years.

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,720
Now that the spirit stone is gone,

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,879
and Cangyun
has always been tightly guarded,

94
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,759
it must mean someone
is secretly colluding with them.

95
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,519
You foxfolk really are persistent.

96
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,320
Don't think that just
because you've set foot in Cangyun,

97
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,560
you can cleanse the filth of your kind.

98
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,199
I submit to Cangyun.

99
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,450
I wouldn't dare deceive the Sovereign.

100
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,199
Then go now.

101
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,439
Find that disgrace
of a brother of yours.

102
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,040
Yes.

103
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,920
The spirit stone was stolen,

104
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,600
and the Goddess fled.

105
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,000
What a grand performance.

106
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,400
Looks like no one's chasing us.

107
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,160
Let's rest here for a bit.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Alright.

109
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:51,800
Yu.

110
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,959
We've already secured
the Cangyun spirit stone.

111
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,400
If we can get
the Demon Clan's spirit stone too...

112
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,839
And add in my own,

113
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,720
we'll have three spirit stones.

114
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,120
By then,

115
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,120
we can protect my people

116
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,360
and guard the world.

117
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,319
Yes.

118
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,000
When peace comes to the land,

119
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,759
we can finally be together in peace.

120
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,720
Yu.

121
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,600
You gave up
the title of Cangyun's mistress,

122
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,560
gave up your place
as the radiant Goddess,

123
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,519
just to stand
by a lowly foxfolk like me.

124
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,000
Are you really sure about this?

125
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,879
You foxfolk are all inferior beings.

126
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,160
Why come to our Cangyun?

127
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,120
Let him go!

128
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,200
When I was a child and being bullied,

129
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,759
you stepped in to save me.

130
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,879
What's your name?

131
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
I don't have a name.

132
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,879
What's your name?

133
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm Jiang Zhiyu,
the Goddess of the Lingxiao clan.

134
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,519
From that moment on,

135
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,480
I never forgot your name.

136
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
So you're that young foxfolk
from back then.

137

Jiu,

138
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,360

there's any hierarchy between people.

140
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,399
Don't belittle yourself.

141
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,200
I've been bound
by these rules for a hundred years.

142
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,639
I want freedom.

143
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,360
