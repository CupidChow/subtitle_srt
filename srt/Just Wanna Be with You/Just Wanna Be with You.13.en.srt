Huai.

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,159
Why are you doing this?

15
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,120
Huai.

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,359
What's the matter with you?

17
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:08,800
Yu.

18
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,360
I know nothing about love.

19
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,080
Let me safeguard you, then.

20
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,759
Ying.

21
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,039
Ying!

22
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,960
Jiang Jinghuai.

23
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,960
You promised to take my hand

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,080
and make me happy.

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,319
But why are you doing this

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
to Cangyun?

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,199
Yu.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,479
I told you so.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,719
Foxfolk are of lowly origin.

30
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,879
They turn cruel
once they become influential.

31
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,960
Why do you think
he arranged this wedding

32
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,599
for you, huh?

33
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,719
He's been after nothing
but your spirit stone.

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,080
Stop your struggle, Jiang Jinghuai.

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,280
The moment you retrieved
the demon clan's spirit stone,

36
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,159
you were destined to go astray.

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,400
You...

38
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,000
For the sake of Cangyun clan,

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,960
kill him.

40
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,120
For the sake of Luo Ying,

41
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,599
kill him.

42
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,599
For your own sake,

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,960
kill him.

44
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,400
You want to get rid of me?

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,560
You low-born foxfolk

46
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,240
deserve to die!

47
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,520
Die!

48
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,639
Jiang Jinghuai.

49
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,120
Did you think she loved you?

50
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,639
That's right.

51
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,399
I never ever loved you.

52
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,879
Just go astray.

53
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,240
I've been wrong

54
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,399
about you.

55
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,959
You're not the Jiang Zhiyu
I've loved for the past three centuries.

56
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,199
You are a demoness.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,079
You are a devil!

58
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,920
Let me help you with it.

59
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,519
I promise you.

60
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,600

(Even if I end up
being in the bottomless pit,)

68
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,759
(I must avenge this.)

69
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,260
(Demon Clan)

70
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,720
Greetings, My Lord!

71
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,252
You are above the three realms

72
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:41,800
and six paths.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,427
If you fight the Heaven's way again,

74
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:44,920
victory is surely yours.

75
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,759
Greetings, My Lord!

76
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,297
You are above the three realms

77
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:49,720
and six paths.

78
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,277
If you fight the Heaven's way again,

79
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:52,800
victory is surely yours.

80
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,680
With the demon clan's power of rebirth,

81
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,399
I've finally resurrected you

82
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,040
by retrieving the remnants of your soul.

83
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,879
Huai.

84
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,480
Master.

85
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,560
I killed a kind-hearted girl.

86
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,439
What is your name?

87
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,040
Fate did bring us together.

88
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,240
Mine comes with the word "Luo" too.
My name is Luo Ying.

89
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,439
Since I first met you,

90
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,800
I've fallen for you.

91
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,240
Right?

92
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,680
No.

93
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,040
That's not it.

94
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,040
She was a mere stepping stone to me.

95
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,720
All I had to get was the spirit stone

96
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,879
to resurrect Master.

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
So what if I had been killed

98
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,839
from doing so?

99
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,319
(Now that)

100
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,839
(I've had the Saintess' spirit stone,)

101
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,519
(I will get all three spirit stones)

102
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,079
(as long as Nangong Xiao keeps his word.)

103
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,341
(And Master will return soon.)

104
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:31,340
(Demon Clan)

105
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,839
Did you ask for me, Huai?

106
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,399
Have you found her?

107
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,240
Answer me.

108
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,320
I never tried to look for Jiang Zhiyu.

109
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,680
That demoness deceived and used you.

110
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,439
Haven't you learned your lesson?

111
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,800
Outrageous!

112
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,199
Search for her at once!

113
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,000
And this is an order.

114
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,680
If you dare disobey me again,

115
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,680
don't blame me for being merciless.

116
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,680
Do you really love her so much?

117
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,399
This isn't love.

118
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,959
I simply want to torture

119
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,759
the one who betrayed me.

120
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,920
After receiving that blow from you,
she's now a wandering soul.

121
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,399
I'm afraid

122
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,000
she's under
the custodian of the resurrection realm.

123
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,639
Get the custodian here immediately.
