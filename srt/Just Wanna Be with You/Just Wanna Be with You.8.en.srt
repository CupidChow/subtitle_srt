to be the one chosen by our clan.)

16

(Come quickly.)

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,719
(Come quickly!)

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,840
(So the secret path to the Demon Clan)

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,280

23
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,560
(I know you don't want
to forget Jiang Zhiyu.)

24
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,719
(Then take me down.)

25
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,319
(I can restore the thread
of love that was severed.)

26
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,120
(But you will be consumed
by demonic energy)

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,639
(and fall into the demon path.)

28
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,280
(Do you accept?)

29
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,319
I do.

30
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,199
Are you really willing to do this?

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,719
I am!

32
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,280

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,960
The Goddess is marrying high.

36
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,159
The auspicious time has come.

37
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,160

38
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,040

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,120
(Yu, wait for me.)

40
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,399
(I will come back to save you.)

41
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
First bow to the Heavens.

00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,600

Unwilling?

46
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,879
She is my woman.

47
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
This final bow

48
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,199
must be with me, Jiang Jinghuai.

51
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,920

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,240

and driven Nangong Xiao back,

81
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,080
but training in forbidden techniques

82
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,440
is never a long-term solution.

83
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,799
I have my own plan.

84
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,120

Now that Jiang Zhiyu
has lost her memory,

87
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,759
why not take this chance
to cut ties completely?

88
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,280
I still remember back then,

89
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,880
when I was training in the demonic path,

90
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,520
I endured the agony of a thousand arrows
piercing my heart every day.

91
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,039
Whenever the pain was unbearable,

92
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,519
Yu would appear by my side

93
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:16,840
and stay with me.

94
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,320
Huai.

95
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Are you all right?

96
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,519
You fell into darkness because of me.

97
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,360
Was it worth it?

98
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,600
For you,

99
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,639
I'd gladly vanish into ashes.

100
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,399
I live my whole life
for just three words,

101
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,159
Jiang Zhiyu.

102
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,720
Huai, I'm really worried about you.

103
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,639
You don't need to worry about me.

104
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,600
Look.

105
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,360
I'm doing fine, aren't I?

106
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,399
I promised you

107
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,600
I'd live each day with you.

108
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,480
So of course I'll protect
my own life first.

109
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,559
There, there.

110
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,120
No more tears.

111
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,240
Otherwise,

112
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,679
my heart will ache again.

113
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,120
(Even if it's all just fantasy,)

114
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:40,720
(but Yu,)

115
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,480
(it was you
who gave me the courage to live.)

116
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,039
After everything we've been through,

117
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,679
I understand even more clearly now,

118
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,360
even if it costs my life,
I will protect her peace.

119
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,320
We've come so far together
through so much.

120
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,039
So I sincerely hope

121
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,360
you can give us your blessing.

122
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,039
But Jiang Zhiyu
has already lost her memory.

123
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,720
What do you plan to do?

124
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,440
In the forbidden grounds of Cangyun,

125
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,799
her sealed memories remain.

126
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,799
I'll take her to retrieve them.

129
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,440
could actually wield the full power
of the Demon Clan's spirit stone.

130
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,200
His strength has grown immensely,

131
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,679
and we've been left in disgrace.

132
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,759
My Lord,

133
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,200
what should we do next?

134
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,840
Perhaps there's someone who can help me.

135
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,759
I'll make good use

136
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,879
of the weakness born of their deep love.

137
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,679
Let them see that love
can be sweet as honey

138
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,360
or sharper than blades.

139
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,159
