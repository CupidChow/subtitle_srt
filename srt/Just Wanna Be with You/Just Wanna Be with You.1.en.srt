13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,239
Heavenly Gate opened.

14
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,159
All clans came to celebrate.

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,159
The champion of Cangyun's
centennial gladiatorial competition

16
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,920
will enjoy eternal immortality.

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,120
Why aren't you watching?

18
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,200
Don't you think
it's cruel to enjoy watching

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,879
different clans kill each other?

20
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,159
They're all lowly beings.

21
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,439
How is it cruel?

22
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,919
Cangyun's gladiatorial ceremony
is held once every century.

23
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,800
Just being noticed by us

24
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,759
is already the highest honor
they could have.

25
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,599
But...

26
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,199
Yu.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,759
(Jiu.)

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,919
(Yu.)

29
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,199
(I finally got to see you again.)

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,240
(Everyone says celestial clan is noble,)

31
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,719
(but I've never seen
such a real wilderness.)

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
(Thank you, Jiu.)

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,800
I want to give you this freedom.

34
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:55,919
Do you like it?

35
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,919
Yes.

36
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,319
(May your heart mirror mine.)

37
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,199
(I will never let you down.)

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,919
Lingxiao clan and Cangyun
have been married for generations.

39
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,360
You don't even know that?

40
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,039
You only told me

41
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,840
to come to Cangyun
to learn summoning technique

42
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,080
and awaken the spirit stone.

43
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,080
You never told me about marriage.

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,080
Soon you will become
the mistress of Cangyun.

45
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,360
If you refuse to marry,

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,960
the entire Lingxiao clan
will be destroyed.

47
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,159
Marriage between Lingxiao and Cangyun

48
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,719
is a thousand-year-old tradition.

49
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,000
If I refuse to marry,

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
our entire clan will be destroyed.

51
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,560
Let's stop seeing each other.

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,479
(Yu.)

54
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,719
(I learned forbidden techniques
and broke into Cangyun)

55
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,039
(just to see you again.)

56
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,400
(I'm here.)

57
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,680
(Jiu, you shouldn't have come.)

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,000
What's your name?

59
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,000
Jiu.

60
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,800
I'm in good mood today,

61
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,560
so I will accept you as my disciple.

62
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,960
What reward do you want?

63
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,319
I want her.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How dare you speak nonsense?

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,040
What a bold foxfolk slave.

66
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,720
How dare you go after Goddess?

67
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,720
Your Excellency.

68
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,070
We foxfolk have been subservient
to Cangyun for generations.

69
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,319
Please consider the peace of our clans

70
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,480
and spare him.

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,399
You're the same.

72
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,399
Good disciple.

73
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,680
After entering Cangyun,

74
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,759
you must submit to me forever.

75
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,439
Otherwise...

76
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,839
Your Excellency.

77
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,639
You and I will be married soon.

78
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,399
Taking a new disciple
is a double blessing.

79
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,680
Spare him.

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
Alright!

81
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,720
Double blessing.

82
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,879
Cangyun's blessings are endless.

83
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,959
Sovereign is blessed with longevity.

84
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,079
Cangyun's blessings are endless.

85
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,279
Sovereign is blessed with longevity.

86
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,759
Cangyun's blessings are endless.

87
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,079
Sovereign is blessed with longevity.

88
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,020
(Cangyun)

89
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,600
You exchanged glances
with that foxfolk today.

90
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,040
Do you have any ulterior motives?

91
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,000
For thousands of years,

92
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,680
Lingxiao married Cangyun clan

93
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,120
to receive protection.

94
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,360
Don't let me catch you.

95
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:31,959
Jiu!

96
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,199
Why risk joining a duel?

97
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,199
Only by entering Cangyun
can we get the spirit stone

98
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,439
and protect foxfolk.

99
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,720
You and I have meager magic.

100
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,120
We can't rival Nangong Xiao.

101
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,360
I entered Cangyun

102
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,360
also because I wanted to see her.

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
I advise you

104
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,000
not to have ideas
about Sovereign's woman.

105
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,040
You and I are humble to the bone.

106
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,920
Only by surrendering

107
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,439
can we preserve the peace of our clans.

108
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,279
Take care of yourself.

109
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,839
(I know she was forced.)

110
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,439
(I want to take her away.)

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,199
(I don't want to give up.)

112
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,020
(Cangyun)

113
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,040
You've worked hard
for the glory of the two clans.

114
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,079
You must serve as my eyes.

115
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,639
Awakening the ancient spirit stone

116
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,319
is the duty of all Goddesses.

117
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,959
It's my duty
to take care of the Goddess.

118
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,240
Have you found
the entrance to demon clan's forest?

119
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,920
Rest assured, Your Excellency.

120
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,600
I've sent people to search for it.

121
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,120
Once I find demon clan's spirit stone,

122
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,879
unifying the three realms

123
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,879
is just around the corner.

124
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,439
Yu.

125
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,759
Yu.

126
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,839
Yu.

127
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,319
Jiu?

128
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,160
Why are you here?

129
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,959
I'm here to take you away from here.

130
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,959
I can't leave Cangyun.

131
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,240
My clan

132
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,680
still needs Cangyun's protection.

133
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,480
Yu.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,680
He just treats you as a tool.

135
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,720
He wants you to help him
summon spirit stones.

136
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,680
Don't you get it yet?

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,759
Nangong Xiao

138
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,159
commits all evil
in the guise of a celestial being.

139
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,559
He won't spare you.

140
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,759
I'll find a way
to protect you and your clan.

141
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,600
Believe me.

142
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,679
But...

143
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,720
Come with me.

144
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,840
Hurry up.

145
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:55,879
(Jiu.)

146
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,679
(Why don't you listen to advice?)

147
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,000
Yu.

148
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,840
(Yu.)

149
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,759
(Nangong Xiao won't spare you.)

150
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,919
(Oh no, what should I do?)

151
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,720
Greetings, Saintess.

152
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,159
How's your cultivation progressing?

153
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,399
It has always been smooth.

154
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,320
If there's nothing else, please go back.

155
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,399
Where's Luo Ying?

156
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,000
She...

157
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,720
She went to the forest
to collect divine dew for me.

158
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,039
You two are usually inseparable,

159
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
