Where have you been?

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:29,760
My dear!

15
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,000
My dear!

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,439
My dear.

17
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,560
You're hurting me!

18
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,480
My dear!

19
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,400
My dear!

20
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,319
Are you scared of me?

21
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,560
I'm not.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
No?

23
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,480
Don't lie to me.

24
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,560
This blood can regulate vitality
and restore life.

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,120
I hope you don't find it frightening.

26
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,439
Be good

27
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,000
and I will protect you.

28
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,439
Take it.

29
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,759
Let me do it.

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,439
I...

31
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,080
Jiang Zhiyu.

32
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,840
I...

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,599
Why are you still stubborn?

34
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,599
I'm just trying to get rid of evil.

35
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,800
Ying.

36
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
You want to kill me?

37
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,759
You low-born foxfolk

38
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
deserve to die!

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,439
(So what if it hurts?)

40
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,280
(As long as I can get rid of him.)

41
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,840
(I hate you.)

42
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,040
(I hate you,)

43
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,920
(Jiang Jinghuai.)

44
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,920
(Even if I end up
being in the bottomless pit,)

45
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,399
(I must avenge this.)

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,000
Jiang Jinghuai.

47
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,120
You're as ignorant as ever.

48
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,560
Let go of me!

49
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,519
That didn't kill you?

50
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,079
What a shame.

51
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,680
We must execute this woman at once!

52
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,519
Execute me?

53
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,160
I'm now a mortal,

54
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,680
but he still can't stop bothering me.

55
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,480
Do you think he will have it better

56
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,279
if I die?

57
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,000
Do it!

58
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,000
Step back!

59
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,519
She is mine, so I will do it myself.

60
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,360
Huai!

61
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
It's come to this point,
and you're still defending her?

62
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,680
Jiang Jinghuai.

63
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,519
Just drop the act already.

64
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,439
I'm disgusted

65
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,720
by what you're doing here.

66
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,439
So what if you're disgusted?

67
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,199
You still have to be with me

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,240
all the time.

69
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,120
Lock her away in the Abyssal Prison.

70
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,279
(Jiang Ziyu.)

71
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,680
(If you want to die,)

72
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,160
(I must be the one to end your life.)

73
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,740
(Cangyun)

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,440
Congratulations, My Lord.

75
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,720
Isn't it time

76
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,480
for you to fulfill your promise?

77
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,920
Why? Are you afraid
of me going back on my word?

78
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,360
How can the spirit stone of Cangyun
change hands so easily, My Lord?

79
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Please think twice.

80
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,079
I am a man of my word.

81
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,600
However,

82
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,399
to resurrect your master,

83
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,120
you have to collect
all three spirit stones

84
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:36,879
and

85
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,519
exhaust all of your cultivation.

86
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,279
Will you do that?

87
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
If that can bring my master
back to life,

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,920
so what if it gets me

89
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,279
killed?

90
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,680
Thank you.

91
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,680
My Lord.

92
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,980
Are you really handling the spirit stone
to some outsider?

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,560
It takes a thousand years of cultivation

94
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
to refine the three spirit stones.

95
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,079
He's just doing me a favor here.

96
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:31,959
Demoness!

97
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,240
You harbinger of disaster!

98
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,000
Weren't you going to whip me?

99
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,360
Why stop now?

100
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,720
Sure.

101
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,399
Of course I will do it.

102
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,360
And I'm not going to hold back.

103
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,360
You've softened again, Huai.

104
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,360
Jiang Jinghuai.

105
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,840
You killed the sister
who stood by me for a century.

106
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,560
And you stole the spirit stone
and brought chaos to the three realms.

107
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,920
And you're locking me up here

108
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,959
because you want to treat me
like a prisoner.

109
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,800
So, don't pretend to care about me.

110
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,399
Since you hate me so much,

111
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,120
kill me.

112
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,920
Do you really hate me that much?

113
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,759
Then why didn't you
stab me harder that day?

114
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,120
You're just the same, no?

115
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,399
I know what to do

116
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,679
with my prisoners.

117
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,159
You will stay here.

118
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,159
That way, I can torture you
whenever I want.

119
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,679
(Let me help you
put an end to it, Huai.)

120
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,759
What do you want?

121
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,640
By order of the Demon Lord,

122
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,080
you are to be executed.

123
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,279
I won't let him get away with it
even if I die.

124
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,800
Those who fall into Hatewater River

125
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
will have their blood soaked
with boundless hatred.

126
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,080
Not only will they not escape it,

127
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,560
but they will be tormented every day.

128
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,920
I won't let you hurt Huai again.

129
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,260
(Hatewater River)

130
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,559
Before bearing any bloodline,

131
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,320
Goddess Jiang Zhiyu

132
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,799
possessed a body
that neither dies nor perishes.

133
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,519
Jiang Zhiyu.

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,440
It's time you learnt your lesson.

135
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,039
Remember who made you suffer unbearably

136
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,320
and tried to kill you time and again.

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,240
Who's that?

138
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,200
Due to your overwhelming hatred,

139
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,679
you crossed Hatewater River.

140
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,360
But you ended up going astray.

141
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,600
Why are you here?

142
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,960
We both ended up this way
because of him.

143
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,320
Why don't we join hands

144
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
and kill him?

145
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,159
You want to use me?

146
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,320
Why?

147
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,279
Don't you hate him?

148
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,679
I do.

149
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
Then I shall grant you this pill.

150
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,399
Take this pill

151
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,000
and you'll gain the power
of the Red-Clad Fiendess.

152
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,600
That way, you can get close to him

153
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,399
and kill him.

154
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,120
And what will you gain from this?

155
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,759
If he dies,

156
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
I can take control of the demon clan.

157
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,600
However,

158
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,480
once you take this pill,

159
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,559
you'll endure pain
that corrodes your bones.

160
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,519
Will you do that?

161
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,679
If it means I can kill him,

162
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,600
