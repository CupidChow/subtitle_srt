to the Underworld Lord")

=Episode 12=

13
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,120
Master,

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,879
soon it will be the happiest day
of my dear friend's life,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,319
and the day
I finally get the spirit stone.

16
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,680
You always taught me to be loyal

17
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,079
and true to my friends.

18
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,319
But for you,

19
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,480
I will become
someone heartless and disloyal.

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,079
Once you awaken,

21
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,120
I'll give you a grand wedding too.

22
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,400
My Lord.

23
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,159
Everything is in place.

24
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,159
Yan Luo really is a useful piece.

25
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,400
Having one more person help me
get the spirit stone.

26
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,719
How delightful.

27
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,719
Once I've gathered all three,

28
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,159
everyone across the three realms

29
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,280
will have no choice but to obey me.

30
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,400
Why isn't it time yet?

31
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,400
You're so impatient.

32
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,840
Marrying Yu is something

33
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,199
I've dreamed of for a hundred years.

34
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,760
Of course, I can't wait a moment longer.

35
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,160
Huai,

36
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,600
your dream is finally coming true.

37
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,000
Congratulations.

38
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,319
You stayed by Nangong Xiao's side
for years, just for me.

39
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,000
I owe you.

40
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,959
What's past is past.

41
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
Today is a joyful day.

42
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,800
Let's be happy.

43
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,319
Right.

44
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,279
When did you learn

45
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
how to make this?

46
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,639
It's a tradition of the foxfolk.

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,800
We wear "red flowers"
to welcome the bride.

48
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,839
A sign of a prosperous,

49
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,680
fiery love ahead.

50
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,199
You know more than I thought.

51
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,279
The auspicious hour has arrived.

52
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,079
Go on.

53
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,759
Why are you lifting the veil
before the ceremony is complete?

54
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,040
Wasn't I already your bride

55
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,879
the day you came back?

56
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,399
Why fuss over formalities now?

57
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,639
Jiang Jinghuai,

58
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,560
do you love me?

59
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,160
With all my heart,
until the end of time.

60
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,959
Now that His Lordship
has left Cangyun,

61
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,079
the three realms are in chaos
over the spirit stone.

62
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,560
Why don't you hand me

63
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,720
the demon clan's spirit stone

64
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,560
for safekeeping?

65
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,960
Wouldn't that be best?

66
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,720
Some proclamation of love you made.

67
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,920
You're already having second thoughts.

68
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,040
If it's what you want,
I'll give it to you.

69
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,360
Yes. Yes.

70
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,319
That's it.

71
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,399
Keep going.

72
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,800
Huai! Don't give it to her!

73
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,560
Stay out of this!

74
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,639
Carry on.

75
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,279
I'll do it myself.

76
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,639
You vile woman!

77
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,240
Everything you've done

78
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,079
has been for the spirit stone!

79
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,120
Is there anyone in the three realms
who doesn't want it?

80
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,519
Fool.

81
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,399
Are you telling me

82
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,439
our hundred years together
meant nothing?

83
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,319
A lowly slave thinking you could win

84
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,800
the love of someone
from the celestial clan?

85
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,639
What a joke.

86
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,040
It's mine!

87
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,519
Hand it over!

88
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,000
What a pathetic slave.

89
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,319
Huai,

90
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,639
she's been lying to you all along!

91
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,959
Everything was just
for the spirit stone...

92
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,679
Wu!

93
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,000
Huai...

94
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,840
