13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,879
I was right.

14
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,959
You do have another agenda.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,239
You've been investigating me.

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,040
Let's not play games.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,160
If you want to use the spirit stone
to save someone,

18
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,000
I can help you.

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,519
Why not work together?

20
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,200
I don't understand a word
you're saying, My Lord.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,159
I didn't expect

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,079
Qing Wei's disciple to be this foolish.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,319
Even if you've uncovered
everything about me,

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,439
I will never work with you.

25
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,840
They're my friends.

26
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,480
Friends?

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,799
Do you think Jiang Zhiyu,
once she finds out what you're after,

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,280
or Jiang Jinghuai and Luo Ying,

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,480
do you think
they'll still consider you a friend?

30
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,439
I don't know
how they'll see me in the end.

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
But what I do know

32
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,560
is that nothing good will come

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,520
from working with you.

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,719
You help me get the spirit stone,

35
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,199
and I'll help you save your master.

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,639
Take your time to think it over.

37
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,680
But know that I'm your only chance.

38
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,639
Why are you staring at me?

39
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,039
Jiang Zhiyu,

40
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,000
when will you marry me?

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,159
Do you love me that much?

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,000
But I haven't decided yet.

43
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,599
You should spend more time
reading instead.

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,879
It's late. Stop reading.

45
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,320
It'll strain your eyes.

46
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,400
Let me tell you a joke.

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,520
Once,

48
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,000
there were two brothers.

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,400
One night, the younger brother
couldn't sleep because of the mosquitoes.

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,560
He said to the older brother,

51
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,479
"There are so many mosquitoes tonight."

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,680
The older brother told him,

53
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,159
"Blow out the candles

54
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,280
and the mosquitoes won't come."

55
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,039
The little brother blew out the candles.

56
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,400
And then,

57
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,879
fireflies flew in.

58
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,840
Guess what the younger brother said?

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,960
He said,

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,280
"Big brother,

61
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,719
the mosquitoes brought lanterns
with them!"

62
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,840
Jiang Jinghuai,

63
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,879
you've told that joke a hundred times.

64
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,120
Let me finish it, then.

65
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,760
The older brother couldn't sleep

66
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,199
because of all the noise

67
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,800
and asked,

68
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,520
"Hey, do you know what a mirror says

69
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,879
when it falls from a great height?"

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
What does it say?

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,719
It says,

72
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,960
"It's getting late

73
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,879
because I crashed!"

74
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,959
I was just thinking,
we've really been through a lot

75
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,879
to get here.

76
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,639
But being with you

77
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,240
makes me feel so happy.

78
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,800
Jiang Jinghuai,

79
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,600
I love you.

80
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,639
Jiang Zhiyu,

81
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,560
I love you too.

82
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,439
300 years.

83
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,360
I've loved you

84
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,360
for that long.

85
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,439
I tried everything I could
to keep your body from decaying.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,920
I held on, hoping one day

87
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,879
you'd wake up

88
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,959
and return to me.

89
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,160
Once I gather all three spirit stones,

90
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,879
you'll wake.

91
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,439
And when you do,

92
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,680
you'll love me.

93
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,439
Master.

94
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,839
I'll never betray you.

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,560
I'll only ever love you.

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,759
From the moment

97
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,759
you took me in 300 years ago,

98
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,600
it was destined.

99
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,040
What I had with Luo Ying

100
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,959
was nothing but an act.

101
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,079
A ploy.

102
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,319
Yes, a useful one.

103
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,200
Now that I've gained
the Goddess's trust,

104
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,800
and I am about to get the spirit stone,

105
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,279
you'll wake soon.

106
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,639
And I'll marry you.

107
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,560
Red robes, wedding sedan,

108
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,879
blessings all around.

109
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,279
How does that sound?

110
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,360
Soon, you'll be back with me.

111
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,839
I won't be long.

112
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,519
This safety charm is really effective.

113
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,399
(I should fold a few more for Yu.)

114
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,480
(May these charms keep her safe)

115
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,879
(and happy from now on.)

116
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,319
(But...)

117
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,560
(Jiang Jinghuai is cultivating
a forbidden technique...)

118
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,439
Right.

119
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,639
What kind of forbidden art
is he cultivating?

120
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,000
He actually defeated Nangong Xiao.

121
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,720
Huai has learned

122
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,240
a forbidden technique,

123
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,800
and obtained
the demon clan's spirit stone.

124
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,240
A forbidden technique?

125
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,520
(I fear he won't be able
to control the demonic energy.)

126
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,319
(He might hurt Yu.)

127
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,600
(I have to tell her.)

128
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,240
(Yan Luo?)

129
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
(I've tried
investigating him several times,)

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
(and still couldn't uncover
his real identity.)

131
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,839
(He is acting strangely.)

132
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,960
(I doubt his feelings
for Luo Ying are genuine.)

133
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:36,800
Yan Luo.

134
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,360
Where are you going?

135
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,199
To find Luo Ying, of course.

136
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,519
Her room's that way.

137
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,199
Thank you, Goddess.

138
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,600
Yan Luo.

139
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,759
You came
from the Spirit-Awakening Chamber.

140
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,680
I haven't been

141
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,759
in Cangyun long.

142
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,319
Maybe I just got lost.

143
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,600
The chamber is well hidden.

144
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,439
Even seasoned disciples of Cangyun
have trouble finding it.

145
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,040
And yet you, newly arrived,

146
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,800
navigate it so well.

147
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,079
You're lying.

148
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,120
What's this all about?

149
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,639
Afraid I'm after the spirit stone?

150
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,159
You said it yourself.

151
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,919
Who in this world

152
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,039
wouldn't be tempted by it?

153
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,120
You've got it all wrong.

154
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,639
I hope it is just a misunderstanding.

155
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,200
If it's not,

156
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,399
I'm warning you now.

157
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,320
Whatever you're planning,

158
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,320
Luo Ying is my sister.

159
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,120
You are not allowed to hurt her.

160
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,080
She's devoted to you.

161
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,039
If you truly care about her,

162
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,399
treat her right.

163
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,919
If you're using her,

164
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,240
I will never forgive you.

165
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,360
Of course.
