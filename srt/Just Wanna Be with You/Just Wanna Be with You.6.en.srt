Huai.

14
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,719
It's the Silver Snow Flowers.

15
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,359
They say it only blooms

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,760

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,840
That means

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,439
our love is real.

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,720
I, Jiang Jinghuai, swear this.

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,840
With the Silver Snow Flower as witness,

21
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,560
in every lifetime,

22
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,879
I will love only Jiang Zhiyu.

23
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,280
I want to marry you.

24
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,159
Will you be my wife?

25
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,520
I will.

26
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,319
Yu, I will walk through
every cycle of rebirth with you,

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,200
and stay by your side
through this world and beyond.

28
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,520
It's Ying.

29
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:55,840
(Sister,)

30
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
(you've entered
the forbidden grounds of Cangyun.)

31
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
(If you don't leave now,)

32
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,000
(your souls will be destroyed.)

33
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,759
(Now that the Saintess and Nangong Xiao)

34
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,360
(believe you are beyond rescue,)

35
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,240
(they've stopped searching Cangyun.)

36
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,439
(Follow the golden butterfly
and come out now.)

37
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,159
Looks like we can finally leave.

38
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,360
But are you sure your body can take it?

39
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,520
Don't worry. I'm fine.

40
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,240
Let's go.

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,159
Yu, don't worry.

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,400
We'll go find
the demon clan's spirit stone now.

43
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,439
Madam.

44
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,560
Sister.

45
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,400
Ying.

46
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,159
Madam,

47
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,319
you were hard to find.

48
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,319
My lord.

49
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,520
Luo Ying was the key to our plan.

50
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,840
She should be well rewarded.

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,719
Sister, that's not true.

52
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,880
Nangong Xiao,

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,920
you forced Luo Ying
to lure out the golden butterfly

54
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,400
and tricked me into showing myself.

55
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,160
You're despicable!

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,879
Don't worry.

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,800
Those who are loyal to me

58
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,600
will always be well rewarded.

59
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,279
But anyone who betrays me

60
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,199
will never be forgiven.

61
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,000
Hand over the spirit stone!

62
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,720
Sister.

63
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,079
Huai.

64
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,079
Huai.

65
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
You insolent foxfolk.

66
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,600
You seduced the Goddess
and stole the spirit stone.

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,959
You defied your master
and betrayed Cangyun.

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
He didn't.

69
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,000
He didn't!

70
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,680
I've long had enough

71
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,079
of your damn rules in Cangyun.

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,079
Even if I'm crushed to dust today,

73
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,680
at least I'll die on my own terms.

74
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,800
Leave the woman out of this.

75
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,920
Come at me instead!

76
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,040
My lord.

77
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,639
This foxfolk is so arrogant.

78
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,199
He should be executed immediately.

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,480
Brother.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,560
No.

81
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
It has nothing to do with Huai.

82
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,879
It was me. I fell in love with him.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,759
Nonsense!

84
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,160
You were clearly bewitched
by that foxfolk.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
You are the Goddess of Cangyun.

86
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:47,000
You are my rightful wife.

87
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,079
She belongs to me!

88
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,279
Goddess, did you hear that?

89
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,279
Who do you truly belong to?

90
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,720
In this life,
I will only love Jiang Jinghuai.

91
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,879
My lord.

92
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,639
That foxfolk
dares to fight you for the Goddess.

93
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,879
You people of Cangyun
are cold and heartless.

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,800
I will never leave Yu,
even if it means death.

95
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,439
My lord.

96
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,240
Those two really are madly in love.

97
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,639
Is that so?

98
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,279
Then what should we do?

99
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,439
How about this?

100
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,680
Throw the foxfolk
into the Eternal Ice Lake

101
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,160
and let him suffer slowly.

102
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,079
Let him fully enjoy
the kindness of the Sovereign.

103
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,959
As for the Goddess,

104
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,519
let the Severing Blade cut off her love.

105
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,319
Let it pierce her soul
and destroy her feelings.

106
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,000
Then she will submit to you forever.

107
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,759
Very well.

108
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,319
What is the Severing Blade?

109
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,879
You won't be able to withstand it.

110
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,920
Huai, go now.

111
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,000
Whatever it is,

112
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,519
I'll bear it for you.

113
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,959
One has their love cut off,

114
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,120
and the other suffers for eternity.

115
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,319
No.

116
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:46,120
I'll make you suffer
in the soul-freezing ice

117
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,199
and watch the one
you love sever all ties.

118
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,879
Huai!

119
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,519
A hundred years of love
will be sliced apart, one cut at a time.

120

Huai!

121
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,279
She will still love you,

122
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,040
but you will forever forget her name

123
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,560
and her face.
