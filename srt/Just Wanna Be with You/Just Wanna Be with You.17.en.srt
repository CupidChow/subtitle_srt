Zhihu Novelist, Little Qi's)

to the Underworld Lord")

=Episode 12=

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,719
You actually fed me
a Spirit-Dissolving Pill.

14
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,920
Jiang Jinghuai.

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,719
How laughable you are.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,000
You killed Luo Ying
and stole the spirit stone.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,120
And you still dared
harbored dirty thoughts towards me.

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,280
You never lost your memory.

19
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,159
I can't afford to forget it.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,519
It hurts, doesn't it?

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,439
But the pain you feel today

22
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,000
is nothing compared to

23
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,000
the pain I felt when you betrayed me.

24
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,079
Demon Lord.

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,879
How does it feel to be suffocating?

26
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,319
Don't worry.

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,800
I'll send you to your death right away.

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,800
Demoness.

29
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,400
You truly are malicious!

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,879
If I hadn't seen through you long ago,

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,919
you would have gotten your way today!

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,080
Guards!

33
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,560
Throw her into the Abyssal Prison!

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,479
Jiang Jinghuai, I will kill you!

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,159
Move!

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,879
Huai!

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,199
(Master.)

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,600
(I've exhausted
a hundred years' worth of power.)

39
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,039
(These three spirit stones)

40
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,719
(are about to converge.)

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,039
(The three spirit stones
have been refined.)

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,719
(You'll wake up soon, Master.)

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,000
No!

44
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,840
She won't make it.

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,080
It's truly worth all the trouble.

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,879
You promised me

47
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,280
to save my master!

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,800
I said I'd save her.

49
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,120
But I never said I'd keep her alive.

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,560
(Master.)

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,520
(I've been a schemer
for a hundred years.)

52
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,560
(I betrayed my brother)

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,199
(and got Luo Ying killed.)

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,199
(Now I've been used by Nangong Xiao.)

55
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,919
(Blame it on my foolishness.)

56
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,800
(I've let you down.)

57
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,639
(I'll make sure you live.)

58
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,159
(Master.)

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,159
(No matter what,)

60
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,839
(you must wake up.)

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,959
Yan Luo.

62
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,920
Who hurt you?

63
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:48,920
It was me.

65
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,079
It's all my fault.

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,639
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,720
Get up first.

68
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,240
I set up Yu on that day.

69
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,839
Everything happened
during the wedding was my doing.

70
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,040
To save my master

71
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,600
and gather the three spirit stones,

72
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,439
I had no choice
but to turn to Nangong Xiao.

73
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Possess the Goddess

74
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,839
and drive them apart.

75
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,000
Say that again.

76
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,720
I deserve to be punished.

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,199
But Nangong Xiao has now gathered
the three spirit stones.

78
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,000
My master's life is hanging by a thread.

79
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,800
I beg of you, please save her.

80
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,920
Please kill me.

81
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,399
If my master dies,
I don't want to live either.

82
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,000
If I kill you,

83
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,800
who will atone for your sins?

84
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,680
What trick are you trying now?

85
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,879
Say it!

86
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,879
Say it!

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,600
My selfishness

89
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,839
caused your misunderstanding.

90
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,079
I only hope

91
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,639
it's not too late
to tell you the truth now.

92
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,600
It was because I trusted Nangong Xiao

93
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,800
that such a great disaster unfolded.

94
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,519
I killed Luo Ying.

95
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,639
I killed Wu too.

96
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,199
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,480
