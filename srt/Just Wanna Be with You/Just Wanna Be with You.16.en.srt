16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,719

(Could it be)

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,760
(that you really hate me that much?)

19
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,280
The Lord of Cangyun
has reached the Demon Region.

20
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,319
Here comes an old friend.

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,840
Jiang Jinghuai.

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,480
How does it feel being the Demon Lord?

23
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,719
Apologies for not greeting you sooner,
Lord of Cangyun.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,439
Back in Cangyun, you called me master.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,840
Today, as your master,

26
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,920
I've come to invite you to my wedding.

27
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,760
Meet my dear.

28
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,039
Jiang Zhiyu?

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,400
My dear.

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,520
This disciple of yours
really lacks manners.

31
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,800
He dares call me by name.

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,159
Don't take it to heart, my dear.

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,039
He's always been like this.

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,240
Moreover,

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,360
he once wanted to take you as his wife.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,199
My dear.

37
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,960
My body and heart belong to you now.

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,319
Don't be jealous, alright?

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,639
Of course.

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,520
A master is like a father.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,919
Well,

42
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,120
you will be in charge of my wedding,
my good disciple.

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,560
Sure.

44
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,240
You truly are a fickle woman.

45
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,400
So what?

46
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,599
Jiang Jinghuai.

47
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,639
You're nothing but pathetic.

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,960
I heard you've been looking for me.

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,039
Are you still thinking about me?

50
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,840
That's right.

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,280
I wish I could kill you
with my own hands.

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,680
My good disciple.

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,840
It's rather improper

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
to be standing so close to my dear.

55
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,840
You think I'm still the Jiu
from back then?

56
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,840
Anyone who attempts to assassinate
the Demon Lord shall be killed on sight!

57
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,000
The doomed devotion is sealed.

58
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,600
And it's bound for eternity,
life after life.

59
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,480
As long as you love her,

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,160
you are doomed to die.

61
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,399
Why did the power suddenly vanish?

62
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,000
The doomed devotion pill
harms all sides.

63
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,519
She may suffer memory loss
when she wakes up.

64
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,000
To be entangled with her
for all eternity,

65
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,040
that suits me just fine.

66
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,340
(Cangyun)

67
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,800
Congratulations, My Lord.

68
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,199
The plan was a success.

69
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,440
With the doomed devotion sealed,

70
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,040
only one of them can survive.

71
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,079
Indeed.

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,759
Let them love
and hate each other to death.

73
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,439
Now I must gather the spirit stones

74
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,160
and unify the three realms.

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,240
Huai. That woman treated you so terribly.

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,079
Why keep her in the Demon Region?

77
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,199
Why don't we just kill her?

78
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,240
It's between her and me.

79
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,280
You should just stay out of it.

80
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,560
Jiang Jinghuai.

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,680
Jiang Jinghuai.

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,199
Jiang Jinghuai.

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:49,959
Huai.

84
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,480
Yes.

85
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,560
Who are you?

86
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,439
Jiang Jinghuai.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,879
You are Jiang Jinghuai?

88
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,079
Why is that the only name I remember?

89
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,000
I remember nothing else.

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,319
Then who am I?

91
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,560
You are Jiang Zhiyu.

92
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,439
You are my wife.

93
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,360
Are you

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
really my husband?

95
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
What are you sorry about?

97
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,360
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,480
I forgot about you.

99
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,439
What's wrong?

100
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,000
It's nothing.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,120
You've only just recovered.

102
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,360
You should get more rest.

103
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,560
Dear.

104
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,000
Could you tell me

105
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,720
about our past?

106
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:48,000
Can you tell me now?

107
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,600
(Why is he ignoring me?)

108
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,600
(Did I do something wrong?)

109
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,120
(Dear...)

110
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,320
Jiang Jinghuai...

111
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,320
Jiang Jinghuai...

112
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,720
Jiang Jinghuai...

113
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,720
What's the matter?

114
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,159
I told you

115
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,960
not to leave my side at all.

116
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,840
I didn't.

117
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,519
I was just taking a stroll.

118
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,120
Jiang Zhiyu.

119
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,519
Did you really forget

120
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,960
everything between us?

121
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,320
I don't remember that.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,120
But I do remember

123
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,039
your name is Jiang Jinghuai.

124
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,519
And you're my husband.

125
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,519
It's strange though.

126
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,519
Just now,

127
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,039
my heart felt like it was being stabbed.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,759
But when I saw you,

129
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,039
the pain went away.

130
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,039
(Jiang Zhiyu.)

131
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,480
(Are you being genuine)

132
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,240
(or not?)

133
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,480
Perhaps

134
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,280
it's because
you haven't had enough rest.

135
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,639
That's why your heart ached.

136
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Tomorrow I'll have the demon physician
examine you.

137
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,440
Sure.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,320
After this, wherever you're going,

139
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,399
let me know.

140
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,519
