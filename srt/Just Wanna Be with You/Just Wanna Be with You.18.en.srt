Yu.

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,599
You're injured.

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,040
Didn't you hurt me all this while?

18
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,519
So stop pretending to care.

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,959
It was all your fault.

20
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,480
It was all your fault!

21
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,319
No.

22
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,959
It wasn't your fault.

I got Cangyun into all this.

27
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,080
I trusted Nangong Xiao too easily.

28
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,159

I'm sorry.

33
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,319
I failed to protect you.

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,520
It was all my fault.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
I shouldn't have doubted you.

36
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,919
I shouldn't have blamed you.

37
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,360
I shouldn't have stopped trusting you.

38
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,680
All of that

39
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,960
wasn't your doing.

The doomed devotion
has taken deep root in us both.

Either one of us

44
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,759

I welcome the return
of the Ancient God Aohen

63

77
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,000
for my sake.

78

Master.

79
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,879
So you knew everything.

85
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,799
we both suffered defeat

86
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200

It's the Ancient God Aohen.

91
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,960
His return will bring disaster to all.

92
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,480
For the peace of the three realms,

93
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
we must destroy his soul completely

94
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,159
before he slaughters the world.

95
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,480
It's Aohen.
