(Cangyun)

14
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:15,640
Ying.

15
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:17,959
Yu.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,799
I was just about to come find you.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,200
I heard from Yan Luo

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,480
that Jiang Jinghuai is practicing
a forbidden technique.

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,840
He's on the verge of going astray.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,800
Did you know about this?

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,040
I'll talk to him
and get to the bottom of it.

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,680
But how could someone righteous

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,079
turn to the forbidden arts?

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,160
It's been a long time
since you last saw him.

25
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,519
Maybe he's already changed.

26
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,000
Ying, I know you're worried about me.

27
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,599
But Huai isn't a bad person.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,959
What about you, though?

29
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,400
Are you really going to be with Yan Luo?

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,560
Is that real love?

31
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,959
Isn't love exactly that?

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,560
Falling for someone
without realizing it?

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,640
But you've only known each other
for just over a month.

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,080
And he treats you like that already?

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,480
Doesn't that strike you as strange?

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,040
Yu!

37
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,079
Why are you so biased against him?

38
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:57,879
I have nothing.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,280
What could he possibly want from me?

40
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,120
In fact, I think Jiang Jinghuai's the one

41
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,159
who's hiding something.

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,079
Luo Ying.

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,159
Yan Luo has ulterior motives

44
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,240
regarding the spirit stone.

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't believe it.

46
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
If he had hidden motives,

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,120
why would he approach me

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,240
and not you?

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,199
Why wouldn't he just try

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,000
to get it from Jiang Jinghuai?

51
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,159
I think he's the one
with the real scheme.

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,800
I bet he's trying to use you
to get all three spirit stones

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,080
to become the next Nangong Xiao.

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,120
Ying.

55
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,240
Ying!

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,039
Ying!

57
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,280
Ying, stop!

58
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,800
Why?

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,080
Why is it fine for you
to be with Jiang Jinghuai,

60
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,520
but you want to stop my relationship?

61
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you want to drive him away from me?

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,240
Ying, you've misunderstood.

63
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,319
I'm just worried
you'll be deceived or hurt.

64
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,800
You don't know anything about him!

65
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,240
He's good to me.

66
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,759
He won't hurt me.

67
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,840
He won't let me down.

68
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,960
Yan Luo is full of secrets.

69
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,400
Let me look into him a little more.

70
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,479
I know.

71
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,280
I know you care about me.

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,080
But when you're truly moved,
it's never too early.

73
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,639
Come to think of it,

74
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,199
the first time I saw him,

75
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,919
I already felt something.

76
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,479
That's not love.

77
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,120
That's walking right into a trap.

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
And I've already told him

79
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,599
to stay away from you for now.

80
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,039
You had no right to do that!

81
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,280
Who do you think you are?

82
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,880
You only care about Jiang Jinghuai now!

83
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,640
There's no room for me
in your heart anymore!

84
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:12,840
Ying.

85
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,080
Yan Luo is not some ordinary...

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,159
That's enough. Say no more.

87
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,080
From now on, stay out of my life.

88
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,840
Ying!

89
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,159
Yan Luo,

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,280
let's leave.

91
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,080
Let's live a life
with just the two of us.

92
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,039
My cultivation is weak.

93
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,159
I can't protect you.

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,560
I don't need you to protect me.

95
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,280
I just want to see you every day.

96
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,360
To be with you every day.

97
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,879
That's enough for me.

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,159
Yan Luo, what's wrong?

99
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,280
Don't you want to be with me?

100
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,879
Luo Ying,

101
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,120
your sister was right.

102
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,639
Let's end this.

103
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,720
Why?

104
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,600
No reason.

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,720
Tell me why.

106
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,360
Because you're just a stand-in for her.

107
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
A shadow.

108
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,800
When I look at you, all I see is her.

109
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,160
My master.

110
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,720
It makes me sad. Guilty.

111
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,720
And...

112
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,600
You have the exact same face as her.

113
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,879
I don't care.

114
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,040
I can be her stand-in.

115
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,560
Her shadow. I'm willing.

116
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,000
I...

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,120

We can work together.

143

How can I trust you?

145
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,199
He's just

146
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,160
a stepping stone to me.

147
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,839

Be ready

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
to possess the Goddess.

152
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,879
Turn them against each other,

153
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,079
and take the spirit stone.

154
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,000
But I'm not strong enough on my own.

155
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,839
I might not be able to take them all on.

156
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,439
Fear not.

157
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,879
I'll give you the help you need.

Yu.

159
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:47,879
Yu.

160
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,360
Huai.

161
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,000
Why are you here?

162
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,000
It's bad luck to see the bride
before the wedding.

163
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,879
Go back.

164
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,240
Who cares about old customs?

165
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,279
I want to see you.

166
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,759
Keep being stubborn,

167
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,360
and I won't marry you anymore.

168
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,959
That won't do.

169
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,839
You still have to call me "husband."

170
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,800
Shameless.

171
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,439
I'm not even married to you yet,

172
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,120
and you want me to call you that?

173
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,040
Just say it. I want to hear it.

174
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,560
Just once.

175
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,879
Husband...

176
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,160
Too quiet. I didn't hear it.

177
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,360
Husband!

178
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,360
All right, all right!

179
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,399
Now go

180
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,639
before someone sees us!

181
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,759
Then...

182
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,879
Give me a kiss and I'll leave.

183
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,960
In your dreams!

184
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,519
Just one.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,679
Just one kiss.

186
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,519
Just one.

187
