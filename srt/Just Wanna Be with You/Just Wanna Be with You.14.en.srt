(Adapted From
Zhihu Novelist, Little Qi's)

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,260
("Three Marriages
to the Underworld Lord")

12
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,260
=Episode 14=

13
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:13,140
(Demon Clan)

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,599
As a custodian, you're in charge
of life and death in the three realms.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,879
That makes you a powerful figure.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,079
I've been waiting long for you.

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,879
Spare the formalities, My Lord.

18
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,680
Just get down to business.

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,400
I heard about you looking for someone.

20
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,480
She used to be your wife,
but she betrayed you.

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,359
Why go through all the trouble?

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,760
She will become a mortal
after her reincarnation.

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,080
And her fate is not to be known.

24
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,680
Here is a reminder for you.

25
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:00,359
There is a price to every favor.

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,720
Only if you can tell me
about Jiang Zhiyu's whereabouts.

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,400
Where do I get in return, then?

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,360
I can give you my heart.

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,840
Sure.

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,439
That mortal has been
around for twenty years.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Little did I expect

32
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,280
the new Demon Lord

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,879
to be lovesick.

34
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,960
Don't you regret it.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,639
My Lord.

36
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,840
A report from our mole.

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,639
Jiang Zhiyu's memories have been erased.

38
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,880
And she's had her reincarnation.

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,680
Jiang Jinghuai gave his heart away
in exchange of her whereabouts.

40
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm afraid he's going
to look for her in the mortal realm.

41
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,759
Fine.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,159
If we manage to remind Jiang Zhiyu
of her vengeance,

43
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,120
they will end up killing each other.

44
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,360
Yu.

45
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,560
Will you

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,639
marry me?

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,560
Yu.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,120
My love for you will last till death.

49
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
(You're nothing but my stand-in
in the mortal realm.)

50
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,479
(Though you look exactly like me,)

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,719
(you still don't deserve her.)

52
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:10,960
(Yu.)

53
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,080
(Don't you forget this.)

54
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,560
(No matter where you are,)

55
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,560
(you and I will be together forever.)

56
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,600
Here comes the auspicious hour.

57
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,480
Who am I?

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,959
You're my husband, Jiu.

59
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,839
(Yu.)

60
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,680
(Let us forget about all the hatred)

61
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,639
(as well as worries.)

62
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,959
(It's also nice)

63
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,279
(to be an ordinary married couple
in this mortal realm.)

64
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,279
You're hurting me, my dear.

65
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,279
Don't touch it.

66
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,079
(He is not your husband.)

67
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,279
(He is a fake.)

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,800
(He is not your husband.)

69
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,439
(He is not your husband.)

70
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,319
(He is not your husband.)

71
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,800
(He is a fake.)

72
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,519
(He is not your husband.)

73
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,839
(He is a fake.)

74
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,439
(He is not your husband.)

75
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,759
(He is not your husband.)

76
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,839
(He is not your husband.)

77
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,360
We don't know one another.

78
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,480
Why are you in my dream

79
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,240
to tell me my husband is a fake?

80
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,879
Who exactly are you?

81
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,959
That evil killed your husband

82
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,560
and took his place by wearing his skin.

83
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,040
Your husband howled
in the woods every night

84
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,480
and begged me to save him.

85
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,879
Little did I expect you

86
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,720
to be so idiotic.

87
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,800
Jiu has always been kind and innocent.

88
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,720
And what's with this evil being

89
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,199
who's going to marry you?

90
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,560
Jiu.

91
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,720
Where did you get that?

92
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,199
I got this at the temple.

93
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,839
It's said to be able

94
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,480
to get rid of evil beings
in a household.

95
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:40,920
Throw it away.

96
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,040
Why?

97
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,120
I said, throw it away!

98
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,839
No more items from the temple
in this household again.

99
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,199
Don't forget

100
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,839
about our wedding tomorrow.

101
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,519
Jiu.

102
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,199
Tomorrow
is the Day of the Seven Killings.

103
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,279
They say we should avoid
getting married on that day.

104
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,800
So, can we...

105
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,639
Like I said, I will make you my wife

106
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,399
tomorrow.

107
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,960
If he's not my husband,

108
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,440
who is he, then?

109
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,320
That is a skin-wearer.

110
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,879
I bet you've seen that scar

111
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,759
on his chest.

112
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,960
That's the seam where the human skin
was stitched together.

113
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,039
Don't touch it.

114
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,559
If you don't believe me...

115
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,879
Just stab his chest

116
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,279
with that hairpin on your head.

117
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,879
And your husband will come back to life.

118
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,720
I dare not do so.

119
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,840
I'm sure I'll miss it.

120
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,519
