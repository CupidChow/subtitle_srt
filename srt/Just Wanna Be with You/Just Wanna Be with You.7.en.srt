=Episode 7=

13
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,000
My dear.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,439
I told you, in life or death,
you belong to me.

15
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,799
Now, seeing you like this,

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
it truly breaks my heart.

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,239
You can drop the act.

18
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,799
You kept me here

19
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,719
only because you want
the Lingxiao clan's spirit stone.

20
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,079
Why go so far just to humiliate me?

21
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,959
Good. As long as you know.

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,319
That foxfolk has already
sunk beneath the Ice Lake.

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,879
His soul has long been destroyed.

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,200
You're so vicious.

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,280
You don't deserve
to be called an immortal.

26
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,439
I told you.

27
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,799
In life, you're mine.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,959
And in death,
your soul still belongs to me.

29
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,680
Stop thinking about that foxfolk slave.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,359
His name is Jiang Jinghuai.

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,599
You're not even worth
a single finger of his...

32
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,639
If he hadn't stirred up trouble,

33
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,439
you and I would already
be husband and wife!

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,680
Even if you have my body,

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,039
you will never have my heart.

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,199
Let's see how long
you can keep talking tough.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,039
To marry me,

38
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,400
to become the mistress of Cangyun,

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,520
to be worshipped by foxfolk
and Cangyun alike,

40
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,560
that is the greatest honor
you could ever receive.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,719
Honor?

42
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,800
All of this is nothing
but disgrace to the Lingxiao clan.

43
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,840
Disgrace?

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
Then let me show you

45
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,400
what true pain of severed love
and broken bonds feels like.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What are you doing?

47
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,840
From this moment on,

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,280
forget Jiang Jinghuai.

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
Your heart must belong only to me!

50
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,039
No... No!

51
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,599
Jiang Zhiyu!

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,719
Don't!

53
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Don't!

54
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,080
I, Jiang Jinghuai, swear this.

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,960
With the Silver Snow Flower as witness,

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,560
in every life I live,

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,879
I will love only Jiang Zhiyu.

58
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,240
(I will marry you.)

59
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,879
(Will you?)

60
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,520
No!

61
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,280
(I do.)

62
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,240
No!

63
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,720
(In this life, flowers in our hair.
In the next, beauty again.)

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,840
(This is the vow of our foxfolk.)

65
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:50,840
(Jiang Zhiyu,)

66
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,120
(I like you.)

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,560
I don't want to forget you.

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,639
Huai, I don't want to forget you!

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,879
I love him.

70
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,479
I love him.

71
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,960
I want to marry him.

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,879
(Last night's starlight,
last night's breeze...)

73
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,520
(- Beneath the laurel hall, by the western tower...)
(- Yu.)

74
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,360
(I wish to follow you
through endless lifetimes)

75
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,200
(and stay with you in the mortal world.)

76
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,439
No...

77
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,360
Forget it!

78
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,360
(Let me give you a name.)

79
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,879
(Jiang Jinghuai.)

80
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,959
Jiang Zhiyu.

81
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,399
(Jiang Jinghuai.)

82
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,000
(I have a new name now.)

83
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,160
(I'm really happy.)

84
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,800
Jiang Jinghuai!

85
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,040
Don't!

86
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,199
Husband.

87
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:12,959
My dear.

88
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,759
Let's pick a day for our wedding.

89
00:05:21,898 --> 00:05:24,260
(Cangyun.)

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,639
Sister.

91
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,160
It's all my fault.

93
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,560
I shouldn't have led you out.

94
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,839
Your immortal soul has been extracted.

95
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,199
You're in grave danger.

96
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,759
You should worry
more about your own safety.

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,560
Sister.

98
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,439
You must hate me now.

99
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,360
Right?

100
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,920
The Goddess would never hate you.

101
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,319
You worked so hard for her.

102
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,160
But Nangong Xiao used you.

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,959
This is not your fault.

104
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
You don't deserve any of this.

105
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,759
My sister has yet to reach the realm
needed to activate the spirit stone.

106
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,400
The spirit stone remains dormant.

107
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,600
She has endured Nangong Xiao's cruelty
all the time

108
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,399
just to...

109
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,240
Just to protect the people
of the three realms.

110
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,759
You have your own life.

111
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,480
You should live it for yourself.

112
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,199
Thank you.

113
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,839
Yan Luo.

114
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,680
Jiang Zhiyu's thread of love
has been removed.

115
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,200
She only recognizes me
as her husband now.

116
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,160
The foxfolk slave
has sunk beneath the Ice Lake.

117
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,480
The Goddess has severed all love.

118
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,439
They can never be together again.

119
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,040
Wise decision, My Lord.

120
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,560
The Heavenly Emperor
has agreed to our wedding.

121
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,279
Who says one can't have both
the spirit stone and the three realms?

122
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,959
I, Nangong Xiao, will have it all.

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,720
Ying.

124
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,720
Sister.

125
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,839
Are you okay?

126
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,480
I...

127
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm fine.

128
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,720
But Ying...

129
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,839
I can't shake the feeling

130
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,120
that I've forgotten something important.

131
