(Adapted From
Zhihu Novelist, Little Qi's)

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,260
("Three Marriages
to the Underworld Lord")

12
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,260
=Episode 19=

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,959
Why this sudden great surge?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's a celestial anomaly.

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,120
Looks like the three spirit stones
have been refined.

16
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,719
We're still too late.

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,439
It's fine, Huai.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,680
A secret from the Lingxiao clan says

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,600
that there's a fourth spirit stone
in this world.

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,959
It can absorb the power
of the other three.

21
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,319
So we just need
to locate the fourth one.

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,439
Nangong Xiao
has already absorbed the stones' power.

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,240
He and Aohen have joined hands
to attack.

24
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,920
We must come up
with a counter plan soon.

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,120
Ying?

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Ying.

27
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,519
You're still alive!

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,719
I'm not Luo Ying.

29
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,879
I am the War God Qing Wei.

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
(No wonder I couldn't find
Luo Ying's soul remnant.)

31
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,719
Luo Ying was transformed
from my master's celestial root.

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
My master

33
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,199
possesses all of Luo Ying's memories.

34
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,159
In this world, tragic fates

35
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,199
are always born of deep affection.

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,159
However, it's alright.

37
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,840
As long as you're alive.

38
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,439
I know what you want to say.

39
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,400
No matter what,

40
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,879
you and I will always be sisters.

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,560
The War God has returned.

42
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,680
If the four of us join hands,

43
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,759
we can surely defeat Aohen.

44
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,159
Though I've awakened,

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
my divine power hasn't recovered yet.

46
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,159
I may not be able to fight him.

47
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,039
It's alright.

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,280
I could sense the presence
of the three stones.

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,880
I believe I can sense the fourth one too

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,479
if I try harder.

51
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,759
This time,

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,879
let's protect the world together.

53
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,639
If you have something to say,
just say it.

54
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,240
Will it be dangerous

55
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,120
for Yu to search for the spirit stone?

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,280
If she can sense it,

57
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,159
it means the stone has chosen her.

58
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,280
To defeat Aohen,

59
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,039
she must live or die with the stone.

60
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,599
What if we stop her from finding it?

61
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:08,960
The Goddess herself

62
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,280
is as powerful
as the fourth spirit stone.

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,560
Only if Yu sacrifices herself

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,520
will all the spirit stones be destroyed

65
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,160
and Aohen's power vanish with them.

66
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,680
You're telling her to die.

67
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,399
I don't want that either.

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,439
But this is a dead end.

69
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,120
If the fourth spirit stone
already has a master,

70
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,279
then this master

71
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,560
is willing to perish with Aohen too.

72
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,720
Does that mean Yu will be safe?

73
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,319
That's right.

74
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
But it's said

75
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,040
that the custodian
controls the fourth stone.

76
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
That man is extremely...

77
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,519
It's me.

78
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:52,920
Back then,

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,439
to find Yu's whereabouts,

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
I made a deal with the the custodian.

81
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,319
You can't live without a heart.

82
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
I'll grant you this stone

83
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,759
to take its place.

84
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,120
Just like that,

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,439
I obtained the fourth spirit stone.

86
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,959
It fused with me

87
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,520
and recognised me as its master.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,959
Since that's the case,

89
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
if I end up getting killed
to destroy Aohen,

90
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,079
then so be it.

91
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,200
You're going to sacrifice yourself

92
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,439
to protect the world?

93
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,839
I live only for Jiang Zhiyu.

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,519
Please keep this secret for me.

95
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Don't let her sense it.

96
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,000
But after all your ups and downs,

97
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,800
you only just reunited.

98
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,319
Thus,

99
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,120
before I go,

100
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,199
I want to spend time with her.

101
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:01,800
Yu.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,160
Don't force yourself anymore.

103
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,879
Huai.

104
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,839
I still can't sense
the fourth spirit stone.

105
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,199
Could it be it's a dead end?

106
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,040
Don't worry.

107
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,480
We're not completely out of options yet.

108
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,960
We still have time to figure things out.

109
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,920
I still can't put my mind at ease.

110
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,519
Aohen will come soon.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,560
Where's Qing Wei? Where is she?

112
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,360
I'll go ask her

113
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,840
if there's a way to awaken the stone.

114
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,759
I already asked her about that.

115
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,519
She said

116
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,319
whether the spirit stone responds
depends on fate.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,800
She also said that,

118
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,439
if the four of us join hands,

119
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,079
we can still stand against Aohen

120
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,319
even if we can't destroy him.

121
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,560
But what I desire
is lasting peace and harmony.

122
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,240
I want everyone to be safe.

123
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,680
Then do you know

124
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
what I want?

125
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,639
To rule all three realms?

126
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,120
In your eyes,

127
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,279
am I a tyrannical Demon Lord?

128
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,519
Well, you are the Demon Lord after all.

129
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,839
But in my view,

130
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,079
even if you did rule the three realms,

131
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,680
you wouldn't hurt anyone.

132
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,720
That's more like it.

133
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,600
However,

134
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,120
you guessed wrong.

135
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,079
What I want

136
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,160
is for you to smile every day.

137
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,399
I want you to be happy every single day

138
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,039
and live a joyful life in this world.

139
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,840
Me too.

140
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,360
Then let's do that together.

141
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,000
You're so clingy.

142
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,320
What if one day

143
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,440
I'm really gone?

144
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,600
Will you cry your heart out

145
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,200
and try to die with me?

146
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,039
In your dreams.

147
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,279
I'll live an even better life.

148
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,200
You can just wait for me
by the River of Oblivion

149
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,879
for a hundred or a thousand years.

150
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,679
Then it's a deal.

151
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,320
No backing out.

152
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,600
Of course.

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,559
Pinky promise.

154
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,559
Pinky promise.

155
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,000
Well...

156
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,919
What's wrong?

157
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,240
Nothing.

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,480
I'm fine.

159
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,440
I just want

160
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,240
to always stay by your side.

161
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,240
Really?

162
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,799
