13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,120
The Goddess is sure
to leave through here.

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,159
Search thoroughly.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,640
Yes.

16
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,000
Nangong Xiao won't let us go.

17
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,480
Did you forget?

18
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,120
I know the concealment technique.

19
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't worry. They can't see us.

20
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Are you scared?

21
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,719
No.

22
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,840
As long as I'm with you,

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,560
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,680
It's a Immortal-Seeking Lamp.

25
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,319
You two search over there.

26
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:06,879
Yes.

27
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,159
The Sovereign already knows.

28
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,919
Why haven't you fled yet?

29
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,560
Take care.

30
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,159
Where are they?

31
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,080
Nowhere to be found.

32
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,280
Don't let me catch
any of your foxfolk tricks.

33
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,360
Keep searching.

34
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,000
If they enter the forbidden ground,

35
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,439
there'll be no way out but death.

36
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,000
Hurry.

37
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,759
This is Cangyun's forbidden ground.

38
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,040
It's my first time here too.

39
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,120
Let's hide here for now.

40
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,560
They won't dare come in.

41
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,680
Why wouldn't they dare?

42
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,080
The cold air here
devours spiritual energy,

43
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
stealing soul and spirit.

44
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,240
If they force their way in,

45
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
their cultivation will suffer.

46
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,839
They'll be gravely weakened.

47
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,839
Huai.

48
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:09,959
Huai.

49
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:10,959
Huai.

50
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:11,720
Huai!

51
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,240
Those two really aren't afraid of death.

52
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
They actually ran
into the forbidden ground.

53
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,600
That place is a land of eternal frost.

54
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,639
One misstep and their soul will be lost.

55
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
The Goddess
has the spirit stone to protect her.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,839
She may not fear it at all.

57
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,600
I may have a plan

58
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,560
to draw the Goddess out.

59
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,240
Have you ever seen the Goddess
entangled with that foxfolk slave?

60
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,800
Never.

61
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,959
You're still my junior sister.

62
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,720
Master told me

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
to look after you well.

64
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,800
So you still remembers Master.

65
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,439
If Master could see you now,

66
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,240
a willing accomplice to evil...

67
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,839
I wonder if he could rest in peace.

68
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
How dare you show
such disrespect to the Sovereign.

69
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,360
I wouldn't dare.

70
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,759
You've been clever
since you were a child.

71
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,399
Now's your chance to contribute.

72
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
The Goddess of Cangyun
should be enjoying honor and splendor.

73
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,600
Yet she was lured away
by that foxfolk's sweet words.

74
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,680
Now there's tension
between her and the Sovereign.

75
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
She's fallen to the forbidden ground,

76
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,319
and her fate hangs by a thread.

77
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,040
What do you want me to do?

78
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,120
I need your golden butterfly.

79
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,439
My powers are too weak.

80
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,399
I fear I'm of no help to you.

81
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,480
But the golden butterfly within your soul
can pass through the forbidden forest.

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,040
It's time you repaid your sister.

83
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,480
Go on.

84
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,959
Huai.

85
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,560
