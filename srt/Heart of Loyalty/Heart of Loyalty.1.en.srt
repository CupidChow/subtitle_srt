Why didn't they close the door?

Say, why did you fall asleep there?

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,550
Come on, you should sleep in bed.

According to the old-timer from the relay station, the victim is a Gusu weaver who came to the capital to stand trial, Bai Baozhen.

38
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,050
He came to Kaifeng alone and didn't bring any attendants.

00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,480
Eldest Brother Zhan, he was poisoned with Five Poison Powder and bled to death through all seven apertures. <br><i>(T/N: 2 eyes, 2 ears, 2 nostrils, 1 mouth) </i>

Is everything you said true?

Yes. Everything I've said is true. I haven't told a single lie.

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,890
All right.

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,460
- Lord Zhan. <br>- Lord Zhan.

45
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,490
The victim is Bai Baozhen, a third-ranking official.

46
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,830
He was murdered here in Kaifeng. This matter...

I understand.

48

Any other findings?

49
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,470

Eldest Brother Zhan, this is evidence though.

What obvious disrespect to our Kaifeng Government Office.

85
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,430
Indeed. This...

86
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,960
Waiter, Li Xu had sat here before, yes?

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,760
Right. How did you know, Miss?

88
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,800
A fight broke out here, right?

89
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,330
That's right as well.

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,530
Some men from Three Yuan Gambling Tavern said they were looking for Li Xu.

Three Yuan Gambling Tavern?

93

Fifth Brother went gambling again?

94
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,800
Where is he now?

95
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,330
This... I don't know.

96
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,330
They chased us all out of the restaurant.

97
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,200
When I came back in again, those big men were lying on the ground.

98
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,530
Li Xu was already gone.

99
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,060
No wonder he's part of the Six Evils of Shuzhong.

100
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,730
He must be highly skilled in martial arts.

<i>(Li Xu)</i>

102

<i>Even ten men couldn't defeat him.</i>

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,010
He can take 100 men on his own. These ten men were already—

104
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,950
All right, okay. That's enough.

105
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,800
This Li Xu isn't as impressive as you said.

106
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,970
<i>At the time, Li Xu was sitting here. There are sword slashes on the table.</i>

107
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,110
<i>That means a fight occurred here.</i>

108
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,050
<i>But with Li Xu's skills, how could he have defated them and escaped so easily?</i>

109
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,550
<i>Chili powder?</i>

110
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,920
<i>I got it!</i>

111
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,330
Miss, are you all right?

112
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,940
I'm fine.

113
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,540
Li Xu is only good at running away.

114
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,720
He's not very good at fighting.

115
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,610
<i>If Li Xu wanted to escape,</i>

116
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,700
<i>the fastest route would be through the main hall or through the windows.</i>

117
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,050
<i>Why are there signs of fighting in the main hall of this inn as well?</i>

118
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,510
<i>Unless someone threw the chopstick holder from here.</i>

119
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,720
<i>This person's skills must be on par with Second Brother's.</i>

120
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,540
<i>Hey! Help me!</i>

121
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,380
<i>Who are you? Let go!</i>

122
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,090
<i>You're Li Xu? Come with me.</i>

123

This... Where did this key come from?

124
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,390
Who's the most skilled in martial arts from your Kaifeng Government Office?

125
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,680
The Royal Cat, Zhan Zhao.

126
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,640
Royal Cat, Zhan Zhao?

127
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,600
<i>According to legend, the Royal Cat, Zhan Zhao, is an excellent swordsman with the heart of a hero.</i>

128
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,160
<i>Ever since he joined the Kaifeng Government Office, he's caught countless criminals mercilessly.</i>

129
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,820
<i>I want to see for myself if you're as impressive as legend dictates.</i>

130
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,790
<i> (Kaifeng Government Office) </i>

131
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,560

- Lord Zhan, thank you and Lord Bao for upholding justice for us.<br> - Lord Zhan.

135
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,080
Don't mention it.

136
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,460
Lord Zhan.

137
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,570
Easy there!

138
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,320
Lord Zhan, I've been held here in Kaifeng for three days,

139
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,050
shouldn't you take me home?

140
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,490
Move.

141
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,450
Lord Bao.

142
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,440
A letter has come from the Ministry of Justice, telling us to hand over Bai Baozhen's murder case.

143
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,110
The Ministry of Justice wants to take over the case? <br> <i>(Bao Zheng) <br> (Gongsun Ce)</i>

144
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,740
Certainly not, we cannot let them get involved in this case.

145
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,600
I secretly moved Bai Baozhen to the capital just to

146
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,550
be able to thoroughly investigate the Jiangnan corruption case.

147
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,840
Unexpectedly he was found dead at the relay station.

148
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,520
This case, I cannot let them have.

149
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,240
- My Lord, how is Li Xu's interrogation going? <br>- He's not saying anything.

150
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,520
When you captured him, did anyone see you?

151
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,920
Please rest assured, when I captured him I had my face covered.

152
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,990
We can't conceal the fact that we captured Li Xu for long.

153
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,770
You must still be wary of the shadows. Li Xu is our only lead.

154
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,670
We must find a way to make a breakthrough with him.

155
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,540
Lord Bao, I'd like to take men to search Jinfeng Inn again to look for any missed evidence.

156
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,480
As for the wedding banquet, I'm afraid I won't be able to go.

157
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,850
The wedding banquet? If you hadn't said anything I would've forgotten it.

158
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,040
Lord Bao, our warehouse only has these four jars of wine left.

159
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,560
Should we send them to Deputy Minister Liu?

160
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,170
Since when does the Kaifeng Government Office have any good wine, take them back.

161
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,420
The only thing that we can offer is Mr. Gongsun's beautiful calligraphy.

162
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,110
Lord Bao.

163
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,100
Lord Bao, we've already mounted Mr Gongsun's calligraphy.

164
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,750
I will be back soon.

165
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,600
Guard Zhan, continue interrogating Li Xu this afternoon.

166
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,910
- Yes. <br> - Sister Ma,

167
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,400
leave a few flatbreads for me, I'll eat them later when I return.

168
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,690
No problem, Lord Bao.

169
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,640
What are you standing around for? Take it away.

170
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,140
Dear, I'm going.

171
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,480
Wait, aren't you going to the wedding banquet?

172
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,970
What are you doing eating my flatbreads?

173
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,520
How can theirs be better than those my wife makes?

174
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,160
Besides I might not even be able to go inside, I'm afraid I might go hungry.

175
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,820
I'm off.

176
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,080
Eat them then, I didn't wash my hands when I made them.

177
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,780
Lord Zhan, you're in luck today.

178
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,390
I know you don't like eating meat, so I specially made you some vegetable flatbread.

179
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,690
- Sister Ma. <br>- Lord Zhang.

180
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,010
You... didn't really not wash your hands did you?

181
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,440
Call me Qin Wei Wei.

182
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,090
Qin Wei Wei.

183
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,530
Deputy Minister Liu's daughter has been admiring you for so many years, now that she's getting married

184
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,480
she clearly wants to see you one last time, are you are really this cold-hearted?

185
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,750
I've never been interested in love, I won't go and add any troubles.

186
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,800
The Royal Cat is also a person, how could you not be moved at all?

187
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,090
As the Royal Cat, it's natural that I must cast romantic relationships aside.

188
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,380
Your Brother Ma Han also used to say that.

189
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,880
Ma Han? And then?

190
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,180
And then? Well he met me didn't he?

191
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,960
They must be delivering the vegetables, why are they here this late?

192
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,170
Madam, you carry on, I'll go.

193
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,660
Okay.

194
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,980
I'm delivering vegetables.

195
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,580
Come on in.

196
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,870
<i>I have to hurry and get Li Xu out.</i>

197
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,040
This isn't the kitchen.

198
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,820
You also aren't here to deliver vegetables.

199
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,950
The Royal Cat Zhan Zhao really does live up to his name.

200
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,060
Who are you? What are you doing here?

201
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,160
If you guess right I'll tell you.

202
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,880
Then please excuse me.

203
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,630
Tell me the truth.

204
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,020
They all say Zhan Zhao is chivalrous and benevolent.

205
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,500
But today after seeing you, this is what you're really like, so heartless.

206
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,360
What do you mean by that Miss?

207
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,910
Deputy Minister Liu's daughter has admired the Royal Cat for so many years.

208
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,330
Everyone in Kaifeng knows.

209
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,140
Now you're letting her marry someone else.

210
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,650
If you're not heartless then who is?

211
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,380
All these years I've always treated her with courtesy.

212
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,360
I have never done anything inappropriate, I have a clear conscience.

213
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,520
I'm just here to speak out against you on her behalf.

214
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,130
But since you've already said so much, then I'll just get going.

215
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,750
Let go.

216
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,730
If you're planning to break into prison, by the laws of Great Song the punishment is death.

217
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,860
You- You're hurting me, let go.

218
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,330
Let go of me! You foul cat!

219
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,220
You have undermined public order with the intention of breaking into prison.

220
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,170
The Kaifeng Government Office will set a date to hold a trial.

221
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,530
I want to see Lord Bao.

222
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,880
You'll naturally end up seeing him.

223
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,960
I am here to seek justice for my fifth brother Li Xu.

224
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,370
<i> (Just and Honorable)</i>

225
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,350
Hey, untie me.

226
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,360
Quickly.

227
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:15,990
<i> (Just and Honourable)</i>

228
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,040
Who is this?

229
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,790
I'm the famous Seventh Evil of Shuzhong!

230
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,170
The Divine Dog, Mo Yan.

231
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,510
A deadly physician steps onto the grounds of the imperial tomb.

232
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,770
Flying flowers in the clouds deceives the lord of the underworld.

233
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,640
I've heard of the name, the Six Evils of Shuzhong.

234
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,100
But I've not heard of a Seventh Evil before.

235
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,400
Also this name compared to the other six doesn't seem as pleasing to the ear.

236
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,080
It sounds more like it was made up randomly.

237
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,040
That's because of your lack of knowledge!

238
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,810
You go and ask around.

239
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,310
I'm quite famous in Shuzhong.

240
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,890
Let's get back to the point.

241
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,690
Hurry up and release my brother. He didn't kill Bai Baozhen.

242
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,580
What proof do you have?

243
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,720
Just bring my brother here and let us talk.

244
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,590
And then you'll know.

245
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,580
Bring in Li Xu.

246
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,920
Move.

247
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,880
Brother. Brother.

248
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,350
Brother. Don't be so rough!

249
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,590
Brother, did they hit you?

250
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,720
Let me have a look.

251
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,790
What are you doing?! Who are you?

252
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,350
How can you not recognize me?!

253
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,070
It's only been a few days. What's happened to you?

254
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,120
Get your hands off me. My Lord, who is this?

255
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,480
You dare say you don't recognize me?

256
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,110
Fine, I know you have a mole on your hand.

257
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,810
- Stop messing around! <br> - Quickly, show them the mole on your hand!

258
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,650
Men and women shouldn't touch each other!

259
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,750
Quickly, take it out and show them.

260
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,600
Little Seven, stop messing around!

261
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,790
What did you just call me? Little Seven.

262
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,490
You let it slip.

263
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,660
Silence. At court,

264
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,780
you shouldn't fool around.

265
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,000
Miss Mo Yan, what evidence do you have to appeal for justice for Li Xu?

266
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,340
I can prove it!

267
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,820
Little Seven, don't...

268
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,540
The evidence are the words carved on Bai Baozhen's desk.

269
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,650
I want to ask all of you. If the true culprit had killed someone,

270
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,980
would he brazenly say that he was the killer?

271
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,010
And would he even carve words on the desk and wait to be arrested?

272
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,620
If he really wanted to die, he could just go hang himself.

273
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,660
Why take so much trouble?

274
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,240
My Lord, I did find evidence that Li Xu was at the relay station.

275
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,940
It proves that Li Xu had entered Bao Baozhen's room before.

276
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,840
Also, among Li Xu's stolen goods, we discovered Bao Baizhen's possessions.

277
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,890
You really want to convict my brother of the crime that badly? Has he offended you?

278
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,590
I'm stating the facts.

279
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,260
Alright. Let me ask you then.

280
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,380
What if someone deliberately carved the words

281
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,870
to frame my older brother? You've been to the crime scene.

282
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,280
Tell us, how was the handwriting?

283
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,620
Natural like floating clouds and flowing water, vigorous and powerful.

284
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,200
The one who carved the words knows martial arts, but Bai Baozhen doesn't.

285
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,850
That must've been left by the true culprit then.

286
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,190
This is only your speculation.

287
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,740
But it's still possible. Who would frame a simple thief?

288
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,770
Seventh Sister, can you quit adding more trouble?

289
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,890
Hurry and go home, will you?

290
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,580
Then it means the thief stole the objects that he originally wanted to get from Bao Baozhen?

291
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,500
Even though Li Xu is the only suspect in this case,

292
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,130
it doesn't rule out Miss Mo's reasoning either.

293
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,640
According to Miss Mo's calculations,

294
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,500
the evidence should still be inside the Jinfeng Inn.

295
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,420
Lord Bao really is amazing.

296
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,860
However, regular people can't find the items hidden by my older brother.

297
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,580
It would seem that Miss Mo knows where those items are hidden.

298
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:20,090
<i>The bottom shelf of wine in the inn's wine storage must be the sealed 100-year-old fine wine.</i>

299
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,820
<i>If it isn't time yet, it definitely wouldn't be opened.</i>

300
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,300
<i>But, among these wine jugs, one of them has been opened.</i>

301
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,490
<i>I wasn't sure at first.</i>

302
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,880
<i>But when I saw my older brother's cherished crow above the inn,</i>

303
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,220
<i>I realized, not only did this crow not enter the prison with my brother,</i>

304
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,620
<i>but was actually lingering above the inn and not leaving.</i>

305
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,230
<i>It means that there was something very important inside the inn.</i>

306
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,150
The ledger is right here.

307
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,910
Bring it up here.

308
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,260
You can't accomplish anything, but liable to spoil everything.

309
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,360
You're good for nothing.

310
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,100
Take a good look. It's very important.

311
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,400
How about it? I've given you the important evidence.

312
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,940
I've said what I wanted to say. Can you release my older brother now?

313
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,400
Ridiculous!

314
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,790
This case hasn't been concluded. Li Xu is still involved. How can he be so easily released?

315
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,140
That's your problem.

316
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,870
Older Brother, hurry up and say something.

317
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,990
- Just admit that you went inside to steal, but you didn't kill anyone. Then we can leave. <br> - Adding trouble!

318
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,000
What did I do?

319
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,670
How dare you, Li Xu! Who ordered you to steal the ledger?

320
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,540
Ledger? No, My Lord, I really don't know anything.

321
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,680
Do you know that the ledger you stole is related to a corruption case?

322
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,940
It concerns people's livelihoods in the Jiangnan area. Even if you didn't kill anyone,

323
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,890
but this action is still a high crime.

324
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:03,530
That lord with the dark face, how can you randomly condemn my older brother?!

325
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,680
Send the evidence to the archive.

326
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,270
Escort Li Xu back to prison.

327
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,180
Court is dismissed.

328
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,250
I... I...

329
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,810
You're good for nothing!

330
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,210
- Go. <br> - No, I found that ledger!

331
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,900
It's mine. You have to return it to me!

332
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,550
You're obviously taking it by force!

333
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,720
Where are you taking it?

334
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,560
Older Brother!

335
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,280
- You're too much! <br> - Miss.

336
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,190
You can leave now.

337
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,480
I'm not leaving!

338
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,620
You can leave now.

339
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,110
What make you think you can kick me out?

340
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,680
Let the Kaifeng Government Office investigate the case.

341
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,190
Miss Mo, it's better you stop interfering.

342
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,740
Then give me back my stuff first.

343
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,520
The ledger is important evidence. Excuse us for not returning it.

344
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,060
But I found it first. Can't I take a look?

345
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,940
According to Great Song's law, that's not allowed.

346
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,750
I want to look at it right now.

347
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,300
You tell me. How can I get a look at it?

348
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,360
Only constables of the Kaifeng Government Office have the right to view it.

349
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,660
Constable?

350
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,530
Alright, alright.

351
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,800
I'll suffer a little. I'll join the Kaifeng Government Office right now.

352
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,450
Now can I see it? Hurry and go get it, go get it.

353
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,590
The Kaifeng Government Office doesn't accept any random people.

354
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,020
You really are a stinky, stupid cat! You're doing this on purpose, aren't you? You make me so angry!

355
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,840
You're so inflexible!

356
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,380
Can't do this, can't do that! Let me tell you,

357
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,500
I don't care!

358
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,260
Open the door! Let's talk a little more!

359
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,560
My Lord, look here.

360
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,050
And there.

361
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,480
Also here.

362
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,640
I had already guessed it.

363
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,320
This ledger is a fake.

364
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,000
It seems that Bai Baozhen, in order to deal with the Kaifeng Government Office,

365
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,830
specially found someone to forge it.

366
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,760
But Li Xu was ordered to take the effort to find the ledger.

367
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,150
It means that the person behind him doesn't know about the authenticity of the ledger.

368
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,080
Then My Lord, who do you think is ordering Li Xu behind the scenes?

369
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,270
There's no trace to follow when freelancers are hired,

370
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,560
unless we lure him out to show himself.

371
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,030
My lord, what do you mean?

372
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:43,120
Send out the word. Set up a trap in the Kaifeng Government Office.

373
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,680
I want to lead him into the urn. <br><i> (T/N: Lure him into the trap)</i>

374
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,040
<i>(Kaifeng Government Office)</i>

375
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,280
You again.

376
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,920
If you want the ledger,

377
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,960
come over here if you can.

378
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,070
To catch me? Wait til your next life.

379
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,620
What are you doing?!

380
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,600
Excuse me for the offense.

381
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,680
I didn't expect the Royal Cat to be so despicable!

382
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,380
Give me the ledger.

383
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,040
No.

384
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,460
Give me the ledger.

385
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,430
Don't come over. If you come closer, I'll...

386
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,230
Give me the ledger.

387
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:33,250
If you come closer again, I will...

388
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,610
take it off!

389
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,210
Miss, please respect yourself.

390
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,840
<i>(Favorable Weather)</i>

391
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,740
Placing this ledger in the Kaifeng Government Office is a trap. Only an idiot would go for it.

392
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,070
I helped you to take it out so that the real culprit would appear.

393
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,500
Lord Bao didn't want to risk his colleagues, that's why he set up the plan in the Kaifeng Government Office.

394
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,190
Please give me the ledger.

395
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,430
Too late. The culprit is already here.

396
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,200
Who are you?! Why did you frame my fifth brother?

397
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,700
<i>If I catch you, then my brother will be released.</i>

398
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Stop there!

399
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,700
Stop there!

400
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,400
Don't worry about, go after him!

401
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,600
<i>(Kaifeng Government Office)</i>

402
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,800
Lord Bao.

403
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,600
How is Miss Mo?

404
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,600
She was treated in time, after removing the five poison powder from her injury

405
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,200
there isn't much danger left. But when I checked her pulse,

406
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,100
I discovered, aside form five poison powder, there are other poisons in her body.

407
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,800
She may be alright now, but we don't find an antidote for those poisons,

408
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,200
they may affect her in the future.

409
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,400
I was incompetent Lord Bao, I accept my punishment.

410
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,600
You had nothing to do with this. Don't blame yourself.

411
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,200
It was my fault. It was my duty to capture the criminal.

412
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,200
Officer Zhan, there's no wrong in saving someone.

413
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,800
The green-robed man will definitely know the ledger is a fake when he sees it.

414
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,000
Then he'll search for the whereabouts of the real ledger.

415
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,430
The ledger is fake?

416
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,070
Lord Bao,

417
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,200
I lured the true culprit out.

418
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,600
That means the Kaifeng Government Office owes me a favor, correct?

419
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,200
Kaifeng Government Office does owe you favor.

420
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,680
If that's the case,

421
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,800
then please let my fifth brother go free.

422
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,400
that's the only thing I can't allow.

423
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,600
Why not? You've already found the real culprit, haven't you?

424
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,600
We can't be sure that Li Xu isn't an accomplice of the culprit.

425
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,400
I told you to go after the culprit.

426
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,800
Why didn't you listen to me?

427
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,200
Bai Bao hasn't handed over the real ledger to anyone.

428
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,800
That means the ledger should still be...

429
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
In the Bai residence.

430
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,200
You are indeed exceptionally intelligent Miss Mo.

431
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,000
Lord Bao, since you think I'm intelligent,

432
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,760
then let me stay at the Kaifeng Government Office and help investigate this case.

433
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,600
Consider it a favor being returned.

434
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,900
No. Government matters aren't child's play.

435
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,800
What does this have to do with you?

436
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,800
I'm asking Lord Bao for a favor. What's wrong with that?

437
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,400
<i>Lord Bao!</i>

438
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,600
<i>My Lord.</i>

439
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Li Xu has confessed.

440
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,800
Brother. Brother!

441
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,200
<i>(Prisoner)</i>

442
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,700
Little Seven?

443
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,600
You—!

444
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,100
You didn't kill anyone why did you confess?

445
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,600
Why are you involving yourself in this mess? Hurry up and get out of here!

446
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,800
No. You'll be beheaded. Do you know that?!

447
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,600
Let me tell you, I can take care of my own matters.

448
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,300
The martial arts world is not as simple as it seems. You could die! Hurry and leave!

449
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,800
I'm not leaving.

450
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,000
I've seen you guys wander the martial arts world since I was young. It doesn't seem that hard.

451
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Are you stupid?

452
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,800
We were pretending!

453
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,300
Pretending?

454
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,200
That doesn't matter either!

455
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,600
Either way, I'm going to join the Kaifeng Government Office to investigate the case and get you out.

456
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,400
My Lord, Li Xu has been transferred to prison. He's being guarded and closely monitored.

457
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Please rest assured.

458
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,900
We've only just gotten a potential lead on the mastermind behind the case.

459
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,600
Yet, Li Xu confessed and closed the case.

460
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,700
But is this case that simple?

461
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,400
Guard Zhan, what do you think?

462
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,800
Continue to investigate.

463
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,400
We may need to return to the starting point of the case. We can't let any details escape us.

464
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,270
Speaking of the starting point,

465
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,500
I'd like to let Miss Mo give it a try.

466
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Lord Bao.

467
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,400
I think Miss Mo is just a woman from the martial arts world.

468
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Weren't you also a hero from the martial arts world when you were younger?

469
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,500
That is why I even more so understand the rules and discipline of government laws.

470
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,400
I've vowed to protect the Kaifeng Government Office and let go of my past.

471
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,700
But Miss Mo...

472
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,800
She's reckless and unpredictable. She'll end up harming herself.

473
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,200
Who will come save her then?

474
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,400
We've witnessed Miss Mo's perceptiveness and eye for detail.

475
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,000
Such an intelligent talent is rare and even harder to utilize.

476
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Guard Zhan.

477
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,600
It's up to you to decide how to use her, <br><i>(Kaifeng Government Office)</i>

478
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,600
What? You—!

479
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,200
Why did you sneak in here? Huh?

480
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,600
You want to join the government office?

481
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,200
You're the sister of the Six Evils of Shuzhong! How can you join the government office?

482
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,800
What are the rules of the mountain? Huh? Recite them for me right now!

483
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,400
Overcome evil. Act with one's ability. Stay away from the government.

484
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Did you hear yourself?

485
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,870
"Say away from the government! Say away from the government! Say away from the government!"

486
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,400
How can you work for the government?

487
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,560
I'm telling you. If Second Brother finds out about this,

488
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,000
I... I might not be able to save myself!

489
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,600
Old Five, if you weren't in prison, would I have come down the mountain?!

490
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,400
Would I have to work for the government?

491
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,600
If you force me, I'll tell Second Brother.

492
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
By then we both can die by his hand. Whose scared of whom?

493
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,000
You—!

494
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,800
I'm telling you, I don't have time to talk nonsense with you.

495
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,400
I don't need you in my business.

496
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,000
Hurry and go!

497
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm not leaving!

498
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I'm going to sleep!

499
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,800
Old Five!

500
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,200
You'll be beheaded if this goes on! Beheaded!

501
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,600
Wake up!

502
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,900
- I don't care! <br>- I'm going to go look for evidence right now to save you!

503
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,600
You just wait!

504
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,200
Little Seven! Get back here right now!

505
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,890
She's just causing trouble!

506
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Why are you here?

507
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,200
You weren't eavesdropping on my conversation with my brother, were you?

508
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,600
Your Fifth Brother... is very important to you, right?

509
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,000
That's none of your business.

510
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,600
Zhan.

511
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,400
I know you don't think much of me and I don't think highly of you either.

512
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,000
But for my brother's sake, I have to stay at the Kaifeng Government Office.

513
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,800
Are you going to agree to let me in or not?

514
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,600
If not, I'll go—<br><i>(Kaifeng Government Office)</i>

515
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,370
Rest up. Don't be late tomorrow.

516
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,800
Wait!

517
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,300
Thank you.

518
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,600
You'll have one month.

519
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,200
If you do well, you can stay. If you don't, pack your bags.

520
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:36,000
