<i>Li Xu has been arrested by the Kaifeng Government Manor.</i>

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,520
No matter what, we can't let Black Bao

28
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,360
find anything on him.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,620
And, Zhan Zhao, the Imperial Cat, is a genius in martial arts.

30
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,470
He's not easy to deal with. You must be careful.

31
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,600
Got it. I know what I need to do.

32
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,480
The autopsy we just performed was a carpenter. It was reported a sucide.

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,900
After examing the stomach, there was no proof of it. Something is off.

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,580
By the way, we just passed by Zhang Long and Ma Hu's rooms.

35
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,230
The two big rooms over there are Lord Gongdun and Lord Bao's.

36
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,920
This is Lord Zhan Zhao room.

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,900
Let me show you what's in the back.

38
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,070
All right.

39
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,340
This is the back courtyard. I heard that the previous landowner left it.

40
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,140
It was requisitioned by the government manor.

41
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,760
Those rowdy old men wouldn't have time to spend in the garden.

42
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,120
So it's been abandoned for many years.

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,490
Here we are.

44
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,380
This used to be where they put the records and files that no one uses.

45
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,560
This place is quite big. Gongsun Ce said the feng shui here isn't great.

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,600
No one has ever lived here.

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,670
What? You're not afraid, are you?

48
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,790
All right, I'll get you a broom in a bit.

49
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,170
I'll get you some sheets, blankets, tablecloths, plants, and anything else you may need. Make yourself at home.

50
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,490
I'm going to cook food so you are on your own.

51
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,540
Thank you, Madam Ma.

52
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,410
Call me Qin Weiwei.

53
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,100
Lunch is in the front courtyard after you settled in.

54
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,550
All this work is making me hungry.

55
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,900
- Did you organize the files yesterday? <br>- Yes, I did.

56
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,770
- Here. I've added more eggs. <br>- When did we have a female detective? <br>- Thank you, Madam Ma.

57
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,710
Madam, your soup buns

58
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,380
are getting better and better. Never had anything like that in the government manor.

59
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,230
It's fine if it's only delicious at Kaifeng Government Office.

60
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,850
You guys need to pitch in some money. I'll make some pork buns for you guys tonight.

61
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,400
Okay.

62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,620
Detective Mo, you're here.

63
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,960
- Are you done tidying up the room? <br>- All done.

64
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,870
Come. What would you like to have?

65
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,300
Sweet or savory?

66
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,070
Sweet, please.

67
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,080
Here.

68
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,430
What would you like here?

69
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,440
This one. This one will do.

70
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,310
There's something off with Bao Baizhen's case.

71
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,950
- We should go to the scene again. See if there are any other clues.<br><i>- That darn cat.</i>

72
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,160
- Okay. <br>- We must secure the crime scene.

73
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,240
Inform the relay station. No one is to enter Bao Baizhen's room.

74
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,730
All right. We'll head out after our meal.

75
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,870
We should investigate the crime scene again.

76
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,190
Yes. This case is really confusing.

77
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,320
Yes, it is.

78
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,620
A detective should act like a detective.

79
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,340
Come over here and eat.

80
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,940
We just started investigating the Bao Baizhen's case.

81
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,560
The Ministry of Justice took over. There's something suspicious happening.

82
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,910
We have our people guarding the crime scene.

83
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,070
It's impossible for anyone from the Ministry of Justice to enter for now.

84
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,590
I think something is trying to frame us.

85
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,980
I'll go to the crime scene too.

86
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,430
See if you can find any clues at the relay station.

87
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,930
Will do.

88
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,970
Miss, as your senior, I hope you take some advice.

89
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,130
The government is different from the martial arts world. There are rules to follow.

90
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,820
For example, what time you are on or off duty has already been determined.

91
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,830
If you're late, your pay will be cut.

92
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,990
There must be clues at the crime scene you haven't found.

93
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,690
Would you take me there, Lord Zhan?

94
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,740
Your job for today is to memorize the Official's Manual.

95
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,400
As for investigating the case, I'll arrange my staff to do so.

96
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,660
You mean, I can investigate after I memorize the manual, right?

97
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,220
Bring it.

98
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,760
It's quite complex. You need to read it seriously.

99
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,280
Or else you won't be able to memorize it.

100
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,750
Isn't it just some unnecessary and overelaborate formalities? Easy.

101
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,120
Since you've become a public official, you should conduct yourself to benefit the people.

102
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,400
This Magistrate's Rules is the foundation of building our characters.

103
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,120
You can patrol the streets only after you've memorized it.

104
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,550
Patrol the streets?

105
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,150
Stop right there!

106
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,040
What did you just say?

107
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,840
I came here to investigate for my fifth brother. What do you mean patrolling?

108
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,190
If I go patrolling, what about my fifth brother?

109
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,570
It's written clearly on the Magistrate's Rules that I just gave you.

110
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,950
New constables must patrol the streets for 3 months before they can investigate cases.

111
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,060
Three months? That's too long! I refuse.

112
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,880
If you don't follow the rules just so you can achieve your goal,

113
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,390
the evil in your heart will appear at any time.

114
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,200
This is the biggest difference between you and Kaifeng Government Office. If you can't stand it,

115
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,900
you can leave at any time.

116
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,240
Madam, I bought you another rouge.

117
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,340
This is good, and it costs a tael of silver.

118
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,210
Take a look. How is it? Do you like it?

119
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,080
It smells weird. I don't think it's worth a tael of silver.

120
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,020
- Nonsense! She's saying nonsense. <br> - I also think it smells weird.

121
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,300
I really spent a tael of silver! One tael of silver!

122
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,500
You were conned again!

123
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,930
Wait! Hey, Weiwei!

124
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,030
What are you guys laughing at? Eat!

125
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,700
This stinky cat. You want to trap me here in this Kaifeng Government Office?

126
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,820
In your dreams!

127
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,410
Having me sweep the floor and then having me copy the Magistrate's Rules.

128
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,470
I don't believe that in such a big Kaifeng Government Office, there aren't a few doors here.

129
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,960
Sure enough, it's as expected.

130
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,470
<i>You can sweep the floor whenever.</i>

131
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,600
<i>Why must you sweep the floor right when I plan on going out?</i>

132
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,770
<i>Can you hurry up a bit?</i>

133
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,860
<i>Why don't I help you?</i>

134
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,440
Li Xu's testimony right now is not enough to convict him.

135
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,120
Everyone should put in some more effort and interrogate him again.

136
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,760
- A new case was found when patrolling South Street. I'll go and take a look. <br> - Okay.

137
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,930
Hello, Minister Zhao.

138
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,700
What are you doing?

139
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,260
I was sweeping the floor and felt a bit tired so I looked for a place to take a rest.

140
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,340
If you're done resting, then continue sweeping.

141
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,070
Stop.

142
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,510
You're really something, Lord Zhan.

143
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,320
You only allow officials to set the fire, and not allow the common people to light the lamps. <br><i> (T/N: double standards)</i>

144
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,040
You also look so stern and impartial.

145
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,470
You used those requirements for others, right?

146
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,260
You neglected your duty.

147
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,120
We don't even know where you went.

148
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,460
Your shoes have mud.

149
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,600
You have a light fragrant smell.

150
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,310
You probably went to a place far away

151
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,700
to burn incense for the dead.

152
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,180
<i>(Riverside Village, Wang Xiaoliu)</i>

153
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,280
Have you memorized the magistrate's rules?

154
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,880
I remembered it long ago. Not a single word left out.

155
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,430
Alright. What is Subrule 5 of Rule 10?

156
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,960
One day of rest for every five days.

157
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,590
If patrolling during the midnight hours from 11 pm to 3 am, then one is given two hours of rest the next morning.

158
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,510
I was on duty yesterday.

159
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,560
Nonsense. The mud on your shoes is still wet.

160
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,060
There was only rain in the western part of the city yesterday.

161
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,540
You can't go from here to the west of the city within two hours.

162
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,810
I have great lightness skill.

163
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,640
You said you were sweeping the yard just then.

164
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,260
That's right. I kept sweeping.

165
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,590
What is this?

166
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,930
This is a petal. What's wrong?

167
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,940
These petals keep falling and I have to keep sweeping them.

168
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,430
Why not wait a few more days so I can sweep them all at once?

169
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,700
Moreover, you made me spend so much time sweep these petals.

170
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,430
Why not let me investigate?

171
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,440
You don't even the patience to sweep the petals and you want to investigate?

172
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,320
You are punished by copying the Magistrate's Rules ten times. You can't eat if you don't finish copying.

173
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,270
I'm not going to copy it.

174
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,580
- Are you going to copy it or not? <br> - No.

175
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,580
Okay. I'll watch you copy it.

176
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,770
Let go of me. Let go of me.

177
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,290
Is anyone seeing this?

178
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,550
<i>Imperial Guard Zhan Zhao is abusing punishments!</i>

179
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,780
Ten times. Copy it.

180
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,590
Hurry and copy it.

181
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,620
<i>(I want to investigate the case)</i>

182
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,320
Let me tell you. If you don't finish copying it, then you're not allowed to go anywhere

183
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,310
or eat.

184
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,800
<i>This stinky cat is stubborn.</i>

185
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,160
<i>I'll go along with his wishes and then make other plans.</i>

186
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,460
<i>Even though this silly cat is annoying sometimes,</i>

187
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,160
<i>but he conducts himself pretty fair and honest.</i>

188
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,990
Guard Zhan, Lord Bao is asking you to go to the great hall. Imperial Palace Guard Wu Sichu has arrived.

189
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,620
- I'll come immediately. <br>- Okay.

190
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,000
A reminder, dinner will be in an hour.

191
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,630
If you don't finish copying it, then you'll be starving tonight.

192
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,740
Wipe your saliva.

193
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,230
Jail transfer?

194
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,830
Yes. I came here on His Majesty's decree

195
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,070
to take Li Xu to be guarded by the Ministry of Justice.

196
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,460
Weird.

197
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,310
The Kaifeng Prefect Manor has not received any notice.

198
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,580
Besides, Li Xu is involved in the Bai Baozhen corruption case.

199
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,950
He should be retained in this prefect's manor for ongoing investigation.

200
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,490
It would be inappropriate to transfer him to another jail now.

201
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,850
Lord Bao,

202
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,350
everyone in the royal court knows about your acute observation.

203
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,660
I am also in great admiration. But you've been given

204
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,660
a corruption case, not about who killed a court official.

205
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,030
These two can't be compared. Besides,

206
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,900
Li Xu has completely confessed to his guilt.

207
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,900
It's up to the Ministry of Justice to decide on the conviction and punishment.

208
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,140
Lord Wu, you mean

209
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,970
that the Kaifeng Prefect Manor has exceeded its authority to investigate this case?

210
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,390
That's not what I meant. If I offended you,

211
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,770
after I've taken Li Xu to the Ministry of Justice,

212
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,260
and then I'll come apologize in person.

213
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,990
The Kaifeng Prefect Manor has interceded into the case of Bai Baozhen's killing.

214
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,630
Today, Guard Zhan will also go to the crime scene to inspect the site and the corpse again.

215
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,480
<i>I believe there will be a result soon.</i>

216
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,360
Once the truth is revealed,

217
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,380
and I've confirmed that Li Xu has nothing more to hide,

218
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,070
I will dispatch people to personally send him to the Ministry of Justice.

219
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:25,100
Minister Wu, what do you think?

220
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,750
Don't worry, Minister Wu. I will give it my all.

221
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,050
Everyone knows about the Kaifeng Prefect Manor's ability to determine a case,

222
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,520
but this case right now

223
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,710
is not a simple corruption case anymore.

224
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,620
Added to that, Bai Baozhen is the royal court's minister of the third ranking.

225
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,010
It's reasonable that it's given to the Ministry of Justice to investigate.

226
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,970
Minister Bao, please

227
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,680
don't put me in a hard position.

228
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,280
That's right, Minister Bao.

229
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,790
Don't put Minister Wu in a hard position.

230
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,780
He's just doing what he was ordered.

231
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,360
This is none of your business. Go out.

232
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,460
I'm here to sweep the floor.

233
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,260
Since it's the Emperor's decree,

234
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,270
then we have to do things according to the rules,

235
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,230
right Minister Wu?

236
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,530
I said this is none of your business. Go out.

237
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,230
Wait.

238
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,630
This floor sweeper is...

239
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,100
I'm a constable in the Kaifeng Government Office.

240
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,450
This floor-sweeping constable in the Kaifeng Government Office

241
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,990
is right.

242
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,290
Lord Wu, please rest assured. I always stand on the side of reason instead of friends and family.

243
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,750
What do you want to do now?

244
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,440
It's not what I want to do.

245
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,230
The Emperor already gave his decree.

246
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,440
Is our Kaifeng Prefect Manor going to disobey the imperial decree?

247
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,680
Minister Wu, hurry

248
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,950
- and bring out the decree for us to see. <br>- You.

249
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,190
This... we still have to wait a few days for the decree

250
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,940
The decree isn't here?

251
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,580
Then wait until the decree arrives and then discuss with us.

252
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,950
I can't help you this way.

253
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,820
Move your feet.

254
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,430
You should've said it earlier.

255
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,560
That's right, Minister Wu.

256
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,520
We only received the Emperor's verbal orders, but not the decree.

257
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,330
If anything happens during this time,

258
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,050
Then both the Ministry of Justice and the Kaifeng Prefect Manor

259
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,750
can't afford to take responsibility.

260
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,260
Lord Wu, you and Zhan Zhao are old friends.

261
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,140
Why don't you stay at the Kaifeng Government Office. Once the imperial decree is received,

262
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,860
it won't be late to take away Li Xu.

263
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,670
Minister Wu, I still have work affairs

264
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,490
- I can't― <br> - Minister Wu, the guest room has been prepared.

265
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,120
Please.

266
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,520
This Miss Mo is a bit interesting.

267
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,010
<i>(Kaifeng Official Relay Station)</i>

268
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,870
It's you, Minister Zhan.

269
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,440
- I want to go in to take a look. <br> - Wait.

270
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,860
Lord Zhan, I still have to support my wife and family.

271
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,230
Will the officials please be kind?

272
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,110
Stop bring me trouble, can you?

273
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,050
Sorry. I'm only investigate according to the rules.

274
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,320
Rules? Minister Zhan, don't think I don't know

275
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,720
Lord Wu Zichu has already come with His Majesty's oral edict. This matter is

276
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,000
already not under the governance of your Kaifeng Government Office anymore.

277
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,010
Lord Zhan, have you discovered that the government official's title isn't that useful?

278
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,090
I don't you long ago.

279
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,310
The rules are not reasonable and you didn't believe me.

280
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,710
Sometimes, doings things according to the rules won't work.

281
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,470
<i>Who is it now? Are you guys going to stop?</i>

282
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,960
Y-you, miss...

283
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,300
Are you going to stop?

284
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,790
Are you wearing Sichuan embroidery?

285
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,920
I heard that Sichuan embroidery is very expensive.

286
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,670
That pants are old, but you had to add hems.

287
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,390
You also carry a strong smell of sandalwood's fragrance.

288
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,630
Do servants at the relay station live such a refined life?

289
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,240
I'm nostagic. So what?

290
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,480
Moreover, I work in the kitchen all day.

291
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,160
My whole body is full of oil and smoke.

292
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,280
I use my unique and secret recipe to make sandalwood fragrance to eliminate the stinky odor.

293
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,080
Is your Kaifeng Government Office also intefering into it?

294
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,910
I can't bother about that,

295
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,690
However, why does the shopkeeper of the fabric shop on the street smell of this sandalwood fragrance all over her?

296
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,920
Maybe you've received a gift from helping people.

297
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,940
As a constable, I should report to Lord Bao

298
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,770
to publicly post announcements so that everyone in Kaifeng will know about your kindness.

299
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,130
Especially your wife and family.

300
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,760
Say, Miss... you're...

301
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,640
Okay. Come in.

302
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,450
Don't blame this lady.

303
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,040
Minister Zhan, no need to talk about it.

304
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,370
Your Kaifeng Government Office is indeed full of talented people.

305
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,500
Let's go. Wherever you guys want to go, I'll bring you guys there.

306
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,620
How is it? Aren't I amazing?

307
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,530
Elder Sir, how often do you water this courtyard?

308
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:41,700
Once every four or five days. If it's raining, then there's no need to water it.

309
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,320
Take a good look around

310
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,250
while I make some tea for you.

311
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,760
Thank you.

312
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,670
It's newly cracked.

313
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,620
My fifth brother must have done it while climbing the wall.

314
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,840
If it's like you said, there was a third person in the scene.

315
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,200
That would surely leave some traces.

316
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,740
Let's look elsewhere.

317
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,470
Besides looking for the third person's trail,

318
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,710
we're also here to prove the murderer's existence.

319
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,330
Don't be careless.

320
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,770
Yes.

321
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,470
Is mint tea.

322
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,040
Mint tea boost appetite.

323
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,700
Bai Baozhen must've had stomach problems all year round, right?

324
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,270
I didn't expect you to know pharmacology.

325
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,900
Before this, on the mountain, my eldest brother taught me how to drug rabbits.

326
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,800
So I know a bit.

327
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,740
The objects were arranged hastily.

328
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,450
He didn't bring clothes either.

329
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,300
He probably came to the capital by chance.

330
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,230
Official Bao was ordered to investigate the Jiangnan corruption case,

331
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,040
in which Bai Baozhen was involved. He was transferred to the capital by Official Bao personally.

332
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,180
<i>(You were nothing, Cloud Explorer, Li Xu)</i>

333
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,870
This ink should be replaced every time someone moves in.

334
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,700
But it ran out so quickly.

335
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,080
- That means... <br> - That he and some others had maintained a frequent correspondence.

336
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,440
That's strange. The last time we were here,

337
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,960
we didn't find any reply.

338
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,990
There should be other clues, let's keep looking.

339
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,420
Officer Zhan, come here.

340
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,230
Look.

341
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,940
It's an exact match.

342
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,170
They stabbed me with this needle.

343
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,700
Green Robed Man.

344
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,100
<i>(You were nothing, Cloud Explorer, Li Xu)</i>

345
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,620
This Bai Baozhen and the Green Robed Man should have known each other.

346
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,000
How did the killer confirm that it was Li Xu who stole the account books?

347
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,600
It's through this.

348
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,420
Public transport box?

349
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,240
This mechanism is intricate and complex.

350
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,620
Look. There are two keyholes on it.

351
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,590
It needs two keys to open it at the same time.

352
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,340
There is only one key here.

353
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,720
If that's the case, then in the entire Jianghu, there is only one person who can open it.

354
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,030
And that's my fifth brother, Cloud Explorer, Li Xu.

355
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,330
So it was Li Xu who first snuck into Bai Baozhen's room,

356
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,550
opened this public transport box and took the account book.

357
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,550
When the Green Robed Man came, they discovered that the account book was already taken.

358
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,050
So their target could only be Li Xu.

359
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,250
He killed Bai Baozhen and then framed it on Li Xu.

360
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,920
Using the prefect to hand over Li Xu.

361
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,450
Clever!

362
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,310
Let's go look elsewhere.

363
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,660
Lord Zhan, do you smell a

364
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,690
faint fragrance in this room? It's like those maidens' sachets.

365
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,690
I'm not really knowledgeable about female things.

366
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,600
It must be.

367
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,320
Lords, please drink some tea.

368
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,710
No thanks, and there's no need to stand on formalities.

369
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,890
I have something to ask you. On the day of the incident,

370
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,630
who came to look for Bai Baozhen?

371
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,210
I don't know.

372
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,040
You were the only one on duty in this entire Relay Station.

373
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,870
If you don't know, who will?

374
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,190
Yes, yes.

375
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,460
It's exactly because I was the only one on duty.

376
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,100
Sweeping the courtyard, purchasing, and all the meals

377
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,070
are all done by me.

378
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,960
Even if a guest comes, I'm too busy to attend to them, right?

379
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,740
Are you going to say it or not?

380
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,660
I... I didn't see anything. What do you want me to say?

381
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,480
It's useless for me to talk nicely to you, is that it?

382
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,600
Fine. Then I'll convict you of harboring a criminal.

383
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,410
- I'll kill you right now! <br> - Constable Mo, don't act rashly.

384
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,920
How can I not act rashly? This person caused my fifth brother to go into jail, and now he won't say anything.

385
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,570
- Fine. I'll just kill him! <br> - Constable Mo!

386
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,060
- Let go! <br> - Constable Mo!

387
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,990
Let go!

388
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,740
Lord Zhan, please be wise.

389
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,760
I did accept five taels of silver from Master Bai

390
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,050
to keep quiet about the guests who come.

391
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,990
But on the day of the incident, I really was busy until late at night.

392
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,350
I really didn't see anything!

393
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,110
Please spare my life, my Lord!

394
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,280
Please spare my life!

395
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,350
We cooperated well this time. That old officer was frightened by us,

396
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,490
and told us everything. It looks like he's not hiding anything else.

397
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,020
Constable Mo.

398
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,150
I know you mean well, but no matter if it's in a bureaucracy

399
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,480
or in the martial arts world, not having etiquette, not having anything to stand for,

400
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,710
and your frank and outspoken temperament can't be used as a reason to hurt others.

401
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,870
A ploy that uses intimidation and temptation cannot be considered righteous.

402
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,510
Besides, you are a constable now.

403
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,350
Every word and ever action from you represents the entire Kaifeng Government Office.

404
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,420
I hope you will pay attention to your words and behavior from now on.

405
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,220
Isn't it good enough for a constant to solve a case?

406
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,020
I mean, it's confirmed now

407
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,380
that the green-robed man who used hidden weapons is the culprint.

408
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,510
Can you release my fifth older brother from jail now?

409
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,200
Constable Mo,

410
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,650
we are in the streets now.

411
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,170
So what?

412
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,520
You sneaked out to investigate the case. It's already breaking the rules.

413
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,990
Now you are discussing the case in public in the streets.

414
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,470
It's a big offense.

415
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:48,510
You are not allowed to investigate the case anymore. Go back and copy the Magistrate's Rules.

416
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,680
You say not to do this and not to do that. How can you investigate the case?

417
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,640
I've realized that you are a coward.

418
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,340
You keep talking about the Magistrate's Rules.

419
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,930
You disobey the rules and flaunt your superiority.

420
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,370
Ultimately you will only harm yourself and others.

421
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,050
Who have I harmed?

422
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,180
Be clear with what you say.

423
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,980
Lord Zhan, how about copying five times?

424
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,750
Copying five times plus sweeping the courtyard.

425
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,100
Really! Just look at how proud he looks.

426
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,970
Zhan...

427
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,030
Constable Mo. Constable Mo.

428
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,610
Constable Mo.

429
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,370
Don't leave.

430
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,450
Don't leave.

431
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,170
I'm not leaving.

432
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,730
Don't leave.

433
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,490
Constable Mo! Constable Mo!

434
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,240
You're awake.

435
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,960
You're fine now.

436
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,440
The morgue? Lord Zhan, you should be understanding when you investigate a case.

437
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,540
How take you take a young miss to the morgue?

438
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,240
No wonder she got so scared.

439
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,800
On the other hand,

440
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,300
it's just a corpse. Why did you get so scared?

441
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,450
Even your soul got lost.

442
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,710
Miss Mo, do you have any health problems?

443
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,160
Or, when you were a child...

444
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,790
I don't have any problems.

445
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,020
Alright now. It's all passed.

446
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,020
Drink some Cassia Soup. It warms the blood. Nothing will scare you then.

447
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,180
Thank you, Sister Weiwei.

448
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,310
It's not enough with just this bowl. I'll go get another one for you.

449
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,790
Feeling better?

450
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,450
This Cassia Soup is pretty good. Do you want to try

451
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,920
No need.

452
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,230
Madam Ma found this from the corpse.

453
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,890
Smell it to see if it's the same as from the room.

454
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,270
Looking at the embroidery work, it should have been made by a rookie.

455
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,890
The colors and the pattern

456
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,540
must have come from a young girl's hands.

457
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,630
I remember Bai Baozhen has a daughter.

458
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,800
Considering the age, it should be embroidered by his daughter.

459
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,020
He was wearing it even until his death.

460
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,200
It means this Bai Baozhen really cared for his daughter.

461
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,340
I already verified just now.

462
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,900
The wounds on the corpse match totally to the imprint of the hidden weapon.

463
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,790
That confirms my deduction.

464
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,210
But who did it?

465
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:36,100
Have you seen this hidden weapon before? We can start with the hidden weapon.

466
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,320
- In the palace. <br> - in the palace?

467
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,790
<i>This floor sweeper...</i>

468
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,170
<i>I'm a constable in the Kaifeng Government Office.</i>

469
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:45,330
<i>This floor-sweeping constabble of the Kaifeng Government Office is right.</i>

470
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,590
Isn't Wu Zichu from the palace? Could it be he is one of the people we suspect?

471
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,340
You sound like you're almost fully recovered.

472
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,110
In that case, keep copying the Magistrate's Rules.

473
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,050
How can you demolish the bridge after crossing it? <br><i> (T/N: ungrateful)</i>

474
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,160
You change so instantly.

475
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,560
Older Brother, quickly get up!

476
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,130
Huh? Little Seven?

477
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,830
You... What are you doing?

478
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,740
Hush. I'm getting you out.

479
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,000
Let me tell you.

480
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,640
The culprit could have come from the palace.

481
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,080
The palace guard even came to the Kaifeng Prefect Manor to take you.

482
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,480
If you stay here, it'll be hard to stay alive.

483
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,830
I...

484
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,990
If you secretly save me, what about you?

485
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,680
I'll leave with you.

486
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,790
You can't come with me.

487
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,550
Why?

488
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,700
You-Your lightness skill is too bad. I can't take you with me.

489
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,660
HuH? This is strange.

490
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,120
Why can't I open the lock?

491
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,590
Little Seven,

492
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,180
can you listen to Older Brother please?

493
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,800
Don't let me worry anymore. Hurry and return to Shuzhong, please? <br><i> (T/N: Shuzhong is the middle part of Sichuan)</i>

494
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,640
Let's talk about that after saving you first.

495
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,250
I've already told you 800 times.

496
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,300
Can you open it by poking like this?

497
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,560
Then you do it.

498
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,310
Miss.

499
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,990
I advise you not to interfere in this matter.

500
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:12,290
Listen to your older brother. Wherever you came from, go back that way.

501
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:15,760
I didn't guess wrong. You are the person who framed my older brother.

502
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,990
You even want to take away my older brother now to kill him to shut him up.

503
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,070
Miss, if you continue to be unreasonable, I can only take you along to the Ministry of Justice.

504
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,990
Go ahead! Come on!

505
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,600
Silly girl, silly girl, don't... Don't do it.

506
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,740
- Let go of me. <br> - Don't go!

507
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,910
This... How can you use the blade?

508
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,150
So lively here.

509
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,060
It's this miss provoking trouble first.

510
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,720
Put down the blade.

511
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,470
Brother Zhan, this young miss has been obsructing my work several times.

512
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,940
I'd have to take her back to the Ministry of Justice.

513
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,520
You shouldn't intercede, or it may hurt our friendliness.

514
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,620
Today, as long as I'm here,

515
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,390
no one in the Kaifeng Government Office can be taken away.

516
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,160
Brother Zhan, do you really have to do this?

517
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,300
You are a blade-carrying imperial guard of fourth ranking. How can you randomly fight with me?

518
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,770
I, Zhan Zhao, is only carrying out my regular duty.

519
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,730
I'm sorry if I injured Lord Wu.

520
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,620
What does that mean?

521
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,390
Brother Zhan, your martial arts have advanced more again.

522
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,450
Goodbye.

523
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,360
So he lives?

524
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,280
Older Brother, what exactly happened? Hurry and tell the truth!

525
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,830
I'll be angered to death by you someday.

526
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,260
Sure, you don't want to talk?

527
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,720
Wait till I go to Gusu to find the real ledger, then you...

528
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,360
Constable Mo.

529
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,120
Where are we going?

530
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,180
- Older Brother, you— <br> - Get out!

531
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,810
Without my permission, you're not allowed to step in here.

532
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:43,950
Lord Zhan, she's young and isn't mature. Don't fault her.

533
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,980
If Lord Bao wants to place the blame,

534
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,010
just blame me.

535
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,460
I know what's appropriate.

536
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,700
Li Xu, who are you sacrificing your life for?

537
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,970
Of course it's whoever pays more, I'll abide by them.

538
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,640
Lord Zhan.

539
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,630
You've come out. I've been waiting for you a long time.

540
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,910
Give me the command token.

541
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,280
Why?

542
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,110
Why?

543
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,190
Why did you go to the jail so late at night?

544
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,140
I went to see my older brother.

545
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,930
The command token.

546
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,630
I'm not giving it back.

547
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,350
My older brother is still inside. I'm not leaving.

548
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,450
If you want to stay, just stay.

549
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,490
I've made up my mind anyway. It doesn't matter if you stay or not.

550
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,780
Lord Zhan, I did wrong.

551
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,830
I ignored the rules and didn't behave.

552
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,140
Please give me another chance.

553
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:25,480
Men and women should keep distance. It's improper that you're grabbing my clothes like this.

554
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,960
Let go.

555
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,220
Let go.

556
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,570
I know I did wrong.

557
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,240
I never give personal favors.

558
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,140
I did this for the investigation.

559
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,530
When my older brother saw Wu Sichu, he didn't show any panic.

560
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,920
He admitted guilt because he knew someone would save him.

561
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,240
Wu Sichu wants to save him. The green-robed man wants to frame him.

562
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,300
There are two different factions behind those two.

563
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,780
Look quickly!

564
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,680
The crow is sending messages. They will go after the ledger.

565
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,590
I told my fifth older brother where the real ledger is

566
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,920
in order to lure the culprit behind the scene.

567
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,860
Do you understand?

568
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,880
Let go! Let go!

569
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,420
You...

570
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,710
Lord Zhan,

571
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,010
I truly know that I did wrong.

572
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,000
Can you give me another chance?

573
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,470
I will definitely do better. I really will do better.

574
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:51,080
Alright, I'll give you another chance.

575
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,210
But you must agree to my conditon.

576
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,180
What condition?

577
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,510
From now on,

578
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,290
you must listen to me to do things.

579
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,330
Yes, I will listen to you.

580
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,980
About the ledger, you don't interfere again.

581
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,340
Hmm.

582
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,370
Anything else?

583
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,760
Oh...

584
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,400
<i>This won't do. The Kaifeng Government Office is so unreliable on handing cases.</i>

585
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,420
<i>I must get the real ledger first this time. Then,</i>

586
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,740
<i>I will have chips to bargain with the Kaifeng Government Office.</i>

587
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:43,030
