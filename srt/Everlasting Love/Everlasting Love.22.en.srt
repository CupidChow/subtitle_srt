1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,900
Three days later is the mid autumn festival,

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,660
it's also the death day of my mother.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,380
I'd like to ask Your Highness to bring the family members

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,130
and all the ministers to pray for her
and have vegetarian food for three days,

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,330
in order to show our condolences.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,820
You didn't do that even

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,410
on the death day of the late emperor,

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,540
you shouldn't spend too much

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,490
on someone even as honorable as the late Empress Dowager,

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,460
people might talking.

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,770
So do you, Your Highness,

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,620
said the same thing to the duke Ye

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,570
about the establishment of the crown fiasco?

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,850
I am on your side

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,930
about the establishment.

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,740
Now you are the emperor,

17
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,210
don't over think about the past.

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,050
Duke Ye is dead now.

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,290
I've heard about it,

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,260
duke Ye is dead for the righteousness cause,

21
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,940
his death is solemn and stirring.

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,850
That's what I said to the world,

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:10,130
but in fact, duke Ye was poisoned to death by my wine.

24
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,450
He harbored resentment

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,940
for my own mother

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,690
only because he's listened what you said,

27
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,340
and he killed my mother with dozens of minsters.

28
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,980
Really?

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,730
I advised to duke Ye,

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,380
but only to support you to be the King,

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
I've never thought that he would take my sister as the enemy,

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,570
it's an unintentional act of me that

33
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,450
eventually got my sister killed.

34
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,260
Is that so, an unintentional act?

35
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,260
Your Majesty, what do you mean by that?

36
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,100
I've known the late Empress Dowager when I was seventeen,

37
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,850
me and her made it to the end in this deep harem,

38
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,130
I was her most trusted person in the world.

39
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,410
I don't doubt that for a second.

40
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,660
Did she give you something

41
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,730
before she died?

42
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,940
Yes, she gave me a letter.

43
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,450
Give that to me.

44
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,500
It's been a long time,

45
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,940
I have to find it.

46
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,940
There's an epidemic out there,

47
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,730
Your Highness,

48
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,170
you'd better not to go outside

49
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,260
before you find that letter.

50
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,540
You're gonna imprison me?

51
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,170
No, I am doing this for your own good.

52
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,570
It's good for you to

53
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,340
just stay in the Yong Shou Hall to chant.

54
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,540
Three days later, the mid autumn festival,

55
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,890
as well as the death day of your mother,

56
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,410
come to me,

57
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,610
I'll give you the letter.

58
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,730
It doesn't feel right,

59
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,700
could the dream the other night was real?

60
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,220
Tell me, did the emperor

61
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,140
has any abnormal behavior when he killed someone

62
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,490
over the years?

63
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,220
His Majesty is a brutal and unsympathetic man,

64
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,900
no one could tell when he decided to kill someone

65
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,100
and who he's gonna kill.

66
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,290
Usually,

67
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,930
he would ask a group of people kneel in front of him,

68
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,170
he touched their heads one by one,

69
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,930
and he chose one he hated the most to kill.

70
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,050
No,

71
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,780
that's not what really happened.

72
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,930
He didn't touch their heads because he wanted to kill,

73
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,810
but after he touched their heads, he knew who he should kill.

74
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,100
I remembered that there's a strange story
about one getting into people's dream

75
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,900
in the book the minister Wu Yu gave to me.

76
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,410
Go get my book box.

77
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,250
And you should take this sleeve arrow also,

78
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,660
no,

79
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,340
I think you still need to add an armor in your clothes.

80
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,170
Why are you looking at me like that?

81
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,170
You shouldn't take the enemy lightly,

82
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,980
listen to me,

83
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,700
it's the mid autumn tomorrow,

84
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,370
you'd better back to me after the court,

85
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,540
do not go anywhere.

86
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,490
The Empress Dowager might be an old lady,

87
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,810
but what if she has any backhands,

88
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,930
what if she burn the whole palace on fire.

89
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,170
There will be no backhands.

90
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,930
I've already checked it all out.

91
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,930
There are indeed a group of troops

92
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,290
in the Peach Mountain,

93
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,810
the garrison officer is called Yang Qi,

94
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,290
he worked for the Empress Dowager before.

95
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,340
I will take my troops to catch them today.

96
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,100
Thank you then, sister.

97
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,700
Alright, you should be at ease now.

98
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,050
Why don't you just sit here, talk to my sister

99
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,220
and wait for me.

100
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,460
Everything is gonna be okay.

101
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,140
You'll have peace of mind

102
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,540
after tomorrow.

103
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,780
Wait for me.

104
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,780
That's enough,

105
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,290
he won't be back just because you keep staring at him.

106
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,140
Everything is fine, trust me.

107
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,100
But the Empress Dowager

108
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,700
has been planning this for so long,

109
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,220
how could she admit her defeat that easily?

110
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,930
Sis, if you're the Empress Dowager,

111
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,930
will you be willing to sit back and wait for death,

112
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,140
or will you launch a mutiny?

113
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,700
The Empress Dowager has always planed first,
then took actions.

114
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,810
Now she has already missed the best opportunity,

115
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,900
the city has been controlled by my arm,

116
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,460
but if it were me,

117
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,850
I would have to wait for the best opportunity.

118
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,220
Then if all of your troops
have all gone to the Peach Mountain,

119
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,340
would the Empress Dowager be

120
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,700
just willingly imprisoned in the palace,

121
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,730
let you kill all of her party

122
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,610
and not even takes any actions to fight back?

123
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,900
Could she had troops in the Peach Mountain
just a plan to lure the enemy away from his base?

124
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,930
Sister,

125
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,980
you can't take your troops
to catch them in Peach Mountain today,

126
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,290
your main army has to stay here

127
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
and guard the imperial city.

128
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,610
Then what about the Peach Mountain,

129
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,660
I'll go there,

130
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,460
you?

131
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,700
What could you do go over there all alone?

132
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,930
Is there a path from the Peach Mountain

133
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,580
to the imperial city?

134
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,850
It's called First Line Gorge.

135
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,730
Yes, that's right.
From the Peach Mountain to the imperial city,

136
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,060
if we don't cross the First Line Gorge,

137
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,890
then we have to go east and cross the Nine Bend River,

138
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,340
that's two days wasting.

139
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,820
Then I know what I should do.

140
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,490
Sister, you just stay here and guard the imperial city.

141
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,820
I'll have to borrow Mr. Yan Ming.

142
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,060
Okay.

143
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,650
Concubine Li, what are we going to do?

144
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,610
There are tens of thousands of pounds of gunpowder

145
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,420
hiding in the hills under the both side
of the First Line Gorge,

146
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,060
if we can find the exact spot and bomb it.

147
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,940
I've found the traces of suspected petroleum,

148
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,220
Save it and seal it,

149
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,530
we'll take it back to the lab to verify it.

150
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,180
Is that real?

151
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,650
There were indeed petroleum in ancient times?

152
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,460
China has a history of

153
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,250
more than two thousand years of using petroleum.

154
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,420
It first appeared in the book I Ching.

155
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,890
In the thirteen year of Ning An,

156
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,940
there was an explosion here,

157
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,530
it is said that the explosion
made the both sides of the mountain collapsed,

158
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,700
blocking the official road
from Peach Mountain to the imperial city,

159
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,980
teacher suspects it's a man-made explosion.

160
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,610
Someone find the best explosion spot,

161
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,340
and the vein mine was detonated,

162
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,460
the natural gas inside the mountain reacted violently,

163
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,580
causing the mountain to collapse.

164
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,530
I've found a suspected detonation point,

165
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,460
Jinan, come here and take a picture.

166
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,700
I'm coming.

167
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,490
This is the spot.

168
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,340
We'll only have to stretch this gunpowder twist

169
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,850
and ignite it outside,

170
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,060
it's done.

171
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,890
It's east to the canal water

172
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,940
and west to the Peach Mountain,

173
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,460
and it deeps through the mountain interior,

174
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,730
it's indeed the perfect place to detonate,

175
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,490
I have to go.

176
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,700
Right now?

177
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,130
Why don't you go after explosion and the road is blocked?

178
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,890
I have to return to the imperial palace

179
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,250
before morning.

180
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,300
Tomorrow is the mid autumn festival,

181
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,370
I have to stay with him.

182
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,940
Then I'll escort you back.

183
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,610
It worked,

184
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,220
once we blocked this road,

185
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,890
the troops in the Peach Mountain
will not be able to the imperial palace tomorrow.

186
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,220
We have to make it through tomorrow

187
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,700
no matter what.

188
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,060
Sister will take care of them

189
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,770
after tomorrow.

190
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,420
Let's go.

191
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,730
Where's the letter?

192
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,700
Can you remove the guards in my courtyard now?

193
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,730
You killed my mother,

194
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,700
it's already a mercy of me to let you be alive,

195
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,300
from now on,

196
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,130
Your Highness, you may just
spend the rest of your life in this Yong Shou Hall,

197
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,610
and pray for the late Empress Dowager,

198
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,530
to confess yourself and repent.

199
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
Let me be alive?

200
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,770
What a good boy.

201
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,770
My dear sister,

202
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,420
this son of yours is

203
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,340
just like you,

204
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,530
so naive, so valuing feelings,

205
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,490
which will only got himself suffered.

206
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,060
I hated the most of you

207
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,060
all striking an attitude like that.

208
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,060
You're all dead,

209
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,490
and now your son is going to hell with you.
