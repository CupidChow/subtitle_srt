1
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,110
Every single one of you is an idiot.

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,910
What's the point of keeping your heads?

3
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,040
Feng Zhili, the emperor of Da Ning

4
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,990
Each one of you should give me an explanation,

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,140
about the offence you committed.

6
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,270
Your Majesty,

7
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,070
am I beautiful today?

8
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,180
Ye Jinhui, what is she trying to do?

9
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,420
My love.

10
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,740
Ye Jinhui, the Royal Concubine of Da Ning

11
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,510
Your Majesty,

12
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,270
this is the new feathered garment I got,

13
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,350
is it pretty?

14
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,270
My love, you're the magnificent of beauty,

15
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,740
you brought vitality and vigor

16
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,510
to this boring hall,

17
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,510
what a shame that there's only one of me

18
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,420
to see the beautiful of yours.

19
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,300
Come on, everyone, lift your head.

20
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,580
Lift.

21
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,070
You,

22
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,700
lift your head.

23
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,740
What?

24
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,070
You don't like my loving concubine?

25
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,950
Or do all of your head just too heavy

26
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,300
and need my help to lift it?

27
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,390
That's what I'm talking about.

28
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,550
Your Majesty, you have to thank the Minister Wang that

29
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,300
you own the honor to enjoy my dance today.

30
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,350
It's the rare crane of Minister Wang,

31
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,950
its feather white as snow,

32
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,230
and soft too.

33
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,300
This feather?

34
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,060
Yes, it's the crane you owned.

35
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,350
Look,

36
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,550
there are blood on it.

37
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,420
My crane, oh my crane.

38
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,230
Your crane?

39
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,260
I stewed that,

40
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,670
talking about the rare crane,

41
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,740
its soup tastes just like chicken soup.

42
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,060
That's a crane of spirit,

43
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,060
what you did, killed it and scrapped its feather,
you're gonna be punished by heaven god.

44
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,860
God?

45
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,590
Your Majesty is the god of Da Ning dynasty,

46
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,620
I have the King to protect me,

47
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,820
I can scrap the crane's feather,

48
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,710
or cut of your head.

49
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,860
My love.

50
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,300
Your Majesty, I have nothing to do with it.

51
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,420
My head hurts, and my hip,

52
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,990
where am I? Am I dreaming?

53
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,110
This evil concubine of yours is gonna ruin our country,
Da Ning is gonna die.

54
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,350
Your Majesty, please you have to be righteous about this.

55
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,150
What is he trying to do?

56
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,150
Is he gonna kill somebody?

57
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,990
He really killed.

58
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,380
What does he want now?

59
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,990
Is he gonna kill me?

60
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,790
Stay away from me, stay away.

61
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,820
I've done this all for you,

62
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,710
are you satisfied? My love.

63
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,820
How's your digging?

64
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,940
I've found nothing till now.

65
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,060
Is this the skull of that tyrant?

66
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,380
I'm not sure,

67
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,260
but here is probably the burial chamber of Ning An King,

68
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,150
or the ones buried with him.

69
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,990
Could it be that evil concubine?

70
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,790
What is her name?

71
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,670
The senior concubine Li, surname Ye.

72
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,180
That's right, they're very famous,

73
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,740
I've been obsessed with them for a quite while.

74
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,180
That's bullshit, Fan Xiaoyu,

75
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,710
she became a moving target in the end,

76
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,790
and died under the chaos of arrows.

77
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,910
I can't believe you've been obsessed with this evil couple.

78
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,710
It's ultimate bad luck of Ye

79
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,670
went down in history as a symbol of infamy with Feng Zhili.

80
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,620
This evil concubine of yours is gonna ruin our country,
Da Ning is gonna die

81
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,500
I've done this all for you,

82
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,070
are you satisfied? My love.

83
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,540
Evil concubine, Da Ning?

84
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,350
I'm not dreaming.

85
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,950
Still me.

86
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,140
But this clothes, did I travel in time?

87
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,590
Sister Bi Tao,

88
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,260
Her Highness' beauty soup is ready.

89
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,950
How dare you.

90
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,660
Her Highness has spent a lot

91
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,660
to beg for this prescription.

92
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,620
This bowl you dropped is worthy your whole family's life,

93
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,950
do you understand it?

94
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,380
She's extravagant and dissipated,

95
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,860
she's ignorant and vain.

96
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,990
Help me,

97
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,860
I don't want to die,

98
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,710
I don't want to be thrown into the
hunting ground to be chased by bears either.

99
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,900
She killed

100
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,310
and she's cruel.

101
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,430
On a normal day,

102
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,140
you probably would only be punished by a few slaps.

103
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,230
But today,

104
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,110
the Minister Wang cursed on the court before he died,

105
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Her Highness is now still in shock,

106
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,470
and you're so careless,

107
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,710
no one can protect you.

108
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,260
Destabilize the ruling party

109
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,620
and Kill the courtiers,

110
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,190
I traveled in time and become the evil concubine Ye.

111
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,830
Your Highness.

112
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,590
How could I

113
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,660
become the evil concubine?

114
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,230
In history,

115
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,860
this concubine died very badly,

116
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,950
I have to find a way to go back my time.

117
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,860
Please forgive me,

118
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:39,830
Your Highness, please forgive me.

119
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,710
I'm willing to take the punish by slapping myself.

120
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,830
Please, please forgive me.

121
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,380
Please don't cut off my hand.

122
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,470
Ye, you have a really bad reputation.

123
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,900
It's so hard to be a evil concubine.

124
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,260
Forget about it,

125
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,190
I, I, I now spare your life.

126
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,230
Thank you,

127
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,710
Your Highness, you're very kind.

128
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,830
Get up now.

129
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,900
His Majesty has arrived.

130
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,070
Oh my god, oh my god,

131
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,310
it's the man with blood on his face.

132
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,540
What?

133
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,380
Is he gonna kill me?

134
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,470
How's that possible?

135
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,710
Then what does he want from me?

136
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,110
Your Highness, you lost your mind?

137
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,140
Your Majesty is with you every night.

138
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,070
He sleeps with me every night?

139
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,590
It's even worse than just kill me.

140
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,590
What's wrong with you, my love,

141
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,140
I'm so worried.

142
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,190
Your Majesty,

143
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,350
I,

144
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,380
I'm on,

145
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,620
I'm on my period.

146
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,500
But I remember that

147
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,900
your period it's on the beginning of every month.

148
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,500
Yes, that's right, that's right,

149
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,110
it's probably because that,

150
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,350
I've got shocked on the court today.

151
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,660
Is that so?

152
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,140
But clearly it's you who's trying to kill the Minister Wang,

153
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,230
how could it shock you?

154
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,140
Did I get the wrong idea?

155
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,950
No. Then, maybe, I,

156
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,950
I caught a cold, I caught a cold.

157
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,350
Your Majesty,

158
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,950
you won't blame me for it, will you?

159
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,540
I won't do that.

160
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,500
Your Majesty,

161
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,900
I'm going to change my clothes,

162
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,590
you.

163
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,780
Let me go to your dream,

164
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,310
and see who the hell are you.

165
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,900
Then I shall leave now,

166
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,900
you have a good sleep.

167
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,500
What's the meaning of this, my love?

168
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,380
I traveled in time the moment I touched his skull,

169
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,140
so could I,

170
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,780
It's indeed just like the skull in the tomb,

171
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,860
so full,

172
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,070
but it won't do.

173
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,830
My love, I have no idea you like to touch
the back of my neck now.

174
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,950
Your Majesty, you don't like it?

175
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,740
I like it very much.

176
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,230
Your Majesty, see,

177
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,660
it's getting late.

178
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,780
Since my love acts like this,

179
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,140
I don't want you to be alone in the night now,

180
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,310
my love, get ready and wait for me.
