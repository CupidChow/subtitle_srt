1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,400
The imperial father in law.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,560
He's the father of Ye, ranked state duke of three dynastic.

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,150
Dad,

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,280
dad.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,950
I don't deserve to be called by you.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,760
Your Majesty, please may I leave first.

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,280
She doesn't look like acting,

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,640
since she doesn't know Ye Tingjun,

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,120
it shows that she's not Ye Jinhui.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,790
All of you, do you have anything to report to me?

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,510
Shit, I'm dead,

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,560
I just offended my own father.

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,760
I lost my only back-up.

14
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,680
Instead of being exposed

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,310
my true identity,

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,870
why don't I take a try?

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,960
I should touch the top of his head,

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,590
and kill him,

19
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,960
or he will kill me off.

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,960
All of you shall leave now,

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,560
I can take care of here.

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,750
No one is here,

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,960
isn't this tyrant afraid of nightmares?

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,430
Your Highness,

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,120
Your Highness,

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,150
His Majesty had a glass at the palace banquet,

27
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,520
so. I can take care of him,

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,710
you can leave.

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,910
Yes, Your Highness,

30
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,960
Your Majesty,

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,590
Your Majesty,

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,310
Your Majesty,

33
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,960
Your Majesty,

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,000
Your Majesty.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,360
I definitely won't sleep with him,

36
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,520
today is the best day,

37
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,750
I should just kill him today.

38
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,560
I can do it, I can do it.

39
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,430
You give me the chance to do it,

40
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,630
so don't you blame me.

41
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,600
No no no,

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:26,920
Your Majesty.

43
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,240
My love, trying to kill me?

44
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,800
I can't even dare to kill a chicken,

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,360
how could I have the guts to,

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,120
to, to kill the King.

47
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,600
But I do remember the year before last year,
that spiritual fox I hunted in the spring,

48
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,510
the deer that owned by your excellency Yu,

49
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,360
and the crane belongs to Minister Wang,

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,390
it's you

51
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,000
who killed them all, right?

52
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,390
Your,

53
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,360
Your Majesty,

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,120
that's all in the past,

55
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,680
and I was just messing with you,

56
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,510
I was messing with you.

57
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,070
You really got scared?

58
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,950
Isn't this kind of game

59
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,750
you love play with me

60
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,270
the most?

61
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,560
No historical records said that

62
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,630
the tyrant and his evil concubine
love to play this kind of games.

63
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,000
I can't kill him,

64
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,920
I can't do it at all.

65
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,120
It's not that I don't dare to do it,

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,680
it's just,

67
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Ning An King is not even

68
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,360
strangled to death in the historical records,

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,560
so, forget it, I'll just take this
as an experience of immersive archaeology,

70
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,000
and take one step at a time.

71
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,480
I do have a lot of gains these past few days.

72
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,160
This homemade embroidered shoe insoles
that the palace maid made,

73
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,160
the eunuch's private collection of
natural onyx snuff bottles,

74
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,240
and this,

75
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,720
red lotus cup,

76
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,120
it's smooth

77
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,510
and moist,

78
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,830
nothing like the ones come out of the ground.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,310
Your Highness, the crown dress is ready,

80
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,310
I'll help you get dress

81
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,630
at five.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,360
The crown dress?

83
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,310
What day is tomorrow?

84
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,360
The princess is return to the imperial tomorrow,

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,360
you need to go with Your Majesty to the city gate by then.

86
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,430
The older sister, the return of the princess,

87
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
is this year the thirteenth year of Ning An?

88
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,510
That's right, Your Highness,

89
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,800
are you right?

90
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,160
You shall leave.

91
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,630
The thirteenth year of Ning An,

92
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,310
the great victory in Weizhou,

93
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,390
thus the older princess is return,

94
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,630
and one month later,

95
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,950
she killed the evil concubine at her birthday party.

96
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,750
The senior concubine Li, surname Ye,

97
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,360
dead at twenty two.

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,430
Only one month,

99
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,950
I have to find a way to survive.

100
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,950
My cup,

101
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,560
my cup,

102
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,560
my red lotus cup.

103
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,000
The older sister of Da Ning,
the princess is return to the imperial.

104
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,680
Welcome, princess.

105
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,960
That is the evil concubine Ye?

106
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Yes, she came to the imperial palace after you left.

107
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,390
I've heard that the King
has been party every night since then,

108
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
he ignored the government affairs

109
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,790
and killed like crazy.

110
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,600
Red armor army.

111
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,670
Yes,

112
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,630
raise the flag, put away your blades,

113
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,440
and return with me.

114
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,720
Yes.

115
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,750
Oh my god, I'm gonna be dead.

116
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,550
She's finally back.

117
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,870
Long live

118
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,000
the king.

119
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Get up.

120
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

121
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,840
So I suppose

122
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,870
this is the famous senior concubine Li,

123
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,200
You're the senior concubine,

124
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
but you're sitting there instead of
paying your respect to your King,

125
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,550
it's not right.

126
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,750
I am the one who allowed that.

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Princess,

128
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,360
please forgive me for this,

129
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,960
it's not right that the senior concubine

130
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720
won't pay her respects,

131
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,510
but you're walk in the court with a long blade,

132
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,600
it's the same as the concubine.

133
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,550
Besides, princess, you're a girl,

134
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,150
yet you get the royal payment,

135
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,360
also the military power in your hands,

136
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,390
and now you speak so rudely to the King.

137
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,870
You're against the royal rules

138
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,670
and look down upon the King.

139
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,550
Just stop talking,

140
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,870
you're so deserve to be my father,

141
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,200
now you talk to her like that,

142
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,960
is only gonna get me killed.

143
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,080
I left here for three years,

144
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,000
guarding Weizhou, fought for almost hundreds of battles,

145
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,390
and fought seven states for Da Ning.

146
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,360
The late emperor gave me name Zhao Ming,

147
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,790
allowed me to walk in the court with blades in my hands,

148
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,840
and I don't have to worship the King.

149
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,840
Your excellency Ye,
do you doubt the decision of the late emperor?

150
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,670
It's because I respect the late emperor,

151
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,670
Your Majesty should obey the rules and be modesty.

152
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,320
That's enough.

153
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,150
Three years in the border,

154
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,720
princess,

155
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,630
your blade is still so sharp.

156
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,270
I've heard some words,

157
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,080
and that hurts my heart,

158
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,390
though the border is hard,

159
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,440
my heart is even more chilling.

160
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,790
Please Your Majesty,
may you get rid off the one who's bad for you,

161
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,200
so to clear your mind.

162
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,870
How dare you.

163
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,910
Good,

164
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
that's so good.

165
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,270
Concubine Li, it's not necessarily a good thing
that you have King's favor,

166
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,000
if you don't behavior well,

167
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,270
I will take care of you for the heaven god.

168
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,840
Oh shit, I'm really gonna be dead.

169
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,480
But on the other side,

170
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,960
this first female emperor in the history

171
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,630
is so cool.

172
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,360
Hello, Your Highness.

173
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,510
Ling Shan,

174
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,910
three years ago, when I decided to go border,

175
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,960
you read me a fortune,

176
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,510
did you ever see that

177
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,150
I could return alive?

178
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,600
The fortune told me,

179
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,440
you shall return victory

180
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,870
for you have God's blessing.

181
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,960
Then I still should thank you for so divine in the telling,

182
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,390
so I could survive in the worst of times.

183
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,080
Your Highness,

184
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,870
your medicine is ready.

185
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,670
My medicine?

186
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,630
Ye has specially instructed that,

187
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,270

188
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,510
