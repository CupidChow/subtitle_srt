1
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,400
You said you want to keep me company,

2
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,760
yet you stay in bed all day.

3
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,150
Keep doing that,

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,590
I'm gonna have to find you a doctor.

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,150
Your Highness.

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,950
You need to figure out for yourself,

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,480
no one could help you.

8
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,760
Then what about you?

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,590
Do you figure out for yourself?

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,400
Just you wait and see.

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,520
Your Highness,

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,840
the king of Da Sheng sent people to bring you a gift.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,840
You can leave now.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,400
Yes.

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,470
A gift?

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,800
Is that wedding gift?

17
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,150
He's after all a king,

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
yet he sent you such a small gift.

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,310
What gift?

20
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,280
This is the Khan's head,

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,910
you wanna see?

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,750
No, no.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,430
But what is all this?

24
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,800
Hu Yanche is a clan king,

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,870
he's very ambitious,

26
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,000
he just needs to wait for an opportunity,

27
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,080
now the Da Sheng needs another king.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,120
I've dealt with him,

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,280
I'll do this myself.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,360
About you and her,

31
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,360
I'll give her an explanation.

32
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,590
So you made a deal with Hu Yanche,

33
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,750
you help him to the throne

34
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,000
and make him the new king.

35
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,750
Aren't they beg for the peace on the border,

36
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,080
Hu Yanche has already promised to pay tribute
and make friends with us.

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Thus us two countries will stay harmony
for at least twenty years.

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,240
I went to the battle when I was fifteen,

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,120
I've made hundreds contributions for Ning,

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,960
but even so,

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,000
I can't decide my own wedding

42
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,960
just because I am the daughter of the royal,

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,870
so does he.

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,000
We've been living in these high walls since little

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,190
with extremely strict rules,

46
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,470
however, we're so lucky that

47
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,400
our parents were deep in love,

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,280
the late emperor still had his harem,

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,910
they lived in the cold palace and always waited,

50
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,470
they were so lonely.

51
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,310
The king though has the most honor,

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,190
but in the mean time, they have the most shackle.

53
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,390
My father yet, had been fought with this all his life,

54
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,830
it's very hard to just love one living in the royal,

55
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,830
but if you're determined,

56
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,630
it's always worth a fight.

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,560
Nothing absolute in the world,

58
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,160
why don't you ask yourself,

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,920
are you willing to just give up like this?

60
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,190
Your Highness, bad news,

61
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,070
a shock in the palace,

62
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,800
His Majesty was assassinated, his life is now at risk.

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,270
What?

64
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,000
Is that true?

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,430
The news come from the department of Wu Wei,

66
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,510
I don't dare to tell a lie.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,560
Are you alright?

68
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,070
I'm fine, mother.

69
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,390
All of you, I think you all saw it,

70
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,480
Hui Zhao kept me company,

71
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,190
so I sent all the guards away,

72
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,830
however I got stabbed by her,

73
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,920
I spared her life for she's pregnant with my child,

74
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,950
but that damn woman committed suicide
because she's too terrified.

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,950
I've already had Ling Shan to do a fortune-telling,

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,480
he said it's a very bad luck, news from god that

77
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,120
I shall not have concubine

78
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,160
in five years,

79
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,240
if I disobey it, there will be life risk disasters.

80
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,120
Em, Hui Zhao had the king's favor,

81
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,800
why did she even do that?

82
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,720
Is there any misunderstandings?

83
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,390
It's king's bedchamber,

84
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,680
the evidence is right here,

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,950
there are no misunderstandings.

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,560
Stabbing the king is a great crime of
wiping out all the clans,

87
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,160
she has already reaped what her sowed.

88
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,160
She's indeed unforgivable,

89
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,950
but her child is innocent.

90
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,950
Enough.

91
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,120
The king is still weak,

92
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,360
stop arguing.

93
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,190
It's late, you shall all leave.

94
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,070
The king needs to take a good rest.

95
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,600
Feng Zhili,

96
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,000
Feng Zhili,

97
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
Feng Zhili,

98
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,950
you're such a fool.

99
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,560
You're a tyrant after all,

100
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,070
acting so bold,

101
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,920
yet was hurt by a girl like this.

102
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,830
Don't cry,

103
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,070
I'm alright, aren't I?

104
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,510
I'm so scared,

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,270
if you're dead

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,000
like this,

107
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,950
then no one,

108
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,870
no one knows who I am,

109
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,310
and no one will ever call me Ye Jinan.

110
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,270
I'm sorry, Jinan,

111
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,790
I don't want anything bad happen between us,

112
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,840
so I want to solve this as soon as possible.

113
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,870
About tonight,

114
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,550
it's just a plan,

115
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,480
in order to fake Wen Qingyuan's death
so that she can get away,

116
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,480
Fake her death?

117
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,960
Wen Qingyuan has been given the name Zhao Yi,

118
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,870
only in this way, no one will ever talk

119
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,600
and she can disappear

120
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,600
in our lives for good.

121
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,000
What the hell happened here?

122
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,360
That day I slept in the Liu Guang pavilion,

123
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,600
actually I wanted to get into her dream

124
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,440
to see who's behind her

125
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,390
and why did he sent her into the palace,

126
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,440
however I saw that she has a lover.

127
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,960
What?

128
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,240
The peach blossom with the willow
(Liu; In Chinese, the willown pronounce the same as"Liu"),
the roof iris
(Yuan; In Chinese, the iris pronounce the same as"Yuan")
means it's spring time.

129
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,240
That is, Wen Qingyuan and Liu Yushu.

130
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,320
Your Majesty,

131
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,000
that's such a romantic saying,

132
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,960
but I don't know who Liu Yushu is.

133
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,510
Liu Yushu,

134
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,150
isn't he the father of your child?

135
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,120
How can the Wen family of Liuzhou,
which has been a family of hairpins for generations,

136
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,200
tolerate you having an affair with a lover

137
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,240
and even pregnant with his child.

138
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,510
So once it got exposed,

139
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,390
someone threatened your life
and forced you to get into the palace.

140
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,750
That's not the truth.

141
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,870
Tell me,

142
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,320
who's behind you?

143
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,270
And what is he trying to do?

144
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,750
That man even dared to set a fire
outside the Tingfang Court,

145
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,750
do you even think he cares about your life?

146
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,790
Do you even think

147
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,360
Liu Yushu can still be alive?

148
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,120
No,

149
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,630
that's not the truth.

150
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,840
If you want him to be alive, there's only one way.

151
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,240
I don't have much patience.

152
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,550
Your Majesty,

153
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,790
I'm willing to tell you everything.

154
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,150
So that's what happened.

155
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,270
Jinan,

156
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,150
I'm sorry,

157
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,670
I failed to understand your worries before,

158
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,390
it's my fault.

159
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,510
I've been living in the royal family,

160
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,600
my parents were deep in love,

161
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,360
I thought that was the best.

162
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,790
But now I understand,

163
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,150
you were right,

164
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,390
no one could share the one he loves,

165
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,550
and I don't care any rules now.

166
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,600
Even

167
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,270
I believe in you,

168
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,790
you're the emperor,

169
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,320
you can't fight the system

170
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,240
and all the rules.

171
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,600
Jinan,

172
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,390
you always said that

173
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,390
on one knows you in this world,

174
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,480
I am in fact the same,

175
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,840
in their eyes, I am the emperor,

176
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,790
but only in front of you,

177
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,510
I am Feng Zhili,

178
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,510
I want to get to know you,

179
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,240
I want to know what's your favorite food,

180
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,720
and where do you come from.

181
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,390
Though I don't know

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,840
how far is Da Ning from your hometown,

183
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,270
but in here,

184
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,390
I'm always the one you know.

185
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,000
Jinan, I promise you,

186
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,390
no one will ever enter the harem again,

187
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,870
when I'm done with what's on my mind,

188
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,600
I don't want to be the king,

189
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,870
I'm going to travel the world with you,

190
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,630
to be a most ordinary husband and wife,

191
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,000
one man, one heart.

192
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,630
Jinan, do you believe it?

193
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,550
There's no way back for me.

194
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,320
Feng Zhili,

195
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,600
you can't lie to me,

196
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,600
the earth and heaven can tell it.
