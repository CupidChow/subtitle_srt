1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,590
Alright, Your Majesty, now I have completed your wish,

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,950
I can have the Yi Lin Tang Book.

3
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
I would prefer you call me by my name

4
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,430
than Your Majesty.

5
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,400
Really?

6
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,840
Of course,

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,120
we can be more comfortable with each other.

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,190
Feng Zhili.

9
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,280
Feng Zhili.

10
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,870
Ye Jinan.

11
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,590
Fire, there's a fire in the Tingfang Court.

12
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,280
How dare you,

13
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,560
you said that you're pregnant with the King's child.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Yes.

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,800
Do you even know if you lie to His Majesty,

16
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,150
you're gonna be dead.

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,960
I know that,

18
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,240
my family rules are extremely strict,

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,870
I have always abide by the good and respectful,

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,750
if,

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,120
if it wasn't the King himself,

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,280
I will never do things that crossed the line,

23
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,840
not to mention to put all my families' life at risk.

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,710
I have never even seen you before,
how dare you speak such a thing

25
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,750
and slandered me.

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,360
Two months ago,

27
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,360
you were drunk at the Tingfang Court,

28
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,030
it was me who looked after you all night.

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,240
Emperor, is that real?

30
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,430
Mammy,

31
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,520
Empress Dowager,

32
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,680
the servant just said that

33
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,870
at the sacrificial rites in the Dragon Boat Festival,

34
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,560
the emperor was drunk and slept in the Tingfang Court,

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,400
there are seventeen people in the palace on duty that day,

36
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,000
they can all confirm it.

37
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,480
I'm only a servant girl,

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,240
so I don't dare to ask for being his empress wife,

39
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,430
and I don't want to humiliate my family

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,240
or worried you.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,720
But I've never thought that
Tingfang Court would burn on fire today.

42
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,830
You can make it alive in this fire,

43
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,950
it must be the god blessing your child.

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,510
Mother,

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,950
we can't tell now that

46
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,560
whose the child is this.

47
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,680
The girls entered the palace were all examined,

48
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,270
even the servant boy couldn't get into the Tingfang Court,

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,510
let alone men,

50
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,360
this child must be yours.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,390
I am so regret about this,

52
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,750
I only wish Your Majesty and
the Empress Dowager could forgive me for this,

53
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,000
I'd rather to die

54
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,160
to prove my heart to the royal.

55
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,390
You threaten me?

56
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,240
I don't feel so well,

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,630
I need to go now.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,430
Emperor, I think you know what's more important here.

59
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,630
Get up.

60
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,310
You should go now.

61
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,950
I pray to Buddha day and night

62
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,070
for the royal child,

63
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,430
now I've finally got my wish,

64
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,510
though it didn't obey the rules of the royal,

65
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,390
it's a good thing.

66
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,240
Wen.

67
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,510
Now I decide to broke the rules

69
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,160
and give you the name Zhao Yi, styled as Hui.

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,750
You should keep law-abiding

71
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,630
in the palace,

72
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,270
take good care of your child in the future.

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,830
Thank you, empress.

74
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,870
The department of Wu Wei has identified that

75
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,630
the fire was set by the outside.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,830
This is a risky plan,

77
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,430
the one behind it

78
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,190
tried to threaten the life of Wen Qingyue,

79
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,510
fooled everyone in the palace

80
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,560
and threaten the life of the emperor without any traces.

81
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,120
The one behind it must be a very treacherous person.

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,830
I just don't know what's his purpose of this.

83
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,270
The one who set out the fire has been dead,

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,800
Wen Qingyuan comes from a

85
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,870
very decent and clean family,

86
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,830
we have no clues.

87
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,630
So the only break point of it

88
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,270
is this Zhao Yi.

89
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,800
Honor to see you, Your Majesty.

90
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,830
Lift your head.

91
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,800
You're going through your stuff again?

92
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,190
Last night, I went to the Liu Guang pavilion,

93
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,510
in fact, I went to,

94
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,950
Your Majesty,

95
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,150
you came just in time,

96
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,750
I want to ask for your permission

97
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
to travel out of the palace.

98
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,630
Travel?

99
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,270
You want to get out of the palace? Why?

100
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,600
Jinan, you misunderstand me.

101
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,150
I've found it all out that

102
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,150
on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival,

103
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,630
someone put drug in the wine.

104
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,080
She is a chosen harem,

105
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,390
she comes here because she wants to be a concubine,

106
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,150
now she has the ability to carry your child,

107
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,270
good for her.

108
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,030
Your Majesty, you don't have to explain to me,

109
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,550
I have nothing to do with her.

110
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,120
The child in her belly is not mine,

111
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,120
you don't believe me?

112
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,750
I believe you.

113
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,440
Then why did you,

114
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,000
What's the point?

115
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,600
Now she's pregnant.

116
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,200
the Empress Dowager thinks that's your child,
all the world think that's your child.

117
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,790
Now she has been styled as Zhao Yi,

118
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,720
that is the fact.

119
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,480
Last night you slept in the Liu Guang pavilion,

120
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,440
that's also the fact.

121
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,390
Last night, I went to the Liu Guang pavilion.

122
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,320
Your Majesty,

123
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,720
the problem between us is not even Wen Qingyuan.

124
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,600
I don't understand.

125
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,120
You're the emperor,

126
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,240
and I am just one of your concubines.

127
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,200
Even there's no Wen Qingyuan,

128
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,600
there will be someone else in the future.

129
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,320
But you are the only one in my heart.

130
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,440
My royal father before had the harem,

131
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,600
that's all for the balance of power

132
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,720
and keep the harmony of border,

133
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,200
he just took the emperor's responsibility.

134
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,000
But the only one he loved

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,670
is my mother.

136
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,870
But that's not a husband and a wife,

137
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,240
what I want is one man,

138
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,840
one heart,

139
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,790
do you understand that?

140
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,960
One man, one heart,

141
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,480
only one person in his life,

142
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,440
I can't share someone I love with others,

143
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,840
even if it's just in name only.

144
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Don't go.

145
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,240
Your Majesty, you can't give me what I want,

146
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,720
now you can't even

147
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,600
set me free?

148
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,870
I'll send guards to see you off.

149
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,790
That's not necessary.

150
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,870
Emperor, do you hear what I said?

151
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,960
Emperor,

152
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,550
the Da Sheng's Khan intends to
marry Zhao Ming as his queen wife,

153
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,840
what do you think of it?

154
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,790
Da Sheng is just a border country,

155
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,270
Khan is already in his fifty,

156
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,030
how dare he asks to marry the princess of Da Ning.

157
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,480
If Zhao Ming is married now,

158
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,870
she wouldn't put herself in such a awkward place.

159
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,480
She's already twenty five,

160
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,630
if she's not married soon,

161
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,480
we will lose our royal dignity.

162
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,270
My sister has been fighting in the border,

163
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,960
she made the great contribution to Da Ning,

164
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,440
if now we forced her to get married,

165
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,630
I'm afraid all the people in our country wouldn't agree that.

166
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,840
Zhao Ming is a girl,

167
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
yet she insists to fight on the war battle,

168
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,150
that's why she got herself in this awkward place,

169
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,630
if she can marry to Da Sheng,

170
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,080
keeping the border in peace,

171
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,630
that's actually a very good thing,

172
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,360
besides, Khan is always respectful for her.

173
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,720
She will be a queen,

174
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,320
that is worthy of her status.

175
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,720
But that Khan has already

176
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,960
had dozens of consorts,

177
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,840
my sister is the royal princess,

178
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,960
that's injustice for her.

179
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,790
One man, one heart,

180
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,840
only one in his life,

181
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,240
I can't share someone I love with others,

182
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,720
even if it's just in name only.

183
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,840
As a royal King, naturally there are so much things

184
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,390
you can't do by your own will.

185
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,000
No time for her to feel injustice,

186
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,750
Khan's invitation has been here.

187
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
If we can't give him a fair explanation,

188
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,720
two countries might be at the risk of war.

189
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,600
I know what I should do,

190
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
I need to take care of something else,

191
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,670
I shall leave now.
