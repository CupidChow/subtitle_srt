1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,220
Enough,

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,140
I won't make her regret it too.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,910
Your Majesty, the Fu Xi Land in the scroll has been found.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,910
Your Majesty,

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,110
Her Highness hasn't been eaten or drunk for two days,

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,500
please you have to go and see her.

7
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,790
Feng Zhili,

8
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,460
how long do you plan to lock me in?

9
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,790
You haven't fully recovered,

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,350
you need rest.

11
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,270
Feng Zhili, this is imprison.

12
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,950
Sit down.

13
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,670
Only a stopgap plan,

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,270
you just need to wait one more day,

15
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,420
you can go home tomorrow.

16
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,420
Go home, home, what home?

17
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,140
The Duke Ye's Mansion?

18
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,270
Go back to thousand years later, where you came from.

19
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,230
What are these bullshit you talking about?

20
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,230
I've planed it,

21
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,550
I'll send you home tomorrow.

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,270
That's ridiculous.

23
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,950
Traveling through time,

24
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,990
acrossing through thousand years.

25
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,790
It's not that easy.

26
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,110
I have my own way to do that.

27
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,420
Feng Zhili, what on earth do you mean by that?

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,390
I regret.

29
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,180
What?

30
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,580
Before, I want my mother to stay,

31
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,230
but what happened?

32
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,070
Me forced her to stay eventually got her killed.

33
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,460
There is nothing worth staying here.

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,180
You should have just left everything behind and left here.

35
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,580
It was me,

36
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,950
I was too selfish,

37
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,620
and that put you all in danger,

38
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,300
almost got you killed too.

39
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,860
This is my decision,

40
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,350
whether I'm going to die or not, I'm willing to take any risk.

41
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,550
But I don't want it.

42
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,740
I've got my mother killed,

43
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,060
how could I let that happen to you too?

44
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,990
But the situation is totally different now,

45
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,150
Ye Tingjun is dead now.

46
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,820
It's still the same,

47
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,150
what killed her was not just one person,

48
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,820
but the overall situation,

49
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,420
if one can be killed,

50
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,350
then the others can be too.

51
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,940
But Jinan, tell me,

52
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,180
though I am the King of the country,

53
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,030
how could I fight against the overall situation?

54
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,590
I've already given orders to the historian to record that,

55
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,940
because provoking the princess,

56
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,910
the concubine Li died at her birthday feast

57
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,150
in the thirteen years of Ning An,

58
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,940
there will be no concubine Li,
named Ye in the future of Da Ning.

59
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,260
I will send you home

60
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,990
tomorrow.

61
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,380
The thirteen years of Ning An,

62
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,710
the concubine Li died at her birthday feast,

63
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,260
I've gone round and round, and I still ended up here.

64
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,300
Does the history changed or not?

65
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,790
Feng Zhili.

66
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,500
I'm back.

67
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,470
At the thirteen year of Ning An,

68
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,740
Ning An King died in the fire of Feng Qi Palace.

69
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,470
Feng Zhili,

70
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,420
Feng Zhili,

71
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:04,940
Feng Zhili,

72
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,910
Feng Zhili,

73
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,180
no,

74
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,350
Feng Zhili,

75
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,740
let me down,

76
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,620
I don't give a shit about that moon what you're talking about,

77
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,230
I won't leave here.

78
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,350
I won't leave you even if I die.

79
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,300
Feng Zhili, I can't leave,

80
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,420
the history hasn't changed yet, the history,

81
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,710
history hasn't changed yet, I just can't.

82
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,420
It doesn't matter,

83
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,500
it doesn't matter if the history doesn't change.

84
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,500
I'm already so grateful that

85
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,110
you've been here.

86
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,550
Don't forget about me when you got back.

87
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,420
Feng Zhili, I won't go,

88
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,230
Feng Zhili,

89
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,910
Feng Zhili, you're a stubborn coward,

90
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,780
you're authoritarian and dictatorial,

91
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,780
you only care about yourself,

92
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,540
I hate you,

93
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,350
I will never forgive you for this.

94
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,380
As long as you can remember me,

95
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,430
it's good even if you hate me.

96
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,070
Even if you got me back,

97
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,780
I will find a way to come back.

98
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,590
Feng Zhili,

99
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,070
Feng Zhili,

100
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,900
Feng Zhili, just you wait,

101
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,310
Feng Zhili, no.

102
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,430
When the sky and the earth are dim,

103
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,500
the red moon hangs high,

104
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,830
that's the exact time,

105
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,740
you'll have to wait for another hundred years
if you miss it this time.

106
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,070
Feng Zhili.

107
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,900
I am sorry, Jinan,

108
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,830
you'll be home soon.

109
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,470
It's bad.

110
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,310
Sister, what are you doing here?

111
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,110
I'll explain it later,

112
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,900
come with me now.

113
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,470
Sister, what are you doing in the Fu Xi Temple?

114
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,470
Jinan sent me a note,

115
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,860
saying it has something to do with our mother,

116
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,350
so I need to follow you.

117
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,950
You really think I do not know it?

118
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,470
All those years,

119
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,430
you've been looking into our mother's case.

120
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,900
At the birthday feast,

121
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,350
the duke Ye died on the spot,

122
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,950
more than ten auxiliary ministers were killed
and their heads were shown to the world.

123
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,710
You've spent day by day in the Nian Xing pavilion,

124
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,070
figured out the things about seven stars in a row

125
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,140
and the heavenly hound swallowed the moon.

126
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,430
You fool,

127
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,950
you don't understand mother.

128
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,500
In fact, she,

129
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,660
she never regretted.

130
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,190
Mother.

131
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,110
Fan, don't be sad.

132
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,860
You and your little brother, you two have to love each other,

133
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,740
and help each other.

134
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,350
Mom, don't leave us.

135
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,990
My little princess,

136
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,230
I,

137
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,990
I never regret,

138
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,350
I never regret to come here,

139
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,740
I've got you and Zhili, I've been very happy.

140
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,780
Mom,

141
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,310
Mom.

142
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,470
I am just like a grass seeds,

143
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,190
spilling in the wilderness,

144
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,070
I will die in the wildfire,

145
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,660
waiting for the return of spring.

146
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,070
Mom,

147
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,230
mom, wake up, mom.

148
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,830
But I heard mother

149
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,710
talking in her dreams more than once that,

150
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,830
she wanted to go home,

151
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,230
though she never complained,

152
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,110
but did she really not regret it?

153
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,620
You think so little of her if you think of her like that.

154
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,950
In Da Ning, she had you, she had the princess,

155
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,990
the late emperor,

156
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,830
you're a happy family, together,

157
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,860
she had all the ones she cherished,

158
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,540
she lived for what her heart really wanted,

159
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,900
how could she regret it?

160
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,740
I'm sorry,

161
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,860
I've got obsessed, and that almost got you killed,

162
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,900
sorry,

163
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,540
I'm really sorry.

164
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,590
You fool.
