1
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,400
This late empress lived quite far away.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,230
I've heard from Bitao that

3
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,950
the Stardust Hall is a forbidden place in the palace,

4
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,430
the late emperor wouldn't allow anyone

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,680
to come in here after the empress died,

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,840
including the now emperor.

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,710
No wonder there are so little of information
of the late empress.

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,000
If I can dig out some secrets,

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,560
I can publish a core journal.

10
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,430
I've heard something over there,

11
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,870
let's go there and check out.

12
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,910
Who, who's there?

13
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,910
I've really heard something.

14
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,680
No one will come here,

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
let's just go.

16
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Let's go.

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,080
Alright.

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,520
Wait.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,630
What do you want?

20
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,000
My earring is stuck on you.

21
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,960
Is it alright?

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,590
Almost.

23
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,190
It's done.

24
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,430
Don't move.

25
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,430
Why do you come here tonight?

26
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,630
I, I,

27
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,120
I've heard the princess
talked about the late empress that day.

28
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,720
I thought that you must really miss her,

29
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,830
so,

30
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,310
you come here to comfort me.

31
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,000
You're really smart, Your Majesty.

32
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,720
Not as smart as you,

33
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,680
you're able to find this place with only a few words.

34
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,830
Interesting.

35
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,920
This is,

36
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,870
the Luoyang shovel,

37
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,750
compass,

38
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,950
what is this palace?

39
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,560
My mother used to love those things,

40
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
so she built a back room for these.

41
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,000
Could the late empress a grave robber,

42
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,680
or maybe she's the same as me?

43
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,120
You know these?

44
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,510
I, I've read those

45
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,310
in some biography of the craftsmen.

46
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,190
The late empress was quite ingenious,

47
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,190
she used to come here

48
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,120
and stayed all day.

49
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,830
I entered here when I was a kid by accident,

50
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,870
I loved it here.

51
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,190
This place is cold and cramped,

52
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,120
she used to be here all alone,

53
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,830
how did she get rid of her loneliness?

54
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,270
Every tool

55
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,120
and every collection here

56
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,600
is made by her,

57
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,830
she wouldn't feel so lonely

58
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,160
doing what she loved.

59
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,160
You can talk to it

60
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,920
or chat with it,

61
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,000
these clay figures are all alive,

62
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,390
they seem to

63
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,310
tell you an amazing story.

64
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,920
I suppose the late empress was an amazing woman.

65
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,550
Your Majesty,

66
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,790
I just feel that,

67
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,000
Doesn't matter.

68
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,870
Your Majesty,

69
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,120
why are you staring at me?

70
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,320
I just feel you're quite different from before.

71
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,790
You seem different from the history book too.

72
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,240
That's for sure.

73
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,270
Are you alright?

74
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,510
Shit, I forget the ecstasy.

75
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,960
I won't go into your dream today,

76
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,120
have a good sleep,

77
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,390
Ye Jinan.

78
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
What is this place?
