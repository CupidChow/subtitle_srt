1
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:07,840
What happened?

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,640
I feel so hot. This tyrant, he's so charming.

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,760
He should be the evil.

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:24,879
No.

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,680
What's wrong?

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,359
Smells not right,

7
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:34,519
it's the fragrance of intercourse.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,879
Your Majesty, are you alright?

9
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,479
What are you doing?

10
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,599
Bloodletting. It can reduce the effect of the incense.

11
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,879
It's not that necessary.

12
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,319
It's not right, he is the king,

13
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,319
I'm his concubine,

14
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,599
we are legitimate husband and wife,

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,680
we should help each other in times of crisis.

16
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,800
Besides, he is the Ning An King,

17
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,439
throughout the ages,

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,000
no archaeologist can sleep with a real King,

19
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,960
I'm such a bad ass.

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,360
We,

21
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:22,960
how about we,

22
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,360
I've never heard that

23
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,800
people have a neck pain after sleeping.

24
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,839
Your Highness, you're awake.

25
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,000
Bitao, where's the King?

26
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,879
Your Majesty has left with your father
to go to the court early in the morning,

27
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,240
he specially asked me

28
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,079
to serve you well,

29
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,800
this is the letter your father left you,

30
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,199
he said that you have to read it
before you go back to the imperial palace.

31
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,639
He sent me to testify that

32
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,680
the princess and Yan Ming has an affair,

33
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,639
and he said that they will go to
catch these two after the court.

34
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,720
Catch who?

35
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,639
What's the matter with you,

36
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,120
Your Highness, what happened?

37
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,240
No, I have to report this to His Majesty.

38
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,279
Bitao, you go back to the palace.

39
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,079
Your Majesty, not only you're late for the court,

40
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,360
but you act so frivolous,

41
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,959
it's out of order.

42
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,720
I always like this,

43
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,959
you didn't know that until now?

44
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,720
My sister.

45
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,759
Your Highness, as the King's sister,

46
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,360
you talk so rude to the King,

47
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,480
I'm afraid no one will take your words seriously.

48
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,360
You give your advice everyday to the King,

49
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,959
what's wrong with me

50
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,439
giving some advice?

51
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,160
Do you dare to admit that

52
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,519
what I just said is not what's really in your mind?

53
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,639
You.

54
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,079
Enough, stop quarreling.

55
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,399
Your Highness.

56
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,600
Your excellency,

57
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,160
do you know who princess rushed to see?

58
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,079
Who?

59
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,399
Her new toyboy.

60
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,800
They said they're together every night.

61
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,120
This is,

62
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,199
Princess even has him in the palace.

63
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,800
They're about to meet now in the Ling Yu Palace.

64
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,399
This is the imperial place,

65
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,160
how can we tolerate such a thing.

66
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,000
That's ridiculous.

67
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,480
Though the princess could be domineering,

68
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,839
she will not break the royal law for just a toyboy.

69
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,360
Minister, it's not real, is it?

70
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
If you don't believe it,

71
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,480
let's all go to see.

72
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,399
Let's all go to Ling Yu Palace,

73
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,600
if it's not the truth,

74
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,920
we can make the princess a justice.

75
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,920
That's right.

76
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,639
All of you,

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,079
please.

78
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,399
Where's the princess?

79
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,639
Your Highness has ordered that,

80
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,639
she will not see the concubine.

81
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,879
Also she has left for the court,

82
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,519
if you really has something urgent,

83
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,600
you can just go the palace to see him.

84
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,319
Then where's the Mr. Yan Ming?

85
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,199
Is he in his residence?

86
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,680
Princess asked him,

87
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,560
he's already in the palace.

88
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,759
Shit,

89
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,600
whether I can change

90
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,720
the Princess's impression of me depends on this time.

91
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,159
God gives me this chance,

92
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,879
I will not miss it.

93
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,559
I'd like too.

94
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,600
We've got here in time,

95
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,159
I wonder what are you all doing here?

96
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,279
He is the famous imperial astronomer, Ling Shan.

97
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,679
Everyone said he's the No. one godlike ones,

98
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,120
he does seem quite immortal style.

99
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,480
This is where the princess lives in the palace,

100
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,919
why is Ling Shan here too?

101
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,080
Ling Shan is doing his duty,

102
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,759
comes here to watch the sky and do the divination.

103
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,320
In princess's house?

104
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:29,960
That's right.

105
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,960
But the stars appears at night,

106
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,320
now is in the day, and they closed the door.

107
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,120
When the imperial palaces were built,

108
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,159
the buildings were not like before,
which were all symmetry,

109
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,960
Ling Yu Palace corresponds to the position
of the sixth star of the Southern.

110
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,960
Since Your Highness returned victory,

111
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,519
the stars move in the track,

112
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,480
I come in here

113
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
to calculate that,

114
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:01,440
the princess has the Qi Sha star in her life fate,

115
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,360
which is actually the great blessing.

116
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,320
He's so good,
talking all the nonsense with such a dead earnest.

117
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,840
Ling Shan has the ability to tell the good fortune
and bad for great Ning,

118
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
and he never failed.

119
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,440
However, if the King didn't approve him of coming here,

120
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,919
it's really gonna get people talking.

121
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,919
What he said is all true.
