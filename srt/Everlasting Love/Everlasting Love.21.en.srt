1
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,860
How did it go? Did you get into her dream?

2
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,830
No.

3
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,750
If the dreamer's mind stronger

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,750
and colder than you, Your Majesty,

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,550
then it's harder for you to get into her dream.

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,940
The Empress Dowager is indeed a strong woman.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,110
Then what should we do?

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,420
We have to find the moment when her mind shaking.

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,220
Your Majesty, you used to act tyrannical,

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,750
in order to frighten the ministers,

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,830
their mind would be shaking

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,630
under the fear,

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,940
so that you could easily get into their dreams.

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,500
But what would the Empress Dowager scared of?

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,500
How did the master know

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,300
what the Empress Dowager afraid of?

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,390
The way to travel through time was

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,670
after all the master Wu Yu gave to my mother.

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,900
He must know something.

20
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,180
But master was a stylite who's outside of the mortal world,

21
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,900
how could he be involved in the harem stuff?

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,140
Did he know it or not, we'll find that out
once we open the tomb, won't we?

23
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,620
Don't worry, I'm an expert at this.

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,390
Where's the tomb?

25
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,950
It's right here.

26
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,070
No mound,

27
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,070
no inscription,

28
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,670
that is our tradition.

29
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,270
The day Empress Dowager was titled,

30
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,860
why did the master Wu Yu put forward a point like that?

31
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,790
And if he didn't know anything,

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,670
why did he go die on the day Empress Dowager was titled?

33
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,900
He's upset,

34
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,350
that's why he showed his slip.

35
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,860
People always brought their secrets into their tomb,

36
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,790
for them,

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,670
this is a way to keep silence,

38
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,460
however, for the afterlife,

39
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,900
this is the evidence,

40
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,230
the clue.

41
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,390
After one is dead,

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,180
his tomb will him the owner to
piece together his whole life.

43
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,830
Matser Wu Yu,

44
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,110
I am sorry.

45
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,790
Master, I can't believe he had a child.

46
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,070
So what is the meaning of,
the moment you have the love and lust in your heart,

47
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,830
is the moment you go to the deep hell.

48
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,180
Minister Ling Shan,

49
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,420
so this practicing of yours required people
to not have any feelings or emotions.

50
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,710
I've never heard you mentioned that before.

51
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,470
Did my sister know it?

52
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,230
Don't worry,

53
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,500
I've already sent my secret guards to investigate it,

54
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,740
soon it will be news.

55
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,860
Your Majesty,

56
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,500
I've taken your orders

57
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,550
and gone to the check it out in the Bi Xia Temple

58
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,550
where the Empress Dowager chanting every year,

59
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,110
according to the temple abbot,

60
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,350
Your Highness the Empress Dowager
had a baby tablet in the temple,

61
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,990
the child name is Liang Yun.

62
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,060
Liang Yun,

63
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,620
isn't that what the master Wu Yu said in his letter,

64
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,180
the child who was killed by his own mother?

65
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,940
What a shock.

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,420
A child.

67
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,550
The Empress Dowager is a smart and cautious person,

68
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,940
we can't find any chance with her clothing,
food, housing or transportation.

69
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,940
However, she copies scriptures
and chants every night before bed,

70
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,990
I've already ordered someone

71
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,420
to put some hallucinogenic incense in her ink,

72
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,620
only a few of it,

73
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,420
it will take effect when she goes to bed,

74
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,380
September is the time when all the cats starting in heat,

75
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,380
I've asked the secret guards in the department of Wu Wei
to find a lot of leopard cats,

76
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,860
they will bring those cats outside of the Yong Shou Hall.

77
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,670
The cats' screaming are just like baby's crying.

78
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,860
Servant.

79
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,790
And we'll drugged out
all the servants girl outside the door.

80
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,420
And there will be no one answering

81
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,620
when the Empress Dowager called.

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,060
Servant, where are you all?

83
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,470
Such a night,

84
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,820
it's definitely gonna break her heart's defenses.

85
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,420
Mother doesn't look so well.

86
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,150
Did you call the imperial doctor to check?

87
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,860
I'm only a little headache,

88
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,180
not a problem.

89
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,740
I'll massage your acupoints.

90
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,420
Sister, don't speak such bad luck things,

91
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,620
the two children of yours are still young,

92
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,300
they still need you to look after them.

93
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,230
It's nothing bad luck,

94
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,110
people are always gonna die eventually.

95
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,300
Feng Zhili,

96
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,260
are you crazy?

97
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,790
This is the Empress Dowager's dream,

98
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,150
if she sees your face,

99
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,620
this dream is gonna collapse.

100
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,470
You're too reckless,

101
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,180
but I've never dreamed of her,

102
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,060
never.

103
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,110
Please bring this to Xiao Li

104
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,350
when he grows up.

105
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,740
He's still too young,

106
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,590
and he's not as strong as Xiao Fan.

107
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,590
I'm afraid that he would be on the wrong path

108
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,940
after I die.

109
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,230
You're a woman,

110
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,420
Zhao Yi, it's not appropriate for you

111
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,710
to come to a minister's residence at the middle of the night.

112
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,350
We're talking about a great major
regarding to the establishment of the Crown Prince.

113
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,670
That is the duke Ye and the Empress Dowager.

114
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,620
I don't have the time to think about that anymore.

115
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,670
The establishment of the Crown Prince,

116
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,230
the emperor only has one son,

117
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,990
who's the first son of the empress.

118
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,940
There's no suspense regarding this.

119
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,550
Yes, the emperor and my sister only has one son,

120
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,710
but they still has one daughter.

121
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,670
That's ridiculous,

122
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,180
how could Yin and Yang inverse

123
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,150
or a woman usurping man's power,
how could this kind of thing exists in the world?

124
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,350
The Empress Dowager is trying to
make the princess on the throne.

125
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,260
I've talked about this with the emperor and my sister,

126
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,470
but I'm only a woman,

127
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,670
it's not right for me to meddle in politics.

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,780
We'll have to rely on

129
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,950
the major ministers in the court like you
to solve this political affairs.

130
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,470
It's just better for Shu to not have

131
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,710
this tactical mind,

132
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,780
if every woman do things like her,

133
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,900
the world is gonna be in chaos.

134
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,590
Speaking of which, the emperor and my sister are now
trying to implement a new policy

135
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,470
to organize women's rural schools,

136
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,230
I guess there will be more and more
talented and tactical women in the future.

137
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,860
Long Live the King,

138
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,380
Long Live the Empress Dowager.

139
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,190
About this time killing the tyrant Feng Zhili,

140
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,140
the minister Yang Qi made a great mark in it.

141
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,350
Reward him.

142
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,140
Thank you, Your Highness.

143
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,020
Feng Zhili,

144
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
that's a tiger talisman, a tiger talisman.

145
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,260
Who's talking in the court.

146
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,660
Who are you? Why don't you dare to
raise your head this whole time?

147
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,470
Break it.

148
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,140
Feng Zhili. You're still alive.

149
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,430
Kill him.

150
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,500
Come on,

151
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,710
kill him,

152
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,500
kill him.

153
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,470
What are you gonna do

154
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,140
next?

155
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,990
I'm going to ask her,

156
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,780
why did she do that?
