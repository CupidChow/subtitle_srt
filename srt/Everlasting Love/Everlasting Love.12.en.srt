1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,150
Your Highness, you haven't left here for three days,

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,790
what bothers you,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,280
could you tell me.

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,680
Your Majesty.

5
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,120
You have avoided me for three days,

6
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,150
what happened that makes you so upset?

7
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,310
You told me that you want to use ghee to cook goat's milk

8
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,400
add some cloud tea,

9
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,080
so I asked people to cook some,

10
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,960
you wanna try?

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,000
Milk tea.

12
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,870
And there's snowflake pastry too.

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,630
Then I guess I'm gonna try some.

14
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,520
Actually today I want to tell you that,

15
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,680
Your Majesty, urgent report.

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,470
Talk.

17
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,190
The Empress Dowager has returned to
the palace from the Bixia Temple,

18
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,120
now she's in the royal carriage

19
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,430
and almost to the Yongfu Hall.

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,240
What? The Empress Dowager?

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,870
There weren't much records of this Empress Dowager
in the history book,

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,560
now I get to see her with my own eyes.

23
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,560
The Empress Dowager has returned to the Imperial Palace.

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,190
Mother empress,

25
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,680
why didn't tell me about your return?

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,750
So that I can send people to
welcome you with the royal protocol.

27
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,360
Honor to see you, Empress Dowager.

28
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,470
My trip to the Bixia Temple this time
to recite Buddhist scriptures

29
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,470
is for the royal bloodline,

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,000
and these time I have always dreamed of dragon horn,

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,280
I feel like it must be the god bless our Da Ning,

32
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,800
and the royal son must be on the way.

33
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,360
So I rushed to return.

34
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,280
Concubine Li.

35
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,310
Yes.

36
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,270
Are you pregnant yet?

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,190
You have the King's favor for three years,
yet you have no birth,

38
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,270
you've really forgot what you should do.

39
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,720
Mother empress, you must be really tired along the way,

40
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,000
why don't you just get some rest first?

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,000
Wait for a moment,

42
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,160
this is the Scriptures of Lian Hua,

43
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,720
concubine Li,

44
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,920
giving birth to the royal son

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,270
is your responsibility,

46
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,390
you have to copy ten volumes of it these days

47
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,390
and hope for the birth of your son.

48
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,070
The Scriptures of Lian Hua,

49
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,310
that's very famous orphaned scrolls,

50
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,720
now I can copy it all I want,

51
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,750
what a great deal.

52
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,720
Thank you, empress, I'm on my way.

53
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,390
Before, she hated to

54
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,000
recite the ritual precepts,

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,480
now she's suddenly changed?

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,560
Mammy An.

57
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,750
Yes.

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,560
It must be very hard for the concubine
to copy the scriptures,

59
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,310
please you have to serve her.

60
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,310
Yes.

61
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,120
Mother, you need to have someone by your side,

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,120
I will personally supervise the concubine Li.

63
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,270
You think I don't know what you're trying to do?

64
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,630
As the emperor,

65
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,390
you shouldn't spend too much time on the harem stuff,

66
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,950
come with me.

67
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,920
The empress even sent a invigilator,

68
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
I didn't make such efforts when I wrote my thesis.

69
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,720
The emperor has arrived.

70
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,240
Honor to see you, Your Majesty.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,950
It's late,

72
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,310
why don't you go back to the empress and serve her?

73
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,190
I've taken the orders from the empress herself to stay here.

74
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,430
So do you mean you refuse to take my orders?

75
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,240
I don't dare,

76
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,000
then I shall leave now.

77
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,680
Wait.

78
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,870
The scriptures haven't finished,

79
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,950
mother won't be happy to see it,

80
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,800
I will send people to bring it to her

81
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,800
when she's done.

82
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,480
Yes.

83
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,510
I will go burn it.

84
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,190
Why do you burn it?

85
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,630
I've been written it for half a day.

86
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,190
Your writing is so much better than hers.

87
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,360
What do you plan to explain it to the empress

88
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,360
if she sees it?

89
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,190
She,

90
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,560
you.

91
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,190
Your Majesty, do you,

92
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,240
Yes, I've known it all,

93
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,950
you're not Ye Jinhui,

94
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,240
your name is Ye Jinan,

95
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
we've seen each other in the dreams more than once.

96
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,950
You're the first one who can come to the dream land with me.

97
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,920
It's actually real.

98
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,270
You really can go into the dream land.

99
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,870
You, I now know such a big secret of yours,

100
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,480
you won't kill me, will you?

101
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,000
You and I have been spent time together for long,

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,390
what kind of a person do you think I am?

103
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,270
You're not a bad person.

104
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,270
I won't hurt you

105
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,270
no matter what happened.

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,510
Do you believe that?

107
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,480
A king never lies.

108
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,000
A king never lies.

109
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,360
I just thought you're gonna ask me
some more important stuff,

110
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,630
like how do I feel about you.

111
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,360
Then how,

112
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,670
Seems that I am not

113
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,600
being obvious enough.

114
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,870
Your Highness, what's this?

115
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,510
This is a bamboo dragonfly,

116
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,440
it can fly just like that.

117
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,440
Try it.

118
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,480
Yes,

119
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,510
that's what I'm talking about.

120
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,510
Come and greet to concubine Li.

122
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,790
Who are they?

123
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,870
Your Highness, you don't remember it?

124
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,750
You were so angry

125
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,510
at the Consort Selection Ceremony three month ago,

126
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,600
thus His Majesty

127
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,360
postphone it,

128
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,390
all the girls are now still living
in the Tingfang Court.

129
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,720
Consort Selection?

130
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,480
Girls?

131
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,360
What? He's gonna choosing new consorts?

132
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,200
Your Majesty.

133
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,750
What's all these you are trying?

134
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,080
It's Bamboo dragonfly.

135
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,000
Bamboo dragonfly.

136
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,390
You're not happy about it?

137
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,960
No.

138
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,080
I just made one of it,

139
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,870
give it back.

140
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,600
I'll trade you with this.

141
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,750
Yi Lin Tang Book.

142
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,240
Will you trade with me?

143
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,030
Yes. Let's trade.

144
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,600
Is this really fair?

145
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,200
No, I need to think it again.

146
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,510
I'll make you another one.

147
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,910
No, ten,

148
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,790
hundreds.

149
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,390
Your Majesty, you're wise and you're brave,

150
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,510
you will forgive me, right?

151
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,120
Trade with me,

152
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,080
trade with me.

153
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,870
Then forget about it.

154
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,150
Then I'll give you hundreds.

155
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,870
Hundreds, well, I'll think about it.

156
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,390
Come on, trade with me. Your Majesty,

157
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,670
give it to me.

158
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,240
I'll give you if you can reach it.

159
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,910
Give it to me,

160
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,840
you said you will give it to me.

161
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,790
Give me hundreds of it.

162
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,390
If you can reach it.

163
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
I can't.

164
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Give it.

165
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,750
Then that's not my fault.

166
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,600
Alright.

167
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,720
Give it to me, give it.

168
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,550
What's this?

169
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,840
It's a heart.

170
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,030
Heart?

171
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,960
In my hometown,

172
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,360
people can see the shape of a heart using tools,

173
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,790
and this is the shape of a heart.

174
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Why do you make it?

175
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,120
Because what people think,

176
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
is what his heart wants.

177
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,270
The most important organ of a person is his heart,

178
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,270
we can't live without it.

179
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,240
I,

180
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,150
I didn't mean anything by it,

181
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,510
I carved it

182
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,510
because it was easy.

183
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
You can take it

184
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,670
if you like.

185
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,750
Yes I like it.

186
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,510
From this side,

187
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,480
