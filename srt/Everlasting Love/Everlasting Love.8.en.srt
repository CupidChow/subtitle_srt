1
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,430
I can't believe Ning already has this kind of craft,

2
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,590
so bad it seems to have failed to pass on.

3
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,360
Bring it back.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Your Highness,

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,710
there's a letter for you from the royal father in law.

6
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,400
A family feast?

7
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,520
So I didn't expose myself last time
fought with him in the court.

8
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,280
But he asked to invite Feng Zhili

9
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,310
to come home with me this time,

10
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,960
why did he do that? What did he want to do?

11
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,680
The history records said that
Ye Tingjun was a loyal person,

12
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,910
a veteran of three dynasties,

13
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,310
so it should be the right thing to do to get along with him.

14
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,750
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,470
What are you thinking?

16
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,240
Your Majesty, lately,

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,910
I've been really missed my home,
and my dad specially set up a family feast,

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,590
I'd like to ask that if you're willing to come with me.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,150
She's not Ye Jinhui.

20
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,240
So if Ye Tingjun found out that
something is not right with me,

21
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,840
there might be dangerous.

22
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,800
My love,

23
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,240
of course I'm willing to come with you.

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,750
Thank you, Your Majesty.

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,310
I'd like to see

26
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,280
what is this Ye Tingjun trying to do.

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,030
I'll go to the Ye's residence tomorrow,

28
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,710
go tell Wu Weisi to come with me in secret.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,960
Yes.

30
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,120
Dad.

31
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,560
Your Highness is the noble concubine,

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,710
I'm afraid you've been long looking down on me.

33
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,280
I know I've been making mistakes.

34
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,470
Yes you've been making mistakes,

35
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,190
but that doesn't refer to you've been ungrateful

36
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,430
and fought with me,

37
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,680
but you've long forgot what you should do.

38
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,630
What I should do? What's that?

39
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,160
How did I teach you?

40
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,800
A woman should have respects for her husband
and be good to her son.

41
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,310
It's been three years,

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
you have the emperor's love
and has been taking the tonic medicines,

43
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,750
why,

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,360
why aren't you pregnant yet?

45
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,750
What?

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,680
Do you even know the great responsibility
on your shoulder?

47
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,560
If you don't pass on the royal bloodline

48
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,720
and the emperor do not have his heir,

49
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,040
how do we protect the Ning dynasty
for thousands of generations?

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,270
I'm really disappointed that

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,720
you haven't got the emperor's child yet.

52
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,750
It's already been three years?

53
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,950
Then maybe there's something wrong with the Ning An King.

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,040
Drink this.

55
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,750
What is this?

56
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,560
I've been added ten more herbs,

57
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,360
and I've had the date calculated,

58
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,630
today is during your ovulatory period,

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,190
it's the best time

60
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,950
to get pregnant.

61
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,720
It's too hot.

62
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,950
I'll drink this later.

63
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,870
Drink it now while it's still hot.

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,430
I'll go see the emperor with you when you're done.

65
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,240
Come on,

66
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,870
drink this.

67
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,950
Drink.

68
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,270
Don't worry, Jinhui,

69
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,120
you're gonna get pregnant with the King's child this time.

70
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,800
Come on, let's go see the emperor together.

71
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,560
What the hell?

72
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,120
He even had the date calculated,

73
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,040
he's indeed old-fashioned and scientific.

74
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,510
Yellow essence oxtail,

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
stewed turtle,

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,560
eucommia pig's waist.

77
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,750
This is so obvious,

78
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,750
his nose is gonna be bleeds.

79
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,120
Now it's summer,

80
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,750
aren't these too greasy?

81
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,430
Your Majesty,

82
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,920
you've been working so hard and worrying too much,

83
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,800
you should get some nourished food.

84
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,600
Since today is the family feast,

85
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
as the royal father in law,

86
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,870
may I make some advice that,

87
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,070
as the King,

88
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,390
you should have your heir

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,720
so as to last this great Kingdom.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,920
Today is a good day,

91
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,870
Your Majesty,
would you be so kind as to share a drink with me today?

92
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,360
I can't believe you really gonna drink this.

93
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,360
I'm gonna be dead tonight.

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,040
Your,

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,630
Your Majesty,

96
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,120
you haven't eaten anything,

97
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,480
drink wine will do harm to your body.

98
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,950
This is the family feast set up by me,

99
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,360
Your Highness, you're not on my invitation list,

100
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
I'm afraid this is rude for you

101
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,190
to just walking in here with blades in your hands.

102
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,120
Family feast?

103
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,920
It's not right for a noble King

104
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,750
to come to a minister's residence.

105
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,040
Not to mention you don't even
bring your followers to come with you,

106
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,360
what you're doing is just like child's playing.

107
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,160
You broke into my father in law's house

108
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,070
and talk rudely to me,

109
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,870
you act so rashly, not like a royal,

110
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,920
that is called a child's playing.

111
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,240
Ye Jinhui, good play, you,

112
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,430
making him so decrepit and muddleheaded.

113
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,390
Feng Zhili, I suggest you'd better not to drink this.

114
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Your Highness,

115
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,310
how dare you just call a King's name like that,

116
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,390
just because of this,

117
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,510
I can call you a treason.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,750
Enough.

119
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,270
Since this is

120
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,600
a family feast,

121
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,870
and the princess is King's older sister,

122
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,120
why don't you just join us?

123
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,720
Or,

124
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,080
how about I drink this for the King,

125
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,360
so the princess won't suspect us.

126
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,870
This ends here now.

127
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,720
Good,

128
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,150
that's great, so it's my fault again.

129
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,750
Oh shit, she now really hates me.

130
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,790
Now with the military honor,

131
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,000
she's even more recklessly and arrogantly,

132
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,960
we can't let her just do that.

133
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,510
Your Majesty,

134
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,120
it's all my fault,

135
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,790
and, and,

136
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,480
What?

137
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,960
A great day

138
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,000
with such a great feast,

139
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,240
what happened?

140
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,670
Sorry, I over think it.

141
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,320
Nothing happened.

142
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,120
Sit down.

143
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

144
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,720
Your Majesty, please.

145
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,120
If you can't drink, don't drink.

146
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,670
So heavy, my god.

147
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,550
Your, Your Majesty, you're awake.

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,030
You're so drunk,

149
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,960
it's exhausted for me to bring you back here.

150
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,670
I just put on a show,

151
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,720
if today I don't stay here,

152
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,750
I'm afraid my father in law would not be so happy.

153
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,960
So you know it all?

154
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,670
He asked me to come to this family feast through you,

155
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,480
if anything bad happened,

156
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,120
you would really be an evil concubine

157
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,150
that make the King decrepit and muddleheaded.

158
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,320
Your Majesty, you don't have to show up here.

159
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,080
You invited me,

160
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
how can I not show up?
