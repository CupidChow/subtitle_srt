1
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,310
It's,

2
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,350
it's a man.

3
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,590
Why is he wearing a dress?

4
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,840
That's my dress.

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,430
He sounds so familiar.

6
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,630
Isn't he that imperial censor,

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,800
what is his name?

8
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,240
I give my advice to His Majesty,

9
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,750
to depose the evil concubine

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,960
and make the royal matters right.

11
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,240
So beautiful.

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,960
How did you come in here?

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,430
Don't look at me,

14
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,750
don't look at me,

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,590
don't look at me.

16
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,840
What are you doing still standing there,

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,750
run,

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,430
come on.

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,960
Why am I so tired,

20
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,400
isn't this a dream?

21
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,000
Feng Zhili,

22
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,360
stop running. Feng Zhili,

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,910
Feng Zhili,

24
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,960
Feng Zhili.

25
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,080
This might be my dream,

26
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,960
I call the shot in my dream.

27
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,120
Look at me.

28
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,680
Fire.

29
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,870
Sorry, my mistake.

30
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,590
Wind.

31
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Be careful.

32
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,190
You,

33
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,400
are you crazy?

34
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,960
How does it so hurt in dream?

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Don't sleep.

36
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,950
Thank god it's only a dream,

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,430
it's only a dream.

38
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,870
Why am I in the Feng Qi Palace?

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,830
Didn't last night?

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,870
Could it be I've been too stressful these days

41
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,270
that I had this kind of dreams?

42
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,360
And why did I always dream of Feng Zhili.

43
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,950
It's off.

44
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,430
Clear your mind,

45
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,950
he is a tyrant,

46
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,120
you can't be flipped by him

47
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,870
just because he's a little bit cute
and and have a tragic history.

48
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,950
Lovesick is gonna get people killed.

49
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,430
No.

50
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,750
On the other hand,

51
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,830
he is indeed quite charming,

52
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,120
no wonder Ye loved him so much.

53
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,750
But the one he likes is Ye Jinhui,

54
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,630
which nothing to do with me.

55
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,430
The most important thing is to keep me alive,

56
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,800
yes, keep me alive.

57
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,750
Something happened last night,

58
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,120
I haven't got the time to look into Qian Xin,

59
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,630
and I broke the dream.

60
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,240
And she showed up last night in Qian Xin's dream.

61
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,160
But from her reaction,

62
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,190
she seemed didn't know that was Qian Xin's dream.

63
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,510
She thought that was her dream.

64
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,560
Your Majesty,

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
the dream world is as real as the reality,

66
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,920
once you get injured,

67
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,750
the danger could be great.

68
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,430
If the concubine can be in the dream with you,

69
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,750
you should be even more careful,

70
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,000
in case of any changes.

71
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,800
She's not an evil person.

72
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,480
Wind.

73
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,430
Be careful.

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Every tool and every collection here

75
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,630
is made by her with her heart and soul,

76
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,600
doing what she likes,

77
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,430
I don't think she would feel lonely.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,750
Ling Shan,

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,920
do you think there's one person in the wide world

80
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,920
that you've never seen her before,

81
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,240
but once you met,

82
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,560
you feel like she's never left you.

83
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,000
Your Majesty, do you know

84
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,600
the reason why you two could be in the same dream?

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,510
What did you do last night when you were together?

86
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,430
It's off.

87
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,480
What could I do?

88
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,270
Don't think about it,

89
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,920
I will go test her myself.

90
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,270
It's almost done.

91
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,270
What are you doing?

92
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,510
Thank you.

93
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,270
I'd like to see if you can be
in the same dream with me tonight again.

94
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,270
Why didn't I see her in the dream?

95
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,200
Or is she still awake?

96
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,480
It's not because of her earrings?

97
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,320
I'll try again tomorrow.

98
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,320
Look at this.

99
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,750
It's for me?

100
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,630
Isn't this the clay figure from that day?

101
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,270
Yes.

102
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,510
Give it back.

103
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,750
What's wrong with him? Is he crazy?

104
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,630
So it's not the clay figure either.

105
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,750
She sleeps so well,

106
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,480
but she's not in the same dream with me again.

107
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,870
Maybe because of this?

108
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,240
Go to sleep.

109
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,750
What the hell?
