1
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,540
You all need to be alert tonight, do not sleep.

2
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,780
Yes.

3
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,220
Alert.

4
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,340
Why?

5
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,730
Why is everything like this?

6
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,820
Everything seems to have changed,

7
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,220
yet everything seems to have not changed at all.

8
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,170
We,

9
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,290
so we really couldn't change

10
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,570
the ending of it?

11
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,340
The emperor is tyrannical,

12
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,340
he killed the good ministers like crazy,

13
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,700
we've all taken orders from the Empress Dowager herself
to crusade against the tyrant.

14
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,850
Yang Qi the traitor, you work for the emperor,

15
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,930
yet you rebel him and are trying to plot a revolt.

16
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,370
We've accepted the orders from the heaven
to kill the traitor.

17
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,540
Your Highness,

18
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,580
Your Highness,

19
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,140
it's me.

20
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,540
Qian Xin, what are you doing back here?

21
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,250
I am back here to report my work to His Majesty,

22
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,540
on the way back here

23
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,370
I've heard that at your birthday feast, you've been,

24
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,780
now I see you're all fine and safe,

25
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,930
I feel relieved.

26
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,540
it's so good I came here

27
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,930
if I'm able to save your life.

28
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,170
There's a big change in the imperial palace today,

29
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,490
you need to find a place to hide,

30
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,050
if me and His Majesty can turn calamities into blessings,

31
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,490
then we'll be able to catch up some other time.

32
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,460
Your Highness,

33
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,730
are you going into the imperial palace?

34
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,250
I can go with you.

35
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,050
I am what I am today, all thank to you and His Majesty,

36
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,540
now that you two are in trouble,

37
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,250
I can't just stand there and watch.

38
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,730
You are what you are today?

39
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,100
What do you mean by that?

40
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,050
I mean lychee, Your Highness.

41
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,540
I've really planted the lychee big like a man's fist.

42
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,250
I've been in the capital for so many years,

43
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,220
yet I have had no contribution.

44
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,050
All thanks to your words,

45
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,610
now everyone in Weizhou

46
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,810
calls me the Lychee King.

47
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,410
The historical records indeed said that
there's one man who's very good at planting lychee,

48
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,220
but that man is named Qian Xiaomiao.

49
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,900
Your Highness, you really are just like god,

50
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,930
when I arrived at Weizhou,

51
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,250
there's a fortune-teller that I met,

52
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,410
he told a fortune for me,

53
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,930
he said that I lacked the element water in my life fate,

54
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,660
Weizhou is the best place for me to come,

55
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,220
and he told me that I should change my name,

56
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,540
to change the element metal into water,

57
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,540
and now my name is Qian Xiaomiao
(In Chiness, "Miao" means water).

58
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,780
So that is to say,

59
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,050
the history books that I read in later ages

60
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,100
was because something I said randomly in this era.

61
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,580
So I am back here is destined,

62
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,140
I am not back in history,

63
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,050
but

64
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,540
I've been in this chaos river of history this whole time,

65
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,810
yes,

66
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,100
yes,

67
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,810
yes,

68
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,810
that's right,

69
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,980
that's got to be it,

70
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,340
that's why I didn't die on my birthday fest,

71
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,700
and today may not be the death day of Feng Zhili.

72
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,930
Yes, everything is still not too late,

73
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,730
thanks, Qian Xin,

74
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,340
no, Qian Xiaomiao.

75
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,610
Your Highness, Your Highness.

76
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,370
Your Highness, Feng Xi Palace is on fire.

77
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,700
No, go get the department of Wu wei to come.

78
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,980
Feng Zhili,

79
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,370
wake up,

80
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,460
Feng Zhili,

81
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,930
I'm coming to get you out of here.

82
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,930
Help,

83
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,540
somebody help us,

84
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,900
Feng Zhili,

85
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,290
Feng Zhili,

86
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,610
Feng Zhili, we're gonna die

87
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,850
if you keep sleeping like this.

88
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,530
Sleep,

89
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,060
he's sleeping.

90
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,530
Everything is going to be okay,

91
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,820
you'll have peace of mind

92
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,060
after tomorrow.

93
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,820
He should be in a dream right now,

94
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,490
I can go into his dream and wake him up,

95
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,580
that's right.

96
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,850
Sleep,

97
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,180
go to sleep,

98
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,890
go to sleep,

99
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,130
come on, sleep.

100
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,940
Though it's still warm,

101
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,580
you can't take a nap lying here.

102
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,610
Mother.

103
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,890
What are you waiting for?

104
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,940
Get up.

105
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,940
Or your sister is gonna lecture you again.

106
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,650
Had a nightmare?

107
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,220
It's alright,

108
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,730
everything is over now.

109
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,940
Nightmare,

110
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,130
yes,

111
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,700
I just had a nightmare,

112
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,490
mother,

113
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,460
I dreamed that you died,

114
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,940
so many people died.

115
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,980
I've said,

116
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:23,980
it's only a dream.

117
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,220
It's all over now.

118
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,980
You've woken up.

119
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,100
That's right,

120
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,940
I wake up now.

121
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,730
Come on, get up.

122
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,890
I've cooked something delicious for you,

123
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,820
let's go, Xiaoli.

124
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,820
I've boiled this chicken soup for a really time, have a taste.

125
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,370
Thank you, mother.

126
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,700
It smells so good,

127
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,060
it's definitely not cooked by the imperial kitchen,

128
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,850
it has to be cooked by mother.

129
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,300
I made you your favorite, gummed chicken soup,

130
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,940
you've been worked so hard lately,

131
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,340
you need to take good care of your body.

132
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,370
I'm already hungry,

133
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,300
thank you, mother.

134
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,980
What are you still waiting for?

135
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,300
Still dreaming?

136
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,420
Come on, eat.

137
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,060
Eat,

138
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,370
so I've just had a really long nightmare,

139
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,940
mother, have some too.

140
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,130
Where's Jinan?

141
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,300
Feng Zhili,

142
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,580
Feng Zhili,

143
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,130
I'm coming to get you out of here.

144
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,580
Jinan.

145
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,100
Teacher.
