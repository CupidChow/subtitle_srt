1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,230
So it seems that

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,870
the Ning An King's tyranny may have something to do

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,310
with the death of their birth mother?

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,590
Maybe this is the key of saving my life.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,230
Why do I get sleepy

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,590
every time he drag me to the court?

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,590
It's no difference with going to work every day.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,120
I can at least slack off at work,

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,680
but there are so many people staring in the court,
I can't even do that here.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,680
Your excellency Qian.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,640
Yes.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,120
You hand me a report said that
you want me to depose my concubine,

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,350
in order to make the royal matters right,

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,240
now I give you a chance,

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,750
are you willing to take back what you said

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,680
in front of the concubine Li?

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,190
I am not,

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,710
please depose the concubine

19
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,120
and make things right.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,910
My concubine.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,310
Your Majesty.

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,190
You smell so good today, what do you use?

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,470
Your Majesty.

24
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,800
Your excellency Qian.

25
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,240
Your Majesty,

26
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,430
do you still remember what the late emperor said?

27
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,590
If you keep bewitching by the evil,

28
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,520
you will get the punishment of our ancestors.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,400
Please think again.

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,960
Now I know why he drag me to the court,

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,870
he wants to kill him, so he uses me as the backstabber.

32
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,120
Shut your mouth,

33
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,360
if the late emperor is still here,

34
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,000
he should kill you,

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,470
the brainless big mouth first.

36
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,840
This is the court,

37
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,310
you call me an evil,

38
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,910
and even dare to teach the King how to rule his kingdom.

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,750
Your excellency,

40
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,630
if you keep behaving like this,

41
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,910
you're gonna get yourself killed.

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,310
Trying to sabotage my plan? Interesting.

43
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,870
You evil.

44
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,390
Say one more word, you're gonna die.

45
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,950
Your excellency is so brave,

46
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,360
even your blood is a lot more red than the others.

47
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,950
My love, do you like lychee?

48
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,950
See, if your excellency's head got blood,

49
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,950
doesn't that look just like a lychee?

50
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,950
How is my archery?

51
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,390
Your Majesty

52
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,630
is brilliant at it.

53
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,160
Come on, my love,

54
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,430
have a taste,

55
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,870
is it sweet?

56
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,360
Come on,

57
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,870
try it yourself.

58
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,830
Peel off it.

59
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,510
What? Don't you love lychee the most?

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,630
I don't feel like

61
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,000
eating it today.

62
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,830
I am standing up for you,

63
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,630
don't you like that?

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,390
My love,

65
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,630
you should be careful while peeling it,

66
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,630
or your excellency Qian's head is gonna off.

67
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,560
No.

68
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,600
Ye Jinhui, what are you trying to do now?

69
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,920
Qian Xin is such a good literati,

70
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,950
Your Majesty, you humiliated him like that
for the concubine,

71
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,560
aren't you afraid all the officials will blame you for it?

72
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,240
They love to blame me, right?

73
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,070
Then I should give them a more reason to do it.

74
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,430
You're really gonna kill him?

75
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,270
He offended my concubine,

76
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,070
she will be sad if I don't do it.

77
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,510
What? What's it got to do with me?

78
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,190
I'm not sad.

79
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,950
You can let him go.

80
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,000
You want to save him?

81
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,510
I come up with a better idea to punish him.

82
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,480
So tell me.

83
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,920
I think today's lychee

84
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,950
are all too small,

85
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,120
I want it big like my fist.

86
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,150
Why don't you send him to Weinan to find it?

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,870
You.

88
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,870
An hopeless aim

89
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,550
with day and night of hard work,

90
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,390
that's the biggest punishment.

91
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,790
Your Majesty, you said you will listen to me.

92
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,550
So do it.

93
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,790
Why is it that the harder I try, the more heartbroken I get?
I have to do it all over again.

94
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,120
Your Majesty, you put on a show today
in the royal garden to scared Qian Xin,

95
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,870
in order to break through her defenses,

96
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,120
so you could get into her dream, right?

97
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,750
You sure know everything.

98
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,320
Though my mother's case is long ago,

99
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,550
I can get into her dream to find out the truth,

100
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,240
the clues are few,

101
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,150
Qian Xin got into the case because of his duty,

102
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,360
I touched his head a few days ago,

103
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,000
but I didn't get into his dream.

104
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,120
The dream land guarded by people's mind and thought,

105
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,360
the stronger a person's mind is,

106
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,600
the harder to get into his dream,

107
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,270
and the harder to break through.

108
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
You're gonna get gain tonight.

109
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,550
I should get even more today,

110
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,550
this concubine of mine, though she might acts exaggerate,

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,440
but I can see clearly that

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,960
she does want to save Qian Xin,

113
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,240
Qian Xin and the royal father in law Ye never gets along,

114
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,960
so it seems that she's not from Ye,

115
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,510
and she's not a treacherous person.

116
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,480
It's time,

117
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,510
I shall leave now.

118
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,790
This is Feng Zhili,

119
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,630
this is the princess,

120
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,960
and this is the late empress, who died mysteriously.

121
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,600
Because of her death,

122
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,390
he got tyrannical,

123
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,750
and then he and she broke up,

124
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,240
so all in all, it's all because of her,

125
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,870
what the hell happened?

126
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,440
If I can find out why Feng Zhili got so tyrannical,

127
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,270
then the princess can't kill me.

128
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,480
And I can get rid off the name evil.

129
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,440
Nothing ventured,

130
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,120
nothing gained.
