1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,150
Bitao, get me a set of civilian clothes,

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,200
I'm going out of the palace.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,120
Your Highness, where are you going?

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,510
I should report this to the emperor.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,230
What? I don't even have the right to go out of the palace?

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,350
No, I don't mean that,

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,000
please let me to get you ready.

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,590
It is said that"is medicine 3 minutes poisonous".

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,710
I'd better not to drink this.

10
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,240
The Ning Dynasty is really very open,

11
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,870
I guess this is the"The night of the song and dance"

12
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,680
in the historical records.

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,960
Mr. Yan is so brilliant.

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,590
Mr. Yan is really handsome and talent,

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,240
I'm falling in love with you.

16
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,030
Me too.

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
I'm so happy, I'm really happy.

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,630
That's right,

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
history said that Yan family fell down,

20
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,590
and Mr. Yan in the end made a living as a performer.

21
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,120
The older sister return to the imperial and saved him,

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,590
to pay his gratitude,

23
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,150
Yan Ming helped her
to become the prime minister of the imperial.

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,150
Mr.Yan, stop being so shy,

25
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,470
you've already become a performer in here,

26
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,960
so don't play so noble of yourself,

27
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,590
am I right?

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,680
I'll give you thirty taels,

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,190
that's enough for you to spend one night with me.

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,150
Whether I can leave a good impression
in front of the princess,

31
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,520
that's all depend on you.

32
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,150
I'll go hundreds taels.

33
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,030
Who the hell are you?

34
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,360
Do you even know who I am?

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,960
How dare to fight with me?

36
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,960
One hundred and fifty taels.

37
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,630
I'll go two hundred taels.

38
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,750
I'll pay two hundred and fifty.

39
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,750
Is he really worth that much?

40
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,270
That's so funny.

41
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,950
Don't be stupid.

42
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,120
You're pride and ambitious,

43
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,750
you couldn't stand this?

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Let me go.

45
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,950
Mr, you hide a weapon,

46
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,800
ready to fight for yourself,

47
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,560
you would really rather to die like this,

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,000
than just hold back for a little while
and prepare for yourself?

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,560
I,

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,190
I'll thousands taels,

51
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,800
Mr. Yan, please go with me.

52
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,800
Long live with the princes.

53
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,310
Done.

54
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,390
Your Highness

55
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,360
loves the talent,

56
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,390
now you've got her favor,

57
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,430
you're gonna get lucky.

58
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,750
Give this to your boss,

59
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,510
someone will pick you up to the red armor camp later.

60
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,870
You, come with me.

61
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,120
That scared me.

62
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,560
Ye, as the senior concubine of the court,

63
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,600
you dare to come to a place like this,

64
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,070
don't you afraid that I report this to the emperor

65
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,120
to cure you of the crime of unchastity?

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,750
There is lotus even in the sludge,

67
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,920
comes to this place

68
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,240
doesn't mean I am a dissolute woman.

69
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,870
I have no idea

70
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,750
concubine Ye is such a good talker.

71
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,630
The emperor's reign at an early age,

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,750
though he's not amazing at strategy,

73
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,630
he's not stupid either,

74
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,240
until he got provoked by a traitor,

75
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,070
he sent me out of the capital,

76
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,750
married you.

77
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,070
Rumor has it that the concubine Li is
magnificent beautiful,

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,870
spoiled and stubborn,

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,430
always confused the emperor with her words.

80
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
As you can see,

81
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,120
am I really that kind of person?

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,070
From what I see,

83
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,160
it's not the truth.

84
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,920
Your Highness,

85
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,920
you're really wise

86
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,870
and ambitious,

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,630
no wonder you're the future emperor of Da Ning.

88
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,560
I guessed right,

89
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,310
you are not what the rumors say,

90
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,000
who's an empty skin waste,

91
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,560
you,

92
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,870
you're scheming and shrewdness,

93
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,270
you have a pretty face and a liar.

94
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,120
Today,

95
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I'll break the love and get rid off you the big disaster

96
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,190
for my stupid little brother,

97
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,480
what do you think?

98
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,630
Are you alright?

99
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,360
Princess, you've crossed the line.

100
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,070
She has bad intentions,

101
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,560
stirring up trouble

102
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,600
and shaking the royal power,

103
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,310
today,

104
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,750
even take my own life,

105
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,920
I will kill her,

106
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,750
it's worth it as long as it gets you to come to your senses.

107
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,790
This ends here now.

108
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,550
What if I insist killing her today?

109
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,150
Being extreme leads to die,

110
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,720
don't you understand?

111
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,550
If you keep doing this,

112
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,750
you might as well kill me too.

113
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Are you lost your mind?

114
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,320
Do you really like her that much?

115
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,960
What on earth has she done to you?

116
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,720
Feng Zhili, you're really gonna spoiled her

117
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,870
and make more mistakes?

118
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,630
Do you even remember what did our mother said to us

119
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,960
before she dies?

120
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,030
Mother, before she dies?

121
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,910
So the dowager empress is not their biological mother?

122
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,200
But the history books did not mention a word about this.

123
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
Of course not,

124
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,910
I do remember everything mother said,

125
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,000
but what I've done is the right thing.

126
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,000
Your Majesty, why don't you get me a royal doctor to do it?

127
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,200
What? You don't want me

128
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,320
to help you?

129
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,120
Of course I like it,

130
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,670
you don't get a doctor because
you don't want to let anyone to know it.

131
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,750
Why do I always feel that the relationship between
Ning An King and the princess

132
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,670
is not like what the history book said that intense.

133
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,550
I,

134
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,750
I went to the Luo Yun Fang today,
because I've got the news that

135
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
the princess will be there today,

136
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,750
she has a misunderstanding with you today in the court,

137
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,200
so I want to

138
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,240
go there to explain myself.

139
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,750
Everyone in the court knows that
I don't get along with the princess,

140
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,670
she has the military power

141
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,960
and look down upon me,

142
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,030
she even threaten to kill you,

143
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,200
why do you still go to her?

144
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,120
I, I just feel that the princess

145
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,790
is a noble and integrity person,

146
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,360
she doesn't mean to offend you.

147
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,670
Today, if I didn't arrive on time,

148
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,670
you're gonna be dead.

149
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,550
Yet you still speak for her.

150
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,150
I'm only telling you the truth,

151
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,870
besides, you came to rescue me, didn't you?

152
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,720
Of course I will protect you.

153
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,270
So I guessed right.

154
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,200
My love, you've got hurt today,

155
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,320
you should get some rest,

156
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,270
I shall leave now.

157
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,030
Have a safe trip.

158
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
So it seems that,

159
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,030
the Ning An KJing's tyranny

160
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,630
may have something to do with the death of his birth mother.
