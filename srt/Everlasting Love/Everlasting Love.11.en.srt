1
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,350
What is this place?

2
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,680
Why am I dreaming again?

3
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,120
Come on, sis, let's have a drink.

4
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,520
How do these people look exactly the same?

5
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't even know her,

6
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,240
why am I dreaming of her?

7
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,000
And that's a lot of her.

8
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm really sorry.

9
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,080
He, he's not the same.

10
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,000
Darling.

11
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,560
Alan.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,750
We haven't seen each other for a long time,

13
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,240
I really miss you.

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
It's been really busy in the department of royal clothing.

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,520
The department of royal clothing.
She's a mammy in the imperial palace.

16
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,680
I come to see you once I got the time, don't I?

17
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,870
Alright,

18
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,870
that's very kind of you.

19
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,750
Come on,

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,960
let's have a drink.

21
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,910
The twilight love of a mammy.

22
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,080
Who's that guy?

23
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,870
This is good wine. It's,

24
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,280
it's osmanthus brew,

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,150
the empress's favorite.

26
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,120
How does this sound so much like Feng Zhili?

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,800
But on one ever thought that

28
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,190
at the mid-autumn palace banquet,

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,910
the empress drunk a cup of it,

30
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,750
and she's dead of poison.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,870
Darling, about this.

32
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,240
Don't worry,

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,630
master said that,

34
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,120
the poison was from eastern suburb of Wujiang,

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,280
even the best royal doctor couldn't do anything about it,

36
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,000
it's also an epidemic.

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,750
The late empress,

38
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,630
Feng Zhili's birth mother was poisoned to death.

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,310
How do you know the empress was poisoned?

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,910
Who are you?

41
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,870
Soldier.

42
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,910
You really came.

43
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,710
Soldier,

44
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,190
come on,

45
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,870
soldier.

46
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,480
Why are you running?

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
Are you Feng Zhili?

48
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,070
Who the hell are you?

49
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,510
Feng Zhili.

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,360
Come on, catch them.

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,190
Yes.

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,830
He saw me. We have to get out of here.

53
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,190
Why did I dream of him again?

54
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,800
Your Highness, you're awake.

55
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,000
The Mammy Song Lan of the department of royal clothing

56
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,270
comes to bring you new clothes.

57
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,270
Honor to see you, Your Highness.

58
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,920
The department of royal clothing.

59
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,800
So I didn't dream yesterday,

60
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,160
but broke into some others' dream?

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,920
And I met Feng Zhili in there.

62
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,270
But it's that even possible?

63
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,560
It's such a pity for mammy Song Lan.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,390
I've heard that morning in the court,

65
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,830
the emperor ordered her to get marry.

66
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,600
It's such a humiliation.

67
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,360
She's the most serious and self-restraint one.

68
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,510
She's already fifty, and now she's going to,

69
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,720
no wonder she looked unhappy just now.

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,600
Marry?

71
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,120
Who's gonna get married,

72
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,480
Is there a "Ai" in his name?

73
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,040
How do you know that, Your Highness,

74
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,600
you and the emperor are really know each other well.

75
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,430
It's the Secretary Wang Ailun from the Ministry of Rites.

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,750
I've heard that your excellency Wang has already fifty

77
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,800
and he hasn't married,

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,430
he's a really lascivious man,

79
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,830
he's so vigorous.

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,750
He's gonna be damned.

81
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,390
He really knows.

82
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,430
What does he know?

83
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,830
Are you alright? Your Highness.

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,870
The emperor has arrived.

85
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,870
Why don't you get some more sleep?

86
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,830
What are you thinking?

87
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm thinking of Qian Xin.

88
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,600
Qian Xin,

89
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,160
why did you think of him?

90
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,270
I just think he's some kind of good looking.

91
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,070
Your Majesty, do you think

92
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,270
he's a little bit pretty?

93
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,510
He knows it sure enough.

94
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,160
Have you had breakfast?

95
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,070
You want to join me?

96
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,190
Your Majesty, I'm a little tired,

97
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,680
I want to get some more sleep.

98
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,720
Qian Xin,

99
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,040
did she guess it?

100
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,190
Ye Jinan,

101
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,240
are you a fool?

102
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,240
You're just guessing that now?

103
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,270
You came,

104
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,390
you really came.

105
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,510
He has long known that I could get into the dream land,

106
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,480
so he's been testing me.

107
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,390
But why we could get into the same dream?

108
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,160
It's the super normal ability that
I have from traveling through time,

109
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,920
or the Ning An King has this kind of ability.

110
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,120
What is your name?

111
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,160
I'm Ye Jinan.

112
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,510
What, how could you ask me
this question in times like this.

113
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,160
Feng Zhili,

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,070
so you have long known that I am not Ye Jinhui,

115
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,120
then why did you act like you don't know it

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,390
and keep acting with me?

117
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,030
Your Highness,

118
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,550
Your Highness, why are you sitting on the ground?

119
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,870
What happened?

120
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,670
You look spaced out.

121
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,910
Bitao,

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,750
do you see any different how the emperor treats me?

123
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,630
So that's what you're worried about.

124
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,000
Your Highness, I've been served you for a really long time,

125
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,870
I know you the best.

126
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,270
The emperor has been treating you

127
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,600
very different recently.

128
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,870
Tell me more.

129
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,030
Take the reward for it,

130
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,440
before, His Majesty has rewarded you so often,

131
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,320
but only the clothes, jewellery,

132
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,910
foreign tributes, though others envy you for it,

133
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,240
these didn't really take much efforts,

134
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,240
while now, His Majesty rarely reward you golden stuff,

135
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,360
but some really

136
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,510
bizarre little things.

137
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,150
Last time I saw it with my own eyes that

138
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,630
His Majesty asked the eunuch Ji for his snuff bottle,

139
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,200
and he put that on the steps in front of our hall secretly.

140
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,120
Who put it here?

141
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,320
What a transparent color,

142
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,270
it looks so valuable.

143
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,720
And there's even more,

144
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,000
Your Highness, you like barefoot on the ground,

145
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,550
but it's cold at night,

146
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,870
So His Majesty ordered people

147
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,790
to cover the hall with fox velvet carpets.

148
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,080
A few days before, you said that

149
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,550
the clothes before though expensive,

150
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,630
but not very comfortable to wear,

151
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,200
these days the new clothes sent by
the department of royal clothing

152
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,720
have been changed to a lighter style.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So recently,

154
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,440
His Majesty has been

155
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,480
really taken your words seriously

156
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,200
and even more love you.

157
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,390
Really?

158
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,550
Is that so?

159
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,480
You invited me,

160
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,600
how can I not show up?

161
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,270
Feng Zhili, you pretend to not know it,

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,200
is it because there's something else you want from me,

163
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,440
so you try to test me

164
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,320
and used me,

165
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,550
or do you like me, even for a little bit?
