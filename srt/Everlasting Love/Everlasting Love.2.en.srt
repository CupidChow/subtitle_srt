1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:09,950
Your Majesty,

2
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,840
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,230
Touching his head is useless,

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
what should I do now?

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,430
This person is not only killed like crazy,

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,310
but very cleaver.

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,120
I'm gonna be caught by him sooner or later

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,150
sleeping with him every night like this.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
I have to think of a way to avoid that.

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,710
The silk of Da Ning is so fine

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,840
and the embroidery

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,950
is so beautiful,

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,070
if I can cut off a cloth

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,230
and bring it back to my times, that's gonna be wonderful.

15
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,240
I'll see you in your dreams.

16
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,240
This is such a strange dream.

17
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,800
Where am I?

18
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,840
An An, look,

19
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,280
is this set of scrolls

20
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,590
the third team dig out

21
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,520
from the Ning An King's monarch tomb?

22
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,800
If this is in the main tomb of Ning An King,

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,310
then it should be collected by him.

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,680
It's just that the handwriting got wore
and teared seriously,

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,840
we can't repair it.

26
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,190
Could the tyrant kept a dairy,

27
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,470
or could he wrote a love note?

28
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,910
You're trying to make me love the couple,

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,430
aren't you?

30
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,680
Don't you ever forget
how did the concubine Li dies in the end.

31
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,680
It's called the Birthday Feast Change.

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,190
The princess of Da Ning,

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,430
older sister of Ning An King

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,960
shot her dead with
clearing the trouble of the King as the reason.

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,120
It has nothing to do with me loving this couple.

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,520
I'd rather believe

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,080
another theory of the academic community.

38
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,750
It's my ring.

39
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,960
Ye is just a victim of the throne,

40
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,520
Ning An King used her,

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,590
he killed and made the chaos
under the name of the evil concubine.

42
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,830
Women are always just an excuse and a cloth of shame,

43
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,870
they say she's an evil concubine and ruined the country,

44
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,830
but it's all just camouflage of the ones in power.

45
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,830
I'm really curious

46
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,270
who can actually get the hold of you,

47
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,630
an academic head.

48
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,270
First, he has to be looking good,

49
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,750
at least

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,680
looks like the Ning An King.

51
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,240
Shit,

52
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,510
she saw me.

53
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,430
The dream is gonna collapse.

54
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,120
Wait,

55
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,270
what's your name?

56
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,950
I am Ye Jinan.

57
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,870
How could you still ask my name in the time like this?

58
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,630
Thank god it's only a dream.

59
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,600
But how the hell did I dream of him?

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,680
He seems quite kind in the dream,

61
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,070
but still scary in real.

62
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,480
Aren't the people in the time-travel TV series
use the same way to come and go?

63
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,070
I've traveled here because I touched the King's head,

64
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,950
why does it not work?

65
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,160
What if I touched the top of his head?

66
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,510
I thought you're on your period,

67
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
what does this mean?

68
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,070
I saw your hair got messy,

69
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,270
I just want to help you to comb it.

70
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,190
It's still early,

71
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,680
let's get some more sleep.

72
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,310
Ye Jinan.

73
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,360
The Sinking Goose Pear Incense.

74
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,720
I just want to try this incense today.

75
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,560
You're so accurate.

76
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,430
It's only a coincidence.

77
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,600
You said that every time,

78
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,680
that means you're a divine fortune-teller.

79
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,870
So Your Majesty, you went into her dream last night?

80
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,310
Your incense plus combing her hair before sleep,

81
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,070
it's not very difficult to get her into a dream.

82
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,190
What did you saw in her dream?

83
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,560
Last night,

84
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,120
I saw a place that completely different from Da Ning,

85
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,310
a strange place.

86
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,920
Tens of billions of mountains

87
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,510
means tens of billions of suns and moons,

88
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,720
means there are tens of billions of worlds.

89
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,720
There are earth heaven on the earth and heaven,

90
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,160
like the sands in the Ganges River,

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,510
it's not surprise.

92
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,120
Women are always just an excuse and a cloth of shame,

93
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,120
they say she's an evil concubine and ruined the country,

94
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,870
but it's all just camouflage of the ones in power.

95
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,510
The cruelest thing in the world
is the strong ones trying to

96
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,630
make the world peace by using the weak ones,

97
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,630
it's never fair.

98
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,150
She, she said the same thing as her.

99
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,870
Maybe they come from the same place.

100
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,600
The stars fall, the moon rises, it's not easy to go back.

101
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,550
What they come from is already in the past.

102
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,550
You know where they came from?

103
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,120
Then could you tell who she is,

104
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
and why is she here?

105
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,910
Your Majesty, I work in the imperial astronomer,

106
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,360
I'm not a fortune teller.

107
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,510
Alright, fine,

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,550
you always talking out of turn.

109
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,000
Forget it.

110
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,550
It's odd,

111
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,550
I'll try to find who on earth she is.

112
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,600
Ling Shan,

113
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,790
do you talk to my sister the same way?

114
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,270
I've heard that she's about to be back.

115
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,150
Long live the king.

116
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
They have a meeting only at the dawn,

117
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,270
it's a dynasty about to die sooner or later.

118
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,390
Get up.

119
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

120
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,080
Your Majesty, I need to say that,

121
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,150
the harem should not participate in politics,

122
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,960
even the senior ones should not break the law.

123
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,440
Em,

124
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,150
I am now an evil concubine,

125
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,480
I should act like one.

126
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,840
Your Majesty,

127
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,600
I just really miss you,

128
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,360
and I don't want to be part with you even for a second.

129
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,080
Since that's the case,

130
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,960
then you should be by my side.

131
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

132
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,440
This is nonsense.

133
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,670
His Majesty already allowed me to be by his side,

134
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,360
your excellency, what you're doing now
insisting to have me go is called nonsense.

135
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,550
Your excellency?

136
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,600
You're now in the high ranking of the imperial harem,

137
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,200
so you don't even obey the rules?

138
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,200
My love, what's wrong with you today?

139
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,510
Even in the court,

140
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,390
you should not treat
the imperial my father in law like this.

141
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,670
Father in law,

142
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,200
he's my dad?
