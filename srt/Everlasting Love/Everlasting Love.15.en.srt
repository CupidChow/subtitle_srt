1
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,140
What are you looking at me like this?

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,470
I just feel it's so amazing.

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,190
The person I studied a thousand years later,

4
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,390
now he's in front of me.

5
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,300
Studied? Why do you mean by that?

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,700
Aren't you curious about where do I came from

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,190
and what I do?

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,940
I came from a long, long time later,

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,580
in that era,

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,220
you, the Da Ning Dynasty, have become a history,

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,750
and what I do is

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,420
to explore history

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,860
and restore the truth.

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,740
My teacher,

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,300
also my foster mother,

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,350
she led me down this path.

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,950
But she's dead in the line of duty.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,700
Then can you tell me
how the later generations talked about me?

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,390
They said that the Ning An King is a famous tyrant,

20
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,230
who went down in history as a symbol of infamy,

21
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,830
the favorite thing he liked to do
was to touch people's heads,

22
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,110
he usually called a row of people
standing in one line in the court

23
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,230
and touched their heads one by one,

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,350
then he would chose one he liked the most,
and killed him, just for fun.

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,110
That is indeed

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,670
quite scary.

27
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,510
Went down in history as a symbol of infamy,

28
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,230
truth.

29
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,950
But you didn't kill the innocents,

30
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,790
they're all just bullshit.

31
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,700
You believe me that much?

32
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,950
I saw it with my own eyes,

33
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,950
If I hadn't traveled here,

34
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,390
I wouldn't have known that
the reason you touch people's heads

35
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,230
is to enter their dreams.

36
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,670
By the way,

37
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,950
why can you get into people's dreams?

38
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,990
It's something you can do since you were born?

39
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,300
I had this ability

40
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,950
after my mother died.

41
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,670
Perhaps I just miss her so much,

42
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,300
it's good if I can see her even in my dreams.

43
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,620
It's all in the past now,

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,230
time have changed.

45
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,550
What is the truth and what is the false,

46
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,670
it seems that

47
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,300
even the most impartial history books

48
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,390
couldn't tell what is real.

49
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,790
What do you mean by that?

50
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,580
History says that I, the concubine Li
died in the thirteenth year of Ning An,

51
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,790
at my own birthday feast,

52
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,580
I was killed by the princess.

53
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,180
That is ridiculous,

54
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,790
why did my older sister wants to kill you?

55
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,270
I was worried before,

56
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,710
and now I think about it,
it might be a mistake in the book or blackmail.

57
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,550
Don't worry, I will not let anyone to hurt you.

58
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,500
By the way,

59
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,470
I just thought that once this matter was over,

60
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,030
I would go pick you up back here
from the princess's residence.

61
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,590
This is a gift I learned from my mother,

62
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,420
for the one I love.

63
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,860
Open it.

64
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,420
You learned it from your mother?

65
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,350
I haven't braided for so long,

66
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,500
so I'm a little rusty.

67
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,180
The end here is braided wrong.

68
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,150
It should be right up and then left down,

69
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,030
so that the shape of the knot can be pretty.

70
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,740
Jinan.

71
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,500
I taught my teacher

72
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,500
about this knot weaving,

73
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,860
it's a gift I give to my teacher.

74
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,860
My mother's name has been forbidden
to recorded in the history,

75
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,300
no one dare

76
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,740
to mention it.

77
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,110
Her name is,

78
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,380
Shu Minhe,

79
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,550
Shu Minhe.

80
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,620
Feng Zhili, Feng Zhili.

81
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,940
She knew that she wouldn't be recorded in the history,

82
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,820
so she took her name apart

83
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,180
and put it into your names.

84
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,300
I'm such a fool,

85
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,350
the answer is right in the riddle.

86
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,860
I now know why I felt so familiar the first time I saw you,

87
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,180
turns out

88
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,550
I've see you thousand times

89
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,380
in my mother's mouth.

90
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,620
My teacher mentioned me to you?

91
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,030
What did she say about me?

92
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,110
My mother has the most honorable status

93
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,230
and she could have whatever she wanted,

94
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,860
however she always felt so lonely,

95
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,590
I didn't understand at that time,

96
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,260
so I always asked her,

97
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,990
she just braided this knot over and over again,

98
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,060
and she told me the story of a girl over and over again.

99
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,060
My mother always said that,

100
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,110
that girl came here all alone,

101
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,590
but she knows that she has the things she wants.

102
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,860
That kid missed her.

103
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,550
Mother always said that,

104
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,300
the colorful rope knot signifies
auspiciousness and peace,

105
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,590
and it should be given to the person I love the most.

106
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,380
Since the first time

107
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,350
I learned of your existence,

108
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,790
I've been waiting,

109
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,300
I believe you're somewhere in the world.

110
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,420
Jinan,

111
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,910
I've been waiting for you.

112
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,030
That's a long waiting,

113
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,180
Feng Zhili.

114
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,860
That's a long waiting.

115
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,380
I am so sure that

116
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,060
Her Highness's handwriting now is totally different

117
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,060
from when she's just married.

118
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,420
Really?

119
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,940
One hundred percent sure,

120
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,590
the handwriting is indeed quite different.

121
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,710
In that case,

122
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,550
the last time she returned here,

123
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,150
the way she acted and talked

124
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,060
were indeed quite different.

125
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,230
If she was not possessed by the evil,

126
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,780
how do we explain all these?

127
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,230
I should have killed them long ago,

128
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,260
if it's her destiny,

129
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,540
then don't blame me for so cruel.

130
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,140
Your Majesty, last night,
all the people in the Shangshu House were killed,

131
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,620
and I found this in the house.

132
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,740
The prescription to stay young and beautiful.

133
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,860
Drinking osmanthus brew on a daily basis,

134
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,380
supplemented by the South Candle Flower as a guide.

135
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,470
You've always good at making incense,

136
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,830
can you see what's in this formula?

137
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,900
Your Majesty, this is a poisonous formula,

138
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,900
it seems quite safe,

139
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,470
the herbs matched in this does not conflict,

140
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,310
but the problem is the ingredient
added to enhance the efficacy of the medicine,

141
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,140
the flower is the sacred flower of Wujiang,

142
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:05,990
the aroma is overpowering,

143
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,500
the flowering stage of the full bloom will be all dead,

144
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,780
its glory and blight is just an instant.

145
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,660
Mother,

146
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,500
mom,

147
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,740
mom.

148
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,380
Take this as the ingredient I mentioned before,

149
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,020
the person who takes it

150
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,020
will be more and more glowing day by day,
like the hibiscus flowers blossom,
and return to the youth.

151
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,310
Yes. The person who's poisoned by this has a special feature.

152
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,660
Her face will be rot

153
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,230
when she's dead,

154
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,660
and her wounds will be like the flower blooming,

155
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,430
and her dead body would have a strange fragrance,

156
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,660
this flower is very hard to get even in Wujiang,

157
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,830
that's why people can not find out the reason

158
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,070
of the people who have been hit by this poison died,

159
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,350
and can only be diagnosed as plague blood disease.
