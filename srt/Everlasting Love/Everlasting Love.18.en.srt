1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,990
Where's the emperor?

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,300
Why are you so panicking?

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,580
What happened?

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,060
Three thousand seven hundred and eighty knives.

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,030
A strong body like you,

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,470
I think I'll scrape a thousand knives for three days.

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,390
But your meat are so few,

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,420
it's cold at night,

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,300
why don't I get you a heater to bake?

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,140
Your Majesty, you might as well just kill me,

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,030
I'll tell you all,

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,500
the list of the party,

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,580
and all the things they've done,

14
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,990
the information of all of it are hide,

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,620
hide outside of my house.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,510
Then take this as reward,

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,350
you shall go to the Xing Wu Gate,

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,020
and have fun with those friends of yours.

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,670
Feng Zhili, what are you doing?

20
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,390
Your Highness, you can't get in there.

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,390
Take her back.

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,790
Yes, Your Majesty. Your Highness, forgive me for this.

23
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,740
I'm not leaving, Feng Zhili,

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,350
I'm not leaving, Feng Zhili,

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,110
Feng Zhili. What are you doing?

26
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,420
Feng Zhili.

27
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,070
Feng Zhili.

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,990
The duke Ye took his own life to prove his loyalty,

29
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,550
he hand over the list of all the sycophants.

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,300
At the birthday feast, the assassins tried to revenge,

31
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,350
made you seriously injured.

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,740
The emperor was furious,

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,700
he started killing like crazy
during the days you were in a coma,

34
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,180
he killed dozens of ministers in the court,

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,300
and hanging their heads on the Xing Wu Gate
to show to the world.

36
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,070
At thirteen years of Ning An,

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,180
the concubine Li died at her birthday feast,

38
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,670
making Ning An King so furious,

39
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,460
he killed a dozens of ministers under the city gate,

40
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,860
their blood flowing just like a river,

41
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,510
the historical records called it

42
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,620
"The Birthday Feast Change".

43
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,140
Turns out,

44
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,510
turns out the history never changed,

45
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,350
Feng Zhili and I

46
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,180
planed this birthday feast,

47
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,420
so I,

48
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,180
so the mastermind of this history,

49
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,550
was me,

50
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,900
it was me.

51
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,420
No,

52
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,860
no,

53
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,150
no way,

54
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,860
no way,

55
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,470
I have to go back to him.

56
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,790
I can't let him keep doing it.

57
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,710
No, no,

58
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,710
Feng Zhili.

59
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:30,740
Don't come close to me.

60
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,150
Feng Zhili,

61
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,500
Feng Zhili.

62
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,030
It was me,

63
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,350
you saw it all,

64
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,860
and you knew it all.

65
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,710
Yes.

66
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,710
So,

67
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,380
are you scared?

68
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,110
You're scared of Da Ning,

69
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,620
and you're scared of me.

70
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,300
Yes, I am scared,

71
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,180
I am scared that you might blame yourself too much,

72
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,910
I am scared that you will lose your mind

73
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,110
or hurt yourself

74
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,180
for some useless fools and some damned people.

75
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,590
I am scared that you'll be presumptuous thus push me away

76
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,380
or don't even want me anymore.

77
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,990
Jinan.

78
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,150
My teacher is now in heaven,

79
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,500
she will be rest in peace.

80
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,790
So stop punishing yourself.

81
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,150
You've still

82
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,710
got me.

83
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,860
Jinan,

84
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,620
Jinan,

85
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,860
Jinan.

86
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,910
I definitely won't let you be the same as my mother.

87
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,710
These,

88
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,260
all these ancient scrolls,

89
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,550
it's hard to get them all even in Da Ning,

90
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,990
how do you find them?

91
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,030
You know they're so rare, so just take a look.

92
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,990
Your Majesty, you treat me so well,

93
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,860
thank you.

94
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,230
What else do you want?

95
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,180
The long lost color rice paper in Xuan Town,

96
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,590
with gold foil sprinkled.

97
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,230
The jade white porcelain in De Town,

98
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,260
the best is the kind of bottle with two ears,

99
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,620
it's very rare, so heard.

100
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,620
And,

101
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,150
the phase face dragon tripod
just unearthed in Da Ning a while ago.

102
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,300
Tripod?

103
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,300
That I can't do.

104
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,060
It's too heavy, you can't take that away.

105
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,060
I'm only talking,

106
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,260
I can't take anything whether it's heavy or not.

107
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,860
Sometimes, you can only talking something,

108
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,190
but I will always remember it.

109
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,740
All those sweet talking.

110
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,430
Then I do think

111
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,310
this dragon robe on you

112
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,310
is quite pretty.

113
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,350
You, what are you doing?

114
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,860
I'm joking.

115
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,190
You, what are you doing?

116
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,710
I'll give you anything

117
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,540
you want,

118
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,540
all I want is for you to live.

119
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,230
Feng Zhili,

120
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,590
Feng Zhili.

121
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,140
What if,

122
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,430
I mean what if,

123
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,710
you have the chance to get out of here,

124
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,740
to go back where you came from,

125
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,500
by that time, we will be thousand years apart.

126
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,020
That won't happen,

127
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,590
because I will never leave you.

128
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,590
You,

129
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,620
what happened to you?

130
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,230
Why do you act so strange today?

131
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,780
Nothing,

132
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,660
I have things to take care of,

133
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,110
you need to have some rest.

134
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,070
Feng Zhili, Feng Zhili.

135
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,380
What the hell.

136
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,070
Feng Zhili, Feng Zhili,

137
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,500
why do you lock the door? Feng Zhili,

138
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,830
it feels not right.

139
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,190
Feng Zhili,

140
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,020
Feng Zhili, let me out, Feng Zhili,

141
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,540
Feng Zhili,

142
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,380
Feng Zhili,

143
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,070
Feng Zhili.

144
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,830
I've gone through my mother's relics
in the underground palace these days,

145
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,660
and I found this in the deep ground.

146
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,620
The master projected that year,

147
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,230
when the seven stars in a row,

148
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,590
and the heavenly hound swallowed the moon,

149
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,830
people might get the chance to travel through time.

150
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,500
Then why didn't she leave?

151
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,380
If she left,

152
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,020
then she wouldn't.

153
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,860
Ling Shan, tell me,

154
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,070
she had the chance to avoid all those disasters,

155
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,660
she had the chance to go back to where she belonged,

156
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,380
why didn't she do that?

157
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,380
The master indeed said it himself when he left that,

158
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,310
the lady chose to stay.

159
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,430
She said that, where her heart is, where her hometown is.

160
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,780
I have you, I won't go anywhere.

161
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,110
I will stay with you.

162
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,590
It's me,

163
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,780
I made my own mother killed.

164
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,540
Why,

165
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,020
why a kind and good person like her,

166
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,590
would end up like that?

167
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,310
Feng Zhili,

168
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,740
I don't like Da Ning anymore.

169
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,590
Enough,

170
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,110
I won't make her regret it too.
