1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,750
Jinan,

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,750
I miss her.

3
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,140
You've gotten into so many ministers' dreams,

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,580
have you never seen her in their dreams?

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,990
No,

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,750
not even once.

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,630
In the hometown of me and my teacher,

8
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,300
she's dead,

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,630
but I've never thought that

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,470
she could exist here.

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,550
Maybe she never left.

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,390
When you miss her,

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,940
you can look at the moon,

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,860
the moon and the stars shining in the night,

15
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,460
they shines on our ancients.

16
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,460
The moon is the same in any eras.

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,700
Mother, what are you thinking?

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,270
I'm thinking of my hometown.

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,740
In mother's hometown,

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,510
I'm sure the moon is also shining in the sky at this time.

21
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,070
Mother, if you miss your hometown so much,

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,860
why don't you go back?

23
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,990
You're here,

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,390
I won't go anywhere.

25
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,740
I will stay with you.

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,140
My mother never treated people bad,

27
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,180
she's the most kind and most merciful people in the world,

28
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,620
but I just don't understand,

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,790
who on earth even wants to kill her?

30
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,180
And he used such a cruel and underhanded means to do it.

31
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,990
Let's face the difficulties and dangers together

32
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,620
in the future,

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,830
let's find it out together,

34
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,550
and give my teacher back a truth.

35
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,420
It's such a big event,

36
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,180
why don't I see the Empress Dowager and the princess?

37
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,420
The Empress Dowager always likes the quietness,

38
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,990
she's been spent all day in the Yongshou Hall
reciting sutras and praying to the Buddha,

39
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,940
she wouldn't be here.

40
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,060
Not even to mention the princess,

41
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,060
everyone knows that she regards him as a thorn in her side,

42
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,180
so His Majesty has already sent her

43
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,940
to the Red Cloud Camp to train her troops.

44
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,110
The emperor

45
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,620
and the concubine is arrived.

46
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,230
Long live the King,

47
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,110
wish Your Highness a happy birthday.

48
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,380
Long live Your Highness,

49
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,230
may you have the god's blessing.

50
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,910
Everyone can sit down.

51
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,790
Thank you, Your Majesty.

52
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,620
I think all of you have long been sicked of

53
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,380
watching the dance and singing,

54
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,740
today I will bring you some new stuff.

55
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,990
Let's see a girl

56
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,110
playing the song of Emperor Meeting His Army.

57
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,300
It's the first time ever

58
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,790
since the beginning of our dynasty.

59
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,740
It's not accidental,

60
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,940
everything is just the same

61
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,180
as the mid-autumn palace banquet at that year.

62
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,230
That's ridiculous,

63
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,420
how could a girl playing a song like that.

64
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,380
It's only a song,

65
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,820
why does the duke so furious about this?

66
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,500
Who told you that girls can only sing warm and soft words?

67
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,790
Today is the concubine's birthday,

68
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,180
it's such a happy day,

69
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,150
don't get so angry.

70
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,860
Come on,

71
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,230
give the duke the new osmanthus brew from Qingzhou,

72
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,380
calm him down.

73
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,550
Duke Ye, why don't you drink it?

74
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,260
This is a so called "Hongmen Banquet",

75
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,500
and this is a poisonous wine,

76
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,380
I will not drink this.

77
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,910
So it's really you.

78
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,740
Yes it's me.

79
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,470
Your Majesty, since you've already found it out,

80
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,590
I will not hide anything from you anymore.

81
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,550
At the mid-autumn palace banquet that year,

82
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,180
this flower and this wine,

83
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,670
are what eventually got Shu Minhe killed.

84
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,790
My mother is a kind person,

85
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,300
she's never involved in any power struggles

86
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,500
and she's never fought for fame or fortune,

87
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,470
why did you do that to her?

88
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,030
Your Majesty, since you don't know the reason,

89
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,470
then I'm going to tell you.

90
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,550
She seems didn't fight for anything,

91
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,940
however,
the late emperor broke the ancestral system for her,

92
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,990
he decided to level the class and abolish slavery,

93
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,620
he thought the women should be the same as men,
had the right to study and read,

94
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,990
in that way, the monarch and his subjects had no hierarchy,

95
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,060
they don't have to pay respects when they met,

96
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,590
that is just so ridiculous.

97
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,180
The world should be one,

98
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,230
we should be on very intimate terms

99
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,060
and share everything together,

100
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,300
she's right about this.

101
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,500
She's fake mercy,

102
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,710
if in that way, the monarch and his subjects had no level,

103
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,260
the father and his son are equal,

104
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,670
this is evil talking.

105
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,860
If we do things only based on our emotion
but system and rules,

106
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,940
the abolition of etiquette will only leads to
the chaos in the world,

107
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,790
she's evil,

108
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,500
she deserved to be dead.

109
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,230
Shut up,

110
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,590
Ye Tingjun,

111
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,070
you won't admit that

112
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,860
you killed my own mother,

113
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,950
don't you even know this is a capital crime?

114
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,990
Your Majesty, it's fine if you want to kill me,

115
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,710
but do you know who planed all this?

116
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,190
It's us,

117
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,350
each one of us,

118
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,830
we were determined to kill the evil, wipe out the heresy

119
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,620
and clear the bad by your side

120
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,660
for our country and the the laws of the imperial court.

121
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,590
Because the late emperor so defended of evil,
we had no way but to do it quietly,

122
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,740
we wanted her to die

123
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,070
soundless,

124
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,990
then we had to do it step by step.

125
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,350
I'd like to toast the Empress Dowager,

126
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,260
it's so hard for one man to do it,
but easy if everyone do it together.

127
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,780
We did it secretly,

128
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,140
and had the amount of minutiae,

129
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,500
but can get in by every opening.

130
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,950
The late emperor never thought that

131
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,020
he was the one who completed the last mission

132
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,260
of killing Shu Minhe.

133
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,070
Year after year, day by day,

134
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,470
everyone of us were just looking forward to her death.

135
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,230
Except her,

136
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,070
the big disaster of Da Ning,

137
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,710
Zhili.

138
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,780
I've been planning for Da Ning my whole life,

139
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,140
I've never thought that one day,

140
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,900
this evil thing

141
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,310
would be born in my own house.

142
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,740
Evil,

143
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,350
there's still evil?

144
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,900
Could it be?

145
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,780
That's right,

146
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,540
she's no longer the daughter of Ye,

147
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,140
she's already been possessed by evil,

148
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,710
she's the big disaster that will leads Da Ning die.

149
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,990
That's ridiculous, who the hell are you to judge others?

150
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,110
I am willing to take my own life
to prove loyal for my country,

151
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,620
today, even I died here,

152
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,950
there will be hundreds and thousand person,

153
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,740
who're determined to wipe out the evil

154
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,830
just like me.

155
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,140
Duke.
