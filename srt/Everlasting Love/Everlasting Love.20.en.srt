1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,940
You fool.

3
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,550
Ling Shan,

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,580
Your Highness, you're hurt.

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,340
Is something wrong with the Fu Xi Temple?

6
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,420
It's an ambush.

7
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,940
The so called a way to travel across the time

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,940
is actually a total trap.

9
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,750
This time traveling method

10
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,700
was recorded in an ancient book that

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,110
accidentally got by the past generation master.

12
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,420
The master Wu Yu?

13
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,990
He got that by accident?

14
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,510
I don't think so,

15
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,700
I think someone deliberately did that,

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,700
in order to lure my mother in.

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,300
But the lady chose to stay in the end,

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,110
and it got her avoiding the disaster.

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,390
It's Xiao Li,

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,950
he hold her here,

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,860
and saved her.

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,950
But those bunch of people still won't let her go,

23
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,740
they made her killed,

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,510
and now they're doing the same thing,

25
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,620
trying to get Xiao Li and Jinan killed too.

26
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,900
But Ye Tingjun now is dead,

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,460
who else would be behind it?

28
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,740
You trash.

29
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,510
The emperor has grown up,

30
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,510
he finally couldn't wait anymore.

31
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,550
You should go to the Peach Mountain,

32
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,790
and tell them

33
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,990
ready to go.

34
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,790
Yes.

35
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,110
Do you still remember

36
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,620
what that ancient book looks like?

37
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,270
It's just just an ordinary book,

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,860
nothing special.

39
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,300
I can't really remember it.

40
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,740
Is this one?

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,140
I'm going to get married soon.

42
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,420
The rules of Da Ning says that,

43
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,950
prince and princess should get married
before twenty five.

44
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,700
I'll be twenty five

45
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,260
at the beginning of spring next year.

46
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,670
Ling Shan,

47
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,420
all those years,

48
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,470
the entanglements between you and me,

49
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,990
eventually to the end.

50
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,710
You shouldn't give me any osmanthus cakes from now on.

51
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,740
Why?

52
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,180
My father said that,

53
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,740
I am the princess of the country,

54
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,380
I can't specially favor someone over others.

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,940
If I favor the osmanthus cake,

56
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,420
the plum cake or the pear cake

57
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,500
would feel unfair.

58
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,590
So I won't eat osmanthus cake anymore.

59
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,740
This is my first jade ring,

60
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,300
it's the most cherished thing to me,

61
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,380
I'm gonna give this to the most cherished person in my life.

62
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,110
I can't take that, Your Highness.

63
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,150
Why?

64
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,420
If you favor one thing over others,

65
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,670
others would feel unfair.

66
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,820
It's the same to men.

67
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,150
The emperor was teaching you a lesson.

68
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,180
I don't think my father was right.

69
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,420
If I don't love one thing,

70
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,550
I wouldn't love the other thing,

71
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,380
so if I don't love one man,

72
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,500
I wouldn't love all the other men in our country.

73
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,230
It's something that I, the princess give to you,

74
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,420
please just take it.

75
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,790
I am the princess of the country,

76
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,470
I can't waste any of my time with you,

77
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,790
now can you tell me,

78
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,230
what on earth do you think of us?

79
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,380
It's late,

80
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,820
princess, you should go back and go to sleep.

81
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,470
That's your answer?

82
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,550
Your Highness,
you're the princess of all the people in our country,

83
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,230
you can't favor one man.

84
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,350
While I, I am just a minister,

85
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,420
it's a mistake from the beginning.

86
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,030
Good,

87
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,110
what a good talking,

88
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,110
so it was me who has been forcing you all these years.

89
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,420
The Khan of Da Sheng is young and brave,

90
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,790
he and I are get along very much the first time we met,

91
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,590
then I think I'll just listen to all the ministers

92
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,260
and get married with him next year in the spring,

93
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,820
when the time comes,

94
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,670
please, I'll need you to host our wedding.

95
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,300
Okay.

96
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,740
Since this being the case,

97
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,350
we should end this,

98
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,670
please give back my jade ring,

99
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,860
and I'll give this peace talisman back to you.

100
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,590
This talisman has already blessed you for years,

101
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,110
it's no use to me anymore,

102
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,820
you don't have to give it back.

103
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,820
The Khan is a good, brave young man

104
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,260
with a dignified appearance,

105
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,910
I congratulate you,

106
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,790
to find such an outstanding husband.

107
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,590
Fine.

108
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,060
From now on, you and I,

109
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,230
our fate is end here,

110
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,620
we have nothing to do with each other anymore.

111
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,140
I've gone through all the ancient books
in Nian Xing pavilion,

112
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,620
there's no trace of it.

113
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,620
Did we guess wrong?

114
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,830
Your Majesty.

115
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,350
What happened to you?

116
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,380
You don't look so well.

117
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,860
I dreamed of my master last night.

118
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,260
My master passed away while sitting cross legged
on the night the Empress Dowager confered her title.

119
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,830
Before he dies,

120
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,380
he left me a word.

121
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,470
That is, the dust moving, the mirror breaks,
smoke rises, shielding the sunrise.

122
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,140
Now I think about it,

123
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,140
the dust moving and the mirror breaks,

124
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,260
isn't that what happened
when you got into other dreams and got out?

125
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,590
While smoke rises, shielding the sunrise

126
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,190
has something to do with the Empress Dowager
titled the young emperor.

127
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,230
The ancient book didn't record

128
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,430
what is the relationship between the Empress Dowager
and master Wu Yu.

129
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,260
Shielding the sunrise, it sounds so mysterious,

130
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,620
could it be the ancient book has something to do
with the Empress Dowager?

131
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,430
It's after all a clue,

132
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,140
it has or hasn't,

133
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,380
we'll only need to give it a try.

134
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:11,830
Mother.

135
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,110
It's late,

136
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,380
what are you doing here?

137
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,110
I brought you some tranquilizing soup,

138
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,740
mother, you've spent so much time in Bi Xia Temple
to worship Buddha and chant sutras,

139
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,710
I haven't really got the time to serve you,

140
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,830
now I got time,

141
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,230
I'll keep you company.

142
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,900
That's very thoughtful of you.

143
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,900
I'll comb your hair.

144
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,660
Mother, you've got white hair.

145
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,500
I'm old.

146
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,430
Mother,

147
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,950
you just need to take good rest in the palace,

148
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,950
I promise you I'll by your side

149
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,990
and treat you very good day after night.
