1
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,950
There will be hundreds and thousands person,

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,780
who are determined to kill the evil,

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,220
just like me.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,110
Duke.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,060
Your excellency.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:26,780
Duke,

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,500
duke,

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,950
duke,

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,030
duke, duke.

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,220
The duke is dead in the cause of justice.

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,270
The evil killed him.

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,670
I killed him?

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,220
He killed,

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,630
shouldn't he pay for it?

15
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,630
The late empress was such a kind and merciful person,

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,790
just because you decided she's an evil,

17
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,420
she just deserved to be dead?

18
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,630
All of you,

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,900
do you dare to ask yourself,

20
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,230
what you've done

21
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,550
is really for Da Ning,

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,510
or for your own good?

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,390
For ourselves?

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,950
What the bullshit are you talking about?

25
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,350
Duke has been devoted all his life to Da Ning,

26
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,700
he died with pride,

27
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,020
while you,

28
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,580
you evil, how dare you insult him like that?

29
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:46,830
She's,

30
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,740
she's really possessed by evil,
what she did was commit high treason.

31
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,740
Everyone,

32
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,270
do you even know the shaman saying,

33
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,460
Da Ning is going to die if the evil exists.

34
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,070
How dare you.

35
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,550
Your Majesty,

36
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,670
are you really gonna defend this evil

37
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,790
by the time like this?

38
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,510
Your Majesty, you're a wise king,

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,460
please to protect the Da Ning dynasty,
you have to kill the evil concubine and clear your mind.

40
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,350
Please, you have to kill the evil concubine

41
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,420
and clear your mind.

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,510
Wei Ming.

43
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:06,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,700
You got into the Hussar Camp when you were fifteen,

45
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,660
joined the Ye Army when you were sixteen.

46
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,390
You're a close disciple of the Duke Ye.

47
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,140
Yes.

48
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,630
Duke Ye is dead to prove the laws of the imperial,

49
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,870
which is the level of the master and disciple,
the level of the father and son,

50
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,580
you're so supportive of it,

51
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,220
you should be dead
to prove your beliefs instead of still living,

52
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,780
am I right?

53
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,830
The department of Wuwei.

54
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,540
Yes.

55
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,100
The Duke Ye reported to me

56
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,390
at the concubine Li's birthday feast

57
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,270
to identify dozens of corrupt sycophants,

58
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,070
I, will not let him down

59
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,390
only because I'm touched by his loyal,

60
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,190
and I will definitely kill

61
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,950
all the treacherous and sycophantic ones.

62
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,830
Please, Your Majesty,

63
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,700
spare my life, Your Majesty,

64
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,630
please forgive me,

65
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,900
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, I'm innocent,

66
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,950
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,100
Feng Zhili,

68
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,950
Feng Zhili,

69
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,830
you're a hopeless fatuous and self-indulgent ruler,

70
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,460
Be careful.

71
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,430
Go to hell.

72
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,460
Jinan,

73
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,190
Jinan.

74
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,070
Doctor, get me a doctor,

75
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,630
Jinan.

76
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,540
Turns out, you can't run away from the history.

77
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,070
Jinan, where are all the doctors,

78
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,220
damn it.

79
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,580
Jinan.

80
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,660
How is she?

81
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,540
Please forgive me for being so incompetent.

82
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,830
Her Highness the concubine Li's breath is stable,

83
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,540
her body is no longer in any serious trouble,

84
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,950
but I don't know why she doesn't wake up.

85
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,870
She's sleeping. She's dreaming.

86
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,390
Jinan,

87
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,660
what are you doing here?

88
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,540
I came to see my teacher,

89
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,710
she's buried in a place where she could see the sunrise.

90
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,390
Mother.

91
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,230
I fought with her the day she went down to the tomb,

92
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,590
do you think she hated me for that,

93
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,470
so she didn't want me?

94
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,390
No, that's not the truth,
she has been worried about you this all time.

95
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,060
But why,

96
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,140
why a good and kind person like her,

97
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,270
would end up like this?

98
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,110
Feng Zhili,

99
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,230
I don't like Da Ning anymore,

100
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,060
in fact, I was quite scared when I traveled down here,

101
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,270
the imperial laws, deep in the palace,

102
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,230
there are so many rules here,

103
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,940
and I can never see my friends and colleagues anymore.

104
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,350
I had the chance to see my teacher,

105
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,990
but I've thought that she would be,

106
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,350
So what's your point? You're scared?

107
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,270
You're scared of Da Ning?

108
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:54,940
Jinan,

109
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,140
Jinan,

110
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,990
Jinan,

111
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,390
the ones who don't like you,

112
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,180
we'll just kill them all.

113
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,230
Your Highness, you're awake,

114
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,820
I'll go get you a doctor.

115
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,540
The vital parts of your body didn't get hurt that day,

116
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,180
only your brain got injured,

117
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,660
it's a near escape.

118
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,470
You're so lucky you got the god blessing,

119
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,900
Your Highness, it's such a close call,

120
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,140
yet your life is no longer in danger now,

121
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,350
you just need to take medicine on time,

122
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,270
and you'll be fine very soon.

123
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,870
Turns out, that day,

124
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,780
I touched

125
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,390
my own skull.

126
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,750
Bitao, where's the emperor,

127
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,420
where did he go?

128
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,420
His Majesty, he,

129
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,780
Where is he?

130
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,110
Why are you so panicking?

131
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,270
What happened?
