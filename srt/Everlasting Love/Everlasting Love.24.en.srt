1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,790
How did you get hurt like this?

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,150
You were fine when you left.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,100
Teacher.

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,820
Why, why are you crying?

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,150
You, do you hurt somewhere?

6
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,180
You're too thin,

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,150
you really need some nutritious food.

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,630
You two can talk,

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,870
I'll go get you some hot chicken soup.

10
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,310
So that's the reason you don't wanna leave here?

11
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,630
Isn't it nice to live here all the time?

12
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,310
It's peace and harmonious,

13
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,100
no killing, no hatred.

14
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,750
Everyone is here,

15
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,140
sister has ascended the throne,

16
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,910
we're a very happy family together.

17
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,140
Feng Zhili,

18
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,590
it's nice here,

19
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,700
but

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,380
it's all fake.

21
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,190
The dream, how beautiful it is, it's not real.

22
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,030
It all only a moment,

23
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,190
the reality, no matter cruel,

24
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,510
has countless possibilities,

25
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,070
I don't wanna have only moment with you.

26
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,190
But this is the first time I've ever dreamed of her.

27
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,750
It has never happened before.

28
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,420
You're going to leave?

29
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,820
Xiaoli,

30
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,140
you need to smile more.

31
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,830
Jinan is

32
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,740
the same.

33
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,860
You need to take care of her from now on.

34
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,910
Yang Qi.

35
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,230
You're looking for him?

36
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,790
He led the troops

37
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,980
and tried to plot a rebellion,

38
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,980
I've protected the King

39
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,100
and killed him in Xing An Gate.

40
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,300
The rebels now have lost their general,

41
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,540
now they've all been captured by me.

42
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,180
The King is still alive,

43
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,100
Your Highness,
yet you've already made the edict of succession,

44
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,230
passed to

45
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,540
the King of Duan,

46
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,390
he's only four.

47
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,150
He is the only clan bloodline.

48
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,030
The rebels killed into the palace,

49
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,830
I'm only afraid what might happen to the now emperor.

50
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,860
When the emperor now has succeeded to the throne,
he's only eight,

51
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,830
that makes sense.

52
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,180
They're all at the age that not able to pro-government
and easy to control.

53
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,950
Zhao Ming, what do you mean by that?

54
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,540
My mother treated you with sincerity,

55
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,620
yet you killed her by underhanded means

56
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,830
and controlled my little brother,

57
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,590
you hidden behind the curtain

58
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,660
and attended to state affairs,

59
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,710
Your Highness, what do you mean by that?

60
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,740
The winner takes all,

61
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,230
it's what happens in the court,

62
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,950
and it's the same to the harem,

63
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,300
Why did Shu Minhe

64
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,590
could have the emperor's favor

65
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,230
with her naive and hypocritical looks?

66
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,660
She said herself that she didn't want to be the empress,

67
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,620
since she didn't want it,

68
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,980
why couldn't I fight and take it?

69
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,060
I'll kill you.

70
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,470
Even if I'm dead,

71
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,420
you can't save your little brother.

72
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,660
What did you do to Xiaoli?

73
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,910
Rumor has it that there's kind of person
could get into people's dream,

74
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,300
the price of it is that
he will lose the ability to dream himself.

75
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,710
And if he has his loved one's hair on him,

76
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,180
he can build a really beautiful dream for himself,

77
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,230
then he will sleep soundly in it

78
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,830
and can never wake up.

79
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,590
Without the emperor,

80
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,590
the bloodline of you royal is very few,

81
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,540
you're a girl,

82
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,540
who can never succeed to the throne,

83
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,150
without me, the great Empress Dowager's help,
to make the young become the King,

84
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,100
the whole country is set to be in chaos.

85
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,620
With the great strategy of ruling the country,

86
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,300
even she's a girl,

87
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,180
why can't she become a great ruler?

88
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,310
On the night of the mid autumn festival,
Yang Qi led his troops,

89
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,830
tried to conspire against the state,

90
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,190
killed the Empress Dowager

91
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,190
and burn the emperor's residence on fire.

92
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,100
The princess Zhao Ming,

93
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,310
stopped the fighting,

94
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,430
she should be the next reigning emperor.

95
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,980
Your Highness, a great ruler should be

96
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,860
bold and unconstrained,

97
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,190
we hope you starting from now,

98
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,740
succeed to the throne,

99
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,190
we're all willing to be your followers.

100
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,310
We hope you starting from now,

101
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,310
succeed to the throne.

102
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,310
Your face got dirty,

103
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,830
does it hurt?

104
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,140
Xiaoli.

105
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,190
Sister,

106
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,470
are you alright?

107
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,070
I'm fine.

108
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,230
You clearly know it's a trap, yet you still went into it,

109
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,190
what the hell were you thinking, Feng Zhili?

110
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,780
Promise me,

111
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,310
don't do that ever again.

112
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,980
She's got mother's letter,

113
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,860
I had to go there.

114
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,140
Mother wrote this to me,

115
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,140
and also to you.

116
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,190
Do you want to be the King?

117
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,620
I want to.

118
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,230
You're older than me,

119
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,500
has better ability and tactics,

120
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,830
you should be the King.

121
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,350
Both you and me know it.

122
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,620
Do you really mean what you said?

123
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,020
With all my heart.

124
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,310
Besides, you know me,

125
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,070
I've had no ambition at all since little,

126
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,740
my best wish is to have a happy family in a peace country,

127
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,620
so that I could be a free and unfettered prince,

128
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,900
traveling all over the country.

129
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,670
I've been this King for you for such a long time,

130
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,710
so tired,

131
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,430
and I received a really bad reputation.

132
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,500
The people are not really living a wealthy and happy life.

133
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,780
Everyone calls me a tyrant.

134
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,070
I can prove that, he is the famous tyrant

135
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,860
in history.

136
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,350
You two,

137
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,740
Sis,

138
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,020
we've been through life and death,

139
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
we don't care about that anymore.

140
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,140
He has been pretending to be
a merciless tyrant for so many years,

141
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,190
so that he could revenge for my teacher,

142
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,430
and also

143
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,470
you can

144
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,980
take his place righteously.

145
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,380
The King of Duan though still young,

146
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,350
he is the only clan bloodline of royal,

147
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,590
if I, the princess is on the throne,

148
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,140
will everyone follow me?

149
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,310
They will.

150
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,980
The star of emperor has fallen,

151
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,590
the star of the new emperor again raises,
it falls in the southwest,

152
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,140
it already says all so clearly.

153
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,590
Ling Shan,

154
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,500
you work in the imperial astronomer,

155
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,590
do you still remember
when you formally took Wu Yu as your master that

156
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,190
you made a promise

157
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,550
to never lie.

158
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,950
Of course I remember it,

159
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,190
but Your Highness, this is your destiny.

160
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,590
I didn't really lie.

161
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,950
After the dawn tomorrow,

162
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,190
I hope you will finally be on the throne,

163
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,350
rules Da Ning, and rules it well for years.

164
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,140
Then,

165
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,190
I'll take your advice.

166
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,380
It's out, it's out,

167
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,350
the star of the emperor has fallen in the southwest,
the new King is the princess.

168
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,590
How's that possible, what should we do?

169
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,500
How's that even possible?

170
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
How could a woman be the King?

171
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,020
The emperor position is empty,

172
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,670
we don't have a ruler now,

173
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,380
thus to choose a talent,

174
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,830
with everything that needed to deal with,

175
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,900
for I've made great contributions to the country,

176
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,100
I have to listen to the heaven
and take this responsibility,

177
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,950
Zhao Ming now is on the throne,

178
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,550
no one dares to go against me.

179
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,780
On the eighth day of September,

180
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,100
I now tell the heaven, the earth,
all the ancestral temples and people in the whole world,

181
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,830
I am the King.

182
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,780
Long Live the King.

183
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,230
Everyone, please this way.

184
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,470
At thirteen years, as well as the mid autumn in Ning An,

185
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,190
the rebel armies tried to take over the emperor's position,

186
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,470
thus the tyrant

187
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,190
died in the fire.

188
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,980
Later, Feng Zhifan, the elder princess was on the throne,

189
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,430
she is also the first female King in the history.

190
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,980
She has ruled the country for more than sixty years.

191
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,470
She made new reforms

192
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,310
and created a new century.

193
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,070
Then who are these two skulls?

194
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,470
These two skulls are

195
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,550
from the ancient tomb of Ning An King,

196
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,100
this one is

197
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,310
the Ning An King himself,

198
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,350
the other one is

199
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,140
not noted in history.

200
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,190
Have you heard about that wild history?

201
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,430
The Ning An King actually never didn't die in the fire,

202
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,900
he escaped,

203
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,230
the evil concubine didn't die on her birthday feast either,

204
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,820
this was all a plan of them,

205
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,950
they did this to escape from the struggle
for imperial power

206
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,740
and be a pair of free lovers.

207
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:08,980
My darling,

208
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,780
this is,

209
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,950
I've specially asked Yan Ming to bring this to me,

210
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,780
this is no ordinary water tank,

211
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,780
this is an article of tribute,

212
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,630
there were lotus flowers planted in there.

213
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,500
Tribute?

214
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,500
Then what about those?

215
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,150
We don't even know

216
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,020
when we can return to Ning An again,

217
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,870
so I've brought everything I can with us.

218
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,950
I've also asked Bitao to bring the official kiln porcelain

219
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,390
and carved silver chopsticks from the imperial kitchen.

220
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,670
All right,

221
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,540
we can take all of these,

222
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,150
but this,

223
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,150
Darling, we can just buy these

224
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,980
when we arrived at Weinan.

225
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,500
You're not the emperor anymore,

226
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,740
do you even have that money?

227
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,500
Can we even afford an official porcelain?

228
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,340
Good point,

229
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,950
I'll have to listen to you in the future.

230
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,980
That's alright, I've got you.

231
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,190
I don't study those historical materials for nothing.

232
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,190
I definitely know more about the clothing, food,

233
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,630
housing and transportation in Da Ning than you.

234
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,190
Let's go, darling.

235
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,670
But are we sure we can't take that?

236
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,110
Yes, we are sure.

237
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:26,950
Let's go.

238
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,910
Let's open a girls' school together,

239
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,430
we could teach girls read,

240
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,340
what about it?

241
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,780
Alright.

242
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,340
Then we can plant rice together.

243
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,780
My teacher said to me that,

244
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,390
an era will not be changed radically

245
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,150
just because of the arrival of one person,

246
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,150
then let's both be a

247
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,500
grass seed of this era

248
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,580
and go change the world little by little.
