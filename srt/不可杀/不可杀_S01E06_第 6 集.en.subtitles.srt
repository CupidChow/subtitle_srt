00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,788
EPISODE 6

2
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,794
See? Because you didn't destroy her soul,
an innocent girl got hurt.

3
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,961
Are you behind this?

4
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,923
No. Some people are impatient.

5
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,966
He was a Monster in his previous life too.

6
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,843
I bet it was Teoreokson.

7
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,845
You gave him intel
and told him what to do.

8
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,807
Are you blaming me?
No. This is more your fault than mine.

9
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,768
The Monsters you killed are trying
to take revenge on you.

10
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,937
So they're after Min Sang-un
who has your soul.

11
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,690
Once your soul is destroyed,
they will stop.

12
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,819
So bring her here
before other people get hurt.

13
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,695
I will give you a day.

14
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,697
And let me remind you again.

15
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,325
You and I are not enemies.

16
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,618
Our real enemy…

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,995
is that woman.

18
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,711
Was that him?

19
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,798
Tell him to take me.

20
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,260
Tell him that I'll come to him.

21
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,262
He can have my soul or whatever he wants.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,891
But tell him to let my sister go.

23
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,521
I don't care if I die.

24
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,148
Call him back now.

25
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,196
No. I will save your sister.

26
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,616
You asked me to kill Bulgasal, right?

27
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,994
To get revenge for your family.

28
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,913
You said I was the sword
that could kill him.

29
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,045
I will help you, but you will help me too.

30
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,424
Find a way to kill him.

31
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,844
Until I kill him…

32
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,930
I will…

33
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,436
let you live as a human.

34
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,359
Okay.

35
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,572
I'll do anything to save Si-ho.

36
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,866
So you better stay true

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,660
to your word.

38
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,090
Did he run away?

39
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,342
He must have driven off.

40
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,802
What about my sister?

41
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,096
He probably took her.

42
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,812
Si-ho…

43
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,834
Si-ho…

44
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,273
DARK HOLE

45
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,987
I thought she'd be alone.
Who was that man?

46
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,990
It was strange. He didn't seem human.

47
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,201
That's none of your business.
Just keep an eye on her sister.

48
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,454
And don't you touch her
without my permission.

49
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,872
We need to use her as bait.

50
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,001
Understood?

51
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:37,962
Answer me.

52
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,424
Yes, sir. But--

53
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,472
How dare he?

54
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,725
I'm the one who caught her!

55
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,019
She's mine!

56
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,775
I caught her. She's mine.

57
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,943
Report this to the police.

58
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,155
He said he'd kill my sister if I did.

59
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,908
That's what all kidnappers say.

60
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,159
There's no time.

61
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,913
This isn't something
the police can handle,

62
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,040
just like 15 years ago.

63
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,379
Does this also have to do with Bulgasal?

64
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,841
Is that kidnapper colluding with Bulgasal?

65
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,469
I think so.

66
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,558
Then what about that man?

67
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,067
I found no other traces.

68
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:48,032
Isn't he on their side?
You said he tried to kill you back there.

69
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,326
That was…

70
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,746
a misunderstanding.

71
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,334
All right, then.

72
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,628
First, we need to save your sister.

73
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,256
What's your next move?

74
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,217
-I heard you used to be a detective.
-So what?

75
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,553
We could use some inside information.

76
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:12,056
Find out which reservoir around here
had a lot of incidents and accidents.

77
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,893
What? There are
over ten reservoirs around here.

78
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,772
One of them will have more
recent drowning cases than the rest.

79
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,025
And all the bodies
will have something in common.

80
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:32,827
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, SAFE NATION

81
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,456
Hey, I just arrived.

82
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,167
I brought some snacks.

83
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,626
Okay.

84
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,176
Get out. Do you want to die?

85
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,723
How dare that scumbag order me around?

86
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,061
-What are you doing?
-Gosh, you startled me.

87
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,731
Detective Ham, why did you come out?

88
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,649
Why are you lifting fingerprints?

89
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,611
Someone stole from my car.

90
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,029
I need to catch them.

91
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,365
Who would steal
from that rundown car of yours?

92
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,242
I know, right?

93
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,578
Can you identify the fingerprints?

94
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,371
Will you do that for me?

95
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,832
Submit an official report.

96
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,709
So is that why you're here?

97
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,507
Here.

98
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,053
You brought me instant noodles? Really?

99
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,599
Nowadays, you can order the best food
with your phone anytime you want.

100
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,689
Come on. Instant noodles are the best
when you're working late.

101
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:48,110
Here. Have some of this hot broth.

102
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,447
I know you're here to ask for a favor.
Is this a bribe?

103
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,824
Don't be ridiculous.

104
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,577
I just have a few questions.

105
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,662
I was right.

106
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,207
-I don't want it.
-Look.

107
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,503
I was asked to look for someone.

108
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,297
A young lady has disappeared.

109
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,883
Her parents talked to
a gifted female shaman,

110
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,638
and she said their daughter
was drenched or something.

111
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,557
A shaman in this day and age?

112
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,725
There are many reservoirs in Hwanam.

113
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,353
Were any of them peculiar?

114
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,146
Perhaps, many drownings?

115
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,858
People often slip and fall
while fishing at reservoirs.

116
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,860
-It's nothing…
-Exactly. Things like that.

117
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,113
But there weren't any unidentified bodies.

118
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,031
None of them match
the one you're looking for.

119
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,158
They were all accidents or suicides…

120
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:47,211
There must be something
that's bothering you.

121
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,173
You see…

122
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,594
It's quite strange.

123
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,345
All the drowning victims

124
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,306
had one dislocated leg.

125
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,017
It's not like some monster
could have pulled them underwater.

126
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,103
-Are you serious? Which reservoir?
-Why do you ask?

127
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,857
Well, I'm just curious. That's all.

128
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,902
I've been fishing lately,
so I want to avoid that place.

129
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,948
So which reservoir is it?

130
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,243
Tell me.

131
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,982
And now, I can finally rest.

132
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,635
Do you think he'll return?

133
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,012
Maybe.

134
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,431
This could be his hunting ground.

135
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,017
What about Si-ho?

136
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,353
Do you think she's safe?

137
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,356
Until tonight, yes.

138
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,742
But why are you trying to save her?

139
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,411
Even back at the mountain,

140
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,914
you seemed to be
genuinely worried about her.

141
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,562
It's not him.

142
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,688
How do you know?

143
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,612
I can sense Monsters when they get near.

144
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,115
And he's not one of them.

145
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,452
You can sense them? How?

146
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,872
When they're around me,

147
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,499
my entire body trembles.

148
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,918
I get goosebumps too.

149
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,212
I've always been like this.

150
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,595
Hello?

151
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,056
It's Detective Kwon.

152
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,686
A chair only for me?

153
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,272
What about you two?

154
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,566
Don't you have more chairs?

155
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,569
I live alone, so I don't.

156
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,864
What did the police say?
Any peculiar drowning cases?

157
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,701
First, get rid of him.

158
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,623
This will be disturbing
and not suitable for minors.

159
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,749
Come on.

160
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,709
Was someone kidnapped?

161
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,961
A peculiar drowning case?

162
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,839
How mysterious. So what is it?

163
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,634
Listen to him. Go.

164
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,177
You too?

165
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,888
Forget it.

166
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,934
Please continue.

167
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,393
What?

168
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,812
Right.

169
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,524
All of the victims

170
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,529
had a dislocated leg.

171
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,533
How did you know?

172
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,451
I met him a long time ago.

173
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,495
-A long time ago?
-That's how he works.

174
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,247
He pulls them underwater and kills them.

175
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,876
To the point
that their legs are dislocated?

176
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,628
How is that possible?

177
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,756
I have something to tell you.

178
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,841
The man who kidnapped my sister

179
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,762
-is not an ordinary human.
-What do you mean?

180
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,224
They were Monsters
who reincarnated as humans.

181
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,020
What? Monsters? Reincarnation?

182
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,314
What are you on about?

183
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,233
Just believe me for now.

184
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,277
My goodness.

185
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,240
But first, please tell us
what you found out.

186
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,200
Where is that reservoir?

187
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,870
How will that help you
locate the kidnapper?

188
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,497
He used to have
a hiding place by the waterside.

189
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,500
If things haven't changed,
he'll probably be at the reservoir.

190
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,217
Dalmyeong Reservoir.

191
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,637
It's fairly close to the place
we went to yesterday.

192
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,950
If he's here,

193
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,745
does that mean Si-ho is too?

194
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,334
He had a hiding place
near a reservoir back then too.

195
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,085
It was his nest.

196
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,297
He'd capture his victims
and keep them there.

197
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,580
Keep this just in case.

198
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,916
Don't hesitate to stab him
if you're in danger.

199
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,251
What's wrong?

200
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,003
Well, the thing is…

201
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,798
I've never used one before.

202
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,634
You can do it.

203
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,220
You've taken many lives
with one in your previous life.

204
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,057
Just give it to me and cut the nonsense.

205
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,440
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
OFF LIMITS

206
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,778
CLOSED FOR RENOVATION

207
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,029
Who are you?

208
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,409
Are you the only one here?
Is there no one else?

209
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,327
We're closed due to construction.

210
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,454
This place has been vacant
for some time now.

211
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,747
Goodness.

212
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,582
I don't think he's here.

213
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,302
He's inside.

214
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,638
He's looking at me right now.

215
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,395
What are you doing?

216
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,398
What the hell?

217
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,192
What…

218
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,878
Did you find him?

219
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,589
Who are you people?
I'm going to call the cops!

220
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,340
-Well…
-What is this?

221
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,844
I'm a cop. You don't need to report this.

222
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,580
How did you know I was here?

223
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,956
Why are you interfering?

224
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,836
I'm here for the woman you kidnapped.

225
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,546
Where is she?

226
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,594
He promised to hand over
that woman if I kept her sister captive.

227
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,304
Dark Hole…

228
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,516
Dark Hole deceived me.

229
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,528
Where is he?

230
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,323
Where is that bastard?

231
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,690
Where is she?

232
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,960
Pull yourself together.

233
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,130
It's not real.
It's a memory from your previous life.

234
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,339
Look.

235
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,759
Look! You're okay. Your arm is intact.

236
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,602
It hurt like hell just a few seconds ago.

237
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,936
What happened?

238
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:49,897
Where did he go?

239
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,786
HIGH-PRESSURE COMPRESSOR ROOM

240
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,345
Si-ho.

241
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,180
Si-ho.

242
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,266
EQUIPMENT ROOM

243
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,781
Si-ho.

244
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,576
Si-ho.

245
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,704
Are you okay?

246
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,623
Are you hurt?

247
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,292
I'll get you out of here.

248
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,760
-Sang-un.
-I finally get to meet you.

249
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,221
I've been wanting to kill you.

250
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,225
No!

251
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,559
No!

252
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,146
Die!

253
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,947
Run!

254
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,031
Run!

255
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,575
-Where do you think you're going?
-Sang-un!

256
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,036
Sang-un!

257
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,171
Are you okay? Get in.

258
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,759
Go upstairs and leave the building.

259
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,802
What about you?

260
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,015
I'll only put you in danger.

261
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,643
Sang-un!

262
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,029
Are you all right?

263
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,829
I'm okay.

264
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,540
Why did you come back?

265
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,751
How could I possibly leave you behind?

266
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,920
Let's go. Okay?

267
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,880
Hold on.

268
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,299
He's still fighting him.

269
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,467
I need to help.

270
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,511
Don't be ridiculous.

271
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,721
The man who jumped
into the water was Bulgasal.

272
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,932
How did you know that?

273
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,310
I met him at our house.

274
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,146
I touched him and he didn't seem human.

275
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,816
He wants you dead, doesn't he?

276
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:26,029
That's why we need
to run away. Let's go. Okay?

277
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,241
Wait. But…

278
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,951
We need to hurry!

279
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,378
We need to go!

280
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,138
What is it?

281
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,071
What are you going to do?

282
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,589
Sang-un, I think he's dead.

283
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,549
He's not breathing.

284
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,970
The police are coming!

285
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,434
Is he…

286
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,020
Is he okay?

287
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,190
He is. He's just unconscious.

288
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:23,081
Si-ho, he's the detective
who was in charge of our case.

289
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,301
You look oddly familiar.

290
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,014
Have we met before?

291
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,767
No.

292
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,398
What?

293
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:55,613
Isn't that the kidnapper?

294
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,574
How did he…

295
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,036
Did this man…

296
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,748
Sir, can you please just let us go?

297
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,874
What?

298
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,127
Once the police arrive,
we need to explain what--

299
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,713
Exactly. Please let us leave with him…

300
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,549
before they come.

301
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,770
Are you really going to take him with us?

302
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,607
But he's Bulgasal as well.

303
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,569
Do you remember
what Sang-yeon told us to find?

304
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,866
The sword that could kill Bulgasal.

305
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,867
Yes.

306
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,536
It's him.

307
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,247
He's the sword
I've been looking for all this time.

308
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,084
I finally managed to find him,

309
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,336
so I can't leave him behind.

310
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,506
He's mine.

311
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,925
He's my sword.

312
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,555
Where are we headed?

313
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,893
A place that's somewhat safe.

314
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,866
How did it go?

315
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,660
What?

316
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,412
Who is she?

317
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,122
Is she…

318
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,374
Yes. She's my sister.

319
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,377
No way.

320
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,088
Did you guys save her together?

321
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,303
Are you okay?
How was it? Weren't you scared?

322
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,181
Who is this chatty kid?

323
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,308
He knows this man. Help me.

324
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,310
What? Sure.

325
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,646
Unbelievable.

326
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,444
Damn, he's heavy.

327
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:58,987
Gosh.

328
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,407
I can't carry him upstairs.

329
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,701
That's enough exercise for a year.

330
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,956
-What happened to him?
-Well…

331
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,752
He hasn't been breathing
since he went underwater.

332
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,548
Hey. Open your eyes, will you?

333
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,799
Hey.

334
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,384
What should I do?

335
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,136
Maybe he drowned.

336
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,971
Perform CPR on him.

337
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,181
Do you know how?

338
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,099
I did learn it in PE class.

339
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,685
But I don't want to do it.

340
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,522
If I do it, I'm afraid I may never go back

341
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,941
to my old self.

342
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,196
What?

343
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,990
What? What did you say?

344
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,617
Your sister is calling for me.

345
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,119
Yes, I'm coming.

346
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:20,360
One, two, three, four,

347
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,362
five, six…

348
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,496
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

349
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:56,312
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,
eighteen, nineteen…

350
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,958
How could Bulgasal die?

351
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,960
This isn't funny.

352
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,962
Wake up.

353
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,758
What should I do?

354
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,437
What are you doing?

355
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,315
You're alive.

356
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,527
What do you think I'm doing?

357
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,154
I'm saving you.

358
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,665
Where am I?

359
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,791
It's your house.

360
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,711
The police came,
so we had to flee the scene.

361
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,385
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

362
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,473
Where is that woman, Si-ho?

363
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,850
Oh…

364
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,395
She's safe. She's here too.

365
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,902
Hey.

366
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,279
Thank you.

367
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,077
Thank you for saving my sister.

368
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,120
I don't want to hear it, so leave.

369
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,923
Is it broken?

370
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,758
-I can help--
-I said leave.

371
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,887
All right. I'm leaving.

372
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,182
Is this how you treat
someone who saved your life?

373
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,219
This used to be my room,
but you guys can use it.

374
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,262
I know it's messy.

375
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,056
Do you live here?

376
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,184
But…

377
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,187
do you know that he's not human?

378
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,773
Of course, I do.

379
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,484
We have no secrets.

380
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,322
Aren't you scared?

381
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,410
Are you a scaredy-cat?
He's totally awesome.

382
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,454
He's strong and immortal.

383
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,248
Isn't he incredible? I envy him.

384
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,876
Are you stupid? That means he's dangerous.

385
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,879
Not at all. He may be ill-tempered,

386
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,298
and he may sound mean,
but he never kicked me out.

387
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,507
I bet he was lonely.

388
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:14,927
Rest up.

389
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,308
He's alive.

390
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,774
That man is weird, but so is that kid.

391
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,527
Still, I think he has a good heart.

392
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,364
Let me see.

393
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,868
-What are you doing?
-You have dried blood here.

394
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,620
-Let's go to a hospital.
-No.

395
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,497
Does it hurt? Are you dizzy?

396
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,582
I'm fine.

397
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,085
I'm really okay.

398
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,630
Since I'm dense,
I must also have a strong skull.

399
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,054
Hey…

400
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,559
I'm sorry.

401
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,315
I'm sorry, Si-ho.

402
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,902
Sang-un.

403
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,740
You must have been scared.

404
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,077
I was.

405
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,249
And I also realized
that you were telling the truth all along.

406
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:30,044
Sang-un, I'm so sorry
that I didn't believe you

407
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,879
this whole time.

408
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,218
It's okay.

409
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,762
I'm the one who's sorry.

410
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,348
You had to suffer because of me.

411
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,189
I'll make sure to keep you safe…

412
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,195
at all costs.

413
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,469
What are you doing here?

414
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:06,140
Well, I was just worried
that you might change your mind overnight

415
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,558
and kill us.

416
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,394
I was keeping an eye on you.

417
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,944
Where are you going in that condition?

418
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,072
To the kitchen. I need some blood.

419
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,907
Blood?

420
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,161
Relax. It's not human blood.

421
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,456
Then wait.

422
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,708
I'll get it for you.

423
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,794
Forget it.

424
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,673
You can barely walk.

425
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,758
Wait here.

426
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,158
What's wrong?

427
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,452
Are you disgusted?

428
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,579
You, who fed off human blood?

429
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,959
Will you stop it already?

430
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,170
I don't want to argue
with someone who is hurt.

431
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,508
By the way, what's your name?

432
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,760
Why do you want to know?

433
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,096
I don't think we're that close.

434
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,347
I see.

435
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,058
Then I'll call you whatever I want.

436
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,519
"Bul" must be your surname
since you're Bulgasal.

437
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,856
How does Mr. Bul sound?

438
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,112
Anyway, let me know if you need anything.

439
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,823
Why did you do it?

440
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,786
-What?
-You could have just left me back there.

441
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:52,913
Why did you save me?

442
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,422
Because I need you.

443
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,800
You're the sword that can kill Bulgasal.

444
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,762
Ok Eul-tae.

445
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,728
That's the name of the guy
you want to kill.

446
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,383
Don't believe anything she says.
She's lying to you.

447
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,972
You want to know who killed the kidnapper?

448
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,684
How would I know?

449
00:39:56,602 --> 00:40:00,106
Who else would know?
You were the only one at the scene.

450
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:06,904
Who is it? Who killed Kang Cheol-yong?

451
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,657
Gosh, this…

452
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,868
This doesn't taste like it did back then.

453
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,080
Can you please stop eating?
Are you shooting an eating show?

454
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,082
To hell with that.

455
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,085
Why am I in an interrogation room?
Am I a suspect?

456
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,336
You're a witness!

457
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,588
A serial killer has died.

458
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,760
Who killed him?
You know who did it, don't you?

459
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,975
You see…

460
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,938
I brushed past someone
on my way to the pool,

461
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,608
but I couldn't see clearly.
I don't remember.

462
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,902
At this age,

463
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:51,574
my vision has become blurry,
and I've become more forgetful.

464
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,786
I definitely smell something fishy here.

465
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,413
That's your mouth.

466
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,748
Gosh, you reek of cigarettes.

467
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,417
Are you not going to quit?

468
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:07,047
More importantly,
have you identified the fingerprints?

469
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,009
Right. Whose fingerprints are they?

470
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,844
They couldn't be identified.

471
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,471
What?

472
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,015
Excuse me.

473
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,560
Hello, Chief.

474
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,354
No identity?

475
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,273
Sorry?

476
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,608
What's his deal?

477
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,902
Yes, sir.

478
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,699
Ho-yeol, you should go
if you're done eating.

479
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,784
All of a sudden?

480
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,208
What's going on? No more questions?

481
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,751
I've been ordered to wrap it up.

482
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,128
The culprit committed suicide.

483
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,466
Did you just say

484
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,968
suicide?

485
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,638
Yes. They just received
his autopsy report.

486
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,265
It was suicide.

487
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,774
Hey, Chief Park. How did it go?

488
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,778
Damn it! I don't care
if it was suicide or homicide!

489
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,155
Who cares how a serial killer died?

490
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,617
Look. Just wrap it up.

491
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,538
This is just going
to taint our city's reputation. Got it?

492
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:26,502
That son of a bitch.
I ought to teach him a lesson.

493
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,092
Where is the chairman?

494
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,302
He's running a bit late.

495
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,139
Please be patient, sir. He's in a meeting.

496
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,195
Why did you fail?

497
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,243
Was bringing Min Si-ho such a hard task?

498
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,454
When I arrived, they had already left.

499
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,999
Kang Cheol-yong was dead,
and the police were there. I'm sorry.

500
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,875
I see.

501
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,505
None of us imagined that
Dan Hwal would find that place so quickly.

502
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,757
You're right. I was careless.

503
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,218
But…

504
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,806
why couldn't you have driven faster?

505
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,601
I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

506
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,855
All right. Do as you please.

507
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,195
Get rid of the garbage in the basement.

508
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,581
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Mayor.

509
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,420
Did you put an end to it?

510
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,088
Please have a seat.

511
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,257
Yes, sir.

512
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,678
I did what you asked me to do.

513
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,430
You don't need to worry.

514
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,516
Don't be so arrogant,
and keep an eye on them.

515
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,434
Yes, sir.

516
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:32,771
No, wait.
You did a great job 15 years ago.

517
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,107
That's how you became the mayor, right?

518
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,693
You should run
for a higher position next.

519
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,320
Thank you, sir.

520
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,948
You've helped me
so much from the beginning.

521
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,243
By the way…

522
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:52,249
you haven't changed one bit
since I first saw you 15 years ago.

523
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,918
Is there a secret to your youth?
May I ask how old you are?

524
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:02,134
You're asking me questions?

525
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,302
Sorry?

526
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,804
You didn't ask why I wanted
to put an end to the case,

527
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,890
but you must be
awfully curious about my age.

528
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,017
I'm sorry, sir.

529
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,814
Why would a dog be interested
in its owner's age?

530
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:31,079
Doting on your dog will only spoil him.

531
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,792
At times, you need to tighten its collar

532
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,295
to make it respect you. Right?

533
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:41,548
Was it necessary for him
to wrap up the case?

534
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,675
You didn't need to protect Dan Hwal.

535
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,052
No, I do.

536
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,262
I need to win him over at all costs.

537
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,600
It seems like he and Sang-un
have joined hands after this incident.

538
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,101
Join hands?

539
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,990
That trust is going to break.
Do you know why?

540
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,494
It's because he despises her
more than he despises me.

541
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,040
How long do you think he can endure
having his enemy by his side?

542
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,856
This girl has finally brought you to me.

543
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:25,277
The scar on your hand. That brand.

544
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,406
You can never run away from me.

545
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:34,745
My curse has not ended yet.

546
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,098
What was that?

547
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:50,195
I only opened it slightly.

548
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,864
-Slightly?
-And it fell off.

549
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,412
Gosh, I barely managed to fix it.
Why did you touch it?

550
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,748
Here. Let me show you.

551
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,583
How can someone live here?

552
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,002
Everything's broken and there's no food.

553
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,045
Tell me about it.

554
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,424
Are you hungry?
Should I go out and buy some food?

555
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,591
The store is quite far but…

556
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,884
Really?

557
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,011
Then I'll go.

558
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,806
Sure.

559
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,933
Where are you going?

560
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,480
Oh, I'm going to the grocery store.

561
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,190
None of us have eaten.

562
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,956
It's too dangerous to go out. Wait.

563
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,043
It's me. Where are you?

564
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,212
I need you to run an errand.

565
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,341
You make me deliver food now?

566
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,551
I had no choice.

567
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,179
I can't go out since I injured my leg.

568
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,473
-Is it bad? Let me see.
-I'm okay.

569
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,851
I told you to be careful.

570
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,315
I'm the only one
who'll suffer if you hurt yourself.

571
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,567
Why are you coming in? Just leave it.

572
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,943
I'm going to eat here.

573
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:23,121
Are we having a party?
Why did you bring meat?

574
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:26,583
Then what did you expect
a butcher to bring?

575
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,461
Gosh. You run a butcher shop?

576
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,046
You're always welcome here.

577
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,673
Who is this sly boy?

578
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,676
Sorry? No one has ever called me that.

579
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,095
Right. I've been called a cool guy before.

580
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,514
I am quite cool, aren't I?

581
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,766
Is the meat ready?

582
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,562
Why aren't you eating?

583
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,690
Here. It's perfectly cooked.
I don't want to overcook it.

584
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,150
Thank you.

585
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,568
You didn't get hurt, right?

586
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,447
Why did you have to run away
and cause this mess?

587
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,074
Why did you do it?

588
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,957
I saw a photo of him.

589
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,334
He seemed suspicious.

590
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,628
-What photo?
-What?

591
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,880
It's nothing.

592
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:14,798
What is it?

593
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,346
Hello. We met at the mountain, right?

594
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,014
I'm Min Sang-un.

595
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,101
I'll cook the meat.

596
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,520
Sure. Will you?

597
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,866
Eat up.

598
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,325
Okay.

599
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,288
I should bring some pepper.

600
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,631
What is it?

601
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,135
Are you going to let
Min Sang-un stay here?

602
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:01,720
For now.

603
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,973
-Ok Eul-tae is still after her.
-What?

604
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:08,059
You're going to let your former wife
and her killer stay here together?

605
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,270
Gosh. This is unbelievable.

606
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,273
Did she agree to this
despite knowing your plans?

607
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,525
She must hate Ok Eul-tae
more than she hates me.

608
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,486
She's really something.

609
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,531
She decided to stay in a lion's den
so she could kill her enemy?

610
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,620
Here. Eat up.

611
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,414
Stop cooking and eat already.

612
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,625
I am eating.

613
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,085
But I don't crave meat at this hour.

614
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,754
Why not? I do.

615
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:41,009
Right. What's your real age?

616
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,762
You said you were 30
while wearing a school uniform.

617
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,972
I had no choice
but to lie in that situation.

618
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,642
Thirty? He's obviously a kid.

619
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:54,064
A kid? I've been through
all the highs and lows of life.

620
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,608
I've experienced everything.

621
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,818
So? Is that why
you're not at school right now?

622
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,528
-School's on break.
-Liar.

623
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,240
School is boring since I have no friends.

624
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:07,243
You don't go to school for fun.
You should at least graduate.

625
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,662
I can take the GED.

626
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,665
Hey, do you think that's easy?

627
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,378
Nothing in life is easy.
Everyone struggles these days.

628
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:19,923
You're an extremely naive woman,
aren't you?

629
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,800
-What?
-All right. That's enough.

630
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,427
Have some more meat. You too.

631
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,512
Give me more.

632
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,681
Give me more.

633
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,309
Who could that be?

634
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,728
We're not expecting anyone.

635
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,814
Coming.

636
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,449
You again? What is it this time?

637
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,619
I'm not here to see you.

638
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,664
Where is he?

639
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,430
It seemed like you were dying,
but you're fine now.

640
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,061
Can I talk with you in private?

641
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,899
Whatever you're doing,

642
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,610
I want in.

643
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,864
What? What do you mean?

644
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,824
Catching Bulgasal.

645
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,953
Ms. Min told me that you could catch him.

646
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,288
Why all of a sudden?

647
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,623
I'm helping you catch a killer,
so what's the issue?

648
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,626
He killed her mother
and sister 15 years ago.

649
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,172
And he's covering up
all the incidents related to Bulgasal.

650
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,173
I need to catch him.

651
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,133
I thought you were no longer a cop.

652
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,719
-This has nothing to do with you now.
-It does.

653
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,766
I have something to ask him.

654
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,392
What is it?

655
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:57,604
Did he do something to you?

656
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,776
Bulgasal is here.

657
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,028
Bulgasal is…

658
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,205
You don't need to know.

659
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:19,584
A Monster like him
who murders people needs to be caught.

660
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,088
To be honest…

661
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,092
I thought you were Bulgasal at first.

662
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:31,012
But since Ms. Min is here with you,
that's probably not the case.

663
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,430
But still,

664
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,933
you seem suspicious.

665
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,976
Why?

666
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:42,899
The police couldn't identify you.
It was as if you didn't exist.

667
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:48,530
And you also found that serial killer
who was one of the Monsters in the past.

668
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,618
Tell me. Who exactly are you?

669
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:54,744
What is your name?

670
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,542
Then from this moment on,

671
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,837
your name shall be Hwal.

672
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,047
Hwal.

673
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,966
It means rebirth.

674
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,219
I'm Hwal.

675
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,471
Dan Hwal.

676
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,433
Hwal? What a peculiar name.

677
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:20,603
Do you mean Hwal as in "bow"?

678
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:24,983
Am I wrong?

679
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:28,736
If you can't be identified,

680
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,281
who owns this house and your cars?

681
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,825
Did you get them through illegal means?

682
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,162
Hey, you.

683
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,331
You've totally crossed the line.

684
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,126
Why would you barge in here
and pester him?

685
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,294
Who are you?

686
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,422
He was a detective. A former detective.

687
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,674
Former?

688
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:53,344
You're not a detective now,
so why would you interrogate him?

689
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,347
Then who are you
to interrupt our conversation like this?

690
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,601
He's my son. So?

691
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:03,938
His dad wasn't around when I gave birth,
so I couldn't register him. Happy?

692
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:07,150
What kind of ridiculous…

693
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,778
Sir, have you eaten yet?

694
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,490
The meat is scrumptious.

695
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,450
-Come have some.
-No.

696
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,035
Come on.

697
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,579
What? He's your son?

698
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,294
Son?

699
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,171
What else could I say?

700
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,715
I was smart, right?

701
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,887
What? Money for the meat?

702
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,348
No. There's no rice
and you don't have a rice cooker.

703
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,934
Will you let them starve?
I should go buy some stuff.

704
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:44,062
Some allowance would be nice too.

705
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,980
For your dear mother.

706
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,359
Please?

707
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,324
Hello, sir.

708
00:58:56,991 --> 00:59:00,495
I just came by to see how you were doing.

709
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,747
I see.

710
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:07,252
Look. Thank you for helping us yesterday.

711
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,128
Don't mention it.

712
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,298
I wasn't of any help 15 years ago.

713
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:16,052
By the way, how is your sister?

714
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,098
Are you okay?

715
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:23,935
Yes.

716
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,107
She injured her head
when she was kidnapped.

717
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,442
I'd like for her to receive a checkup.

718
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,112
May I ask you for a favor?

719
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,575
-Sure.
-Could you drop us off at the hospital?

720
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,330
-No, it's okay. I'm fine.
-No. You should go.

721
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,040
It's too dangerous for us to go alone.

722
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,584
You should listen to her.

723
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,129
How about we head out right now?

724
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,547
Get ready and come out.

725
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,640
-What?
-Will we be okay?

726
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,809
Didn't you say
we shouldn't trust the police?

727
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,228
Right.

728
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,941
But I think we can trust him.

729
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,986
Si-ho, go downstairs first. Okay?

730
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,655
I'm really fine.

731
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,018
Run!

732
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,144
Hurry!

733
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:07,997
I will help you,

734
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,208
but you will help me too.

735
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,752
Find a way to kill him.

736
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,131
Until I kill him…

737
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,468
I will let you live as a human.

738
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,160
Hey.

739
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,414
I'm going to the hospital
with my sister and Detective Kwon.

740
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:50,957
Detective Kwon?

741
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,167
Then you don't need to go.

742
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,712
They can go without you.

743
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,840
No. I need to go too.

744
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:01,259
-I have to get some stuff from home.
-Forget about that.

745
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:03,052
They're all useless.

746
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,345
They're not useless.

747
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,389
They're all I have
to remember my mom and sister by.

748
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,307
Like family photos.

749
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,519
That's why they're useless.

750
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:12,854
They're not your family.

751
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:17,316
They were just unlucky people
who reincarnated as those close to you.

752
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,194
Unbelievable.

753
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:22,947
You just made me
want to go there even more.

754
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,494
Do you still not get it?

755
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,538
You're not going anywhere without me.

756
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:34,333
The moment you asked me
to kill Ok Eul-tae,

757
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,711
you became mine.

758
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:38,921
So do as I say.

759
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,344
No. You must be mistaken.

760
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,680
I'm here because I want to.

761
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,724
You're the sword that I found.

762
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,935
The sword that can kill him.

763
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,483
Don't you dare go back.

764
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,736
He'll be waiting for you
with a knife in hand.

765
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:16,853
You've been running away so well,

766
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,646
Ms. Min.

767
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:31,158
THE SWORD THAT CAN KILL BULGASAL…

768
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,119
Would you look at that.

769
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,539
So you've decided to go this far.

770
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,856
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

771
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:04,233
You can go with Detective Kwon.

772
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,988
I'm sorry. Please take good care of her.

773
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,782
Don't be. You don't need to worry.

774
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,453
-Shall we go?
-Sure.

775
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:20,416
Sang-un!

776
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:25,838
I'll buy lots of good food.
Don't fight with him. Be cordial.

777
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,715
Shut it.

778
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,592
All right. Be safe.

779
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,636
Drive safely.

780
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,221
Is your leg all better now?

781
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:16,764
As you can see, yes.

782
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,479
Since we're alone, let's talk.

783
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,773
About how we can kill him.

784
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,369
Is this…

785
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:25,916
Is this really me?

786
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:31,714
I told you.

787
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,134
You've had numerous past lives.

788
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:37,261
These are traces of them.

789
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,447
What are you doing?

790
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,825
Why didn't you tell me you got hurt?

791
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:01,368
It's nothing.

792
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:03,954
Don't get up.

793
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,414
I just sprained it.

794
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,709
Didn't Teoreokson do this to you?
Do you want to be a cripple?

795
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,004
If Ok Eul-tae comes after you,
do I need to carry you?

796
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,424
Don't be an inconvenience.

797
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:17,510
That won't happen.

798
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,733
It's okay. Let me do it.

799
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:35,152
It's quicker if I do it.
I've done it many times.

800
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:41,575
How evil you were in your past life

801
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,828
and what you did to me.

802
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:47,915
You don't need to do this.

803
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,543
It's confusing whenever you help me

804
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,837
since I know you want to kill me.

805
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:56,465
So don't bother being nice to me.

806
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:12,606
I'll do as you say.

807
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:17,778
If I was Bulgasal in the past
and I murdered your family,

808
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:21,115
I'll give back your soul
once Ok Eul-tae dies.

809
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:25,202
I'll become Bulgasal
and lock myself up in that well.

810
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:30,958
I thought you had come up
with some grand plan.

811
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:33,169
Don't talk as if
it's your decision to make.

812
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,671
Because you don't have a choice.

813
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:38,132
You're wrong.

814
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:43,012
It is my decision to make.

815
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,974
Because I could betray you.

816
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:49,310
-Betray me?
-You have a weakness too.

817
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,562
You feel pain when you get hurt.

818
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,063
And it takes time to recover.

819
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:55,858
If I harm you enough that you can't move,

820
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:57,818
then I can run away from you.

821
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:00,487
Then I can just find you again.

822
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:02,573
I don't care how long it takes.

823
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:03,991
But it's agonizing.

824
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:06,785
The longer it takes,
the more agonizing it is.

825
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:09,955
Because of the memory
of losing your family.

826
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,208
It's painful.

827
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,668
I know how that feels.

828
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:21,425
But show me proof
that what you told me is true.

829
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,636
Then I'll do as you say.

830
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,015
Can you prove…

831
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,102
that my soul actually belonged to you?

832
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:36,106
The Monsters who are after you,
Teoreokson and Geuseunsae…

833
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,275
They all died at my hands.

834
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:41,904
They are after my soul
because they have a grudge against me.

835
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:44,907
What about proof that I was Bulgasal?

836
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:48,702
When you stole my soul as Bulgasal,

837
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:50,537
I stabbed you in the shoulder.

838
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:55,084
That's when you put a curse on that wound.

839
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:58,879
I will be born again

840
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,300
with this scar that you have given me.

841
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:05,427
You said you'd reincarnate

842
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,305
with that scar on your shoulder.

843
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,100
A scar on my shoulder?

844
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:15,229
A strange man was following me.

845
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:18,440
Did you see his face?
What did he look like?

846
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:22,069
He got out of the car
and asked to see my shoulder.

847
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:28,117
When I checked
your sister's dead body 15 years ago,

848
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,493
I saw the scar.

849
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,203
Since you two shared my soul,

850
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,580
you must have that scar as well.

851
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:45,259
Like you said, she had a scar
on her shoulder from birth.

852
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:47,678
But I…

853
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,639
I didn't have one.

854
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:53,767
That means…

855
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:57,479
I wasn't Bulgasal.

856
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:13,454
You…

857
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,501
Who exactly are you?

858
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:04,004
This is where you died a seventh time.

859
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:07,174
The neighbors said
that the crazy elder daughter

860
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:08,842
set the house on fire before running away.

861
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:10,928
I don't remember anything.

862
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:13,806
You have to remember your past lives.

863
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,141
You have to remember
how to kill Ok Eul-tae.

864
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,394
We should come running if we're summoned.

865
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,271
Hwal saved me when I was six years old.

866
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,273
Should I take a look?

867
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:26,276
If I want to be free from this pain…

868
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,862
I have to kill her as soon as I can.

869
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:34,660
