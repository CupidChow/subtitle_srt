EPISODE 3

2
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,468
I wanted to come one last time

3
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,721
before they demolished this place.

4
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,977
Today's the day you and Mom died.

5
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,566
I'm sorry, Sang-yeon.

6
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,822
It took me…

7
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,659
fifteen years to come back here.

8
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,081
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,219
Look for a way to kill Bulgasal.

10
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,888
You'll recognize it. It's…

11
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,099
But Sang-yeon…

12
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,477
I don't remember what you said after that.

13
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,688
It must have been important.

14
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,785
Run.

15
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,766
This place is off-limits.
What are you doing here?

16
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,269
Right. I used to live here.

17
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,354
I heard it's being demolished,
so I stopped by.

18
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,690
Good night, then.

19
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,069
Can you show us your ID?

20
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,824
Pardon? Why do you want to see my ID?

21
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,160
We received a report
about a suspicious man here.

22
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,454
There was a theft case nearby too.

23
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,958
If you refuse, you will have
to accompany us to the station.

24
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,045
Sure.

25
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,765
"Park Hui-cheol." Born in…

26
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,561
In 1960?

27
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,731
I look younger than my age, right?

28
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,400
A lot of people tell me I look younger.

29
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,321
This is Patrol One.
Requesting a background check.

30
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,865
The name is Park Hui-cheol.

31
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,075
His date of birth is September 21, 1960.

32
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,411
His date of birth is…

33
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,607
I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

34
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,083
Let's go.

35
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,876
To where?

36
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,294
Dogu-dong Intersection…

37
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,962
No. Wait.

38
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,135
Sir, drive me
to the front of Eunbaek Apartment.

39
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,014
To the front of Eunbaek Apartment?

40
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,558
Yes, but don't stop there.
Just keep driving.

41
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,895
There's something I want to check.

42
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,509
Where to now?

43
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,473
Dogu-dong Intersection…

44
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,154
Was it you?

45
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,324
The one who was here?

46
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:39,810
SI-HO

47
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,821
Hello?

48
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,658
Si-ho, where are you right now?

49
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,701
I just left work after my shift.

50
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,286
What is it?

51
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,540
Si-ho, can you hurry back home?

52
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,416
Something weird just happened to me.

53
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,545
What happened? Did you meet
weird people on the street again?

54
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,047
The ones who have been following you…

55
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,841
No. That's not it.

56
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,845
I think it was the guy from 15 years ago.

57
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,103
The power to break down a door…

58
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,522
It was the same as that night.

59
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,817
I think he was Bulgasal.

60
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,904
I haven't found a way to kill him yet.

61
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:36,242
Sang-un, let's talk about that
once I get home.

62
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,369
I need to take care of something.

63
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,204
What is it? What's wrong?

64
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,956
It's nothing serious.

65
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,541
Then come home now.

66
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,127
Si-ho, I want you to come home right now.

67
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,589
If he's really back,
we have to go somewhere else.

68
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,257
I can't come home tonight.

69
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,509
I'm having an important talk
with my boyfriend.

70
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,928
I'll call you later.

71
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,221
Make sure to lock up.

72
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,806
Hello?

73
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,558
Si-ho!

74
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,867
The person you are trying to reach--

75
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,816
I'm tired. And my feet hurt.

76
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,654
We have to hurry.

77
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,657
Where are we going?
Why do we have to leave home?

78
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,533
We can't live there anymore.

79
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,996
I miss Mom. And Sang-yeon too.

80
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,667
Where did they both go?

81
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,379
Mom and Sang-yeon…

82
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,933
We have to hurry. Let's go.

83
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,935
No, I'm not going!

84
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,105
Where did Mom and Sang-yeon go?

85
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,523
They're gone!

86
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,900
They're gone.

87
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,656
Mom and Sang-yeon aren't here anymore!

88
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,291
I brought some delicious apples
for you. Try some.

89
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,917
Gosh. Thank you.

90
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,756
They are my distant relatives.

91
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,134
Something happened, so I took them in.

92
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,136
Thank you for the apples.

93
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,555
-I hope you like them.
-Sure. Bye.

94
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,319
Si-ho.

95
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,286
You brought it, didn't you?

96
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,247
You brought that scary thing.

97
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,250
That's why Mom and Sang-yeon died.

98
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,214
No.

99
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,674
I didn't.

100
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,344
It's your fault.

101
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,763
It's all your fault!

102
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,073
Sang-yeon.

103
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,617
Why is he looking for me?

104
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,454
How can I kill Bulgasal?

105
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,458
What in the world…

106
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,132
is Bulgasal?

107
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,868
Hello, my good sir. You called again.

108
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,578
I haven't found the girl yet.

109
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,871
How many years has it been?

110
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,748
Isn't this your expertise?

111
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:02,169
Listen. I only have her photo and name.
That's all I have to go on with.

112
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,672
Right? This is tough for us too.

113
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,590
I went to the house she used to live in.

114
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,092
And someone had been there.

115
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,720
Gosh. Even so,
I doubt that it was Min Sang-un.

116
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,223
Get your men
to search the area just in case.

117
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,683
Well, to do that…

118
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,142
I'll need a bigger budget.

119
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,645
I'll give you the money, so just find her.

120
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,772
Really? Gosh, thank you…

121
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,402
Hello, you've reached
private investigator, Dachaja.

122
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,486
It's me.

123
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,907
-Did you find anything?
-Well…

124
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,617
It's not looking good.

125
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,786
We've been searching for two years but--

126
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,372
-I haven't even gone home for--
-Keep searching.

127
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,938
I will go after her.

128
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,442
And I will take revenge for my family.

129
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,863
Are you planning to find
the woman who will be reincarnated

130
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,115
as a human and kill her?

131
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,660
I will take her soul.

132
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,496
Just like she did to me.

133
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,751
I will turn her into Bulgasal
and put her away in a deep pit.

134
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,296
I will make her

135
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,549
live eternally as an immortal being

136
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,260
in darkness, despair, and solitude.

137
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,804
I will make her suffer
in pain for eternity.

138
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,933
That shall be my family's revenge.

139
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,936
And mine.

140
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,445
A young man with a dark hole.

141
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,740
He said he was after her soul.

142
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,121
That was when I realized

143
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,792
that I, alongside many others,

144
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,838
was after her soul.

145
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,560
I will not let you get away this time.

146
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,147
I will find you before those bastards do.

147
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,413
MAP

148
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,334
A STUDY ON SWORDS FROM JOSEON DYNASTY

149
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,381
Look for a way to kill Bulgasal.

150
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,174
How?

151
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,926
How do I look for it?

152
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,595
You'll recognize it. It's…

153
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,938
I need to go back
and put an end to this karma.

154
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,899
This is my final chance.

155
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,944
I need to find the sword
that can kill Bulgasal.

156
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,320
The same sword…

157
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,490
that killed me 600 years ago.

158
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,791
Where is it? Here.

159
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,129
MR. YOON, HANDLES ANTIQUE SWORDS
SAID HE WOULD CALL IF A SWORD CAME IN

160
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,673
The sword that can kill Bulgasal.

161
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,703
Sir.

162
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,664
Do I know you?

163
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:13,086
Goodness. You always seem
to know when to show up.

164
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,343
Sir, you received another sword
from the Joseon period, right?

165
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,805
Come on.
That's what you told me on the phone.

166
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,308
I didn't know I was talking to you.

167
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,435
Please, sir.

168
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,979
My goodness.

169
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,815
ENERGY DRINK

170
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,693
All right.

171
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,278
-Here.
-Gosh. Thank you.

172
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,663
You're not going to buy it,

173
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,249
but you always want to see
any new sword that comes in.

174
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,251
Exactly.

175
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,379
She's been checking swords
from every antique shop

176
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,005
in this alley for years.

177
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,343
I'm sorry.
But I really have to find something.

178
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,095
What is it?

179
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,139
A way to save my life.

180
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,975
I need that sword to save myself.

181
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:12,479
What? Goodness.
What a strange thing to say.

182
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,899
I just have a lot of interest
in ancient swords.

183
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,568
I bet you carried a sword
in your previous life.

184
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,613
-Right?
-Gosh. You're super smart.

185
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:27,035
I bet you're right. I must have wielded
my sword at bad guys in my previous life.

186
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,998
Goodness.

187
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,589
Look for a way to kill Bulgasal.

188
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,258
You'll recognize it.

189
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,110
No, it's not this one.

190
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,449
I don't know.

191
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,661
What is it? Is something wrong?

192
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,165
What? No.

193
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,710
Sir, please let me know
when you get another sword.

194
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,919
Gosh.

195
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,130
Thank you.

196
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:39,066
How on earth can I kill Bulgasal?

197
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,249
Your hands trembled

198
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,960
and you got goosebumps in the bus, right?

199
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,379
Yes. What was that about?

200
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,182
It means you recognize them as well.

201
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,643
You recognize those Monsters
from the past.

202
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,562
This won't be the last time you meet one.

203
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,842
Don't come after me.

204
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,760
-If you do--
-You.

205
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,555
How did you know I was watching you?

206
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,015
Can you sense people like me?

207
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,810
You can.

208
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,565
Come to think of it, you both knew
that I was watching you that day, right?

209
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,902
-What?
-Right?

210
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,241
Who are you?

211
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,368
How…

212
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,333
The smell of your soul.

213
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,751
The smell of your soul.

214
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,628
Who are you?

215
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,089
You've been following me the whole time?

216
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,800
I've been looking for you
ever since we met that day

217
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,220
because I couldn't forget you.

218
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:18,141
Why are you Monsters
trying so hard to kill me?

219
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,310
Doesn't this get old for you?

220
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,979
Please.

221
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,774
Stop following me.

222
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,653
Trying to run away
from Bulgasal is tough already.

223
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,656
Hey.

224
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,328
You know,

225
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,414
I remember the smell of your soul.

226
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,251
You just wait. I'll find you again. Okay?

227
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,588
No.

228
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,383
You reincarnated Monsters
will never catch me.

229
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,595
I don't plan on dying
before I kill Bulgasal.

230
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,972
No, you'll die.

231
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,599
Many others are looking
for you besides me.

232
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,062
Is there a fan club I don't know about?

233
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,233
So where are they now?

234
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,540
Oh, my stomach.

235
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:27,294
Getting mixed up with
that weirdo is causing me trouble.

236
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,136
Hot! You startled me!

237
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,721
When did you get here?

238
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,097
My heart!

239
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,766
You get startled every single time.

240
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,226
Just give me what you found.

241
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,187
I asked you countless times
to let me know when you come.

242
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,652
You stink!

243
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,697
You should wash up. You reek of alcohol.

244
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,198
My nose is really sensitive.

245
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,242
Well, to get that information,

246
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,369
I had to drink with a cop all night.

247
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,414
I actually stopped by the sauna.

248
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,792
This is the suspect
of the missing person cases, right?

249
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,627
Yes. But…

250
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,799
I don't think he's one of the psychopaths
you're usually looking for.

251
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,053
He was a suspect
but was released recently.

252
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,097
He's the culprit.

253
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,517
He's the one
who killed those missing people.

254
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,853
How do you know something the cops don't?

255
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,230
It's not like you're a gifted shaman.

256
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,608
He's done it before.

257
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,404
He and the others were born to kill.

258
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,241
Hey.

259
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,496
Sir. I'm just really curious.

260
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,623
Why are you looking for these criminals?

261
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,379
Because…

262
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,423
we are looking for the same woman.

263
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,257
Hey.

264
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,008
Who are you?

265
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,927
It was you, wasn't it?

266
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,887
What?

267
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,142
A kid from my orphanage went missing.

268
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,977
I saw the kid get into a car,

269
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,604
and it had your plate number.

270
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,150
You took the kid, didn't you?

271
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,693
Right.

272
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,239
The cops told me something about that.
They said someone saw my plate number.

273
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,575
Was that you?

274
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,534
What did you do?

275
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,828
That poor kid has no parents

276
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,997
and was even bullied
at school because of that.

277
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,582
What's the problem then?

278
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,418
-What?
-That kid has no friends

279
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,378
or parents who would be worried.

280
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,380
So what's the problem?

281
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,799
The world will be fine without that kid.

282
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,345
No one is even looking for that brat.

283
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,600
Right?

284
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,101
Gosh.

285
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,730
You really are an asshole.

286
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,234
Right.

287
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,738
Did you come here alone?

288
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,949
You're one fearless kid.

289
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,119
I own this building.

290
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,580
No. I brought someone.

291
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,624
Hey! Over here!

292
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,391
I had to keep a low profile
because of the cops.

293
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,145
This all worked out.

294
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,260
What are you doing in my parking lot?

295
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,846
We need to talk. Get out of the car.

296
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,764
Are you a cop?

297
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,392
I already talked to them.

298
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,811
Well, I'm not a cop.

299
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,605
But I know that you killed
the missing people from this area

300
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,607
over the past few years.

301
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:04,571
Come on. What a day!

302
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,782
Who are you?

303
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,660
How did it feel when you killed that kid?

304
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,791
It was fun.

305
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,377
I see.

306
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,921
It was?

307
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,090
I'm just joking.

308
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:29,721
I was joking because
you were asking me a ridiculous question.

309
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,682
Right. I'm sure it was fun for you.

310
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,563
You were born to do that.

311
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,358
You just followed your instincts,
so it's not your fault.

312
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,570
It was wrong that you were born a human.

313
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,033
You were never human anyway.

314
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,369
What are you talking about?

315
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,747
You think I'm a joke? You crazy…

316
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,153
Have you seen this girl?

317
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,700
Did you kill her too?

318
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,660
Who…

319
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,703
are you?

320
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,124
What about her?

321
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,879
I don't know.

322
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,839
I don't know!

323
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,218
Where am I?

324
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,097
You may not remember me…

325
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,643
but we've met before.
A very long time ago.

326
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,437
Where did she go?

327
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,523
I killed her.

328
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,199
I've met people like you for so long

329
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,575
that I'm sick of you.

330
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,038
You Monsters from previous lives

331
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,708
were reincarnated as humans.

332
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,292
Yet, you still kill humans.

333
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,295
But all of you…

334
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,465
looked for this woman.

335
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,759
You were good at finding her.

336
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,679
I heard you could recognize
the smell of her soul.

337
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,814
But I, the owner of that soul,
cannot sense it.

338
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,649
It…

339
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,777
smells awful here.

340
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,655
It makes me sick.

341
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,287
You can smell it?

342
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,417
Was she here?

343
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,583
You…

344
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,795
You stabbed me again in the same spot.

345
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,560
Why are you doing this to me?

346
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,813
I didn't do anything to you.

347
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,233
This is the only thing I know how to do.

348
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,194
Kill Monsters.

349
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,124
What?

350
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,459
He's already back for the bowl? Come on.

351
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,215
-Hey.
-I think we can find her.

352
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,508
What?

353
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,848
Wait. Is that blood?

354
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,725
Oh, this? It's nothing.

355
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,228
No, that looks like something to me.

356
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,151
Gosh. What are you up to now?

357
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,277
Just a hobby.

358
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,988
What kind of hobby involves
blood splattering?

359
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,660
Wait. Did you go and see
the guy in the case file I gave you?

360
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,456
No, I didn't. I'm still looking for him.

361
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,792
Stop lying. I've been
a private investigator for 30 years.

362
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,504
All those bastards
I found for you went missing!

363
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,964
Really?

364
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,383
What a coincidence.

365
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,309
No, I can't do this anymore.
I'm done here.

366
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,146
This is way too dangerous.

367
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,900
You've been doing this for 15 years.
Don't make a scene now.

368
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,319
Yes. I've known you for 15 years.

369
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,071
But I know nothing about you.

370
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,030
Or what you do.

371
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,533
Besides, how did you make that much money?

372
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,827
I don't work now.

373
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,664
But I've done all kinds of things
in the past to make money.

374
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,165
How old are you?

375
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,628
How come you never age?
Exactly how old are you?

376
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,963
I never counted.

377
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,464
Any family members?

378
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,635
I had a family, but not anymore.

379
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,263
-Why not?
-Why do you care?

380
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,765
That's enough about me.

381
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,861
What? Gosh, this is so much.

382
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,614
I'm not the one you need to interrogate.

383
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,907
Focus on finding the girl.

384
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,995
She's at a nearby place
that uses a lot of detergent.

385
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:13,165
Detergent?
Dry cleaners, laundromats, hotels…

386
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,709
That's a big range.

387
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,420
Come on. Do your money's worth.

388
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,505
Other agencies have already started.

389
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,133
Gosh. You should have told me sooner.

390
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,927
By the way,

391
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:28,556
I have one more question
I've been wanting to ask.

392
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,726
Why have you been searching
for Min Sang-un for the past 15 years?

393
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,315
For atonement.

394
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,109
ATONEMENT: TO MAKE UP FOR ONE'S
SINS THROUGH OTHER MERITS

395
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,944
I've wronged my family.

396
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,905
And it's not 15 years.

397
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,075
It's been much longer than that.

398
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,420
Hey, where are you?

399
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,380
Why did you call?

400
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,215
I'm sure you know why I called.

401
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,218
I have a nice gig.
Do you want it, Detective Kwon?

402
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,096
No. I don't want it.

403
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,307
I'm on a stakeout, so I'm busy. Bye.

404
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:17,605
Goodness. All you ever do
is tail cheating couples.

405
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,482
You were a detective. How embarrassing.

406
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,691
It's so good.

407
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,860
These are the only requests I get.
So what?

408
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,905
-I love you.
-I love you too.

409
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,491
Gosh. Look at them having a blast.

410
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,035
How could they do that to their families?

411
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,661
It's because you're picky.

412
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,872
Take one of my cases.
I'll outsource it to you.

413
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,374
It pays very well.

414
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,293
I don't accept cases
from gangsters, drug dealers, or stalkers.

415
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,587
-You know, right?
-None of the above.

416
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,006
It's your specialty.
You just have to find someone.

417
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,758
-Get it!
-Yes!

418
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,803
-We got one!
-We got one!

419
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,056
ATTENTION: PLEASE KEEP NOISE TO A MINIMUM,

420
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,350
REFRAIN FROM EXCESSIVE DRINKING,
AND DO NOT DISTURB OTHERS.

421
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,319
Hey.

422
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,114
Come on. What are you doing?

423
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,949
Your feet stink. Put them back on!

424
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,450
My feet stink?

425
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,661
Come on.

426
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,748
I wore them for only three days.
So they still smell fresh.

427
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,544
INSTANT COFFEE

428
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:25,172
Can't you brew me real coffee?
I don't want chemicals in my coffee.

429
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,716
Are you kidding me?
As the kids these days say,

430
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,094
this is legit! Legit coffee!

431
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,015
Detective Kwon,
close down that small agency of yours.

432
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,851
Why don't you join me?

433
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,727
That sounds awful. Why would I do that?

434
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,897
And stop calling me Detective.

435
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,315
I quit years ago.

436
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:47,153
Right. Why did you quit?
It's so hard to become a cop these days.

437
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,654
I got kicked out

438
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,865
because of some case from 15 years ago.

439
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,741
What case?

440
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,535
Why do you want to know?

441
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,205
By the way, who do I need to find?

442
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,381
Well, you see…

443
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,760
This case is supposed to be top secret.

444
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,350
He's an old client of mine,
so I need to do it myself.

445
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,685
But you know about my health.

446
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,438
Gosh, you're dragging this out.
Just tell me already.

447
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:38,746
This photo…

448
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,373
What? Does she remind you of someone?

449
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,627
I think I might know her.

450
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,297
Do you remember the culprit's face?

451
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,305
Who is this girl?

452
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,934
This is an old photo.

453
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,062
You need to find a girl
who looks like the one in the photo.

454
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,022
Apparently, she looks exactly the same.

455
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,819
Who is the client?

456
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,947
That's confidential. Don't ask.

457
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,032
If he plans to hurt this girl…

458
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,617
Don't ask me that either. I don't know.

459
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,285
Seriously. Who is the client?

460
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,165
What's gotten into you today?
You never asked before.

461
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:31,048
I'll double your fee.
And I'll pay you under the table.

462
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,717
Can't you just tell me?

463
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,471
I'll close down my agency
and work here for a small salary.

464
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,602
Come on. I know you're lying. Forget it!

465
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,857
Tell me who the client is!

466
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,196
What's wrong with you?
Did you have too much to drink?

467
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,569
Call me if you remember anything.

468
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,405
Get well soon.

469
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,288
KWON HO-YEOL

470
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,623
Bulgasal.

471
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,002
What?

472
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,590
Bulgasal. Bulgasal is coming.

473
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,385
Where did you hear that?

474
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,387
Who told you that?

475
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,556
What's wrong, Ho-yeol?

476
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,892
He's coming to kill us.

477
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,019
He's still looking for me.

478
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,607
Are you sure it was Bulgasal?

479
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:14,526
Are you certain?

480
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,202
Ho-yeol.

481
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,505
Wake up.

482
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,174
Please wake up.

483
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,385
Wake up.

484
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,597
Bulgasal is here.

485
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,031
Bulgasal is coming.

486
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,993
Bulgasal is…

487
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,749
"Bulgasal is coming."

488
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,751
"Bulgasal is…"

489
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,098
WOO PHARMACY

490
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,940
Goodness, so many bandages…

491
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,825
Are you okay?
Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

492
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,077
I'm all right. This is nothing new to me.

493
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,679
FROM SEONGJIN POLICE STATION

494
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,431
NOTICE OF VIOLATION

495
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,568
By the way,

496
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,029
why have you been searching
for Min Sang-un for the past 15 years?

497
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:49,825
For atonement.

498
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,956
I've wronged my family.

499
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,790
What's this?

500
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,668
Hey.

501
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,587
Wake up.

502
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,841
Wake up.

503
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,011
Wake up!

504
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,432
Step back.

505
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,100
Stay away, you murderer!

506
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,779
It just healed, you punk.
You stabbed me in the same spot.

507
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,907
What…

508
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,367
Did I just stab you?

509
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,745
I thought you were that murderer. Oh, no.

510
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,705
What do I do?

511
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,874
Where are you going?

512
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,212
I'll call 911 right now. My phone…

513
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,464
Forget it. You don't need to call.

514
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,633
How could I not?

515
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,717
Where's my phone?

516
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,348
Sir.

517
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,725
Let me borrow your cell phone.

518
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,478
What are you doing?

519
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,647
Get away from me.

520
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,731
Here it is.

521
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,608
You're getting a call.

522
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,324
-Where's my phone?
-What is it?

523
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,828
You asked me to look into places
that use a lot of detergent.

524
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:07,541
So I sent someone
to detergent factories and to hotels.

525
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,084
But the thing is…

526
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,213
it will take
about three to four days to check.

527
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,923
No, that's too long.

528
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:17,300
We need to find her
before she finds out and runs.

529
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,596
Mister, you don't have time
to talk on the phone right now.

530
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:23,974
Look at all that blood.

531
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,517
Be quiet. Go away!

532
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,726
Call 911.

533
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,895
We have to call 911.

534
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,399
What is that? Are you in trouble?

535
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,401
No, I picked up a weird kid.

536
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,486
Me? Are you talking about me?

537
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,990
We have to call 911 right now.

538
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,408
You don't have time for this.

539
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,744
Tell me where to look. I'll go.

540
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,663
Text me the address.

541
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,792
What? Mister.

542
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,588
Don't tell me
you're going to drive in that state.

543
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,050
You could die.

544
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,260
I told you to forget it.

545
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,388
Don't come here again
unless you want to die.

546
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,598
What?

547
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,808
What…

548
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,993
MR. GU

549
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,334
What is it now? Just text me the address.

550
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,253
We'll look into the detergent factories.

551
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,923
But there are laundry plants
in the suburbs.

552
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,883
Do you want to check them out?

553
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,676
Where are they?

554
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,678
I'll text you the addresses.

555
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,118
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable--

556
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,677
Hyeon-ju.

557
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,887
Hyeon-ju!

558
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,056
What's on your mind today?

559
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,849
You totally spaced out.

560
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,936
Oh, my younger sister
isn't answering her phone.

561
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,106
She hasn't been picking up
after meeting her boyfriend.

562
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,150
That's because she's a young girl in love!

563
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:42,237
My daughter won't answer my calls
when she's with her boyfriend.

564
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:48,785
-Gosh, give me that. I'll do it.
-What?

565
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,745
I'm fine.

566
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,915
-You have the late shift tonight, right?
-What?

567
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,208
How about I do it?

568
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,501
Can you?

569
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,713
If the boss finds out,
we'll get an earful.

570
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,756
The boss told us to quit
if we're not well.

571
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,385
Gosh. Then we don't have to tell.
It'll be our secret.

572
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,512
You should go home and rest up.

573
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,889
Gosh, I feel awful.
You help me out every time.

574
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:14,227
You're so considerate
for a girl of your age.

575
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,814
Gosh. My kids don't know
that I work my ass off for them.

576
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,983
They get so mad whenever I nag them a bit.

577
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,027
We must have been enemies
in our past lives.

578
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:24,446
I envy you.

579
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,406
What? What do you envy?

580
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,742
Bickering with your family like that.

581
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,995
Goodness, that's an odd reason to envy me.

582
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,540
You don't bicker with your family?

583
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,209
I can't fight with my sister.

584
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,670
I wronged her a lot.

585
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,219
-Hold on.
-Sure.

586
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,596
SI-HO

587
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,728
-Hello?
-Hello?

588
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,064
Hey, Si-ho.
Why didn't you answer my calls?

589
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:02,025
Well, I just had something to sort out.

590
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,526
Where are you?

591
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,612
Gosh, Si-ho. I was worried.

592
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,323
I'm at the laundry plant.

593
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:12,494
SPOTLESS LAUNDRY PLANT

594
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,664
I've never seen her.

595
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,708
She doesn't work here.

596
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,170
There's another
laundry plant nearby, right?

597
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,882
There's one beyond that vacant lot.
It's over that way.

598
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,720
There's something I need to tell you.

599
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,810
Well, I…

600
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:44,150
Hello? Sang-un?

601
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,401
Are you okay?

602
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,737
Is something wrong?

603
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,948
What? No.

604
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,617
I just got a weird feeling.

605
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,629
Are you there, Sang-un?

606
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,589
-Yes.
-Are you okay?

607
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,924
I'm fine.

608
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:10,176
I didn't get much sleep
so I'm feeling kind of down.

609
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,554
So you have something to say?

610
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:16,182
No. I'll tell you when I see you later.

611
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,977
I'm working late today.
I'll be home pretty late.

612
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,480
I know. I'll hang up now.

613
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,815
Okay. See you later.

614
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,996
Are you going home now?

615
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,582
Hey. Are you sure you'll be okay?

616
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,459
Can you stay here alone?

617
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,210
You bet I can. Go home now.

618
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,422
Thanks. Hold on a second.

619
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,508
Hey, it's me.

620
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,802
Yes, I'm on my way home.

621
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,222
What? You're going to wait
for me at the bus stop?

622
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,516
Gosh, you don't have to.

623
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:23,833
So much dust.

624
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,975
Who are you? I didn't hear you come in.

625
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,770
I just knocked.
I guess you didn't hear it.

626
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,772
I just wanted to ask you something.

627
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:49,108
Is there anyone who resembles her
among your employees?

628
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,403
I asked who you are.

629
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,155
I'm from an errand service center.

630
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,698
I got a request to find her.

631
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,494
I see. Is that an old photo?

632
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:04,707
I see. Yes, it's her. This is Hyeon-ju.

633
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:07,877
Does she work here?

634
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,673
But why are you looking for her?
She caused trouble, didn't she?

635
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,299
Why do you ask that?

636
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,261
I knew something was off
the moment I saw her.

637
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,055
She didn't want to sign a contract.
She just wanted to work.

638
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,682
I knew it. This girl…

639
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,058
Is she still at the plant?

640
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,686
No, she went home. It's late already.

641
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,650
What? She's working outside?

642
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,196
Hey! Why are you doing that outside?

643
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,033
Stop that. Finish the rest inside! Okay?

644
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,997
Who's that?

645
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,583
Her name is Hong Ji-suk.
She's working late tonight.

646
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:50,336
Gosh. She's always complaining
that she's not well but I can't fire her.

647
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,298
If you want to see Hyeon-ju,
come back tomorrow.

648
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,465
Can I get her address?

649
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,969
I can't just give out addresses
to strangers.

650
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,315
Wait. Let's see…

651
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,598
I texted you an address.

652
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:46,684
It might be Min Sang-un's home address,
so go and check now.

653
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,729
What? You found out where she works?

654
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,147
Did you see her?

655
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,192
Not yet. That's why I'm asking you
to go check the address.

656
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,860
Do it now.

657
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:57,904
It might be a fake one.

658
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:04,452
SANGYONG LAUNDRY

659
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,879
He should buy us a new one.

660
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:34,440
Thank you.

661
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,693
Thank you!

662
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,219
You're super strong, mister.

663
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:06,389
Two men struggle to lift that.

664
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,016
Thank you.

665
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,852
Wait.

666
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:22,321
Here. This is the only thing
I can offer you.

667
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,073
-Take one, please.
-I'm good.

668
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,534
Come on. Don't turn it down.

669
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,703
Take one. Please?

670
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,961
Wait. Are you hurt?

671
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:39,839
-It's nothing.
-No, that looks serious.

672
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,758
You should go to a hospital.

673
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,176
Should I call the boss?

674
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,303
-You seemed to know--
-No.

675
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,096
I'll take care of it.

676
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:03,154
Did you check?

677
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,783
There's no house there. It's an empty lot.

678
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,743
That was quick. You're already there?

679
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,872
No. I looked it up on a map online.

680
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,624
I'm using a satellite map.

681
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:18,377
I can check out any address
with just a few clicks on my computer.

682
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,131
Why would I waste gas on that?

683
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,342
No. I told you to check it in person.

684
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,761
I'm not an old dog
who can't learn new tricks!

685
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,346
Forget it. I'll go myself.

686
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:55,122
Come on. Don't turn it down.
Take one. Please?

687
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,103
SANGYONG LAUNDRY

688
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:49,070
I told you I'd find you again!

689
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:04,460
Listen carefully. You have to live.
Live in hiding, and don't trust anyone.

690
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,215
And look for a way to kill Bulgasal.

691
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,220
Hey.

692
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,139
Hey.

693
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:01,350
How could this be?

694
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:03,936
Who the hell are you?

695
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:12,903
The smell of your soul…

696
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,115
It makes me sick.

697
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,578
The smell of your soul

698
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,330
makes me sick!

699
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,803
No. Don't go after him.

700
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,098
It's dangerous.

701
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:21,532
Are you all right?

702
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,993
You have a cut on your face.

703
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,328
Did he just do that to you?

704
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,501
Finally.

705
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,920
I finally found you.

706
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,298
Oh, no.

707
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:41,844
Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

708
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,346
I have spent a very long time

709
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:46,974
looking for you.

710
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,728
I desperately prayed
that we would meet again.

711
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:55,107
Well, thank you for helping me.

712
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,693
You helped me again.

713
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:01,322
I have never once forgotten

714
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,617
about taking revenge for my family

715
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,703
and the grudge I've held.

716
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,883
You have a cut on your face.

717
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:47,243
What did you just show me?

718
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,496
What exactly

719
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,957
are you?

720
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:03,384
Sang-un?

721
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:08,430
Is that you, Sang-un?

722
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:33,580
Who are you?

723
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:54,727
Are you okay?

724
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,067
Why are you here?

725
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:03,694
What's going on?

726
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:22,421
It is your fault.

727
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,881
Father!

728
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,142
You will cross paths one way or another.

729
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,393
Why did it have to be…

730
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:02,646
Either as enemies or as friends.

731
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,567
One of them has already found her.

732
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,486
The guy who lives here is really powerful.

733
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,990
Her soul will be ours!

734
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,994
Was he a Monster as well?

735
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:19,121
You're the one
who killed her family, aren't you?

736
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:21,290
Does that mean I'm not the only Bulgasal?

737
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:28,380
