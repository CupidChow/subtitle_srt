1
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,245
I said I had to
tell you something earlier.

2
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,791
The one who murdered
your family 600 years ago

3
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,292
wasn't me.

4
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,960
It was Ok Eul-tae.

5
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,215
What…

6
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,759
What do you mean?

7
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,177
Don't believe her.

8
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,222
Don't believe anything she says.

9
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,021
I see. So I was
the one who killed his family.

10
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,397
I killed them?

11
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,484
You think we'll believe you?

12
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,402
It was you

13
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,696
who killed his family.

14
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,368
Gosh. She's amazing.
That's some excellent acting.

15
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,786
Look at those sincere eyes.

16
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,704
She can't be lying with those eyes.

17
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,748
She's serious. She's not lying.

18
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,293
Now, she's even fooling herself. Right?

19
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:11,172
I pity you. I really do.

20
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,257
You have to believe me.

21
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,968
The one responsible
for your family's death 600 years ago--

22
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,222
How dare you lie,
pretending to have lost your memory?

23
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,974
Don't confuse him.

24
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,893
I know your secret.

25
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,688
If you hurt me,

26
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,773
you get hurt too.

27
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,027
You're in pain right now. Aren't you?

28
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,363
You managed to figure that out.

29
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,909
But if I do this, I will live

30
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,078
and you'll die.

31
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,436
Is what she said true?

32
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,648
Why won't you believe me? Why…

33
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,235
I'm going to find out the truth.
So you just wait.

34
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,327
Let's get away from here.

35
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:12,418
1,000 YEARS AGO

36
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,142
I heard you were going to Gaegyeong.

37
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,531
You must know that I deserve
more than this small mountain village.

38
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,369
I will leave behind my family
and only take my second son with me.

39
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,539
Then what do you plan
to do with your first son?

40
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,624
He is sick.

41
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,127
He coughs up blood.

42
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,130
And he started to go mad
after his mother died.

43
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,215
He cannot succeed me.

44
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,351
I am glad that I have
a second son from a second wife.

45
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,604
My second son takes after me in every way.

46
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,690
He is strong and brave.

47
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,541
Who's there?

48
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,257
What is it?

49
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,760
I cannot find our son, Eul-seo.

50
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,511
He went hunting this afternoon,

51
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,806
but he has not returned from
the forest where there is a Monster.

52
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,869
Was it a human or a Monster?

53
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,538
Who killed my son?

54
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,791
It was Bulgasal,

55
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,209
Father.

56
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,755
Eul-seo hunted in the mountains

57
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,925
where Bulgasal lives.

58
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,135
Bulgasal?

59
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,387
He was an exceptional warrior.

60
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,015
So other Monsters
could not have killed him.

61
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,649
Bulgasal? There is no such thing.

62
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,275
It is only a made-up story.

63
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,360
No, Father.

64
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,695
I saw it.

65
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,031
I even know where it is.

66
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,924
I must have lost my mind.

67
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,968
How did I end up helping Bulgasal?

68
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,472
Ms. Min. You knew he was Bulgasal, right?

69
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,015
Yes.

70
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,478
And yet, you still stayed
with him all this time?

71
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,605
It was to catch Ok Eul-tae.
I had no choice.

72
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,899
Hwal is the only one who can help me.

73
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,443
Even so,

74
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,487
don't you know what Bulgasal is?

75
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,739
Hwal is not like Ok Eul-tae.

76
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,450
He used to be human.

77
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,701
Human?

78
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,412
Yes. I'll explain the rest later.

79
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,874
But he's not healing.

80
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,710
It's probably because
the woman who kidnapped me

81
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,336
injected him with poison.

82
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,854
Damn it.

83
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,674
All right.

84
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,638
All good.

85
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,182
Let's go.

86
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,143
What is it?

87
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,870
Honey, you're bleeding.

88
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,627
Honey. He's gone.

89
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,508
-Don't go out. No. Don't!
-Wait.

90
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,428
Honey!

91
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,269
Father!

92
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,937
Father!

93
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,273
Father!

94
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,692
Hwal. Please wake up.

95
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,402
Hwal, wake up!

96
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,908
The one who murdered
your family wasn't me.

97
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,620
-It was Ok Eul-tae.
-Father!

98
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,413
Father!

99
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,539
Hwal.

100
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,127
Are you all right?

101
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,425
Do you know where you are?

102
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,473
It wasn't you?

103
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,559
The one who killed my family
was Ok Eul-tae?

104
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,940
It hurts. You're hurting me!

105
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,572
If it wasn't you, why were you there?

106
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,535
You were next to my dead son and wife,
covered in their blood.

107
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,996
I can't answer that
because I don't remember my past life.

108
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,374
Then how do you know it was Ok Eul-tae?

109
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,461
I heard it from the woman
who raised me and my sister.

110
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,297
Ms. Kim Go-bun.

111
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,216
She's Kim Hwa-yeon's sister.

112
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,552
I think she heard everything

113
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,555
from Kim Hwa-yeon
who remembered her past life.

114
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,143
I have to go see her.

115
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,478
What?

116
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,230
You want to go there in that state?

117
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,150
No, don't. I'll take you there
tomorrow morning. Okay?

118
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,238
Come on.

119
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,538
Are you all right?

120
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,221
You can have my blood.

121
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,056
You can't defeat Ok Eul-tae like this.

122
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,562
You stole my soul
and turned me into Bulgasal.

123
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,150
Are you trying to take away
my last trace of humanity now?

124
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,780
It's not that.

125
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,034
I'm afraid you might die
even though you're Bulgasal.

126
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,786
Move.

127
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,878
If you don't want it, that's fine by me.
I hate being in pain anyway.

128
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,422
But…

129
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,342
I wasn't human to begin with.

130
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,761
So wouldn't it be okay
if you drink my blood?

131
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,222
But you are human now.

132
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,390
I made a promise to someone

133
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,477
to never feed off human blood.

134
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,116
Because he's Bulgasal.

135
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,868
Just like me.

136
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,174
Oh, my. Are you out
to destroy that soju and beondegi?

137
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,218
Looks like you're demolishing them.

138
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,762
I've lost my touch.

139
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,098
My touch…

140
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,519
What about your other senses?

141
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:22,027
Goodness, that's the worst dad joke
I've heard in a while.

142
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:29,326
When I was a detective,
I was able to catch all those bad guys.

143
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:34,123
But the worst of them
was right under my nose.

144
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,417
And I didn't know.

145
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,421
Enough with that. Just go home.

146
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,089
Enjoy some life after work.

147
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,301
I'm going to crash here tonight.

148
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,886
Get the light on your way out.

149
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,804
Yes, sir.

150
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,433
I'll deduct the accommodation fee
from your pay.

151
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,852
And don't drink too much.

152
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,602
YEAR 1975, GUNAM CITY

153
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,952
Hey. Curfew started.

154
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,374
Where's Dad?

155
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,250
He'll be here.

156
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,252
Come on.

157
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,838
You didn't have dinner.

158
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,174
Eat up, so you can go to sleep.

159
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,802
If you don't, Dad will beat you again.

160
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,197
MILK

161
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,324
You're home.

162
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,453
We were going
to eat quickly and put it away.

163
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:44,962
Drink this.

164
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,938
This milk smells weird.

165
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,732
Just drink it!

166
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,156
It's over.

167
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,536
Bulgasal is here.

168
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,544
And you're coming with me.

169
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,938
I'm tired.

170
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,109
Stop right there!

171
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,029
Stop right there!

172
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,914
Where are you? Come on out!

173
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,041
Your scent.

174
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,419
I can smell you.

175
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,838
Someone, please help us.

176
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,341
I know you're here. Come on out!

177
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,927
Please take my father away.

178
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,595
Please…

179
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,323
Ho-yeol.

180
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,253
Seon-hui.

181
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,879
Hey…

182
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,262
Bulgasal is here.

183
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,264
Bulgasal is…

184
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,062
Wake up, Seon-hui. Please.

185
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,565
Wake up.

186
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:23,287
Damn it. What does he want?
I thought he was done for the night.

187
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,393
Why are you here?

188
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,567
You're hurt. You should see a doctor.

189
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,694
I asked why you're here.

190
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,366
Were you drinking?

191
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,204
Why do you care what I do in my free time?

192
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,998
I came to tell you something.

193
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:08,999
What is it?

194
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,127
That you are Bulgasal? Or…

195
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,629
That serial killer

196
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,130
was killed by Bulgasal.

197
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,673
Why are you asking me this?

198
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,717
There's another Bulgasal that you know.

199
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,805
No.

200
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,558
Never mind.

201
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,396
What do you need to tell me
in the dead of the night?

202
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,981
Looking creepy like that.

203
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,236
I didn't mean to hide
the fact that I was Bulgasal.

204
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,071
I don't care.

205
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,281
I never trusted you from the beginning.

206
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,743
There were so many red flags.

207
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,205
Now that I know you're Bulgasal,
I will never trust you.

208
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,539
Is that all?

209
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,877
Yes. I just came to tell you that.

210
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,524
One of them killed my sister.

211
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,574
One of the two Bulgasals…

212
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,418
Hey. Did you tell him everything?

213
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,628
No.

214
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,630
You didn't?

215
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,091
You should tell him
that you used to be human

216
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,094
and became Bulgasal
because I took your soul a long time ago.

217
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,470
I didn't tell him.

218
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,097
I just couldn't.

219
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,729
What if Detective Kwon starts to hate you
and finds you suspicious like before?

220
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,855
That's fine.

221
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,191
If I told him, he would've hated me more
and found me more suspicious.

222
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,611
He wouldn't even have
let me talk to him like today.

223
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,451
I knew it.

224
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,162
Do we have to go see Ms. Kim at this hour?

225
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,747
The nursing home isn't even open.

226
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,041
I must find out as soon as possible.

227
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,834
It's been 600 years.

228
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,879
The years I've spent
not knowing the truth.

229
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,006
I cannot wait any longer.

230
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,716
You woke up.

231
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,932
Why did we sleep here?
You should have woken me up.

232
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,601
People need sleep to recover.

233
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,686
Oh, right.

234
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,605
How's your wound?

235
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,273
Stay still.

236
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,694
Oh.

237
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,030
It's all healed.

238
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,576
Being Bulgasal has its perks.

239
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,703
You think so?

240
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,125
Just wait. This life was yours,
so I'll return it to you soon.

241
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:43,296
No. You can take your time with that.

242
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,426
Why are you in a good mood?
What could you be happy about?

243
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,678
Do I seem happy?

244
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,267
To be honest, now that there's a chance

245
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,894
that I wasn't the one
who murdered your family,

246
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,313
I am a bit relieved.

247
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,358
Don't jump to conclusions.

248
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,485
It's not certain yet.

249
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,614
No. I'm certain of it.

250
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,409
I'm sure it was Ok Eul-tae.

251
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,802
Eul-tae.

252
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,222
Hey, you're here.

253
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,766
I called you several times.

254
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,851
What's up?

255
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,353
Why did you want to see me?

256
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,355
I needed to talk to you.

257
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,024
Oh, right. Me too.

258
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,610
I heard you were the one
who saved Detective Kwon.

259
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,820
Gosh, I'm so glad you did.

260
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,363
Thank you, Eul-tae.

261
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,824
How's Hwal?

262
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,327
I bet he was hurt badly.

263
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,455
He's fine,
but I just want him to be careful.

264
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,248
He passes out all the time.

265
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:05,003
But who kidnapped Detective Kwon?

266
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,173
Someone has a grudge against Hwal.

267
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,383
It's all okay now.

268
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,638
That's great news. I was really worried.

269
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,476
But I don't see your secretary today.

270
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,810
She's…

271
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,188
on vacation.

272
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,777
Eul-tae. You're okay, right?

273
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,321
-You look a bit…
-Min Sang-un.

274
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:35,200
Min Sang-un is coming between Hwal and me.

275
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,745
She's pretending to be a human
who lost her memories…

276
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,957
to confuse Hwal.

277
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,797
I thought I could fill
this dark hole with his help.

278
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,468
I need to separate her from Hwal.

279
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,721
How will you do that?

280
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,145
You bring her here.
And don't let Hwal know.

281
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,316
What will you do to her?

282
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,236
Why? You think I'm going to kill her?

283
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,364
No. It's not that.

284
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:18,076
Eul-tae, I thought my job
was just to surveil them.

285
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,953
You told me to stay close to them.

286
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,496
Our situation changed, Do-yun.

287
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,332
Isn't this the least you could do for me?

288
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,417
But Eul-tae…

289
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,502
This is a bit…

290
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,546
I don't think I can do it.

291
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,048
I don't want to. It doesn't feel right.

292
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,550
It's not like that.

293
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,802
You just need to bring her here.

294
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,183
You can't even do that for me?

295
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,435
After all I've done…

296
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,980
for you and your brother.

297
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,275
I did everything for you and your brother.

298
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,960
Where have you been all day?

299
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,297
I went to school.

300
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,840
You're lying.

301
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,259
Gosh. What is it this time?

302
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,220
Hey. You're not
even wearing your school uniform.

303
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,972
Something is going on with you.

304
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,724
You make secret calls too.

305
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,352
Don't tell me…

306
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,022
you got a girlfriend.

307
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,358
No, it's not that.

308
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,276
So you won't go to school?

309
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,695
Why would I? Nothing good comes from it.

310
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,197
Besides, I'll take care of it.

311
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,615
As if!

312
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,493
If you want us to back off,
don't make us worry.

313
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,453
You've been living as you please so far.

314
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,789
But that ends with us.

315
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,875
High school graduates make more money
than middle school graduates.

316
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,834
Go back to school.

317
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,171
Right. Or prepare for the GED.

318
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,048
Right.

319
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,303
I already have enough on my mind.

320
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,890
Please stop pestering me.

321
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,727
By the way, where's Sang-un?

322
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,313
Why? Why are you looking
for my sister all of a sudden?

323
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,108
Never mind.

324
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,736
-Did you eat?
-I don't have an appetite.

325
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,990
What? You're always talking about food
but you don't have an appetite?

326
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,452
Is he going through puberty?
I don't know what to do. I never had kids.

327
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,579
He's already passed that age.

328
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,207
Maybe he really fought
with his girlfriend.

329
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,459
Girlfriend?

330
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,798
Do-yun.

331
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,052
It'll be over after this.
I promise you. This is it.

332
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,140
You don't even have to go back
to that house. I'll take care of you.

333
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,977
We must separate her from Hwal

334
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,147
before she deceives him with her sly lies.

335
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,029
BAEKILHONG NURSING HOME

336
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,622
Have some of this, Go-bun.

337
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,750
It's your favorite.

338
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,257
It's me, Hwa-yeon. You remember me. Right?

339
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,099
Where have you been all this time?

340
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,976
I told you not to wander off.

341
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,901
But who is that man?

342
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,285
It's okay.

343
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,204
He's a good friend of mine.

344
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:54,167
Can you tell me about Dark Hole?

345
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,586
Remember what you told me before?

346
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,380
Tell me what Dark Hole did
to the family of the man

347
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,341
with a scar on his hand.

348
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,934
The man with a scar
on the back of his hand?

349
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,603
The scar on the back of his hand?

350
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,026
Hwa-yeon, he's here.

351
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,029
The man with a scar
on his hand is here to get you.

352
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,907
-Calm down.
-You have to run away. Run away now!

353
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,867
-You have to run away!
-Ma'am.

354
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,453
Go! No. Go now!

355
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,038
-Go!
-Ma'am.

356
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,957
-You have to run!
-Goodness.

357
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,395
Is Ms. Kim okay?

358
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,733
Yes. Maybe I shouldn't have
brought you in.

359
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,193
I was shortsighted.

360
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,738
No. I'm glad I went in there with you.

361
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,701
I was able to see how Ms. Kim reacted.

362
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,036
What do you mean?

363
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,082
If her sister was that scared,

364
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,252
Kim Hwa-yeon
must have been terrified of me.

365
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,839
Are you saying that Kim Hwa-yeon was
terrified of you and ran away

366
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,382
because she wronged you?

367
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,676
That's right.

368
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,928
Because you wouldn't believe her.

369
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,681
You wouldn't have
even if she told you 50 years ago.

370
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,601
I wouldn't have and still don't.

371
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,939
What's that look on your face?
Why do you look disappointed?

372
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,525
Because you won't believe me.

373
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,821
I said I didn't believe
Kim Hwa-yeon, not you.

374
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,911
I believe you more than you think.

375
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,040
So you believe me?

376
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,417
Yes.

377
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,629
You're like a fool with no memory,

378
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,715
so you tell me everything
without hiding anything.

379
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,678
Let's go.

380
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:20,647
If you can't believe Kim Hwa-yeon,
we have to find another way.

381
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,398
Evidence to prove Ok Eul-tae did it.

382
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,275
Like…

383
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,612
I'm just bouncing ideas here.

384
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,530
Do you know if anyone was there

385
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,742
at the time your family was killed?

386
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,080
Why are you curious about that?

387
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,001
Well, my sister, Si-ho…

388
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,879
She can see people's memories.

389
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,590
I think she can see their past lives too.

390
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,175
She can see past lives too?

391
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,178
To be precise, she can see
the memories of people's souls.

392
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,808
Right. It's like reading
the growth rings of a tree.

393
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,195
Why did you want to see me?

394
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,824
Sang-un told me
that you wanted me to do something.

395
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,463
She doesn't look that scary.

396
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,049
Do-yun said she looked scary.

397
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,679
Are we your hostages?

398
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,765
-Pardon?
-You think Sang-un is your enemy.

399
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,893
So are we your hostages?

400
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,689
You're still blunt just like before.

401
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:50,069
I heard you can see people's past lives
and the memories of their souls.

402
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,362
Did Sang-un tell you?

403
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,657
-Is that why I'm here?
-Yes.

404
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,788
It's true but I can't do it
whenever I want to.

405
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:06,085
Can you see your own past life too?

406
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,463
My past life?

407
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,468
Right, I guess that's possible.

408
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,094
But I never tried.

409
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,180
Can you try?

410
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,766
I could…

411
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,143
but I have a question.

412
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,146
How did you know I had this special power?

413
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,899
Ms. Lee told me
that she heard it from you.

414
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,320
We've met before in your past life.

415
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,280
In my past life?

416
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,990
How did we meet?

417
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,537
We just crossed paths briefly.

418
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,998
You didn't know a monster like me.

419
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,460
Why do you call yourself a monster?

420
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,545
Pardon?

421
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,507
Well, I did think
you were a monster at first.

422
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,342
But not anymore.

423
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,096
It's a bit awkward around you,
but you're not scary.

424
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,517
You saved me and Detective Kwon.

425
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,477
Ok Eul-tae is the monster.

426
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,980
Anyway, looking at my past life

427
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,274
helps to prove
that my sister is innocent, right?

428
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,442
Probably.

429
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,445
Then I'm in. I'll try.

430
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,405
But I'm not sure it'll work.

431
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,433
-You're back.
-Yes.

432
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,854
-Did you talk to Hwal?
-Yes.

433
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,316
He wanted me to look at my past life.

434
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,652
Your past life?

435
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,655
-So did you?
-Of course, it didn't work.

436
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,073
It doesn't work on me.

437
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,243
But why did he want to see

438
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,288
my past life specifically?

439
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:10,042
Right. He's not even
looking for his wife and son.

440
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,878
Why did he ask you…

441
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,592
But what's this smell?

442
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,135
Something smells?

443
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,305
Ms. Lee cooked fish stew.

444
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,309
Si-ho.

445
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,353
-Oh, my goodness.
-Si-ho!

446
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,314
What's wrong? Does she have indigestion?

447
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,441
No, it's not that.

448
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,735
Are you okay?

449
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,445
Then what's wrong with you?

450
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,615
It's not like you're pregnant.
Gosh, that was weird.

451
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,496
Why are you quiet?

452
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,292
What? You're really pregnant?

453
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,754
Yes, I am.

454
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,380
Goodness.

455
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,217
How far along are you?
You should have told me sooner!

456
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,595
What do I do? Wait.
This isn't important right now.

457
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,308
What? How long have you
been standing there?

458
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,187
Did you hear everything?

459
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,412
What are you doing here?

460
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,416
Why do you look so serious?

461
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,088
Don't tell me you're shocked by the news

462
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,590
that your wife
from a past life is pregnant.

463
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,802
You should have seen
the look on your face.

464
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,553
You said something to me before.

465
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,975
Once they are intertwined with me,
we are destined to meet again

466
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,894
either as enemies or as friends.

467
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,606
Bullshit. You always
go on about my prophecies.

468
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,566
Did I ever tell you any lottery numbers?

469
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,445
You said that ties in our past lives
are bound to repeat in our current lives.

470
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,533
And once intertwined,
those ties could never be broken.

471
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,038
If so…

472
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,667
wouldn't A-chan

473
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,461
be born again with Sol as his mother?

474
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,630
I was thinking about that.

475
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,304
You must really miss your son.

476
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,933
It's not just about that.
I want Sol to meet her son in this life

477
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,770
and live a happy life this time.

478
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,648
What about you?
You must miss your son too.

479
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,031
Gosh, that'd be nice.

480
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,283
So I can stop looking
at that sad face of yours.

481
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,619
But don't get your hopes up.

482
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:52,997
I know.

483
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,875
Go in. I'm going out for groceries.

484
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,085
Si-ho is feeling nauseous.
She needs to eat.

485
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,589
-I'll go.
-Forget it.

486
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,842
Actually, we have one more person
moping around here.

487
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,303
-Go check up on him.
-What do you mean?

488
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,097
I'm talking about Do-yun.
He won't come out of his room.

489
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,434
-That glutton won't even eat.
-Leave him be. He's not a little kid.

490
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,978
It worries me when people skip meals.

491
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,146
How can I let him be?

492
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,065
Go and find out what happened to him.

493
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,566
You're the only guy here.

494
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,819
It might be a girl problem.
Go listen to his troubles.

495
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,654
Sure. I'm the perfect man for the job.

496
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,074
I've lived alone for the past 600 years.

497
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,283
Forget it.

498
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,994
Goodness. You're so heartless!

499
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,455
I almost thought he was human.

500
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,045
-Here.
-You can have it all.

501
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,466
Right. I got used to
splitting it with my older brother.

502
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,261
You have a brother?

503
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,555
Yes. Our parents passed away
when we were kids.

504
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,933
I only have him now,
but he's in the hospital.

505
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,186
Why? Is he sick?

506
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,604
He's fine now.

507
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,732
Actually, he's been sick
ever since he was young.

508
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,443
Did you know?
When one of your family members is sick,

509
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,445
you're never happy.

510
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,573
It makes me wonder
if he's sick because of me.

511
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,659
That crosses my mind.

512
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,664
What's wrong?
Is your brother not getting better?

513
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,500
No. He's gotten much better.

514
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,585
He might get discharged soon.

515
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,549
That's not the problem. The thing is,

516
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,553
we have a supporter who's been helping us
ever since we were young.

517
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,639
Sometimes, he treats us like family.

518
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:39,061
But this supporter of mine
asked me for a favor.

519
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,688
What favor?

520
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,859
A favor I don't want to do.

521
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,570
Then you don't have to do it.

522
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,197
But he's done so much for me.

523
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,783
It's not easy to say no
to someone like that.

524
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,660
Come on.

525
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,038
You're older than me,
but you know less about the world.

526
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,294
Do you even know how to spell that?

527
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,048
Come on. That was mean. So mean.

528
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,930
If you don't want to do it, don't.

529
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,433
Forget what he did for you.
Why is he forcing you?

530
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,311
He chose to help.
He can't use it to get what he wants.

531
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,605
I shouldn't have asked you.

532
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,941
After all, you do whatever you want to do.

533
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,488
So what did this supporter ask you to do?

534
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,993
It's nothing. Forget I said anything.

535
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,221
What?

536
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:01,310
It's just that
I missed my window to say this.

537
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,895
Your brother's illness

538
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,939
isn't your fault.

539
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,483
So you don't have to feel sorry.

540
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,035
I know.

541
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,011
Go ahead. I'm going to make a call.

542
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,096
Okay.

543
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,060
Goodness!

544
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,687
I've been waiting for you to call.

545
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,357
I'm so happy to hear from my VVVIP client.

546
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,360
You almost hurt my feelings.

547
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,779
Don't forget all the years
we spent together.

548
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:57,074
Why are you being so clingy?
Have you been drinking?

549
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,951
Anyway, I need your help.

550
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:02,580
There's a boy named Nam Do-yun
at Jaae Orphanage.

551
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,915
Find out who's been supporting him.

552
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,543
Hwal, come on. Hurry!

553
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:11,338
Gosh, that's my specialty.
It won't take long.

554
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,507
I'm on my way now. I just got in my car.

555
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,136
Score!

556
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,263
What's the case?

557
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,057
Why do you look like
you're walking on cloud nine?

558
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,895
My generous client gave me another case.

559
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,857
Gosh, I should have ordered
some sweet and sour chicken too.

560
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,235
The client who asked you
to find that woman?

561
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,698
What is it this time?

562
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,371
Where have you two been?
We were waiting for you.

563
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,665
We went to the pharmacy.

564
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,252
What's the cake for?

565
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,421
This? Ms. Lee bought it.

566
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,214
Whose birthday is it?

567
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,264
Hwal.

568
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,141
Hwal.

569
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,270
Can you stay for a bit?

570
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,980
We're celebrating for Si-ho.

571
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,942
All right.
How many candles should I light?

572
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,403
Candles? That's embarrassing.

573
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,488
Two?

574
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,708
What a surprise.
You're gracing us with your presence.

575
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,589
I'm just here for a second.
I'll go upstairs soon.

576
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,719
By the way, is this our dinner?
We're having cake?

577
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,014
Yes. Si-ho gets nauseous
when she smells food.

578
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,392
Okay. Let's celebrate with the cake.

579
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,936
We don't have to sing, right?
Or do you want us to?

580
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,145
Gosh, no.

581
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:54,149
What are we celebrating?
I need to know what we're celebrating.

582
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,943
Oh, you don't know yet.

583
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,821
Si-ho's pregnant.

584
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,281
Pregnant?

585
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:11,500
Si-ho, that was a baby bump?

586
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,421
Hey. I don't have a baby bump yet.

587
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,256
I haven't started showing yet!

588
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,842
No way. She's pregnant?

589
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,846
Do-yun, aren't you happy
to have a new addition to our family?

590
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,431
What?

591
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,767
A new addition to our family?

592
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:30,519
We're not family.

593
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,106
Why not? We're living together.
That makes us family.

594
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,290
That's right.
Living together makes us a family.

595
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,333
Colleagues at work are like family too.

596
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,294
Sometimes, families are your enemies too.

597
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,843
But I could move out any day.

598
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:07,181
And Hwal keeps nagging me to leave too.

599
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,641
What? What do you want?

600
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,310
I'm just pointing that out.

601
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:16,106
You have no home.
So stay here for the rest of your life.

602
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,816
I'll teach you butchery later.

603
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:22,070
I could never do that, Ms. Lee.
Blood creeps me out.

604
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,655
Can you teach me?

605
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,700
You? Do you think you can do it?

606
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:29,077
Yes. I'll be happy to learn under Ms. Lee.

607
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,079
I need a proper job.

608
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,917
I have to raise a kid too.

609
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,711
Goodness, I'm so proud of you.

610
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,632
Did you hear that?
You should learn from Si-ho.

611
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:49,681
Ms. Lee, I don't want to copy people
or think following other people is cool.

612
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,976
I have my own path to walk.

613
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,897
Bullshit. You have
a fancy way of saying no.

614
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,482
Get the light for the candles.

615
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,027
"Bullshit"? Bullshit…

616
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,157
-Hey!
-Do-yun!

617
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,117
Wait until we light the candles first!

618
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,995
You did that on purpose, right?
You're such a rebellious kid.

619
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,330
Gosh. What's up with him?

620
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,040
-He did that on purpose.
-Right.

621
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,708
-It's too dark in here.
-Come on!

622
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,633
Were you hungry?

623
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,510
-You're almost done with yours.
-I am.

624
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,470
-Can you tolerate a cake?
-Yes.

625
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,556
It's too bad you can't eat it.

626
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,850
-This is so good.
-Yes, this is amazing.

627
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,144
Should we put some blood on it?

628
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,399
This is great.

629
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,110
-It's a lot, right?
-What's that?

630
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,571
Don't do that.

631
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,200
Eul-tae.

632
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,412
I sent you a text.

633
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,747
I don't think I can do it.

634
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,750
I read it. Are you sure?

635
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,461
Yes. I'm sorry.

636
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:05,299
But Do-yun, if you don't do it,
things will get out of hand.

637
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,137
What? What do you mean?

638
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,764
I would have to bring her here myself.

639
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,224
Then…

640
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,186
the people in that house will get hurt.

641
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,450
Do-yun.

642
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:33,702
Yes?

643
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,622
Do you remember
when we first met ten years ago?

644
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,685
When I went to the orphanage,

645
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:03,899
you held my hand tightly because
you wanted me to help your sick brother.

646
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,818
Eul-tae.

647
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,946
Can you help my brother?

648
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,494
Your hand was so small,
but you held my hand so tightly.

649
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,830
I still remember your grip.

650
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,500
Eul-tae.

651
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,710
This is my brother.

652
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,171
Please help him.

653
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,425
It felt like you wanted me to save you.

654
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,470
Eul-tae.

655
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:39,309
You reached out to me for help back then.

656
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,145
But now,

657
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,607
I'm reaching out to you.

658
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,818
I'll wait.

659
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,695
You're the only one on my side.

660
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,156
And the only one I can trust.

661
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,606
You're back.

662
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,401
I knew it'd be a long call,
so I put everything away.

663
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:32,863
The leftover cake is in the fridge.
Eat it when you're hungry.

664
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,990
Okay.

665
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:47,794
Sang-un.

666
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:50,964
Yes?

667
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,801
I have a favor to ask you.

668
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,679
What is it?

669
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,938
SANYEONG-DONG, SINHWA-DONG

670
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,664
You really came.

671
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,710
You don't even know where we're going.

672
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,799
You asked so seriously yesterday.

673
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,846
Can you tell me where we're going now?

674
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,934
What about Hwal?
You didn't tell him, right?

675
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,980
No, I didn't. He must have left early.
His car was gone.

676
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,298
Why are you here?
I have an appointment with Mr. Gu.

677
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,135
What the heck is that punk, Do-yun, up to?

678
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,513
What?

679
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,391
I heard you asked Mr. Gu
to look into Do-yun's supporter.

680
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,476
Do you know who it is?

681
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,480
Did you tell Si-ho?

682
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,859
No. She was sleeping so I left quietly.

683
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,570
You should have told her.

684
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,780
That means no one knows.

685
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,333
Do-yun, where are we going?

686
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:58,091
To be honest,
I'm taking you to Ok Eul-tae.

687
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,137
Ok Eul-tae?

688
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,349
He said he would come to the house
if I didn't bring you to him.

689
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,728
And people at the house would get hurt.

690
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:14,065
I thought I should at least tell you.

691
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,528
I'm sorry. Do you want…

692
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,323
to go back home?

693
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,331
No. I'm glad you told me.

694
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,875
-I should have known better.
-What?

695
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,419
Even after everything that's happened,

696
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,422
I forgot that people around me…

697
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,343
will be in danger.

698
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,387
I was selfish.

699
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,807
It's been a while
since I spent time with other people.

700
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,727
So I got carried away.

701
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,397
It felt like a real home.

702
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,859
I liked having other people in my life.

703
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,405
So I stayed there too long.

704
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,707
You go home. I need to go somewhere alone.

705
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,335
Where are you going?

706
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,504
To a place where Ok Eul-tae can't find me.

707
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,049
Then you don't have to do
what he tells you to do.

708
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,806
Tell Si-ho and Hwal
that I'll call them once I get settled.

709
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,945
I don't think this is right. Don't go.

710
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,280
I'll tell Hwal the truth.

711
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,032
There must be a way.

712
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,617
Are you getting on?

713
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,120
No, we're not. I'm sorry.

714
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,298
What?

715
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,097
Where are you two going?

716
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,018
I was going out for a walk with Do-yun.

717
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,520
I told you it wasn't safe to come out.

718
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,355
Go wait in the car.

719
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,482
Okay.

720
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,777
You and I need to talk.

721
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,293
Hwal, where are we going?

722
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,257
I knew something was off.

723
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,136
You weren't scared of me
and you were too friendly.

724
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,095
What?

725
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,224
What did Ok Eul-tae want?

726
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,312
How did you know?

727
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,648
Were you involved in Si-ho's kidnapping?

728
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,649
No.

729
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,110
Did you help him kidnap Detective Kwon?

730
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,195
No. I never did that.

731
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,238
Did you give him
the location of the house?

732
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:10,075
No, I really didn't.

733
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,077
Then what did you tell Ok Eul-tae?

734
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,412
I just told him…

735
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,751
about your relationship with Sang-un,

736
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,294
and what you guys were up to.

737
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,172
Is that all?

738
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,466
You snuck into my house just for that?

739
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,843
You pretended to be homeless
and without a family

740
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,555
and to get along with the people
you had to spy on.

741
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,307
It was all a show?

742
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,601
I'm sorry.

743
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:41,523
But I had my reasons, Hwal.

744
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:44,192
-The thing is--
-No. I don't want to hear it.

745
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,443
Don't give me excuses.

746
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,908
Just leave. And never come back.

747
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:52,909
What?

748
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,875
I'm sorry, Hwal.
I won't ever do that again.

749
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,920
I'll apologize to Sang-un and Si-ho too!

750
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,005
I'll apologize to Ms. Lee
and Detective Kwon.

751
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,340
I'm sorry, Hwal.

752
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,179
Just scold me. Be mad at me.

753
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,722
You can even beat me.

754
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,727
Just don't kick me out.

755
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,938
I'll never lie to you now.

756
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,068
You said I could stay with you guys.

757
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,989
If you kick me out like this,

758
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,533
I'll have no place to go.

759
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,369
Please?

760
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,334
Leave. And never come back.

761
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,462
If I ever see you again,

762
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,630
I'm going to kill you.

763
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,259
Hwal…

764
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,529
What about Do-yun?

765
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,156
He left.

766
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,074
He's not coming back.

767
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,118
What? Why not?

768
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,841
Where are you? Are you coming?

769
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,593
I'm waiting.

770
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,261
I can't…

771
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,847
help you anymore.

772
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,726
Hwal found out.

773
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,645
How did that happen…

774
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:47,732
Why did you let him find out?
That was very foolish of you.

775
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,485
You…

776
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,239
Good job.

777
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,408
There's nothing you can do now.

778
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,327
So you can go back to the orphanage.

779
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,913
I'll call you later. I'm busy right now.

780
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,081
Wait!

781
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,085
My brother…

782
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,587
You never told me
the name of the hospital.

783
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,173
I don't know where he is.

784
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:17,095
I want to see my brother right now.

785
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,973
Right.

786
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,395
He's not at the hospital.

787
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:28,439
What? Did he get discharged already?

788
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,566
No.

789
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,736
-He died.
-What?

790
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,239
His disease was rare.
He was lucky he lived that long.

791
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,575
I knew you'd be sad, so I didn't tell you.

792
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,202
What are you talking about?

793
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:44,497
You told me he was getting better
and could get discharged.

794
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,500
Do-yun, don't blame it on me.

795
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,711
That's just what doctors say to families.

796
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,045
I was merely copying them.

797
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,215
I can't believe this.

798
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,343
Then you were deceiving me?

799
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,095
You were lying to me?

800
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:02,140
Lie to you? No, I wasn't lying to you.

801
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:05,018
I was trying
to find the right time to tell you.

802
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,936
Anyway, I'm busy. Let's talk later.

803
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,288
Don't let Do-yun in if he comes.

804
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,874
-I don't want to see him now.
-Yes, sir.

805
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,417
Did you find Ms. Kim?

806
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,754
She couldn't have gotten far.
I bit her neck.

807
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,922
We're checking every hospital
and pharmacy nearby.

808
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,383
Find her fast
before she goes after Hwal again.

809
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,719
Where are you headed, sir?

810
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,390
I need to go and get something myself.

811
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,144
I have to get it myself.

812
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,738
Are we really moving?

813
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,199
I think Ok Eul-tae knows where we are.

814
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,787
He'll try to take you himself.

815
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,375
Si-ho, wake up.

816
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,793
What? What is it?

817
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,670
We have to get out of here now.

818
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,713
What? Why all of a sudden?

819
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,215
What's going on?

820
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,217
Ok Eul-tae is coming.

821
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,763
How…

822
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:26,891
Well…

823
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,363
SI-HO

824
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,833
Do-yun, where are you right now?

825
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,626
Did Ok Eul-tae really send you here?

826
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,128
Were you spying on us?

827
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,295
Yes.

828
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,172
I'm sorry.

829
01:01:58,756 --> 01:01:59,882
You…

830
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:03,928
Why did you do it? Why?

831
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,596
I…

832
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,061
My brother was sick. So I had to.

833
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:14,814
But…

834
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,068
he's dead.

835
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,028
What?

836
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,448
What are you saying?

837
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,200
I don't know…

838
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,454
what to do right now.

839
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:32,707
I really don't know.

840
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,543
Do-yun.

841
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,641
Si-ho will be out soon.

842
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,644
But where are we going?

843
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,272
There's a place I've stayed at.

844
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,862
-What is it?
-I mean,

845
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,948
he was friendly and never scared of me.

846
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,035
But I never suspected him.
I completely fell for that kid's act.

847
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,246
I'm sure it wasn't all an act.

848
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,207
In the end, he told me the truth.

849
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,793
I shouldn't have let him go.

850
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,171
No. I should go and get him.

851
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,299
-To do what?
-Hwal!

852
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,272
Can we talk?

853
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,776
-I just talked to Do-yun.
-Where is he?

854
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,736
I don't know. He won't tell me.

855
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,154
But more importantly…

856
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,076
Do-yun's brother…

857
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,329
is dead.

858
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:55,790
What?

859
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,042
Why all of a sudden?

860
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,462
He had a rare disease as a kid.

861
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,506
Do-yun was born with a condition too.

862
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,883
Ok Eul-tae helped him get surgery

863
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,510
and took care of him.

864
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,096
That's why he helped Ok Eul-tae.

865
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,765
Do-yun…

866
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,686
was born with a condition?

867
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:17,854
Yes.

868
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,857
He was born blind.

869
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,530
Blind?

870
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:34,871
Ok Eul-tae helped him
get an eye transplant.

871
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,248
Are you sure? Is that really what he said?

872
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,252
Yes. That's what Do-yun told me.

873
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,229
What is it? What's wrong?

874
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,834
Bulgasal Bro.

875
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:26,797
If you kick me out like this,
I'll have no place to go.

876
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,551
Leave. And never come back.

877
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,928
If I ever see you again,

878
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,721
I'm going to kill you.

879
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:36,223
Hwal…

880
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:39,977
Do-yun…

881
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,732
Do-yun…

882
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:54,951
was A-chan.

883
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,986
Don't you want to know
where your brother is?

884
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,404
My brother?

885
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,532
It's dangerous if you two stay here.
Ok Eul-tae could come for you.

886
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:35,783
Are you really here alone?

887
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,040
What?

888
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,710
Did you send him to me knowing who he was?

What does he say about me?

891

I'm not getting in a car with Bulgasal.

892
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:56,262
We need to join hands to find him,
so let's not argue.

897
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,245
Are you okay? Oh, my goodness.

898
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:24,915
Do-yun!
