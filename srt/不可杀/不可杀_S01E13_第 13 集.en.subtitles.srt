1
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,599
What's wrong? Are you okay?

2
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,101
What's going on?

3
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,556
Why did you do that?

4
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,605
You…

5
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,359
killed people.

6
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,779
All those people.

7
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,158
What are you talking about?

8
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,244
I remembered something.

9
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,040
And it was so vivid.

10
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,500
You killed people.

11
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,629
And you stood among the dead bodies.

12
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,506
You smiled at me

13
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,760
from among the dead bodies.

14
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,222
And you looked so cruel,
smiling like that.

15
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,974
You terrified me

16
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,060
and made me angry.

17
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,396
So I tried to stab you with a sword.

18
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,442
And you stopped me with your right hand.

19
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,367
No. It's different.

20
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,451
What's different?

21
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,870
It's different from the dreams
I had when I was young.

22
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:11,042
In my dreams, you were the one
standing among the dead bodies.

23
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,431
EPISODE 13

24
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,101
Hwal. Sang-un.

25
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,894
What are you doing here?

26
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,271
We felt trapped over there.

27
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,273
It was irritating too. So we came here.

28
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,692
Hwal said you weren't well.

29
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,529
Is that a wound?

30
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,823
It's nothing. I'm fine.

31
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:50,039
I will take everything you have
the next time we meet.

32
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,127
Even your son, your father, and your wife.

33
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,088
I will kill everyone you cherish.

34
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,017
Everyone, get in the car.
You can't be here.

35
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,520
Why not? Can't we stay here with you guys?

36
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,063
We'll just stay here.

37
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,898
I'm more comfortable staying together.

38
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,858
I said no!

39
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,319
Why did you come back here?

40
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,113
Come on. Why are you yelling at us?

41
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,365
Don't yell at them.
I'm the one who suggested it.

42
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,534
We're worried about you two staying here.

43
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,827
Who told you to worry?

44
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,288
How could I not? You barely stay in touch.

45
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,249
For all I know,
Ok Eul-tae could have killed you.

46
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,918
I don't need you to worry about me.

47
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,880
Do you know what you've done?

48
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,673
You put my family in danger.

49
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,800
Your family?

50
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,721
Then am I not your family?

51
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,689
Everyone, get inside.

52
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,995
Where are you going
all of a sudden, Ms. Lee?

53
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,290
We just got here. You can't leave.

54
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,458
I'm leaving.

55
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,835
I'll never come back
to this shabby haunted house.

56
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,630
Why was I so nice to a man
who's never done anything for me?

57
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,882
If you go now, you'll be in danger.

58
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,550
Ok Eul-tae might come after you.

59
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,969
-Right.
-Why would he come after me?

60
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,930
He only goes after
people Hwal cares about.

61
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,100
Why would he come after me?
I'm not Hwal's family. I'm nothing.

62
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,524
You just take care of Si-ho and Do-yun.

63
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,610
Say something.

64
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,155
-Ms. Lee!
-Ms. Lee! Don't leave.

65
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,032
What are you doing? Let go.

66
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,826
If you leave, who's going to cook?

67
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,829
-Am I a housekeeper?
-He means you're important to us.

68
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,457
You're as important to us
as food is to survival.

69
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,209
If you leave, we'll starve to death.

70
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,045
Let go of me. Get off me!

71
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,505
-Let go.
-That hurts.

72
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,341
-Sang-un. Help us make her stay.
-Hey. Stop that.

73
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,176
-That hurts, Ms. Lee.
-Give it back, you brat.

74
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,346
-Sang-un, what are you thinking?
-You brat!

75
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,848
-You're not leaving.
-You punk.

76
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,932
Nothing.

77
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,018
Are you still mad?

78
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,813
You didn't have to blow up like that.

79
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,149
They were safe in this house before.

80
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,818
Things have changed.

81
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,529
Ok Eul-tae didn't come after them before

82
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,573
because he wanted something from me.

83
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,491
But not anymore.

84
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,702
He said he'd kill everyone.

85
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,788
What? What do we do then?

86
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,415
Should we head back now?

87
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,666
No.

88
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,752
He probably has people watching us by now.

89
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,296
Leaving this house is riskier.

90
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,214
I won't let anyone go outside.

91
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,134
They'll be in danger if we're separated.

92
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,345
-What else?
-I must catch and kill Ok Eul-tae

93
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,847
before he does anything.

94
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,643
But now that you're all here,
I can't go anywhere.

95
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,980
Then…

96
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,275
I'll look for Ok Eul-tae.

97
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,111
No, you shouldn't. It's too dangerous.

98
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,238
Who do you think I am?
Must I repeat myself?

99
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,949
I used to be a cop
and I work for a detective agency.

100
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,994
I can find him without getting caught.

101
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,038
You don't trust me?

102
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,207
-That's not why.
-Then it's settled.

103
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,000
Once I find him, come right away.

104
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,169
How much longer
must they hide in this house?

105
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,339
Do you want to keep Si-ho
and Do-yun locked up in here forever?

106
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,087
Hey, kitty.

107
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,675
Hey, kitty.

108
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,220
Where are you, kitty?

109
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,722
It's not here.

110
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,444
The cat.

111
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,031
It saw me and ran away just now.

112
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,327
You didn't hurt it, did you?

113
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,087
What brings you here?
I didn't hear your car.

114
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,547
I walked here.

115
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,549
Why?

116
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,385
My chest…

117
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,599
It feels like my entire body
is going to burst from rage

118
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:04,562
because he rejected me to the end.

119
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,111
So I came here because
I might kill anyone I see right now.

120
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,780
What are you talking about?

121
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,116
For a thousand years,

122
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,037
I did everything I could
to fill this dark hole.

123
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,372
But he ruined everything.

124
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,916
He rejected me because of that woman.

125
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,964
Now, I will destroy him completely.

126
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,216
And he will also lose everything.

127
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,556
To do that, I need you
to do something for me, Min-su.

128
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,184
What is it?

129
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,270
Do you still kill people
and bury them in the ground?

130
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,856
The trees here looked nice.

131
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,277
Trees planted over dead bodies
yield beautiful flowers.

132
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,697
I don't kill people anymore.
I lost interest.

133
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,783
Once you see this,
you'll change your mind.

134
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,209
No matter how many people you killed,
you still felt empty inside. Right?

135
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,837
I'll let you have her.

136
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,799
In return, you need to help me.

137
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,385
What are you going to do?

138
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,552
I'm going to…

139
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,306
drag someone down to hell.

140
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,644
When you find Ok Eul-tae,
don't approach him. Call me first.

141
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,313
I called Mr. Gu and other agencies too.

142
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,775
-Don't go around alone.
-Gosh, I said I got it. I'm not a kid.

143
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,069
You sound like a dad
sending his son to the army.

144
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,696
Ok Eul-tae is dangerous.
How could I not worry?

145
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,782
Goodness. Fine.

146
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,827
I'd like to live until I'm 80. Okay?

147
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,662
I'm off.

148
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,215
-Where is he going?
-To find Ok Eul-tae.

149
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,175
What? All by himself?

150
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,427
That's too dangerous.

151
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,719
We have no choice.

152
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,598
While I stay here protecting you guys,
someone has to look for Ok Eul-tae

153
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,434
before he does anything.

154
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,977
And if Detective Kwon finds him?

155
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,521
Did you think about
how you can put him in the well?

156
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,233
No. I don't think that will work now.

157
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,651
Once he's located,

158
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,446
going there to finish him is easier.

159
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,530
How is that easier?

160
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,575
I told you to stop saying
that you'll die with Ok Eul-tae.

161
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,036
Let's try to find a way.
We still have some time.

162
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,706
What is it?

163
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,916
You were about to kill me
with scissors before.

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,043
Yet it's as if
you still don't want me to die.

165
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,212
Oh, that.

166
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,506
That just happened.

167
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,761
Let's talk.

168
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,895
Hey.

169
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,565
I'm sorry about earlier.

170
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,442
Did it hurt a lot?

171
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,526
Don't worry about it.

172
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,739
I want to talk about
what you remembered from a past life.

173
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,451
Was that all you remembered?
Me killing people?

174
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,454
Yes. But you said
your dreams were different.

175
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,751
I don't know what's true
or if it really was from my past life.

176
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,046
I think it really was
a memory from your past life.

177
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,673
Because of this scar.

178
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,760
I was born with this scar
because I was cursed by Bulgasal.

179
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,680
Both of us don't remember it.
But I think something must have happened

180
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,391
between us even before 600 years ago.

181
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,936
The scar on your shoulder.

182
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,105
Kim Hwa-yeon
and your sister, Min Sang-yeon,

183
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,191
all had the same scar since birth.

184
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,862
People born with the scar
remembered their past lives.

185
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,614
Except you who didn't have the scar.

186
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,908
-Then…
-I don't think it's a coincidence.

187
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,035
You'll get your memories back soon.

188
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,830
That means we'll be able to find out

189
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,209
about the beginning of our story
that you wanted to know.

190
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,297
And about the ill-fated relationship
between Ok Eul-tae and me.

191
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,675
Right.

192
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,220
And you will hate me.

193
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,223
What do you mean?

194
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:13,269
Kim Hwa-yeon tried to kill me too.
Not only Ok Eul-tae.

195
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,814
I wouldn't. There's no way.

196
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,052
What were you doing?
Were you looking at your wound?

197
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,306
-Let me see it too.
-No. I said it's nothing.

198
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,641
Gosh. That's what you always say.

199
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,687
I thought you would be okay with Hwal.

200
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,980
Look at you.

201
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,649
It would've been worse
if Hwal wasn't there.

202
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,152
Right.

203
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,321
If it weren't for Hwal,

204
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,991
Ok Eul-tae would have killed you already.

205
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,377
After looking at your past life,

206
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,422
I was a bit scared of Hwal.

207
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,133
But he's the only one we can rely on.

208
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,054
So I feel bad that I thought he was scary.

209
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,184
Right. I got scared
by an uncertain memory.

210
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,186
Memory?

211
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,440
Oh, that. Just like Sang-yeon,
I remembered a bit about my past life.

212
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,194
What's wrong?

213
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,278
It's…

214
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,200
It's just my gut feeling.

215
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,037
I think it'd be better…

216
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,625
if you don't try
to get your memories back.

217
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,336
-Why not?
-I told you that I met Ms. Lee

218
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,838
when she was young in your past life.

219
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,800
She told me that I shouldn't look
at your past life.

220
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,554
I think something scary
must have happened in your past life.

221
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,811
So even if you do remember the past,
don't tell just anyone about it.

222
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,901
Goodness. Don't worry.
I'm sure this is nothing.

223
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,069
Come on.

224
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,905
Won't you just listen to what I say?

225
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,494
Okay. Go to sleep now. I have to go out.

226
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,663
Hwal is guarding the house alone.

227
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,792
You two have your hands full
because of us.

228
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,504
Maybe we shouldn't have come
like Hwal said.

229
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,256
Don't say that.

230
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,799
I'm happy you're here.

231
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,635
The house is crowded with people again.

232
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,846
It feels like home. I like it.

233
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,723
Go to sleep now.

234
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,404
Why are you so startled?

235
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,114
No, I'm not.

236
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,992
When did you come up?
I thought you were outside.

237
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,119
I had to get something.

238
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,371
Why are you out here? It's late.

239
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,624
To stay with you.
I'm sure you'll need help.

240
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,709
Don't bother.

241
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,670
No.

242
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,465
Come with me.

243
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,391
I can do it myself.

244
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,393
You don't even know how.

245
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,771
By the way,

246
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:47,983
you told me that I had this scar
on my shoulder in my past lives

247
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,819
because you stabbed me, right?

248
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,571
Why did you stab me?

249
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,074
Because I thought you killed my family.

250
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,452
Why? Are you upset now?

251
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,704
No. It's not that.

252
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,749
You didn't even look into it thoroughly.

253
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,001
You stabbed me and took my soul too.

254
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,629
I think we're even.

255
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,548
I see. Is that so?

256
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,594
Anyway, you stabbed me in my past.

257
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,137
And now you're treating me?

258
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,932
I guess so.

259
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,310
You just had the wrong idea about me.

260
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,020
But why did I take your soul?

261
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,523
Once your memories come back,
we'll find out why.

262
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,529
Is getting my memories back a good thing?

263
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,782
We tried to kill each other 600 years ago

264
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,700
and long before that too.

265
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,743
I'm not sure either.

266
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,414
More importantly,
are you sure it doesn't hurt?

267
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,041
Do you want some painkillers?

268
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,793
I'm fine. The pain is bear--

269
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,047
I said it was bearable.
I didn't say it didn't hurt.

270
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,424
-Stop whining.
-I'm not.

271
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,512
You stitched me up without anesthesia.
I'll do it from here.

272
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,515
You're infatuated with those children.

273
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,185
You think of them as your own.

274
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,984
I'm afraid that you might leave me.

275
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,448
What's wrong?

276
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,788
Stay seated. You'll collapse again.

277
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,665
I don't feel good.

278
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,521
I despise you.

279
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,107
I truly…

280
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,444
despise you.

281
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,252
Are you all right?
Did you get another flashback?

282
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,840
No. It's nothing.

283
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,551
You've been outside all day.

284
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,470
Get some rest. I can keep watch.

285
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,769
You know you're a really bad liar.

286
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,271
I know you saw something.

287
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,233
It's not that important.

288
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,736
It was the same one I saw yesterday
but it was more clear. That's all.

289
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,162
Fine. But you don't have to come out.

290
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,331
It's dangerous at night.
Go get some sleep.

291
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,545
Wait.

292
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,964
I have a question.

293
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,842
You told me before

294
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,972
that what Ok Eul-tae said
shook you to the core.

295
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,349
What did he say?

296
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,351
Why are you asking me now?

297
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,437
I just want to know.

298
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,648
I want to know why you were so anxious

299
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,818
and what made you
question yourself that much.

300
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:05,532
You asked me to turn you
into Bulgasal a thousand years ago.

301
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,451
It was nothing much.

302
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,621
But didn't you tell me not to think
about what Ok Eul-tae said?

303
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,248
Well…

304
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,750
So why are you suddenly--

305
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,056
DETECTIVE KWON HO-YEOL

306
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,651
I looked into the mansion
and buildings under Ok Eul-tae's name,

307
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,570
but there were no traces of him.

308
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,405
What did Mr. Gu say?

309
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,909
He's on a stakeout at Ok Eul-tae's house,
but he hasn't come back home yet.

310
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,453
Where the heck is he?

311
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,121
Or…

312
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,458
what if he's already
hiding near your house?

313
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,586
I doubt that. He knows what I'm thinking.

314
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,379
He knows he'll die if we meet.

315
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,173
So he'll try to stay under the radar.

316
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,842
And he'll just wait
until I leave this house.

317
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,553
Okay. I'll keep looking.
I'll call you again.

318
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,525
41 SAN, SANGYONG CITY, GYEONGGI-DO

319
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,247
Goodness.

320
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,345
NO VEHICLES ALLOWED ENTRY
PRIVATE PROPERTY, NO TRESPASSING

321
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,518
Gosh. You startled me.

322
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,770
You're on private property.
You can't come in.

323
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,314
I just had a few questions.

324
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,441
But it's a little too early, right?

325
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,612
Do you work here?

326
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,738
Yes.

327
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,450
This land belongs to Mr. Ok Eul-tae.

328
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,202
Do you know him?

329
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,412
I do.

330
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:19,624
Did Mr. Ok Eul-tae come here recently?

331
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,585
No one comes here because it's so far.

332
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,086
It's always only me.

333
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,715
I see. Is that so?

334
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,100
POLICE STATION

335
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,226
What?

336
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:43,190
Are you serious? You're calling
in the morning to ask me for a favor?

337
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,109
I was called in early this morning.
I'm exhausted.

338
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,320
Gosh, Captain Ham.

339
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,573
I knew you were competent
but you're diligent too? Goodness.

340
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,659
Enough with the chitchat.
I'm busy. Just cut to the chase.

341
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,579
There's a farm at Mount Dongbu.

342
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,541
Can you do a background check
on a man who works at the farm?

343
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,835
You want his personal information?

344
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,629
You know that's illegal.

345
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,339
Something is off about this guy.

346
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,383
I've seen eyes like his
when I was on the job.

347
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,760
And his face--

348
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,096
Goodness. Do you think
you're a face reader now?

349
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,225
And he looks familiar too.

350
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,481
Don't reverse park here.
You'll damage the trees.

351
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:33,490
Hey. Can't you help me out here?

352
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,659
No. I can't.

353
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,577
I'll get in trouble for this.

354
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:38,995
I'm busy.

355
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,763
Goodness.
He must think I'm still his junior.

356
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,476
-Hey.
-You're here.

357
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,979
I didn't even wash up. What is it?

358
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,856
Why are you bringing me in on your case?
What's this about?

359
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,400
Come with me.

360
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,196
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, SAFE NATION

361
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:18,868
This came from the Chairman,
so there can't be any mistakes. Okay?

362
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,121
Yes, sir.

363
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,289
Good day.

364
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,348
Are you okay, Sang-un?
What's on your mind?

365
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,769
Oh, it's nothing.

366
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,604
You didn't even get any sleep.

367
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,273
Go get some sleep. I got this.

368
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,321
I'm fine. I just had something on my mind.

369
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,364
You're acting weird.

370
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,075
Did something happen between you and Hwal?

371
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,829
You guys always stuck together.
But you won't even go near each other.

372
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,000
Did you two fight?

373
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,960
Don't tell me

374
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,713
he rejected your feelings for him?

375
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,630
What?

376
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,718
It's nothing like that.

377
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,651
What is it?

378
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,615
You've been out for too long.
It's bothering me.

379
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,079
I have to go inside and cook.

380
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,632
Do you have something to say?

381
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,593
No.

382
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,098
Then why do you keep glancing at me?

383
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,642
I didn't glance at you.

384
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,269
You've never done laundry, right?

385
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,190
You have to do this.
Or it will have wrinkles.

386
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,201
Hey. I gave it some thought.

387
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,161
It's not too late.

388
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,788
What do you mean?

389
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,417
To take your soul from me.

390
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,711
We already decided not to do that.

391
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,464
Or is it because you don't trust me?

392
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,842
Can't you not ask any questions,

393
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,052
and just do things the way I want?

394
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,264
Let's go back to how it was before.

395
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,058
That means

396
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,353
you don't feel safe
that I'm Bulgasal, right?

397
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,897
You saw me kill people in your past life.

398
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,399
So I might do the same thing…

399
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,943
as Bulgasal.

400
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,865
But ever since I became Bulgasal,

401
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,534
I've never killed innocent people.

402
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,745
I only killed murderers.

403
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,705
I tried my best not to forget…

404
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,958
that I was human

405
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,170
and that I still am.

406
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,466
Despite that, if you still don't feel safe
that I'm Bulgasal, give me some time

407
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,426
because once I find Ok Eul-tae,

408
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,928
I'll be gone and you won't
have to worry anymore.

409
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,356
Hwal!

410
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,734
Hurry.

411
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,157
What? What is it?

412
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,911
Well, Ms. Lee won't come out of her room.

413
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,079
We cooked for her, but she has no appetite

414
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,122
-and won't get up.
-What?

415
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,125
Is that why you called me in such a hurry?

416
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,211
I thought there was a serious problem.

417
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,214
Come on. This is all your fault.

418
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,842
You know what? Go to Ms. Lee,
apologize, and make her feel better.

419
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,053
Goodness.

420
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,263
You can't even cook. What do you mean you…

421
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,226
Let's eat.

422
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,564
Gosh. We haven't been here in a while.
Look at us fighting already.

423
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,691
Hwal. Please!

424
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,236
-Just make up with her already.
-She's often like this.

425
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,154
She'll get over it.

426
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,742
Wait. I see a car coming here.

427
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,125
It's the police. What are they doing here?

428
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,544
Stay away from the window.

429
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,046
Hwal, you go upstairs.

430
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,173
-What are you going to do?
-Isn't it obvious?

431
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,800
I'll send them back as always.

432
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,593
That's what I do.

433
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,688
You two, come with me.
The rest of you, check for exits!

434
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,860
What are we doing here?
You're not going to tell me?

435
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,654
Just watch for now.
I'll fill you in later.

436
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,878
You're going to break the door.
What do you want?

437
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,337
I'm from the police.

438
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,882
We received a report that
a murder suspect was here.

439
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,175
Murder?

440
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,262
Yes. The swimming pool case in Hwanam,

441
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,389
the missing building owner
in Yeongsu-dong,

442
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,349
and the Mount Padu case.

443
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,812
These composite sketches are based
on witness statements.

444
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,855
WANTED
MURDER, ACCESSORY TO MURDER

445
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,939
They're here, right?

446
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,318
Gosh, I don't recognize them.

447
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,237
You came to the wrong place.
I live here alone.

448
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,574
Well, we'll see about that.
Here's the search warrant.

449
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,326
What are you doing? I live alone!

450
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,705
Police. Open up!

451
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,709
You should go now.

452
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,211
I don't know what's happening right now,

453
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,088
but you can't get caught.

454
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,965
They might find out you're not human.

455
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,134
-What about you?
-Don't worry about me. Go now.

456
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:12,764
Sang-un, what are you talking about?
You should go with Hwal.

457
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,273
Police! Open up!

458
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:25,860
Oh, my gosh!

459
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,949
What the heck is going on here?

460
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,992
-Gosh.
-Go in pairs. Search everywhere!

461
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,496
You didn't even take off your shoes!
It's my house! You jerks!

462
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,375
That's my kitchen!
Why are you going in there?

463
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,335
What's going on?

464
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,503
-Did they leave?
-Yes.

465
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,006
That's the kitchen! Come on!

466
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,551
Hurry up and search the area!

467
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,181
I was told they would be here for sure.

468
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,643
Yeongsu-dong? The Pasu-dong case?
What's all that about?

469
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,562
Besides, my team was
in charge of the swimming pool case.

470
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,191
The case was closed because
he killed himself. But a murder suspect?

471
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,943
The culprit didn't kill himself.

472
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,987
I got a tip he was murdered.

473
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,657
This murderer goes
around the country and kills people.

474
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,368
Who gave you the tip?

475
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,666
Do you think Ok Eul-tae told the police?

476
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,335
If people find out that you are Bulgasal,

477
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,920
it won't be good for him either.

478
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,014
He wanted me to leave the house.

479
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,684
So I would be caught by the police
and he could do what he said.

480
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,356
He told me
he would kill everyone I cherished.

481
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,160
What should we do?
The police are involved now.

482
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,579
I'll think about it once the police leave.

483
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,373
They'll leave if they can't find us.

484
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,670
Gosh. I told you it was just us here.

485
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,506
-Do-yun. We have to stay together.
-Hey, don't go there.

486
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,051
We couldn't find them.

487
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,761
We'll have to pull out.

488
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,847
What? All of a sudden?

489
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,349
No. I understand.

490
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,854
Hey, let's go.

491
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,066
You two need to come with us.

492
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,027
-Me?
-Why?

493
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,072
-You're important witnesses. Take them.
-What?

494
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,156
-What?
-Take them.

495
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,157
-What is this?
-No!

496
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,327
I put up with your ridiculous search.

497
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,704
You're taking innocent kids? Unbelievable!

498
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,623
-Please move.
-No, I won't!

499
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,792
Get your hands off them. And leave.

500
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,210
-Hey.
-You can't do this.

501
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,212
What are you doing?

502
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,880
You can't force them to come.

503
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,549
Right. Let's follow the law.
Should I call my lawyer?

504
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,427
I even know a detective.
Should I call my lawyer?

505
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,762
Come on. Arrest them!

506
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,555
Yes, sir. Please move.

507
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,182
-Ma'am!
-No!

508
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,935
-Why are you doing this?
-Let go of me!

509
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,229
-Come on!
-Hey. Be careful!

510
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,897
-Gosh. What are you doing?
-No!

511
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,739
Si-ho.

512
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,117
Si-ho!

513
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,042
They're not here.

514
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,389
-Why did you come, Ms. Lee?
-Exactly.

515
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,934
I should come with you as your guardian.

516
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,437
You'd better not try anything funny
at the station. Or I'll destroy you.

517
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,815
Come on. Be quiet.

518
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,567
Are we the culprits?

519
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,027
How dare you tell us to be quiet?

520
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,655
That's enough, Ms. Lee.

521
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:07,206
We have to get our stories straight
at the police station.

522
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,084
We have to tell them
we don't know anything about those two.

523
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,002
Nothing at all.

524
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,587
Right. Okay.

525
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,426
But why am I so nervous?

526
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,429
Don't worry.

527
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,057
Let's finish this quickly
and have some gukbap afterward.

528
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,209
But this route doesn't lead to anywhere.

529
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,377
Where are we going?

530
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,006
Hey, you can't investigate like this.

531
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,591
There was never an investigation.

532
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,593
They're our targets.

533
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,429
It came from the higher-ups.

534
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,933
After this case,
we'll be going places. Okay?

535
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,478
The higher-ups? Who ordered this?

536
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:30,665
I took care of the case as you requested.
They will be here soon.

537
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,709
I hope you know that I had to force

538
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,212
my people to get this done

539
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,256
and quash the murder case before too.

540
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,091
Because you asked me to.

541
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,897
I just hope that
you can recognize my efforts.

542
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,524
The general election is next year.

543
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:01,153
The more influence I have,
the more I can be of service to you.

544
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,321
That's all.

545
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,749
What's wrong?

546
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,794
The wound isn't healing.

547
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:21,048
Hwal. The wound he gave me…

548
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,347
That's odd.

549
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,058
Are you all right?

550
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,228
-What were you saying?
-Oh, right.

551
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,691
I was hoping that you could help me
with the general election next year.

552
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,192
So I can go to the capital.

553
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,403
No. You have to stay here.

554
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,572
What? Why must I?

555
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,116
I need someone to clean up the mess.

556
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,411
And you're the only one
who will get his hands dirty.

557
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,081
I've done nothing
but serve you for the last 15 years.

558
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,626
Starting with the twin sisters case,
I cleaned up every mess you made.

559
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,671
You want me to stay as your cleaner?

560
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,800
Then I won't sit back anymore!

561
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,428
I'm going to expose you

562
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,513
and your bizarre identity.

563
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,183
I have evidence.

564
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,060
I can just…

565
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,380
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable…

566
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,470
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable…

567
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,933
-Did you reach them?
-No, all three of them aren't answering.

568
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,685
-What about Detective Kwon?
-He's not answering either.

569
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,686
Hello?

570
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,688
Hello?

571
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,317
Where are you? Are you all right?

572
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,569
What's wrong? What happened?

573
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,988
Remember your junior detective
at the station?

574
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,200
-The one I told you to stay away from.
-Detective Ham? Why?

575
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,619
Can you find out where he is right now?

576
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,882
You're not getting out?

577
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,928
Why did you get me involved in this?
What is it? Why me?

578
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,596
I didn't choose you.

579
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,266
-I was instructed to bring you.
-You were instructed?

580
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,645
Captain Ham,
let's just do what we were told to.

581
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,522
We followed orders and brought them.

582
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,567
It's nothing serious. It's over now.

583
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,652
Let's go in and say hello.
Come on out now.

584
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,742
HO-YEOL

585
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,416
Why do you keep calling me? I'm busy.

586
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,709
Where are you?

587
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,044
I'm working. Let's talk later.

588
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,629
Working?

589
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,341
Do you have any idea

590
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,927
whom you took those people to?

591
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,388
What? How did you know?

592
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,433
Tell me where you are right now.
You made a very big mistake.

593
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,561
How could a cop be a henchman
to a man he doesn't know?

594
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,688
So you really became a dirty cop?

595
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,940
Hey. Are you listening to me?

596
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,987
Don't reverse park here.
You'll damage the trees.

597
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,117
Okay. I'll call you later.

598
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,660
Hey!

599
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:55,638
Don't reverse park here.
You'll damage the trees.

600
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,783
Do you think they're at the farm?

601
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,661
The detective is there, so they must be.

602
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:22,873
They should be okay, right?
He couldn't already have…

603
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,750
No. It's not too late.

604
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,754
I'm sure they're okay. We can save them.

605
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,846
Hello?

606
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,974
Who is this? Si-ho?

607
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,475
It's me.

608
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,270
Is this our first phone call?

609
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,569
Where are they right now?

610
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,321
Where they are is not what's important.

611
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,115
You should be asking why I took them.

612
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,449
Why did you take them?

613
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,494
You only want to kill me.
Why are you getting them involved?

614
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,996
To show you…

615
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,165
Hwal's true colors.

616
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,295
I want to show you…

617
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:14,258
the true colors of the man
who has your trust and who protects you.

618
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,846
I'm not interested in that.

619
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,308
So send my family back right now.

620
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,560
No. You have to know

621
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,354
why you wanted
to kill Hwal in your past life.

622
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,274
He's just like me.

623
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,070
I'll go to you. I'm the one you want.

624
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,074
Break my soul, and fill your dark hole.

625
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,328
So don't hurt them. Please.

626
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,460
If you lay even a finger on them,

627
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,795
I'll separate your flesh from your bones.

628
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,716
I'll do it over and over again
so you will be in pain forever!

629
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:22,826
Have we met?

630
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,414
I've seen you from afar with
the Mayor and the Police Commissioner.

631
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,340
I brought Detective Ham Un-yeong
like you wanted.

632
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,097
Where are they?

633
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,878
You're Ok Eul-tae, right?

634
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,964
Why did you bring us here?

635
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,217
Once Hwal finds out,
he won't let you get away with this.

636
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,136
Ms. Lee.

637
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,805
What do you want from us?

638
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,140
Tell us.

639
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,267
Hey.

640
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,687
Be quiet. He'll be here soon.

641
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,690
What? Who?

642
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,410
This is them?

643
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,371
The woman in the photo isn't here.

644
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,375
That girl is Min Sang-un's sister.

645
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,335
If you kill her…

646
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,130
Min Sang-un will

647
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,300
come looking for you.

648
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,385
What are you talking about?

649
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,304
There are cops outside!

650
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,514
Hey! Detectives!

651
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,309
Do you know what they're doing?

652
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,352
They're going to kill us!

653
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,772
Take care of them. I'll be outside.

654
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,234
There's someone
I would rather not see get killed.

655
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,711
Ms. Lee!

656
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,046
Stop!

657
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,689
Eul-tae!

658
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,025
You promised me.

659
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,110
You promised not to hurt Si-ho.

660
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,906
You promised when we hung out. Remember?

661
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,491
Eul-tae.

662
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:11,495
I'll forgive you.
I forgot about how you tried to kill me.

663
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,540
And even about
what happened to my brother.

664
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,750
He was sick.
There was nothing you could do.

665
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,043
I won't hate you.

666
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,464
I'll leave Hwal and Sang-un too.

667
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,092
Please. I'm begging you.

668
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,929
Please let Si-ho and Ms. Lee go.

669
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,808
Please? Eul-tae.

670
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,270
Eul-tae.

671
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,448
What was that?

672
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,826
That hurts!

673
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,248
Ms. Lee…

674
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,166
-No!
-Ms. Lee.

675
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,753
No!

676
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,590
Let go!

677
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,722
-Ms. Lee!
-Ms. Lee!

678
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,646
Ms. Lee, are you all right?

679
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,649
What a mess.

680
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:27,404
An evil spirit will come…

681
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,117
from the dark hole.

682
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,622
The evil spirit
that fed off its father's blood

683
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,084
will rise up from the dark hole.

684
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:47,883
The evil spirit opened the dark hole.

685
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,887
And now,

686
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,767
it is coming to close it.

687
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:02,439
The soul will go back to its owner.

688
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:09,321
The soul will go back to its owner.

689
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,681
Hey. I'm here.

690
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:41,103
I can't see them from here.
When will you get here?

691
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,855
I'm on my way.
Don't do anything and just wait for me.

692
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:46,650
Okay.

693
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,861
I don't want to face Ok Eul-tae
on my own anyway.

694
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,118
What…

695
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,705
That punk.

696
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,785
Did he…

697
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,245
Ms. Lee.

698
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,791
You're okay.
You're going to be okay, Ms. Lee.

699
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:49,171
-Ms. Lee. Stay with me!
-Ms. Lee.

700
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,214
-Ms. Lee! Please!
-You'll be okay.

701
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,133
Ms. Lee…

702
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,013
You're going to live.

703
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:03,477
You said we were going
to have gukbap together.

704
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,229
Please? Oh, no.

705
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,442
Run.

706
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:14,321
Run away…

707
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,241
before they come back.

708
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,703
How could we possibly leave you behind?

709
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,834
-Si-ho…
-Yes?

710
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,503
Do you think you can lift her?

711
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,798
Can the three of us make it out of here?

712
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:34,800
Yes.

713
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,762
Just go without me.

714
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,898
The three of you have to live.

715
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:52,692
You…

716
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,781
Do-yun…

717
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,742
and…

718
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,372
the baby you're carrying.

719
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,593
No…

720
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,430
No, Ms. Lee.

721
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,310
No, Ms. Lee!

722
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,104
Wake up, Ms. Lee!

723
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,947
-Ms. Lee.
-Ms. Lee.

724
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:41,616
Ms. Lee!

725
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,419
That's right.

726
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,129
Living together makes us a family.

727
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,801
Look at him go.

728
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,595
It tastes so good.

729
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,691
Ms. Lee!

730
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,569
Ms. Lee…

731
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:20,906
Ms. Lee…

732
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,245
Mr. Kwon.

733
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,248
-Mr. Kwon. What do we do?
-Mr. Kwon…

734
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,385
Ms. Lee…

735
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,434
Ms. Lee…

736
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,072
Ms. Lee…

737
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,822
BIBI LANDSCAPING

738
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,033
Let's go.

739
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,872
Come on.

740
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,125
We're done here.

741
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:04,926
Did you see them?

742
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,137
They're the suspects.

743
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,645
Detective Kwon.

744
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:19,607
Wake up.

745
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,486
Where are the others?

746
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,238
Where…

747
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:28,867
Where are they?

748
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,287
I couldn't protect them.

749
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,540
I couldn't…

750
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:02,984
Ms. Lee.

751
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,151
Ho-yeol!

752
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,318
What happened?

753
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,532
Damn it. What happened here?

754
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,536
Hey. You're the suspect, aren't you?

755
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,413
He's the guy we're looking for, right?

756
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,165
What are you going to do now?

757
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,625
Arrest them both.

758
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,378
You're under arrest for murder.

759
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,547
-You have the right to--
-Where are they?

760
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,050
What?

761
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,261
The ones you took. Where are they?

762
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,431
What's he talking about?

763
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,897
Damn it. What do you think you're doing?

764
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,320
You…

765
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,041
No, Hwal!

766
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,719
Stop!

767
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,575
Stop!

768
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,160
What are you doing?

769
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,079
Stop it.

770
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,581
You said you don't kill people

771
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,251
even after you became Bulgasal.

772
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,961
I don't care about that now.

773
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,880
I'll kill them all.

774
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,508
Anyone who hurts my family
or gets in my way.

775
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,678
I'm going to kill them all.

776
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,654
I want to show you the true colors
of the man who protects you.

777
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,782
He's just like me.

778
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,666
Where are the other two?

779
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,976
The man who works here took them.

780
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,947
Snap out of it! Please!

781
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,243
You can't become like Ok Eul-tae.

782
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,121
Look at me.

783
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:28,750
Are you…

784
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,753
the Dan Hwal that I know?

785
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,672
The one who wanted to remain human?

786
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,676
I won't hurt him.

787
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,803
Eventually, he'll be on my side.

788
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,098
Hwal will come.

789
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:30,353
Everything will go back
to its rightful place.

790
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,356
Someone died because of you.

791
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,608
You took three innocent people

792
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,069
and handed them over
to Ok Eul-tae and a murderer.

793
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,114
I'm over here!

794
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:46,619
No!

795
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,545
Ok Eul-tae and I are the same.

796
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,507
You should stop coming here too.

797
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,425
Hey, Hwal!

798
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,384
How is Hwal?

799
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,302
Has he shown his true colors yet?

800
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,806
Because I wanted to become Bulgasal,

801
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,933
my family keeps
paying the price with their deaths.

802
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:19,360
