EPISODE 11

2
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,516
Do-yun.

3
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,267
What are you doing?

4
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,520
Where have you been?

5
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,563
Everyone's out looking for you.

6
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,169
Do-yun.

7
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,047
Do-yun.

8
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,049
Do-yun!

9
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:25,228
EMERGENCY CENTER

10
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,412
Wake up, Do-yun! Do-yun!

11
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,999
-Do-yun. Wake up, kid.
-What should we do?

12
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,001
-Hurry!
-What should we do, Detective Kwon?

13
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,643
The doctor said
that his vital organs weren't damaged.

14
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,813
The hospital was going to call the police.

15
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,983
But Detective Kwon handled it.

16
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,110
Thank you.

17
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,405
You don't have to thank me.

18
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,117
But when you first found him…

19
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,329
was there really no one around?

20
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,998
The one who did this to him.

21
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,124
I told you.

22
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,669
When I arrived,
the culprit had already run away.

23
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,546
What about other traces?
You didn't find anything?

24
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,383
We can catch the culprit later.

25
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,051
Do-yun's recovery is our priority.

26
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,387
Once Do-yun wakes up,

27
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,389
we'll find out who did this to him.

28
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,479
SI-HO

29
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,565
Si-ho is calling me. What should I say?

30
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,568
Don't tell her about
what happened to Do-yun.

31
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,195
She'll only worry.

32
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,746
We found Do-yun. He's with us now.

33
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,749
Really? Then you should have
called me right away.

34
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,211
Right. Sorry about that.

35
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,213
Things were so hectic.

36
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,174
Anyway, I'm glad to hear that.

37
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,221
I had a weird dream about Do-yun.
It was unsettling.

38
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,765
How is he?

39
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,185
He must be devastated
about his brother's death.

40
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,270
Right.

41
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,230
He's fine.

42
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,648
We're with him.

43
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,608
Don't worry.

44
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,693
Okay.

45
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,157
They found Do-yun?
So when is he coming back home?

46
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,284
Later. Something came up.

47
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,452
What? Nonsense!

48
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,038
They should bring him home right away!

49
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,376
The house feels empty without them.

50
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,712
I know.

51
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,423
I liked it when everyone was home.

52
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,092
Now, I feel…

53
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,262
so lonely in this house.

54
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,595
How's Do-yun?

55
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,223
The same.

56
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,103
So is that guy.

57
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,147
Yes.

58
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,857
Should we go out for a bit?

59
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:44,987
Thank you.

60
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,535
I get that Bulgasal doesn't have to eat.

61
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,328
But we, humans, do.

62
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,747
Dig in.

63
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,552
But why do you think
Do-yun isn't waking up?

64
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,179
Perhaps, he doesn't want to.

65
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,349
When he does,
he'll have nothing but misery.

66
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,270
But he seems okay, so he'll wake up soon.

67
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,772
Don't worry.

68
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,023
I hope so.

69
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,113
Actually, I wanted
to ask you something too.

70
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,866
Hwal called himself his father.

71
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,702
What was that about?

72
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,788
Oh, that?

73
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,084
Do-yun was Hwal's son in a past life.

74
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,212
His son in a past life?

75
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,717
Bulgasal can have children?

76
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,761
No. I told you the other day.

77
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,055
Hwal used to be human too.

78
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,266
He became Bulgasal because of me.

79
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,937
Because of you?

80
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,147
Yes.

81
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,127
Detective Kwon bought
some clothes for you.

82
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,466
Detective Kwon?

83
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,467
Yes.

84
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,177
He might sound cold,

85
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,429
but I think he's worried about you.

86
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,764
He said you should rest.

87
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,148
Why do you look like
the world is ending for you?

88
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,111
Do-yun will wake up soon.
And he'll get better.

89
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,072
So cheer up.

90
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,574
Well…

91
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,871
I can't relax.

92
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,876
I'm afraid I might lose him again
just like 600 years ago.

93
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,506
And that terrifies me.

94
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,350
Something like this…

95
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,729
will never happen again.

96
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,651
What are you two doing?

97
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,364
Why are you holding hands?

98
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,203
Do-yun. Are you all right?

99
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,207
No, I'm not.

100
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,751
-My stomach.
-I'll get the nurse.

101
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,836
No.

102
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,047
I'll go. You stay here.

103
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,225
Does it hurt a lot?

104
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,060
Did you also

105
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,355
feel like this when you were stabbed?

106
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,566
How did you put up with the pain?

107
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,277
It hurts like crazy. It's no joke.

108
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,280
I'm sorry.

109
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,077
Why are you sorry?
It's not like you stabbed me.

110
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,335
Tell me.

111
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,462
Who did this to you?

112
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,924
Was it Ok Eul-tae?

113
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,218
Why?

114
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,887
For what?

115
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,806
I…

116
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,310
found out something
I wasn't supposed to know.

117
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,651
Six hundred years ago…

118
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,155
Ok Eul-tae killed me and my mother.

119
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,914
So it's true
that Ok Eul-tae killed your family.

120
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,501
And he tried to kill Do-yun
to keep that a secret.

121
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,089
Where are you going?

122
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,467
To ask him if it's true.

123
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,843
What are you going to do?

124
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,887
We don't know how to kill him yet.

125
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,473
It can wait.

126
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,101
Do-yun's recovery comes first.

127
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,479
Gone?

128
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,774
He had already been discharged
when I got there.

129
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,651
He was there for five days.

130
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,528
How was Do-yun?

131
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,489
The surgery went well
and he was recovering.

132
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,418
Hwal must have found out
everything by now.

133
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,548
How should I explain this to him?

134
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,302
What should I do?

135
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,140
Don't do anything.

136
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,352
Hwal will come to me. I should get ready.

137
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,317
I must have hesitated…

138
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,696
when I stabbed Do-yun.

139
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,993
It looks like my end is nearing.

140
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,544
Goodness. What on earth happened?

141
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,587
Where are you hurt?

142
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,966
It's nothing.

143
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,011
Hwal got hurt last time,
and this time, it's you?

144
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,929
Is getting hurt a thing in our house?

145
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,265
You said nothing was wrong.

146
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,185
I didn't want you to worry.

147
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,937
-Let me. Come here.
-Sure.

148
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,190
-My stomach.
-Oh, my.

149
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,359
Stop whining. You're not the only one
who's been stabbed before.

150
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,278
Stabbed? He was stabbed?

151
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,405
-Sang-un!
-How bad was it?

152
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,700
-I'll explain later, okay?
-How could you not tell me about it?

153
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,452
Oh, my goodness!

154
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,914
It's just that
everyone is worried about you.

155
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,166
I know.

156
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,628
But it's awkward.

157
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,922
I've never had anyone
worry about me like that.

158
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,924
I don't know how to react.

159
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,759
Whatever you want, just name it.

160
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,388
Gosh. Almost dying has its perks.

161
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,016
You're giving me special treatment. Gosh.

162
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,435
What do you mean?
I'm treating you the same way.

163
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,607
Then I want
a whole fried chicken to myself.

164
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,860
I really want to stuff myself
with fried chicken.

165
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,238
You got it.

166
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,989
But not now. After you recover.

167
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:45,908
Anything else?

168
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,871
How about a supercar?

169
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,958
Okay. I'll buy you one
once you get a license.

170
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:58,254
What? I only said that to tease you.

171
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,130
Gosh, never mind. I don't need a car.

172
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,466
Once I recover, let's go camping.

173
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,970
And I want to go fishing too.
I've never gone fishing before.

174
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,807
Actually…

175
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,978
I was going to go fishing
with my brother once he was cured.

176
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,647
But we won't be able to now.

177
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:24,405
But I do have a favor to ask you.

178
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,240
What is it?

179
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,244
Can you kill Ok Eul-tae for me?

180
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,126
I was going to do that anyway.

181
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,045
Then that's all I want.

182
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,756
Forget about the other stuff.

183
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,303
I want to get some sleep. I'm tired.

184
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,510
It feels weird

185
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,888
to see my portrait in flames.

186
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,599
More so for me.

187
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,644
I kept it with me wherever I went
for a very long time.

188
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,022
I stared at it every day to remind myself

189
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,900
of who I had to get revenge on.

190
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,571
I'm sorry…

191
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,538
for loathing and hating you for 600 years.

192
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,458
I'm sorry for that.

193
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,132
It's okay.

194
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,678
You didn't kill me
or take my soul and lock me up.

195
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,263
You actually protected me from Ok Eul-tae.

196
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,266
I was going to get revenge on you

197
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,519
after getting rid of Ok Eul-tae.

198
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,646
I didn't have good intentions.

199
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,692
That brings me to my point.
I'll handle Ok Eul-tae from now on.

200
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,818
You stay out of it.

201
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,778
What do you mean?

202
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,405
I'll get him on my own.

203
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,156
I'll help you and your sister hide.

204
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,324
And…

205
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,994
please look after Do-yun for me.

206
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,745
What are you going to do?

207
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,206
I'm going to put him in the well.

208
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,667
You said I'm the sword that can kill him.

209
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:43,752
No.

210
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,213
That won't work.

211
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,215
Use me.

212
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,758
I'll be bait.

213
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,135
I'll lure him to the well.

214
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,638
-That's too dangerous.
-I don't care as long as we can get him.

215
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,017
I've been thinking about it
for the past few days as well.

216
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,935
And don't forget.

217
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,187
Ok Eul-tae is my enemy too.

218
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,315
I have to see this through
for my mom and sister too.

219
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,692
You might really die.

220
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,110
I don't care if I do.

221
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,612
I'm okay as long as Si-ho is safe.

222
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,782
I'll think about it.

223
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,704
You want to protect Do-yun too.

224
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,956
I want to protect

225
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,042
Si-ho too.

226
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,884
And even if I die,

227
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,846
I can be reincarnated
as long as my soul is intact.

228
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,598
So in my next life,

229
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,684
come find me again.

230
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,521
I'll return your soul then.

231
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,027
Sang-un.

232
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,324
Sang-un?

233
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,846
Do-yun, why are you out here?

234
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,983
Do-yun.

235
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,367
What's the matter?

236
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,870
I was going to sleep.

237
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,581
But do I deserve to go to sleep

238
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,000
in comfort?

239
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,461
That thought crossed my mind.

240
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,759
I don't even know
where my brother is buried.

241
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,266
Maybe…

242
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,103
it would have been better
if I had died that day.

243
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,189
I've been thinking that too.

244
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,403
I'm completely alone in this world now.

245
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,829
No, you're not.

246
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,790
You have me, Sang-un, Ms. Lee,

247
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,668
Hwal, and Detective Kwon.

248
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,505
Everyone was worried about you
when you were gone.

249
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,051
So don't you ever say that again. Got it?

250
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,429
You're not alone.

251
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,764
Everyone here,

252
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,892
including me,

253
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,686
will be your family.

254
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,818
It'll be okay.

255
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,129
I'm sorry for everything
and how you got caught up in all of this.

256
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,798
I've been caught up in this
for a while now.

257
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,843
Take good care of Do-yun.

258
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,220
Don't lose him again.

259
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,566
All right.

260
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,485
Let's go.

261
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,570
Let's go.

262
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,697
We're not coming back here ever again?

263
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,991
I'll be coming back.

264
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,077
After getting everyone to a safe place.

265
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,038
Why? Do you not feel well?

266
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,581
I'm fine.

267
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,418
Now that I'm really leaving,
it's kind of sad.

268
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,005
I've gotten attached to this house.

269
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,595
I'll bring you back here soon.

270
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,514
I promise.

271
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,945
You make me deliver food now?

272
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,031
Isn't that a grill pan?

273
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,449
I think she brought meat.

274
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,326
Really? Awesome.

275
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,453
Goodness.

276
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,288
-Hey.
-No.

277
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,462
-Hey!
-Do-yun!

278
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,380
Wait until we light the candles first!

279
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,084
I bought this house a few years ago.

280
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,003
-I stay here when I'm in the area.
-What a fancy place.

281
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,881
Why did you stay
in that dump all these years?

282
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,299
What do you mean?

283
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,177
It was more like a haunted house.

284
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,555
Gosh. I should start unloading our stuff.

285
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,140
Let's do that.

286
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,935
Awesome. I want to live here
for the rest of my life.

287
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,896
But you didn't want to leave that place.

288
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,398
Hey, that was before I saw this place.

289
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,691
Si-ho!

290
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,778
I'm right here.

291
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,197
What? Push me. Let's go over there.

292
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,574
Hurry!

293
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,786
Hey, calm down.
Your stitches might pop open.

294
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,122
Hold on tight. All right.

295
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,010
-Goodness. Look over there.
-Here we go!

296
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,053
What are you doing?

297
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,102
Oh, you're watching them?

298
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,020
No. It's nothing.

299
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,731
Oh, stop. You're staring at them
with a dumbfounded look.

300
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,944
My goodness. Look at those brats.

301
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:09,197
We came here to hide away from Ok Eul-tae.
Why are they so excited?

302
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,157
They're such kids.

303
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,083
Do you need anything? I'll go shopping.

304
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,961
You will? Then go buy meat and charcoal.

305
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,505
Buy us some alcohol too.
And buy a lot of meat.

306
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,216
Are we here on a getaway trip?
Should I set up a tent?

307
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,551
Do you have one?

308
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:37,058
I mean, being at a place like this
makes me feel like we're on a trip.

309
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,102
We have to eat meat.

310
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,396
Si-ho and Do-yun have to eat well.

311
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,068
I should buy a lot of food, right?

312
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,864
What? You're changing
your stance just like that?

313
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,659
Right! We need some side dishes too!

314
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,161
I'll go with him.

315
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,162
Sure.

316
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,748
Wait for me!

317
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,758
Give them to me. I'll carry them.

318
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,012
No, it's okay. I can carry them myself.

319
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,513
Let me. They're heavy.

320
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,768
Hey.

321
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,647
Can't you just treat me
like you did before?

322
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,732
I can't get used to this.

323
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,360
Then should I be mean to you?

324
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,029
No.

325
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,501
-Gosh. Just like that?
-Oh, my.

326
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:48,421
I have to reel it in
and shake at the same time.

327
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,423
All right!

328
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,594
Mr. Kwon, do you always
carry a fishing rod around?

329
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,929
Are you good at fishing?

330
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,640
This is for my disguise
when I'm on a stakeout.

331
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,975
But watch me.

332
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,560
I wouldn't even teach
my children this trick.

333
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,772
Come on. You have no children to teach.

334
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,233
Hey.

335
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,530
That's why I'm teaching you guys,
total strangers.

336
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,698
All right.

337
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,075
We've been watching you.
So catch us some fish.

338
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,786
-Hurry. Just do it.
-Shall I then?

339
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,707
Let's go.

340
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,168
We have to go back
to that house before the sun sets.

341
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,128
Already?

342
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,505
If we don't go now…

343
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,758
I might not want to leave.

344
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,719
Wait.

345
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,222
Can't we stay here just for one night?

346
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,851
I want to stay with Si-ho a bit longer.

347
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,604
I wonder what kind of fish
live in this stream.

348
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,567
I might never get to see her again.

349
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,698
I want spicy fish stew.

350
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,034
You should spend
some time with Do-yun too.

351
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,660
You guys can talk.

352
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,621
You said you wanted to tell your son
something if you found him.

353
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,291
What is it?

354
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,459
I just realized

355
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,295
how much I told you about myself.

356
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,213
Even my innermost thoughts.

357
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,888
Hey! When did you guys get here?

358
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,725
What took you so long? I'm starving.

359
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,809
What did you get?

360
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,646
Gosh. This is grilled perfectly.

361
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,940
-Goodness.
-That looks delicious.

362
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,277
By the way, where's Hwal?

363
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,362
Well…

364
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,573
He didn't want to sit with us
since he doesn't eat anything.

365
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:39,949
-Come on.
-Gosh.

366
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,951
He should just sit with us
on a day like this.

367
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,036
What a party-pooper.

368
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,955
Why are you burning it all?

369
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,083
Let me do it. Step back. Give me that.

370
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,001
-You want some more?
-No, we have plenty.

371
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,127
Give it to me.

372
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,254
Oh, my.

373
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,801
Open a bottle.
I want a drink while grilling.

374
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,887
Gosh. Why is she bossing me around?

375
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,430
What did you say?

376
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,642
-Here. Drink it.
-What are you mumbling about? Gosh.

377
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,732
This hits the spot.

378
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,901
The meat is so tasty.

379
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,528
-It is, right?
-Yes!

380
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,822
I did a good job. Why is she on my case?

381
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,407
-Try it.
-It's not burnt.

382
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,034
Why is she so picky? Goodness.

383
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,371
-Mr. Kwon.
-What?

384
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:27,956
Can I have a sip?

385
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,334
No. Your wound will fester.

386
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,710
You're injured.

387
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:36,631
Listen. They say kids should learn
about drinking from their elders.

388
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,882
He's an elder.

389
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,218
You're telling me
you never had a drink before?

390
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,928
Stop lying.

391
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,849
I see. So you must have
started drinking in high school.

392
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,850
Of course.

393
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,896
Hey, Si-ho. You drank behind my back?

394
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,317
-You little…
-No. I just had a sip. Just to taste it.

395
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,153
-So you did drink.
-Hey.

396
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,280
Do we have any soft drinks?

397
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,031
Here, drink this.

398
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,451
-Your bravado cost you.
-Thank you.

399
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,119
Serves you right.

400
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:11,082
Once your wound heals,
you and I can get a drink.

401
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,169
Like you said, you need to learn
how to drink from elders.

402
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,172
Of course. Yes.

403
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,256
No.

404
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,720
He's too young to drink.

405
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,680
What do you mean?

406
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,349
Boys at his age can have a drink

407
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,393
and should date girls too.

408
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,895
-Okay?
-What are you saying?

409
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,480
He's still a kid.

410
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,440
I'm not a little kid.

411
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,817
He's such a boomer.

412
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,696
He's a 600-year-old boomer. Seriously.

413
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,158
My adoptive father was a real boomer.

414
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,827
He nagged me, forced me to drink,

415
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,370
and told lame jokes.

416
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,915
Why are you bringing up
your adoptive father now?

417
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,542
Are you being overprotective
of Do-yun because he's your kid…

418
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,380
His kid?

419
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,346
Enough with your nonsense.
Just keep drinking.

420
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,597
All right. Dig in.

421
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,808
Do-yun, drink this with your meal.

422
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:13,645
Hey, what good is working out
if you're not going to eat any protein?

423
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,438
No, forget it.

424
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,775
She's right. You should drink this.

425
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,443
You said no alcohol.

426
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,364
You can at least clink cans with me.
Cheers.

427
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,699
-We should too.
-Sure, we should.

428
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,701
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

429
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,837
What's wrong? Are you okay?

430
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,588
Do you want a wrap?

431
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,465
I'll make one for you.

432
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,051
You will?

433
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,525
Here. Go ahead.

434
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,777
I can feed myself.

435
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,578
I want one too. Here.

436
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,955
Do you not have hands?

437
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,420
Laugh all you want.

438
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,172
My cup is empty. Pour me a drink.

439
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,674
Do you not have hands?

440
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,139
Fine. Drink up.

441
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,600
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

442
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,439
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

443
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,732
What are you doing here?

444
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,193
Hey.

445
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,362
I'm on guard, just in case.

446
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,573
I don't want what happened
to Do-yun to repeat.

447
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,285
Don't worry.

448
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,995
Ok Eul-tae doesn't know this place.

449
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,664
Well…

450
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,418
I have a favor to ask.

451
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,003
What is it?

452
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,504
While I'm gone…

453
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,507
please take care of them.

454
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,095
So you're going to meet Ok Eul-tae?

455
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,479
If you're rash,
you might end up in trouble.

456
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,272
Are you worried about me?

457
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,815
Of course.

458
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,569
You're the only one
they can rely on right now.

459
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,490
Besides, you're the only one
I can trust for the time being too.

460
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,661
Okay. I won't put myself in danger.

461
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:41,125
Good. You even found
the son you lost 600 years ago.

462
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,339
-You need me.
-Fine. Just smell it.

463
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,425
-Why do people even drink this?
-This?

464
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:53,262
I can't understand how you feel
as I never had children.

465
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,933
Even if I did,
I might not have been able to understand.

466
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,228
I doubt I would have been a good father,

467
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,480
thinking back on my own.

468
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,443
I'm sure you would have.

469
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:11,072
You're reserved,
so you just don't express your affection.

470
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,699
You find it hard to apologize too.

471
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,536
You secretly worry about them
because you care a lot.

472
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,622
Gosh.

473
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,625
You don't know anything about me.

474
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,460
You were kind to a boy

475
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,130
who wasn't even your son.

476
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,882
What are you talking about?

477
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,804
You're good to Do-yun and Si-ho.

478
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,724
That's just because I care about them.

479
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,308
I just do.

480
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,270
Be good to them.

481
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,315
Be there when Si-ho gives birth.

482
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,694
And take good care of Do-yun too.

483
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,532
What's gotten into you?
You sound like you're going away for good.

484
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,576
Are you going to die?

485
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,829
Of course not. I'm Bulgasal.

486
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,668
Are you serious?

487
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,170
I don't know.

488
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,796
Where did they go?

489
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,506
Do you want a sip?

490
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,133
Wouldn't alcohol disinfect his wound?

491
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,552
Hey, that's not something to joke about!

492
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,604
Why am I so sleepy?

493
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,522
Maybe I ate too much.

494
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,025
-Go to sleep.
-Okay.

495
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,778
I can tuck myself into bed.

496
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,157
You're injured.
I'll tuck you in until you fully recover.

497
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,576
By the way,

498
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,871
I want to take back
what I said the other day.

499
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,414
What?

500
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,083
I asked you to kill Ok Eul-tae.

501
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,002
Can you not get revenge?

502
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,463
For your family.

503
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,840
I'll try not to get revenge
for my brother too.

504
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,844
I know it's not fair,
but if we let go, we can live together.

505
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,098
Let's hide from Ok Eul-tae
and live together like this.

506
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,518
Why am I so sleepy?

507
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,941
What? Why aren't you sleeping?

508
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,067
You said you were tired.

509
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,695
It's hard to fall asleep in a new house.

510
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,157
Right.

511
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,618
You never liked moving.

512
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,995
You get anxious.

513
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,415
But I feel fine this time.

514
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,751
Is it because we're all together?

515
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,090
I wish we could
all live together like this.

516
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:41,347
When it was just me and Ms. Lee at home…

517
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,892
The house felt so empty

518
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,019
even though we haven't
been together for long.

519
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,314
I see. Is that how you felt?

520
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,194
You know what?

521
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,239
Maybe I just wanted to have a family.

522
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,575
So I must have dated men,

523
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,535
no matter how awful they were,

524
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,996
because I wanted to feel
how it was to have a family.

525
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,207
I just wanted to make a family.

526
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,837
I must have wanted to live a normal life
like when Mom and Sang-yeon were alive.

527
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,010
We all started living together
because of Ok Eul-tae.

528
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,053
Isn't it ironic that I like this?

529
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,680
No.

530
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,690
I was really happy today too.

531
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,401
Right.

532
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,820
Ms. Lee, Do-yun,

533
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,740
and Detective Kwon are all nice people.

534
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,077
They're really nice to me
even when I behave like a spoiled brat.

535
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,123
Why did you leave out Hwal?

536
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,334
Try to get along with him.

537
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,544
It's not that.

538
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,505
I want to,

539
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,758
but how should I put it?

540
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,344
I still find him difficult.

541
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,180
He's Bulgasal.

542
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,390
He used to be human.

543
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,645
He's way too reserved and cold.

544
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,691
He's not that bad. Sometimes, he's kind.

545
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,318
I don't know.

546
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,696
Maybe you're only saying that
because you've never met a kind man.

547
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,823
You're so clueless.

548
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,286
A man who is nice
to everyone is likely to be a player.

549
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,164
He should be kind only to his woman.

550
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,583
Are you serious?

551
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,461
You've never had a real relationship.
You're all talk.

552
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,047
You don't have to date men to know that.

553
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,302
I want you to meet someone like Hwal.

554
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,932
So I know he'll take care of you
even if I'm not here.

555
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,601
Take care of me?

556
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,561
What are you planning this time?

557
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,189
I was just saying.

558
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,657
It can't be just the two of us forever.

559
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,119
Whatever. I don't want to hear that.

560
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,038
Besides, looks are important.

561
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,960
What? Hwal is good-looking.

562
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:21,340
I like cute guys.
Guys who are adorable like puppies.

563
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,342
I see.

564
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,720
Sang-un.

565
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,763
You're acting weird.

566
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,766
What do you mean?

567
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,184
Do you like him?

568
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,065
Are you serious? You're ridiculous.
Why would you ask me that?

569
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,401
You keep complimenting him.

570
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,028
You're putting him on a pedestal.

571
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,613
Well…

572
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,949
that's because he's a good man.

573
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,868
I'm just complimenting him.

574
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,120
Look at you.

575
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,290
Sang-un, you shouldn't like him.

576
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,542
He's Bulgasal.

577
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,879
Gosh, don't worry.

578
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,088
I don't like him.

579
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,093
Let's go to sleep.

580
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,871
Why are you out already? Get more sleep.

581
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,291
I can't fall asleep.

582
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,049
I came out after I saw Si-ho fall asleep.

583
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,428
But don't we have to get going soon?

584
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,889
What's that look on your face?

585
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,308
Are you nervous now that it's time?

586
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,185
A little bit.

587
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,485
We can catch Ok Eul-tae another way.

588
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,072
I came up with an idea.
I'll tell you later.

589
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,074
Can we pull it off
with just the two of us?

590
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,285
Yes. As long as you don't mess up.

591
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,914
Is that why you look down?
Because I might mess it up?

592
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,957
What do you mean?

593
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,167
You look super serious.

594
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,752
Lighten up a bit.

595
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,129
I should say that to you.

596
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,139
Happy?

597
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,852
By tomorrow, we'll be able to sleep
without any worries

598
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,687
after we put Ok Eul-tae in the well.

599
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,730
Aren't you happy about that?

600
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,361
You must be the carefree type.

601
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:48,863
No.

602
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,657
Well, you are.

603
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,119
You're unnecessarily positive
even in a situation like this.

604
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,122
Even when I was going to kill you,
you managed to stay with me.

605
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,167
I don't know if you're fearless, reckless,

606
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,169
or foolish.

607
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:07,798
Foolish? You really know nothing about me.

608
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,842
Actually, once you killed Ok Eul-tae,

609
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,178
I was going to run away if I could.

610
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,762
To a place where no one could find me.

611
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,848
You still think I'm foolish?

612
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:25,816
Gosh.

613
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:27,610
Look at you.

614
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,278
What?

615
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,779
Your face.

616
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,867
I've only seen you smile like that
when you were mocking people.

617
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,828
I didn't know you could smile like that.

618
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,456
Smile again. Please?

619
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,665
Stop it.

620
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,169
Just one more time. Smile one more time.

621
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,817
What's wrong?

622
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,278
No. It's…

623
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,868
The alcohol I drank earlier
must be getting to me now.

624
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,872
Good for you.

625
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,084
One of us might die and
the other might get ripped into pieces

626
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,211
when we go to Ok Eul-tae later.

627
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,843
Right.

628
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,935
Let's go get ready. It's time.

629
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,378
Why are we here?

630
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,256
We need to pack a few things.

631
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,675
You'll find ropes over there. Pack them.

632
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,137
Okay.

633
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,518
By the way…

634
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,190
did you get to talk to Do-yun?

635
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,776
No. Not really.

636
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,487
Then you must have not been able
to tell him what you wanted to.

637
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,198
I've never said it before.
So I couldn't bring myself to.

638
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,743
And Do-yun might find it weird too.

639
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:47,374
What were you going to say?
You can practice with me.

640
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:52,254
-Forget it.
-What is it? Just tell me.

641
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,718
It's nothing much.

642
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,804
I regretted not saying it to him
all those years ago.

643
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,017
He may not have known before he died.

644
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,603
That I don't hate him.

645
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,316
And that I love him.

646
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,536
Did it sound that weird?

647
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,917
No. I thought you had
something grand to say to him.

648
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,046
Everyone says that nowadays.

649
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,506
Even animals say…

650
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,383
Well, not animals.

651
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,135
People profess their love to anything.

652
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,101
It wasn't

653
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,687
weird at all.

654
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,905
Where are the ropes?

655
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:02,741
Are you okay?

656
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,828
Of course, I am.

657
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,455
It's just said Si-ho said
something ridiculous earlier.

658
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,750
No. You get anxious
when you're in a dark place.

659
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,045
Oh, that?

660
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,508
This room is big enough.

661
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,470
By the way, I don't see any…

662
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,691
Stay here until the morning.
I'm going there alone.

663
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,529
Open it.

664
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,866
Open the door now.

665
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,619
What if you go there alone and fail?

666
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:53,041
I'll go with you.
You can't go there alone!

667
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,591
Hwal!

668
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,926
Hwal!

669
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,693
Please open it!

670
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:36,043
DAN HWAL

671
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,795
You answered right away.

672
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,840
Yes. I was waiting for your call.

673
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,009
You took longer than I expected.

674
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,886
I had to sort out my thoughts.

675
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,472
We should meet.

676
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,806
We should.

677
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,934
Where should I go?

678
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,030
Is anyone there? Can you open the door?

679
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,241
-Si-ho.
-Sang-un.

680
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,909
Open the door.

681
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,536
Okay.

682
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,957
Sang-un, what were you doing in there?

683
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,250
Where's Hwal?

684
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,512
-You're late.
-This is no joke.

685
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,056
It's been a while since I hiked.
I'm out of breath.

686
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,475
Hold on. Let me catch my breath.

687
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,061
What the…

688
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,146
What is this?

689
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,274
POWER OFF

690
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,901
Who is it? Your girlfriend?

691
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,695
A spam call.

692
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,154
I doubt that.

693
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,282
But this place is so nice. Look.

694
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,701
You picked a great place
for our rendezvous.

695
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:54,121
Soak it in.
You might not be able to see it again.

696
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,748
Why would you say that? We just met.

697
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,458
You're scaring me.

698
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,795
How's Do-yun?

699
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:05,007
You're the one who stabbed him.
You don't get to ask how he is.

700
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,342
Right. I shouldn't, right?

701
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,179
So that must be where the well is.

702
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,015
The well you prepared for Min Sang-un.

703
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,600
Right.

704
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,273
You'll die if you go. What will you do?

705
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,901
This is the only way to kill Ok Eul-tae.

706
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,822
That's not true. There are other ways.
I can look at your past life.

707
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:30,240
I said no to that.

708
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,118
Do you think not traumatizing me

709
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,120
is more important than your life?

710
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:37,789
If you die, do you think
I'll be happy all by myself?

711
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,292
I told you I wanted to help.

712
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,754
I don't want to be in the dark
and wait until you resolve this.

713
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,717
I want to kill Ok Eul-tae too.

714
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:55,057
You called me here to put me
in there instead of Min Sang-un?

715
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,183
That's right.

716
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,352
What's your plan?

717
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,355
You must know that
I won't voluntarily go into that well.

718
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,149
You must have come here with a plan.
What is it?

719
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,068
It's no fun to spoil the surprise.

720
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,741
I could change the entire story.

721
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:17,537
I could separate your head
from your body and lock you in there.

722
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,081
So you can only stare

723
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,291
at your body for ten or a hundred years.

724
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:30,926
Make sure not to let go

725
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,053
no matter how I react.

726
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,681
We have to do it in one go.
Do you understand?

727
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:38,892
Yes.

728
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,146
Sang-un, you can't be nervous.

729
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,191
Don't be scared. I'll be fine.

730
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,319
All right.

731
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,260
Sang-yeon!

732
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,220
Sang-yeon!

733
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,770
It's okay.

734
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,489
Si-ho, it's okay.

735
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,908
Just keep going.

736
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:40,328
Don't stop. Just go past that.

737
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,332
Go and find Kim Hwa-yeon.

738
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,961
Go and find Kim Hwa-yeon.

739
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,391
Hwa-yeon, your medicine.

740
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,268
Dad wants you to take it.

741
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,688
Are you okay?

742
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,691
I have to kill it.

743
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,694
What?

744
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:16,114
I have to kill Bulgasal.

745
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,533
That again?

746
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,036
Stop talking about that. Okay?

747
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,662
Dad will be angry if he hears.

748
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,499
Take your medicine.

749
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,550
What are you doing? You're bleeding!

750
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,847
There's a way.

751
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,099
Wait here.
I'll go and get the first-aid kit.

752
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,276
I have to make them kill each other.

753
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,371
I see. This is the well.

754
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,165
How will you lock me up here?

755
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,543
You'll find out soon.

756
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,294
How come you haven't asked me

757
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,839
why I killed your family 600 years ago?

758
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,633
-I'm not curious.
-Why not?

759
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,552
Why…

760
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,310
I'm asking you a question.

761
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,604
So you don't even want to talk to me now?

762
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,775
You want me to ask a human-eating
Monster why he kills people?

763
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,611
But you should
at least ask me why I did it.

764
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,906
You should be angry that I deceived you.

765
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,868
Tell me you feel betrayed
by someone you thought was a friend!

766
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,997
You need to ask me why
for me to give you an answer.

767
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,833
Ask me.

768
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,378
Stop talking.
Come and check out your tomb.

769
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,548
See how cozy it is.

770
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,466
I bet it's cozy like a hotel room.

771
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:02,304
But can you see
in the dark as clearly as me?

772
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,055
What do you mean?

773
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,989
You're old school too.

774
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,116
You should at least put some lights here.

775
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,329
Look at this outdated lamp.
How much longer will you use this?

776
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,624
Does it hurt?

777
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,835
Hang in there a bit. You won't die anyway.

778
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,671
I won't lock you up in the well

779
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,506
because I still need you.

780
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,803
I told you
that I can't break her last soul.

781
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,763
You have to do it!

782
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,725
I need to tell you something important.
Don't try anything funny.

783
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,061
Just listen to what I have to say. Okay?

784
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,814
Don't do anything, and just listen.
I'm sure you can do it.

785
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:39,109
I will now tell you
why I killed your family.

786
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,819
Once you hear my story,

787
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,655
you will think differently of me. Okay?

788
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,536
What? What did you say?

789
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,664
What? What are you saying?

790
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,751
Why come after me if you can't beat me?
You can't even talk now.

791
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,879
Speak up.

792
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,928
What are you saying?

793
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,932
Hey, are you all right?

794
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,601
Maybe I stabbed your heart
right in the center.

795
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,063
Are you…

796
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,585
You told me

797
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,629
that the dark hole was your weakness.

798
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,591
I might not be able to kill you,

799
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,178
but I thought I could
make you vulnerable for a bit.

800
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,265
What have you done?

801
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,862
Stop it. Don't.

802
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,948
If you keep this up, we'll both die.

803
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,491
Both of us?

804
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,743
Don't be ridiculous.

805
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,162
You still don't get it?

806
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,833
This is what she's wanted all along.

807
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,918
She's been wanting this

808
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,671
for a thousand years.

809
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,673
Wanting what?

810
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,467
To kill…

811
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,680
Bulgasal.

812
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,977
I have to make them kill each other.

813
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,021
They have to stab
each other's hearts at the same time.

814
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,858
They…

815
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,820
are the swords that can kill each other.

816
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,739
Bulgasals…

817
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,368
are each other's lifelines.

818
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:40,623
Bulgasals aren't immortal
because they have no souls.

819
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,293
It's because they were born
a pair from the beginning.

820
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:48,298
So unless you kill them at the same time,
you can never get rid of them.

821
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,509
As long as one is alive,

822
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,553
the other will never die.

823
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,891
So she wanted us
to fight and kill each other?

824
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,644
Why? I get why she wants to kill you.
But why me?

825
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,563
Because she hates you.

826
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,440
A thousand years ago,

827
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:08,568
she gave you the curse of Bulgasal.

828
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,869
I told you that the woman who was born

829
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,079
with no memory on purpose

830
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:25,251
was deceiving you
and taking advantage of you.

831
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,344
What are you doing?
Didn't you hear what I said?

832
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,388
No. I heard you loud and clear.

833
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,057
She's taking advantage of me?

834
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,184
I don't care.
She can do whatever she wants.

835
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:46,064
I just need to get rid of you
for killing my family.

836
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,398
What?

837
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:59,160
I don't care if it costs me my life.
All I want to do is kill you,

838
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,828
so you can never hurt my family again.

839
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,706
This all happened because of you!

840
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,583
You wanted this!

841
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,670
It was for you.

842
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,881
I did it for you!

843
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,841
To turn you…

844
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,512
into Bulgasal.

845
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,641
You asked me to turn you into Bulgasal

846
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,019
a thousand years ago.

847
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:29,107
So on that day 600 years ago,

848
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:33,945
I brought that woman to you.

849
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,531
To make you Bulgasal.

850
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,408
To keep the promise I made to you!

851
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,326
Stop lying to me!

852
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,663
No! You'll kill us both!

853
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,957
I said I didn't care.

854
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,917
We can both die.

855
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,503
Then we won't be
in perpetual pain as Bulgasals.

856
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,466
No!

857
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,060
Don't go.

858
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,566
I told you everything you said
in your past life just now.

859
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,234
They both have to die.

860
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:16,029
Both Ok Eul-tae and Hwal must die.

861
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:20,158
We don't know why,
but we shouldn't trust Hwal either.

862
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,493
I know that.

863
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,580
But still…

864
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,415
Then why are you going?

865
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,088
I can't help myself.

866
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:37,759
Why?

867
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,528
No.

868
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,246
It can't be…

869
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,968
You're…

870
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,720
alive.

871
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:48,723
I told you to stay at home.

872
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,892
Why are you here?

873
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,481
I don't know.

874
01:02:57,982 --> 01:02:59,025
No.

875
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,694
Actually, I think I know why.

876
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,782
But I don't know why I feel this way.

877
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,577
What are you talking about?

878
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,288
What Si-ho said bothered me.

879
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,459
I was worried that
you would die with Ok Eul-tae.

880
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:27,428
I always wanted to get rid of Ok Eul-tae.

881
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,350
But I was afraid when I thought…

882
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,854
you would be gone too.

883
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,278
You have become more important to me…

884
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,283
than my revenge.

885
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:53,830
What do I do?

886
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,041
I've ruined this.

887
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,169
I've ruined everything.

888
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:10,489
This is our opportunity to get Ok Eul-tae.

889
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:14,785
So in order to kill Ok Eul-tae,
Hwal needs to die as well?

890
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:16,954
Promise me.

891
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,956
That you will lock him up
in the well without killing him.

892
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,166
Do you have feelings for me?

893
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,628
You want to know
what happened 1,000 years ago.

894
