EPISODE 4

2
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,996
Sang-un?

3
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,165
Is that you, Sang-un?

4
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,759
Who are you?

5
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,386
Are you okay?

6
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,477
Why are you here?

7
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,103
What's going on?

8
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,982
Why are they together?

9
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,734
Why did it have to be…

10
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,781
Why is she with that woman?

11
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,118
Who is he?

12
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,747
He has a knife.

13
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,755
No, Si-ho. That's not his.

14
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,757
He helped me.

15
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,931
Sang-un.

16
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,809
He seems strange.

17
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:28,481
Thank you for helping me.

18
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,401
Now that my sister's here, I'll be fine.

19
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,694
You should get treated.

20
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,696
Thank you so much.

21
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,613
Let's go.

22
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,864
Who was he?

23
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,869
Did he really help you?

24
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,838
He did.

25
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,550
But he was strange too.

26
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,973
He said something odd,
and his stare was frightening.

27
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,559
Was he one of those Monsters
that you talked about?

28
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,855
No. He didn't seem like one of them.

29
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,359
I'm not sure.

30
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,696
Let's sleep here tonight
and look for a new place tomorrow.

31
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,990
-It's too dangerous to stay here.
-What?

32
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,078
We're moving again?

33
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,249
The one I saw at our old apartment
could have been Bulgasal.

34
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,501
If I had accidentally
left something behind,

35
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,461
-then we shouldn't be here.
-Sang-un.

36
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,172
How long must we keep this up?

37
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,925
Always being on the run
is taking a toll on me.

38
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,677
I'm sick of it.

39
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,181
I understand, but what choice do we have?

40
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,100
Let's bear with it a little longer.

41
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,726
I can fix this.

42
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,062
Once I find a way…

43
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,563
A way to kill Bulgasal?

44
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,357
By finding that sword?

45
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,817
Is there even such a thing?

46
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,278
Does Bulgasal even exist?

47
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,320
Min Si-ho.

48
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,490
Don't you think
that's just absurd in this day and age?

49
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:46,077
I'm fed up with living in hiding
over something that ridiculous.

50
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,120
Okay?

51
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,913
I use a fake name,
a phone under a borrowed name,

52
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,749
have no bank account or credit cards,
and have no friends.

53
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,087
Is this living?

54
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,676
Do you want to stay here

55
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,972
because of your boyfriend?

56
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,517
No. We broke up today.

57
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,063
I'm just tired of living this life.

58
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,357
I refuse to live like this any longer!

59
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,986
Because…

60
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm pregnant.

61
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,877
What did your boyfriend say?

62
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,378
What does he want to do?

63
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,134
He wants no part in this.

64
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,802
It has nothing to do with him now.

65
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,972
It's my baby. I'll raise it on my own.

66
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,600
That's why I can't do this anymore.

67
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,770
First, I need a stable job. So I can't--

68
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,693
Don't worry.

69
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,408
I'll help you.

70
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,911
I'll look for a way.

71
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,790
Okay? I'll fix this.

72
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,751
How?

73
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,088
You only know how to run away.

74
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,091
Even now,

75
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,051
and back then too.

76
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,016
When we lost Mom and Sang-yeon,

77
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,685
you couldn't do anything.
No. You didn't do anything.

78
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,028
Sure. We were very young. But still…

79
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,531
you should have done something.

80
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,703
That…

81
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,415
-That was because--
-Don't touch me.

82
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,296
Is it bad again?

83
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,844
It hurts when my hands touch anything.

84
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,264
I keep having strange thoughts.

85
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,851
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

86
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,296
Is that you, Sang-un?

87
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,423
Who are you?

88
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,735
Father!

89
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,703
It…

90
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,538
It is your fault.

91
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,041
My baby.

92
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,220
Why? I do not understand.

93
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,307
Why have they died
when the curse of Bulgasal

94
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,517
has befallen me?

95
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,271
It is because they had ties with you.

96
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,317
They were dragged into your karma.

97
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,821
As long as the retribution continues,

98
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,824
they will be intertwined with you

99
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,494
in their next lives as well.

100
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,882
Either as enemies…

101
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,720
or as friends.

102
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,170
You are destined to meet them again.

103
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,968
And they will be dragged
into your karma once more.

104
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,145
What if I avoid them in the next life?

105
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,105
Such ties

106
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,692
cannot be broken that easily.

107
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,487
You will cross paths one way or another.

108
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,198
Isn't it common courtesy not to play music

109
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,158
when an unconscious person is in the car?

110
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,451
Are you awake?

111
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,788
You might as well tell the world
that you're Bulgasal.

112
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,332
Turn that down! My head hurts.

113
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,336
I just saved your life!
Maybe I should have just left you there.

114
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,341
Why are you here?

115
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,468
Were you supposed to come today?

116
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,387
Goodness, old man.

117
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,723
Being centuries-old
must have affected your memory.

118
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,433
It's delivery day.

119
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,688
Why did you crash your car?
Is something wrong?

120
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,566
I found her.

121
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,733
Found whom?

122
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,570
You did? That woman?

123
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,613
And next to her…

124
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,408
was Dan Sol.

125
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,869
They're sisters.

126
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,705
Your former wife and your enemy?

127
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,582
Why?

128
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,918
It's karma. An ill-fated bond.

129
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,213
Just like you said in the past.

130
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,633
There you go again. My goodness.

131
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,761
You keep saying
I told you things in a previous life.

132
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,535
Gosh, that's heavy.

133
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,663
Goodness.

134
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,550
Darn, these are so heavy.

135
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,179
Are you still disgusted by animal blood?

136
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,806
How did you even survive for centuries?

137
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,436
You need to drink this
if you want to survive.

138
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,940
If not, are you going to
lie in bed like a corpse

139
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,483
for years and years?

140
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,859
Gosh.

141
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,236
And can you please clean?

142
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,782
It looks like a haunted house.

143
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,700
Gosh.

144
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,662
It is haunted. I'm a ghost, after all.

145
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,246
It's a haunted house.

146
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,377
You're right.

147
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,129
From now on,

148
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,300
I should pay an entrance fee
every time I come here.

149
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,140
Still, you should clean up
once in a while.

150
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,350
That's enough. Just go.

151
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,144
I'm not some son you're checking in on.

152
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,107
And that's the last delivery.
You don't need to bring me any more.

153
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,320
Will you finally put an end to it?

154
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,239
You hesitated and failed last time.

155
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,053
That won't happen this time.

156
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,640
Really?

157
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,727
Then I guess I won't have to
come all the way here anymore.

158
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,439
This means I repaid you
for saving my life when I was young.

159
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,733
Don't be absurd.

160
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,152
What about the promise
you made 50 years ago?

161
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,197
Come on.
Do you really expect me to do that?

162
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,532
I should retrieve my soul

163
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,784
and turn her back into Bulgasal.

164
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,376
Then I'm going to lock her up
in that abandoned well.

165
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,003
Forever.

166
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,883
And your job

167
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,761
is to protect and manage that well.

168
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,931
-Until when?
-Until you die.

169
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,976
What?

170
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,728
Then your daughter

171
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,606
and then your granddaughter
will take over.

172
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:49,026
Why would you make me
do that tedious work? What about you?

173
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,528
Your offspring can do that.

174
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,074
Once you become a human again,

175
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,618
get married and have cute children, okay?

176
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,674
After all, you've found your wife too.

177
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,843
Right?

178
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,807
It's a previous life she can't remember.

179
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,601
She'll despise me

180
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,520
for killing her sister.

181
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,188
Sang-un.

182
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,607
He seems strange.

183
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,987
After her sister and I disappear…

184
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,867
please take care of Sol.

185
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,744
You'll disappear too?

186
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,496
What are you saying?

187
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,751
Monsters from the past have reincarnated.

188
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,921
They are after her right now
since she has my soul.

189
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,216
But once I retrieve it,
they'll come after me.

190
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,301
They will want me dead.

191
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,262
Those bastards.

192
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,931
Then find them first and get rid of them.

193
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,975
Didn't you say they were still murderers?

194
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,769
I will certainly get rid of one.

195
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,690
One of them has already found her.

196
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,027
He'll get in the way.

197
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,865
I need to kill him before locking her up.

198
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,826
After that,

199
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,452
I don't care if I die.

200
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,788
Because I'll die as a human.

201
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,334
Gosh. You shouldn't talk about death
in front of someone older than you.

202
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,588
Did you forget that I'm older?

203
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,922
Good for you.

204
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,426
How can you say that
to someone you've known for 50 years?

205
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,428
It's only 50 years.

206
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,180
That's short for me.

207
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,723
It's meaningless.

208
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,770
Just promise me you'll guard that well.

209
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,272
All right.

210
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,192
And don't forget
to text me before you die.

211
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,819
You need to pay for the deliveries.

212
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,571
You better not die before that.

213
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,156
Bye.

214
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,479
I'm sorry for sneaking in.

215
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,023
And for stabbing you.

216
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,108
Why did you sneak in here?

217
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,069
Is this what you do?

218
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,488
I wanted to see if you were okay.

219
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,572
I was worried.

220
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,616
But…

221
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,577
you're really fine.

222
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,288
You were stabbed.

223
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,667
What…

224
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,670
are you?

225
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,712
What do you mean?

226
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,840
Did being in the trunk
mess with your head?

227
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,051
Come on. You can't fool me.

228
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,512
I saw blood seeping out of your stomach.

229
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,015
Right. There's something else
that's mind-boggling.

230
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,393
Why do you have Choi Jae-yeong's car?

231
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,397
-I bought it from him.
-What?

232
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,733
He sold it while I was still in the trunk?

233
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,736
Gosh. I'm dumbfounded.

234
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:25,701
Nevertheless, you saved my life.
Thank you.

235
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,829
Yes. Let's say that was the case.

236
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,622
Leave.

237
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,749
Fine.

238
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,128
Let me get my stuff
and go downstairs. What?

239
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,257
My phone. Wait.

240
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,011
I think it's in that room.
Give me a second.

241
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,728
By the way…

242
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,734
do you live here by yourself?

243
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,696
Right. I've been curious.

244
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,657
What is this drawing
and what are all these photos?

245
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,327
They're kind of creepy.

246
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,208
What… What's wrong?

247
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,841
Leave. I'll let you off
the hook this time.

248
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,135
If you ever talk about me to others,

249
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,180
I'll find you and crush your limbs.

250
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,224
I won't.
I don't have any friends or family.

251
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,728
But I do have a favor to ask.

252
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,813
What is it?

253
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,697
The previous owner of that car
kills young kids who have no family.

254
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,491
And I'm sure he'll be after me.

255
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,327
I can't return to the orphanage
since he knows where it is.

256
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,580
So can you please
let me stay here for a few days?

257
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,667
I don't care. Sleep on the streets then.

258
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,922
Please, I beg you. I have nowhere to go.

259
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,132
You're invincible.
Getting stabbed was nothing.

260
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,094
What if I post things
on my social media about you?

261
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,180
Are you sure about this?
I'll post about everything that happened.

262
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,306
I will.

263
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,183
I'm serious.

264
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,129
What? Where are you going?

265
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,132
Untie me before you go.
What if he comes for me?

266
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,510
Don't worry. He's gone.

267
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,470
What? Why?

268
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,557
Sir!

269
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,396
What did you do to that monster?

270
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,523
Sir!

271
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,568
That bastard is a murderer!

272
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,237
He kills people!

273
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,899
It's Geuseunsae!

274
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,861
GEUSEUNSAE: A MONSTER THAT ATTACKS PEOPLE
WITH A NOOSE ON RAINY DAYS

275
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,510
Where have you been?

276
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,975
Hey, Dark Hole. When did you come?

277
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,981
I told you to stop calling me that.

278
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,401
Did you find her?

279
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,363
No, not yet.

280
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,209
You're lying. I can read you.

281
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,506
-I told you not to touch her.
-I didn't touch her.

282
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,967
Some guy interfered,
so I couldn't do anything.

283
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,719
-Some guy?
-Yes. He was terrifying.

284
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,721
He wanted me dead.
I don't think he was human.

285
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,891
Who would want you dead?

286
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,228
Don't be silly. You have me.

287
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,022
Look at me. Let's hurry and catch her.

288
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,816
You've practiced a lot, right?

289
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:12,195
Right. Ever since we saw
the twins 15 years ago.

290
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,269
Find her again.

291
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,979
We have to find her before he does.

292
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,484
MISSING CHILD
NAME: MIN SANG-UN

293
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,615
Si-ho, come eat.

294
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,705
Si-ho.

295
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,835
Come out and eat, will you?

296
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,590
Hey. You should at least eat.

297
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,884
I don't have an appetite.

298
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,927
How do you expect

299
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,096
a pregnant lady on the run to be hungry?

300
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,686
Come on. This is good news.

301
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,106
Hey, a new member has joined our family.

302
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,650
I can't wait to meet the baby.

303
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,530
Gosh, it's going to be so beautiful.

304
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,246
Are you smiling? Seriously?

305
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,624
Of course. Are we supposed
to cry about it?

306
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,586
Hey, I'm not smiling because I'm happy.

307
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,965
We need to smile if we want to be happy.

308
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,134
Stop that. You're so weird.

309
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,219
That was cheesy.

310
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,847
I didn't know what you should eat,
so I made seaweed soup.

311
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,768
If Mom and Sang-yeon were here,
they would have taken better care of you.

312
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,479
As if.

313
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:12,190
If they were here,
they would have given me an earful.

314
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,025
Gosh. That's right.

315
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,069
Come out and eat.

316
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,321
See you later.

317
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,948
Why are you leaving so soon?

318
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,869
Well, I need to stop by somewhere
before going to work.

319
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,790
I should put an end to everything
before you give birth.

320
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,459
Are you going to look for that sword?

321
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,628
Yes.

322
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:38,091
That sword is really hard to find.

323
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,845
Sang-yeon had said something,
but I can't remember.

324
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,640
Don't open the door for anyone.

325
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,185
-Make sure you eat. Bye.
-Sang-un.

326
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:51,896
Yes?

327
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,235
I'm sorry about yesterday.

328
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,112
I was harsh.

329
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,287
It's fine.

330
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,290
Bye.

331
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,719
Damn it. This is alcohol.

332
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,179
Yes, it is.

333
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,347
Drink some more.

334
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,473
Are you serious?

335
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,184
How could you drink
and sleep in my office?

336
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,687
Would you be a dear
and order some jjamppong for me?

337
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,483
Or at least tell me
who's looking for that woman.

338
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,444
Gosh. Why do you keep asking
for client information?

339
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,363
You know I can't do that.

340
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,740
And even I don't know.

341
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,077
His name, address…
I have no idea who he is.

342
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,917
About 15 years ago,

343
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,629
he came to me
and asked about that woman in the photo.

344
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,174
Wait. He didn't even tell you why?

345
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,052
He said she owed him something,
but that's about it.

346
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,720
I just need to get paid.

347
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,515
Gosh, what a money-grubber.

348
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,019
Then forget about his information.

349
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,648
Just give me his number.

350
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,903
You're just being ludicrous.

351
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,697
-This is important for me.
-What?

352
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,575
-Give me your phone. Where is it?
-What's with you?

353
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,536
Stop that! This is sexual harassment!

354
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,164
Come on!

355
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,500
Why are you looking for him?

356
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,419
Did your girlfriend cheat on you with him?

357
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,795
Is he an enemy of your family?

358
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,260
-You're right.
-What?

359
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,928
An enemy of my family.

360
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,474
Is this some action movie?
Don't be ridiculous and just go.

361
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,853
You asked me several times
why I quit being a detective.

362
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,733
It was because of that woman.

363
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,069
I got fired for violating orders

364
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,656
while investigating
her family's murder case.

365
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,745
Forget it.

366
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,122
Are you seriously lying to my face?

367
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,709
Darn it. Don't believe me
if you don't want to.

368
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,213
You wanted me to work here!

369
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,341
Will you?

370
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,802
As for your salary,

371
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:15,183
you'll be getting two-thirds
of your previous one.

372
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:19,062
Gosh, what a thug.

373
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,521
Darn it.

374
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,484
-Here!
-Give me his number!

375
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,444
Okay, I'll give it to you.

376
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,460
Damn, that's loud.

377
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,587
I need to pee so bad.

378
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,677
I'm free.

379
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,100
Please…

380
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,186
Damn it. Seriously?

381
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,656
Please…

382
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,664
Damn it, that's so loud.

383
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,750
What is that?

384
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,804
Hello?

385
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,930
Hello?

386
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,850
You're looking
for Min Sang-un, aren't you?

387
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,601
No.

388
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,271
You wanted us to look for her.

389
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,231
It was you, right?

390
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,942
-This isn't my phone.
-What?

391
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,904
The owner of this phone isn't home.

392
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,322
And how do you know him?

393
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,159
-Who are you?
-Wait.

394
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,745
Hold on. Why are you being rude?

395
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,041
-What?
-He's out. Call again next time.

396
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,084
Wait.

397
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,128
Goodness.

398
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,049
You said you're at his house, right?

399
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,885
Where is it again?

400
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,012
Why are you asking? Who are you?

401
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,891
I'll be honest.
I work at a detective agency.

402
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,394
The owner of that phone
made a request to us.

403
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,688
And who could you be?

404
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,940
I'll be honest.

405
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,234
I'll be temporarily…

406
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,820
No, I'll be living with him from now on.

407
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,782
Oh, I see.

408
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,745
Then may I know the address?

409
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,413
I need to deliver something,

410
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,415
but I forgot the address.

411
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,525
It looks like a haunted house.

412
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,786
You're…

413
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,663
a teenager?

414
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,001
Why are your hands bound?

415
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:33,047
Sir, can you please untie me? Hurry.

416
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,301
How do you know the owner of this house?

417
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,684
I just know him.
We're not exactly best friends.

418
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,311
But we shared our secrets.

419
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,438
That's how we are.

420
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,858
-Name?
-I'm Nam Do-yun.

421
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,235
Not yours. What's that guy's name?

422
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,737
-I don't know. Do you know?
-No. That's why I asked.

423
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,448
Darn it.

424
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,829
What? Hold on. I thought
you worked at a detective agency.

425
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,416
You came to deliver something,
but you don't know his name?

426
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,085
Don't tell me you lied.

427
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:15,214
Gosh, he'll kill me
if he finds out that I let you in.

428
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,592
Who are you?

429
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,887
You're too chatty for your own good.

430
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,153
It looks like her.

431
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,453
What? What are you doing?

432
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,039
You're making a mess.

433
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,290
Sir.

434
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,751
The guy who lives here is really powerful.

435
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,586
You'll be in huge trouble.

436
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,588
Sir!

437
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,798
Sir!

438
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,142
It is him.

439
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,228
He's the culprit.

440
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,322
4 GEOMEULMOK-RO, SANGYONG CITY

441
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,699
It can't be…

442
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,870
Sir, are you leaving?

443
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,081
Hold on.

444
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,583
Sir, can you untie me before you leave?

445
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,834
Please.

446
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,420
Hurry.

447
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,216
You saw the guy's face, right?

448
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,843
What? Yes, I did.

449
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,304
Why?

450
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,144
Who is it?

451
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,382
-You were with my sister last night.
-Don't be scared.

452
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,885
I'm not here to hurt you.

453
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,137
I came to catch that Monster.

454
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,207
Sir.

455
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,835
Just use the map application.

456
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,296
Or at least free my hands!

457
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,881
I'll do that once we find him.

458
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,508
Are you a thug?

459
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,969
You're dragging a tied-up teenager…
Watch out!

460
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,805
Darn it.

461
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,182
Darn it.

462
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,977
What does he want to do? Ruin my life?

463
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,106
What's with him?

464
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,900
Did he see a ghost
in broad daylight or something?

465
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,610
What? Sir.

466
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,410
It's him, isn't it?

467
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,169
Stop it.

468
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,171
Stop!

469
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,591
Stop.

470
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,264
Hold on!

471
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,730
Spare me!

472
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,041
Just like you did in your previous life,

473
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,126
you kill people when it rains, don't you?

474
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,842
On rainy days?

475
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,480
Monsters like you
shouldn't have reincarnated as humans.

476
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,385
When it rains…

477
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,514
Watch.

478
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,334
When it rains,

479
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,503
I get in a good mood.

480
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,214
When it rains,

481
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,717
I become stronger!

482
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,521
You're hanging!

483
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,492
I beat you! I won!

484
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:25,788
That man told me
that you'd come if I lured you here!

485
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,292
Her soul will be ours!

486
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,415
Did you say "ours"?

487
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,501
Are you colluding with someone?

488
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,170
Was he a Monster as well?

489
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,798
Dark Hole.

490
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,883
Dark Hole?

491
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,718
Who was it?

492
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,554
A young man with a dark hole.

493
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,432
He said he was after her soul.

494
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,060
Who is he?

495
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,687
Where is he right now?

496
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,690
She's ours. Ours!

497
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,112
Stop!

498
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:45,909
Let him go.

499
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,872
Are you going to kill him
in broad daylight?

500
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:56,420
You're the one who asked Mr. Gu
to find Min Sang-un.

501
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,505
And you're the one
who killed her family, aren't you?

502
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,802
Who the hell are you?

503
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,111
What?

504
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,655
Where did he go?

505
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:45,677
Be born as my real son in your next life.

506
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,015
I will protect you, my son.

507
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:04,112
You will cross paths one way or another.

508
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,825
Either as enemies or as friends.

509
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,338
You are destined to meet them again.

510
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,634
And they will be dragged
into your karma once more.

511
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,649
-Yes?
-Are you keeping an eye on her?

512
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:44,695
Where is she?

513
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,530
BAEKILHONG NURSING HOME

514
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:51,577
She just entered a nursing home.

515
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,161
Was there anyone suspicious?

516
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,956
I followed her all day,
but there was no one around her.

517
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,418
And this isn't my first rodeo…

518
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:00,877
What?

519
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:04,840
What do you want?

520
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,134
What is it?

521
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,227
Hello?

522
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,187
Hello?

523
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,398
Hello?

524
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,783
Hey, are you okay?

525
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,660
Yes.

526
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,705
How do you know that man?

527
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,373
Why were you fighting?

528
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,169
He's trying to kill that woman.

529
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,384
Is this the woman you're talking about?

530
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,307
Yes. I know where he is.
We need to stop him.

531
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,299
Grandma.

532
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,356
You need new names too.

533
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:50,404
Min Sang-un and Min Si-ho
don't exist anymore.

534
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,078
Don't go to school
and don't make any friends.

535
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,331
You must live in hiding. If you don't,

536
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,584
you'll end up like your sister…

537
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,095
About Bulgasal…

538
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,599
Why is it…

539
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,351
I told you to forget about it.

540
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:25,272
But my sister told me to find a way.

541
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,441
A way to kill it.

542
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,984
Don't mention it ever again.

543
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,652
Don't think about it either.

544
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:34,114
Just live in hiding,
and don't let it find you.

545
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,240
If you don't,

546
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,492
you'll also die.

547
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,079
Back then,

548
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,458
you didn't let me mention Bulgasal.

549
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,962
But now, I have to know.

550
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,924
Fifteen years ago…

551
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,303
when Sang-yeon brought me to your house,

552
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,682
you two had a talk. Do you remember?

553
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,977
I need to go back
and put an end to this karma.

554
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,480
This is my final chance.

555
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,107
I need to find the sword
that can kill Bulgasal.

556
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:13,320
Please tell me
what she was trying to do that day.

557
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,697
She said it was her final chance.

558
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,824
She had to find a sword
that could kill it.

559
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,294
I listened to you and lived in hiding.

560
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,381
But I can't do that any longer.

561
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,344
We'll be welcoming a new family member.

562
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:44,726
So please help us find a way
to break free from Bulgasal.

563
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,814
You know what she was planning
to do, don't you?

564
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,566
Grandma.

565
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:55,153
Why? Why did you do that, sister?

566
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,281
You shouldn't have run away like that!

567
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,742
It came after you left.

568
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,452
Our house was engulfed in flames.

569
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,455
Mom!

570
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:09,751
Our parents were trapped inside the house.

571
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:16,383
It was because you left us to look for it!

572
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,425
Grandma…

573
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,554
Why did you do that?

574
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,348
Why did you do that? Why?

575
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:30,397
Why? Our mom…

576
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:34,693
Our parents burned in the fire…

577
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:40,365
How could you leave us like that?

578
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,660
Grandma, it's okay. Grandma.

579
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,828
Ma'am!

580
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,914
She needs to calm down, so please leave.

581
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:07,183
Kill Bulgasal with Bulgasal.

582
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:15,233
Kill Bulgasal…

583
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,485
with Bulgasal.

584
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,325
Kill Bulgasal…

585
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,371
with Bulgasal.

586
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:34,044
SI-HO

587
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:41,134
Why haven't you been picking up?
I've been calling you.

588
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,802
Why? What's wrong?

589
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,514
-A strange man barged into our house.
-What?

590
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,184
And the same guy
from last night was there too.

591
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,310
-And--
-Are you okay?

592
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,394
Where are you?

593
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,481
I'm outside.

594
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:02,113
Sang-un, who is that guy from last night?

595
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,993
-What do you mean?
-I touched him…

596
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,541
and it felt weird.
It didn't feel like he was human.

597
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,544
He wasn't human?

598
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:22,008
Si-ho, go to a nearby motel.
I'll come to you right now.

599
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,218
Okay.

600
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,484
Hello, are you Ms. Kim Go-bun's guardian?

601
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,779
Yes. Whom am I speaking to?

602
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,531
You must not remember me.

603
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:48,118
I'm from the administration.
I wanted to talk about her insurance.

604
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,161
Can you spare me a minute?

605
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,706
I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.
I'll call you later.

606
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,791
Hold on.

607
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:58,253
Are you going to walk to the bus stop?
It's pretty far. I'll drop you off.

608
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,733
Where are you?

609
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:03,651
Ma'am?

610
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,290
I was going to give you a ride.
This area is dangerous!

611
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,405
You're really fast.

612
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,990
But it's over now.

613
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,498
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

614
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,416
I have to kill you.

615
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,545
Because of this.

616
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,313
Damn it.

617
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:06,941
So you're saying…

618
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,361
that he's after her soul?

619
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:15,241
Soul? Like Sam's soul in Ghost?

620
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,913
Yes. Everyone's after her soul.

621
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:25,627
Doesn't this guy seem very strange?

622
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,089
He does. I'm aware of that.

623
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:35,929
Sir, have you heard of Bulgasal before?

624
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,557
Bulgasal?

625
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,102
Yes. My friend told me… No.

626
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:47,690
Dark Hole told me

627
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:51,236
that the man is Bulgasal,
the immortal Monster.

628
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,246
You're the same guy…

629
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,457
who helped me last night, right?

630
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,795
It was you, right?

631
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,716
You were the one
who's been chasing me all along.

632
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,011
You're…

633
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,055
Bulgasal, aren't you?

634
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,936
Why are you trying to kill me?

635
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,647
You don't remember?

636
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,444
Was your twin sister the only one

637
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:16,154
who could remember?

638
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,032
About what you were…

639
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,869
and what you did to me in the past?

640
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:29,834
Tell me.

641
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,420
Why are you trying to kill me?

642
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,299
Why did you kill my family? Tell me!

643
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,517
I killed your family?

644
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:47,894
Yes.

645
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,396
It was you.

646
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,483
You killed my family.

647
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:57,195
You killed my family!

648
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,215
I'm at the well.

649
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,010
But she's still a kid.

650
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,596
Can you really do it?

651
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,226
It's a Monster disguised as a girl.

652
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,311
They're twins.

653
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,563
Which one is it? Both of them?

654
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,357
There's a way to find out.

655
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,109
Wait there.

656
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,568
By myself?

657
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,153
Until when?

658
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,406
Ghosts appear here at night.

659
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,032
I can feel one already.

660
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,826
-Bye.
-Sir. Hey.

661
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,786
Hey. Darn it. Did he hang up?

662
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,470
Sang-yeon!

663
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,375
I didn't kill your family.

664
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,002
I don't kill the innocent.

665
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,462
I'm different from you.

666
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,047
What are you talking about?

667
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,762
There was someone suspicious there.

668
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:49,682
He must have killed them.

669
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:54,604
He was probably a Monster
who had reincarnated as a human.

670
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,440
No.

671
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,359
It wasn't human.

672
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,737
It was far more powerful.

673
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,073
It was unbelievably strong.

674
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,576
It growled like a beast.

675
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,331
It was Bulgasal.

676
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,211
It was you!

677
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,391
I think we're here.

678
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:36,354
-Is this right?
-Yes, it is.

679
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:40,358
Thank you for taking me to her.

680
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,783
What are you doing?

681
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:53,746
Darn it.

682
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,293
Hey, kid.

683
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,213
Are you okay?

684
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,884
Wake up!

685
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,595
Wake up! Hey, kid!

686
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:54,056
That hurts. Stop slapping me.

687
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,441
That bastard…

688
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,527
Damn it.

689
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,893
Hey. Hey…

690
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:44,315
Hey! Stop that!

691
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,360
I told you to stop him.

692
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,278
You're useless.

693
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,782
What are you doing? Stop that!

694
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,391
Bulgasal…

695
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,746
If Bulgasal was the one
who killed your family,

696
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,874
does that mean I'm not the only Bulgasal?

697
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,669
Not the only Bulgasal?

698
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:53,384
Kill Bulgasal…

699
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:55,428
with Bulgasal.

700
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,899
Run. Hurry.

701
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,575
Run in the opposite direction.

702
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:20,221
Is this our first time meeting each other?

703
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,556
You recognize me, don't you?

704
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,142
Who are you?

705
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,645
Why did you appear out of nowhere?

706
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:29,313
Out of nowhere?

707
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:32,233
You're the one who appeared
out of nowhere 600 years ago.

708
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:35,569
I've been walking on this earth
for much longer than that.

709
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:39,323
And I'm the sole survivor of the Monster
annihilation during the Joseon era.

710
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,476
What is this? You're weak.

711
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,355
You don't drink human blood, do you?

712
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,440
Because you were human too?

713
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,564
Doesn't it hurt?

714
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,442
It's okay.

715
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,528
It's okay. I'm not trying to kill you.

716
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,698
You're just in the way
of getting rid of her soul.

717
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,160
Getting rid of her soul?

718
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:07,870
Yes.

719
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:18,881
Only Bulgasal can get rid
of a human's soul.

720
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,176
She won't reincarnate anymore.

721
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,261
This is the last time.

722
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:27,598
Her soul is mine.

723
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,351
She's indebted to me as well.

724
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,384
Are you okay?

725
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:50,222
I told you there was no way
you could run away from me.

726
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,976
You shouldn't have stolen a soul
and become human.

727
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,564
You should have been more careful.
Why did you do that?

728
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,401
I finally got you.

729
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,325
Our ill-fated bond

730
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:11,994
ends here.

731
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:36,226
Listen carefully. You have to live.

732
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:39,188
Live in hiding, and don't trust anyone.

733
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:43,150
And look for a way to kill Bulgasal.

734
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:52,785
How? How do I look for it?

735
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:56,413
You'll recognize it. It's…

736
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,665
Get out of my house!

737
01:12:58,749 --> 01:12:59,958
Get out!

738
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:12,304
Min Sang-un.

739
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,808
Focus. Don't forget what I said.
You have to remember it.

740
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:18,352
Find…

741
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:20,229
What?

742
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,857
Find the man with a scar
on his right hand.

743
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,777
He's the sword that can kill Bulgasal.

744
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,219
You're awake!

745
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,350
You really don't die.

746
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:02,813
Right, this. I can't take it out.
What should I do?

747
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:06,233
Okay.

748
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,817
Again?

749
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,785
What have you done?

750
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:01,747
Your sister!

751
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:05,709
What has she done?

752
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,386
If I can't crush your soul this time,

753
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,347
you might as well just die.

754
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:20,015
I'll crush it

755
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,893
the next time you are reincarnated.

756
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,883
We'll meet again.

757
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,301
Wake up.

758
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:39,928
Wake up.

759
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,352
I finally found you,
the one who killed my family.

760
01:16:48,478 --> 01:16:50,397
I need to take my revenge.

761
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:54,026
I don't want to search for you anymore.

762
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:58,697
I don't want to wait for you any longer.

763
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,492
So wake up.

764
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:08,999
Don't die.

765
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,643
It was…

766
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,270
you.

767
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,565
My sister…

768
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,319
told me to find you.

769
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:42,240
The man with a scar on his right hand.

770
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:44,660
She said…

771
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:52,834
you were the sword
that could kill Bulgasal.

772
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:10,811
Please help me.

773
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:17,359
Help me.

774
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,362
You want me to help you?

775
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:21,882
You're Bulgasal on the outside,
but you're still human on the inside?

776
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:24,009
Are you like Wolverine?
Do you have healing powers?

777
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,302
Where is the woman?

778
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:26,303
I don't know.

779
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:28,889
Tell me why you locked me up
and why I can't call my sister.

780
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:29,931
You'll never see her again.

781
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,558
Who are you?

782
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:34,311
Min Sang-un?

783
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:35,979
This is her curse.

784
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:37,689
For a thousand years…

785
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,150
What are you really trying to do?

786
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:42,194
You and I are not enemies.

787
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,029
Our real enemy is that woman.

788
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:51,828
