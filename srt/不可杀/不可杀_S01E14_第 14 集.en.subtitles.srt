1
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,789
Stop!

2
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,373
What are you doing?

3
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,292
Stop it.

4
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,795
You said you don't kill people

5
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,464
even after you became Bulgasal.

6
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,174
I don't care about that now.

7
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,093
I'll kill them all.

8
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,888
Anyone who hurts my family
or gets in my way.

9
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,891
I'm going to kill them all.

10
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,535
I want to show you the true colors
of the man who protects you.

11
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,712
Where are the other two?

12
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,758
The man who works here took them.

13
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,729
Snap out of it! Please!

14
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,025
You can't become like Ok Eul-tae.

15
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,778
Look at me.

16
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,532
Are you…

17
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,535
the Dan Hwal that I know?

18
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,454
The one who wanted to remain human?

19
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,467
Let go. You'll get hurt.

20
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,448
EPISODE 14

21
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,826
Si-ho, are you okay?

22
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:23,995
Yes.

23
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,663
I'm okay.

24
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,591
Where do you think he's taking us?

25
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,179
What do you think he'll do with us?

26
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,903
The three of you have to live.

27
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,947
You…

28
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,449
Do-yun,

29
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,203
and the baby you're carrying.

30
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,376
I don't know where he's taking us.

31
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,963
But when we get there, he'll probably…

32
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:28,101
So we need to run away
before we get there.

33
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,271
We need to let people know.

34
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,940
We still have a shot.

35
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,943
If there's an opportunity,

36
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,320
we have to do something.

37
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,677
How's your arm? Is it broken?

38
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,180
I don't think so.

39
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,183
But I think it might be fractured.

40
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,560
You should go to a hospital.

41
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,855
Don't worry about me.
We should find them first.

42
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,231
We're running out of time.

43
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,904
Hwal is looking into
the man who took Si-ho and Do-yun.

44
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,366
That man…

45
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,660
His face…

46
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,704
He looked familiar.

47
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,554
I can't find his name.

48
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,390
There's nothing here. Who the hell is he?

49
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,060
I told you. I don't know either!

50
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,650
And yet, you let some stranger take them?

51
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,487
That's because

52
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,947
I thought they'd be fine.

53
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,948
Hwal.

54
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,162
Detective Kwon has something
to tell you about that man.

55
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,214
Detective Kwon.

56
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,760
You know something about that man?

57
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,679
Before he left,

58
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,933
he said he would wait
for Sang-un to find him.

59
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:18,604
But he looked familiar
when I first saw him.

60
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,106
So I'm wondering…

61
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,576
Captain Ham, where are you?

62
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,994
You haven't been picking up.

63
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,329
I have a favor to ask.

64
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,582
Can you look into a cold case for me?

65
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,542
What? Which one?

66
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,003
The disappearances at Mount Cheongsol.

67
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,546
It's an old case. It's urgent.

68
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,300
The suspect was Gong Min-su.

69
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,510
He was 21 years old at the time.

70
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,430
He lived with his mother
at Gadu-myeon near Mount Cheongsol.

71
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,224
A total of five residents
and hikers went missing.

72
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,728
A witness had seen him luring
the missing people,

73
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,271
and it became a murder case.

74
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,482
But during the investigation,

75
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,234
the suspect went missing.

76
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,362
Can you send me his photo? Hurry.

77
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,072
WANTED FOR SERIAL MURDER

78
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,953
GONG MIN-SU, 21 YEARS OLD, MALE

79
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:16,996
It's him.

80
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,876
Ok Eul-tae must have
hidden him here since then.

81
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,462
That's how he was able
to avoid getting caught.

82
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,140
There's no one around here.

83
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,234
Does your stomach hurt?

84
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,819
The place where Ok Eul-tae stabbed you?

85
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,071
That man hit me

86
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,823
in the same spot.

87
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,785
The pain is getting worse.

88
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,622
Excuse me. Can you pull up for a minute?

89
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,707
His stomach hurts a lot.

90
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,378
He's in a lot of pain!

91
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,964
We're almost there.

92
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,383
It'll be over soon.

93
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,678
It'll be over?

94
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,809
He wants us to find him.

95
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,852
He lived here for the past 20 years.

96
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,314
The only place he knows
must be his former house.

97
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,942
We have to hurry.

98
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,110
Wait.

99
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,904
What about this place?

100
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,616
-What about Ms. Lee?
-I'll stay with her.

101
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,954
You two should go. I'll report this.

102
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,163
Don't.

103
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,959
The police will only get in the way.

104
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,006
We're just going
to leave her lying on this cold floor?

105
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,719
She's already dead.

106
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,805
We should find the others first.

107
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,770
You're coming with me.

108
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,568
You should go too.

109
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,071
Find them first.
Then we can think of what to do next.

110
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,103
My tractor has been unstable all day.

111
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,314
And it's finally broken down.

112
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,316
Do-yun, this is our chance.

113
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,238
Gosh, it's blocking the way.
But it just won't budge.

114
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,740
I called for help,

115
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,910
-but they already got off work.
-Do-yun, your back.

116
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,623
What?

117
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,472
You need superhuman strength to move that.

118
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,599
Do-yun, cut this.

119
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,950
Goodness.

120
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,996
I'm afraid you'll have to make a U-turn
all the way to the intersection.

121
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,874
But where are you going?

122
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,711
This is a very rural area,
so only residents take this road.

123
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,380
I'm just visiting someone.

124
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,589
I see.

125
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,842
Wait.

126
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,971
Aren't you the son
of the family that came from Ulsan?

127
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,431
No.

128
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,641
It is you.

129
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,478
I can tell by your height and your face.

130
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,772
Back then, the police…

131
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,234
Do-yun!

132
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,446
Do-yun, are you okay?

133
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,742
-Si-ho, you should go first.
-I'm not leaving you behind.

134
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,205
Just until there.

135
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,957
No, you can do it. Let's go.

136
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,448
How do we get out of here?

137
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,493
He took our phones.

138
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,372
Hwal will come.

139
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,251
Sang-un too. Just like they did before.

140
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,211
I didn't think they would, but they came.

141
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,256
They will come. I'm sure of it.

142
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,690
Si-ho, what should we do?

143
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,451
Mother. Where are we going?

144
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,412
I am scared!

145
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,664
Your father will come and save us.

146
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,628
Turn around and run now.

147
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,130
Run and find your father.

148
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,757
Hurry!

149
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,342
Father!

150
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,804
-Si-ho.
-Father!

151
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,724
-Father!
-Si-ho.

152
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,726
Father!

153
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,186
-Si-ho.
-Yes?

154
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,897
What's wrong?

155
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,399
I saw something strange.

156
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,159
Let's get out of here.

157
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,497
Let's run in opposite directions.

158
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,333
That'll confuse him.

159
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,542
What do you mean?

160
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,544
You're in too much pain to run.

161
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,254
I'm okay now.

162
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,520
Run that way.

163
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,647
Be careful.

164
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,575
I'm over here!

165
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,826
Over here!

166
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,880
I'm the only one you need, right?

167
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,590
You're waiting for my sister.

168
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,884
Then just take me.

169
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,762
He'll only get in the way.

170
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,373
Turn around!

171
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,458
And run!

172
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,185
Find Hwal and Sang-un!

173
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,064
No…

174
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,171
No!

175
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,010
No…

176
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,565
Hwal.

177
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,276
Si-ho…

178
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,280
Si-ho was taken by him.

179
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,424
It's you.

180
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,219
Ok Eul-tae was right.

181
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,973
He said you'd come looking for me.

182
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,102
He said you'd make my life
more interesting.

183
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,737
What did you do to my sister?

184
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,741
She's still alive.
I just hit her head and knocked her out.

185
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,619
Were you the one who killed Ms. Lee?

186
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,997
Who's that?

187
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,166
The woman back at the warehouse!

188
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,376
Oh, her?

189
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,128
Ok Eul-tae bit her in the neck.

190
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,422
It was going to be a slow death,

191
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,175
so I did her a favor.

192
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:41,597
Both you and Ok Eul-tae want me.

193
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,056
You could have only killed me!

194
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,767
Why did you have to harm the others?

195
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,330
Fine.

196
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,041
I'll only kill you.

197
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,514
You.

198
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,934
You must be Yeongno.

199
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,894
YEONGNO: A MONSTER THAT ATE 100 NOBLEMEN

200
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:32,773
You are the reincarnation
of the monster that killed 100 people.

201
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,081
What are you talking about?

202
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,094
You're strange.

203
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,471
You're not human.

204
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,017
I can tell.

205
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,561
You're like Ok Eul-tae.

206
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,230
Am I wrong?

207
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,107
You're different from him.

208
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,610
What exactly are you?

209
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,863
Hwal!

210
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,246
That's enough. It's over.

211
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,170
Please stop.

212
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,178
Where is Dan Sol?

213
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,139
Dan Sol?

214
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,349
Who is that?

215
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,478
Your sister.

216
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,151
Si-ho. Wake up.

217
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,614
Si-ho.

218
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,491
Si-ho.

219
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,791
What about Do-yun?

220
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,714
He's fine.

221
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,134
Did you hear that?

222
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,803
Yes.

223
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,561
What about Ms. Lee?

224
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,918
Hello?

225
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,170
We found them. They're both safe.

226
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,341
Okay.

227
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,552
I'll take care of things here.

228
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,806
How is he? Is he okay?

229
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,183
Yes. We called 911.

230
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,568
You better not talk
about what happened today.

231
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,695
Let's pretend like it never happened.

232
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,447
If you dare to utter anything about it,

233
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,992
I'll make sure you pay with your lives.

234
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,417
Is this the police?

235
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,005
Someone has died.

236
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,481
You sacrificed yourself
to protect them, didn't you?

237
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,483
I know.

238
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,405
You did well.

239
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,286
I hope you rest in peace.

240
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,458
Rest peacefully.

241
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,692
Where are we going?

242
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,445
Are we going back to that farm?

243
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,696
No.

244
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,866
The police will have arrived there by now.

245
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,451
What about Ms. Lee?

246
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,079
I want to say goodbye to her.

247
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,372
Where are we?

248
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:41,831
Are we there yet?

249
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,792
We're almost there.

250
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,559
Wait here.

251
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,270
And lock the doors.

252
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,041
Since we saved Si-ho and Do-yun,

253
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,127
I'll untie that detective.

254
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,089
No, not yet. Wait here.

255
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,935
Don't shout. I'll remove the tape.

256
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,072
Why? Why are you doing this to me?

257
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,991
Why have you tied me up here?

258
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,160
How long have you been working
for Ok Eul-tae?

259
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,038
I've never worked for him.
I saw him for the first time today.

260
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,457
And you still kidnapped them
like he wanted?

261
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,667
I didn't know what was going on.

262
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,794
I came here without knowing.

263
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,880
Someone died because of you.

264
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,007
You took three innocent people

265
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,343
and handed them over
to Ok Eul-tae and a murderer.

266
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,430
-That was--
-Her sister almost died because of you.

267
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,767
Damn it.

268
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,395
How do you know Ok Eul-tae?

269
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,940
I don't even know him,

270
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,360
but he told Detective Seo
to bring me with him.

271
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,487
That's what I heard.

272
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,364
He wanted to drag me into this.

273
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,283
Is that so? Then Ok Eul-tae
will come looking for you again.

274
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,369
Why?

275
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,209
If he comes looking for you,
call me at the number on that phone.

276
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,378
Don't tell him that we met.

277
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,546
Okay.

278
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,632
Okay.

279
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,759
Don't do anything foolish.

280
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,012
You have a wife
and a six-year-old daughter.

281
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,391
-What?
-I saw you at the police station before.

282
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,893
I did a background check just in case.

283
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,812
I'll go now. Thanks.

284
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,733
I knew something like this would happen.

285
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,987
We've had an ill-fated relationship
since 600 years ago.

286
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,949
Monsters must be killed.
Behead it and put it in the well.

287
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,244
An ill-fated relationship
will go on forever.

288
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,288
And the past will repeat itself.

289
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,127
What the hell are you talking about?

290
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,254
You are bound to harm my family and me.

291
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,589
But I won't let that happen this time.

292
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,908
What did you guys talk about?

293
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,244
I said I'd kill his family.

294
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,415
You threatened to hurt his family?

295
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,669
I'll do anything I can to get Ok Eul-tae.

296
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:20,425
You do know that's
what Ok Eul-tae says all the time, right?

297
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:24,012
He threatened to kill my family
if he couldn't break my soul.

298
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,182
That's why I'm doing this.
I won't stand back anymore.

299
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,226
Then what makes you
any different from him?

300
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,438
I don't care if we're the same.

301
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,738
An evil spirit…

302
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:30,161
will come from the dark hole.

303
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,164
The evil spirit…

304
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,961
opened the dark hole.

305
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,838
And now,

306
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:44,259
it is coming to close it.

307
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,485
I will take your soul for now.

308
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,571
I cannot die yet.

309
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,922
I will be born human in my next life.

310
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,759
I will have a scar on my hand.

311
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,723
Find me and turn me into Bulgasal.

312
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:36,936
If you don't,
that soulless dark hole will never close.

313
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,523
And you will be in agony every single day.

314
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,568
Keep your promise.

315
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,770
Careful.

316
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,819
Do-yun, are you okay?

317
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,946
Look at me, will you?

318
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,114
I'm okay.

319
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,792
What about you? Is your stomach okay?

320
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,169
Yes. I'm all right.

321
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,879
When Detective Kwon returns,

322
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,007
I'll ask him
to take you guys to the hospital.

323
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,050
When is he coming?

324
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,469
-Is he still at the police station?
-Yes.

325
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,224
He needs to take care of Ms. Lee.

326
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,604
But this is all real, right?

327
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,398
This isn't a dream, right?

328
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,902
Everything was fine until this morning.

329
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,488
Hwal and Ms. Lee got into an argument.

330
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,741
And I told them to reconcile.

331
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,784
Normally…

332
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,412
we would have had breakfast.

333
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:03,416
Then Ms. Lee would nag me about cleaning.

334
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,963
And I'd complain to her.

335
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,259
Why did this happen?

336
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,428
Why?

337
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,983
Have some.

338
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,485
Okay.

339
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,697
How's Hwal? Is he okay?

340
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:39,368
I don't know. I think he's very upset
about what happened.

341
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,580
That's why he's been acting out

342
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,373
and saying things he doesn't mean.

343
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,667
I understand.

344
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,669
Ms. Lee…

345
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,465
was probably his only family.

346
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,677
I'll stay with Do-yun.

347
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,806
I can't be alone,
and I'm concerned about him.

348
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,474
You should go to Hwal.

349
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,476
Okay.

350
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,240
We didn't even have breakfast

351
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,077
because the police barged in.

352
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,746
I should have stopped her.

353
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,208
When the police wanted
to take Do-yun and me,

354
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,254
she insisted on coming with us.

355
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,050
She was worried about sending us alone.

356
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,678
But she didn't have to.

357
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,974
Si-ho.

358
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,060
But you know what?

359
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,439
When she said she'd come with us,
I felt so relieved.

360
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,153
I've always relied on others.

361
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,072
I've relied on you all my life.

362
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:03,828
Had I told her she didn't have to come,

363
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,413
she'd still be alive

364
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,292
and here with us right now.

365
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,711
It's all my fault.

366
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,410
Hey.

367
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,370
How are your eyes?

368
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,664
They're okay.

369
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,334
You should go inside and rest.

370
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,877
I'll stay outside instead.

371
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,961
That's okay.

372
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,881
I want Ok Eul-tae and his men to know

373
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,967
that I'm fine.

374
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,762
Then I'll stay with you.

375
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,604
Did Ms. Lee have any family?

376
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,232
We should let them know.

377
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,775
She had none.

378
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,946
How about her close friends?

379
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,157
-We should hold a funeral.
-The police took her.

380
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,284
They'll be investigating.

381
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,495
Let it be.

382
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,039
We have no time to worry about the dead.

383
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,582
We have no time?

384
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,420
We're talking about Ms. Lee here.

385
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,005
That's not important right now.

386
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,007
Then what is?

387
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,842
Do you really not know?

388
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,678
Catching Ok Eul-tae?

389
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,429
Yes. That's important.

390
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,807
But a family member just passed away.

391
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,016
She wasn't my family.

392
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,103
What we had was only
an ill-fated relationship.

393
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:56,399
She was a shaman who told villagers
to kill me 600 years ago.

394
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,861
I just kept her close
to keep an eye on her

395
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,989
in case she turned into an enemy again.

396
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,533
-I had no choice but to keep her near.
-Don't lie.

397
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,704
You're just saying that because you're mad
and can't accept her death.

398
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,580
But don't say things you'll regret.

399
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,458
It'll also hurt you.

400
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,294
I won't regret it.

401
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,546
Everyone dies.

402
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,799
If you live for a long time,
you get used to seeing people die.

403
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,510
I'm completely fine.

404
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,388
Do you really mean that?

405
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,692
Leave.

406
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,445
Take Si-ho and Do-yun. Leave this place.

407
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,488
I'm going to stay here
and kill Ok Eul-tae.

408
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,073
I told you over and over again

409
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,159
that I wasn't going
to run away without you.

410
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,869
I'm not telling you to run away.

411
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,579
I want you to stop hindering me.

412
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,333
To be honest,
none of you are helpful to me.

413
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,834
You're only a burden.

414
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,086
I'll make sure we don't get in the way.

415
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,839
And this is all
because of Ok Eul-tae and me--

416
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,341
That's not true.

417
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,844
You asked me about
what he said that shook me.

418
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:11,599
A thousand years ago,
I asked him to turn me into Bulgasal.

419
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,435
What are you talking about?

420
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,147
It's not a coincidence you attacked me
and took my soul 600 years ago.

421
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,067
I was also the reason
why my family was killed.

422
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,569
What are you saying?

423
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,613
I wanted to become Bulgasal.

424
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,074
Ok Eul-tae and I were
on the same side 1,000 years ago.

425
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,284
He and I are the same.

426
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,037
So there's no need to stay with me.

427
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,331
Take the others and leave right now.

428
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,541
But what about you?

429
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,670
-You can't even see.
-That's exactly why.

430
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,590
I can barely defend myself in this state…

431
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,843
let alone all of you.

432
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,513
You were all just a nuisance.

433
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,598
Si-ho, Do-yun,

434
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,142
Detective Kwon, Hye-seok, and you too.

435
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,770
Protecting you all has worn me out.

436
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:04,110
I can't be bothered anymore.
I'm exhausted.

437
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,405
I need to confront Ok Eul-tae
as soon as possible.

438
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,908
I need to put an end to all of this.

439
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,119
To everything.

440
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:56,412
DETECTIVE KWON HO-YEOL

441
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,251
-Hello?
-It's me.

442
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,836
Where are you?

443
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,213
I just left the police station.

444
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,214
SANGYONG POLICE STATION

445
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,675
I lied about everything.

446
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,553
Like you said,
the police shouldn't get involved

447
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,763
if we want to get Ok Eul-tae.

448
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,016
And regarding Hye-seok--

449
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,477
Thank you. You should go home and rest.

450
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,979
I won't be able to rest.

451
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,815
I'll have to drink myself to sleep.

452
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,234
How are Si-ho and Do-yun?

453
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,861
I'll go to your house right now.

454
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,905
No. You don't have to come here.

455
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,283
-What?
-You should stop coming here too.

456
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,618
What are you talking about?

457
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,371
Hello? Hey, Hwal!

458
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,558
DETECTIVE HAM

459
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,358
Hello?

460
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,570
Ho-yeol, where are you right now?

461
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,115
You bastard. Why did you call me?
How brazen of you.

462
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,283
Help me.

463
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,287
Things have gotten complicated.

464
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,666
-I don't know what to do.
-What's wrong?

465
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,459
Where are you right now?

466
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:11,922
Detective Ham?

467
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,437
You…

468
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,731
We need to talk.

469
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,941
-Why are you--
-What happened to your arm?

470
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,943
Are you okay? Is it bad?

471
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,778
Where is Detective Ham?

472
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,656
Why do you have his phone?

473
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,659
-Did you--
-Don't be silly.

474
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,745
I don't kill people for no reason.

475
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,205
Then why did you kidnap
those innocent kids

476
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,458
and kill Hye-seok?

477
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,168
Because I had to.

478
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,670
In order to provoke Hwal.

479
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,049
You crazy bastard.

480
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:55,966
How is Hwal?

481
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,260
Has he shown his true colors yet?

482
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,270
-We're both going to die tonight.
-Your father, Kwon Seung-in…

483
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,940
Why are you bringing him up?

484
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,734
I looked into him.

485
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,195
Your father was one remarkable man.

486
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:21,283
He poisoned and killed dozens
of his fellow factory workers.

487
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,619
He abused his wife and his two kids.

488
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,455
His wife couldn't take it anymore
and ran away.

489
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,668
Gosh, no human could possibly do that.

490
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,589
Your father wasn't really human.

491
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,176
Sometimes, those who aren't human
reincarnate as one.

492
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,552
I'm sure you know this.

493
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,514
You probably saw Monsters
while spending time with Hwal.

494
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,185
My father…

495
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,690
was a Monster?

496
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,732
Yes.

497
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,568
And you know who hunts them down
and kills them, right?

498
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,518
Have you seen this woman before?

499
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:33,063
-Was she one of your victims?
-I've never seen her before!

500
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,525
Who the hell is she?
Why are you chasing me?

501
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,193
Because you kill people.

502
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,781
You poisoned your neighbors
and even your wife to death.

503
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:48,287
They talked too much.

504
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,539
They were too noisy!

505
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:55,794
So I poisoned them.

506
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,506
That's when they shut their mouths

507
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,968
and became quiet.

508
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,805
There's another reason why
I'm chasing you.

509
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,893
It's because you're the reincarnation
of a Monster who killed people.

510
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,942
Bulgasal is here. Bulgasal is…

511
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,074
Wake up.

512
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,534
Please wake up.

513
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:48,305
I'm not the one
who killed your father and your sister.

514
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,557
It was Hwal…

515
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:54,186
the man that's been
by your side all this time.

516
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,285
Not only did he kill your father,

517
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,872
but he also left your sister to die.
Do you know why?

518
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,587
Because he couldn't care less
about people dying.

519
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:26,760
The only thing he cares about
is his family from his past life.

520
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,473
But even that's not true.

521
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:36,937
He's just been obsessed with family
ever since his father left him as a boy.

522
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,273
He doesn't have any human emotions.

523
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,985
All he ever wanted was revenge.

524
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,405
A thousand years ago…

525
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,366
and even now.

526
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,323
What is it?

527
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,492
Look.

528
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,079
I told him to come here as you wanted.

529
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,665
So as you promised,

530
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,336
he's not going to be harmed, right?

531
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,088
Why are you worried?
Do you owe him or something?

532
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,715
No, it's just…

533
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,802
He helped me a lot when I was a rookie.

534
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,096
I won't hurt him.

535
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,351
Eventually, he'll be on my side.

536
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,812
Hwal will be abandoned

537
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:04,274
by everyone he cherished.

538
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,109
Just like he was in the past.

539
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,365
Everything will go back
to its rightful place.

540
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,670
No one's tailing us, right?

541
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:28,256
I've been checking
and there's no one behind us.

542
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,096
Lighten up. We had no choice.

543
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:37,724
We said we would contact him
after we go somewhere safe.

544
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,686
But it's still strange.

545
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,979
He didn't even see us off.

546
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,943
Sang-un. You're sure
he'll join us later, right?

547
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,114
Sang-un?

548
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,157
To be honest,

549
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,910
it's just us.

550
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,122
He doesn't know where we're going.

551
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,040
-What?
-Why not?

552
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:05,419
Because your safety is more important
than getting rid of Ok Eul-tae.

553
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,797
We can't let what happened
to Ms. Lee happen again.

554
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,759
I understand,
but he should still come with us.

555
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,553
I don't know anymore.

556
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,179
Don't know what?

557
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,683
I don't know who Hwal is anymore.

558
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,976
What do you mean?

559
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:25,522
A thousand years ago,
I asked him to turn me into Bulgasal.

560
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,776
I wanted to become Bulgasal.

561
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,779
Ok Eul-tae and I were
on the same side 1,000 years ago.

562
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,327
I'm used to being alone.

563
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,330
As a little boy
and after turning into Bulgasal,

564
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,707
I've always been alone.

565
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,959
So this is rather uncomfortable.

566
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,628
Because of us?
What's making you uncomfortable?

567
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,215
I'll have to get used
to being alone again.

568
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:57,220
As time goes by, I may end up alone again.

569
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,099
And that would be difficult.

570
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,743
Hey.

571
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,454
Did you just come home?

572
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:08,333
Goodness. What were you doing all day?

573
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,169
Why are you here?

574
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,923
What do you mean? It's delivery day.

575
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:18,969
Gosh. Can you please
clean your fridge? It's filthy.

576
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,680
Clean the floor too.
Gosh, look at all this dust.

577
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,057
You're nagging me even after you've died?

578
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,226
You didn't go to the afterlife?

579
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,228
Or…

580
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,773
is this just a memory?

581
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,130
Hwal.

582
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,767
I left home.

583
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:13,023
You see, my cheating husband
who ran off came back

584
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,358
and told me to leave instead.

585
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,698
So would it be okay
if I stay here for a few days?

586
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,577
This is the only place that I can call…

587
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,914
my home.

588
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,170
What's wrong? Can't I stay?

589
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,798
Gosh, you're so coldhearted.

590
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,345
I'd rather leave than stay here
with someone so petty.

591
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,894
But…

592
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,105
can't you at least comfort me?

593
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,318
Even when I had a miscarriage…

594
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,371
You're so…

595
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,187
Uncle Hwal.

596
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,330
I quit my job.

597
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,666
The boss at the factory is so annoying.

598
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,377
He looks down on me for being an orphan.

599
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:03,341
So I was wondering if you would hire me
as a live-in housekeeper.

600
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,305
But then again,
I know you don't want to live with me.

601
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:14,853
I don't want to work anymore.
Should I just get married

602
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,022
and have a big family?

603
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,744
Why did you come here?

604
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,212
I don't want to live at the orphanage.

605
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:26,841
The other kids tease me for being weird…

606
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,846
since I don't remember
anything from before.

607
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,226
And they said

608
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,979
that you're actually my dad

609
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,108
and that you abandoned me there.

610
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,196
So I was wondering…

611
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:54,160
if I could just live with you.

612
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,580
That again? You always talk
about wanting to live with me.

613
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,833
Aren't you even scared that I'm Bulgasal?

614
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,710
You're the only person

615
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,755
who treats me nicely

616
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,508
as if we're family.

617
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,678
I've never treated you like family,

618
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,263
so why do you say that?

619
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,475
You wanted me dead 600 years ago.

620
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:22,480
So why? Why do you keep coming to me?

621
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,352
Hwal!

622
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,232
What are you doing?

623
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,818
Why did you come back here?

624
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,695
I came back for you.

625
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:15,825
I don't think
I can just leave without you.

626
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,078
But what are you doing right now?

627
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,246
Do you want to die?

628
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,458
I can't kill myself
even if I wanted to, so just let go.

629
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,794
I feel suffocated. That's all.

630
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,508
My chest feels tight.

631
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,219
I have to do this to ease the pain.

632
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,513
Stop!

633
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,265
Why in the world are you doing this?

634
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,152
She wanted to live with me…

635
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,156
but I never let her.

636
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,368
I was afraid that she would grow on me.

637
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,496
I was angry about what she did
to me 600 years ago,

638
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:05,208
so I never comforted her even once
when she was in pain.

639
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,459
When in fact…

640
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,672
she was like a daughter to me.

641
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,008
My daughter died.

642
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:22,100
I never wanted to go through
the pain of losing my family ever again.

643
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,103
But because I wanted to become Bulgasal,

644
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,647
my family keeps
paying the price with their deaths.

645
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,526
I'm in perpetual agony.

646
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,946
I can't die even if I want to.

647
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:38,658
And I can't cry even if I want to.

648
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,505
It's okay. I'll help you.

649
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:56,634
I'll help you put an end to this agony.

650
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,850
I'll help you protect

651
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,603
your family.

652
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,356
And I'll protect you as well.

653
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,775
I'm going to keep you safe
from Ok Eul-tae.

654
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:18,531
I don't care that you wanted
to become Bulgasal in the past.

655
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,994
It doesn't matter if you and Ok Eul-tae
were on the same side before.

656
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,920
I hate seeing you in pain right now,

657
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,465
so I'll be by your side.

658
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,052
I'll protect you.

659
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,971
So come with me.

660
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,866
If I think back on it now…

661
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,911
I'm the one to blame.

662
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:50,581
Goodness.

663
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,543
Everything you said until now was true.

664
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:58,464
I guess people who cross paths once
continue to meet each other.

665
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,925
One, two, three!

666
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,346
We're here to end things where they began.

667
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,185
You and Ok Eul-tae…

668
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,273
looked like friends rather than enemies.

669
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,401
Sang-un has started
to regain her memories.

670
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,530
She told me that she saw you
saving me in your past life.

671
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,073
No!

672
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:28,119
Everything you did was for me…

673
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,332
I'm sorry.

674
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:38,212
