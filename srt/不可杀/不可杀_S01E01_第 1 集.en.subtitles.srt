1
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,031
On this land 600 years ago,

2
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,077
there lived beings that were not human.

3
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,122
They were Monsters.

4
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,168
There were countless
human-eating Monsters.

5
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,714
But now,

6
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,884
all the Monsters have disappeared.

7
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,598
Except for me.

8
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,855
I am the last to survive of the Monsters.

9
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,443
I cannot be killed
and cannot die as I am Bulgasal.

10
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,160
To put an end
to this curse of immortality,

11
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,914
I have been searching
for you for 600 years.

12
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,835
If I had not met you

13
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,463
on that day from 600 years ago…

14
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,563
EPISODE 1

15
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:50,396
LATE GORYEO

16
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,856
I think we should go back.

17
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,858
Where could we go when there is a famine?

18
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,278
The Japanese pirates raided our land
and burnt it down. We cannot go back.

19
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,740
They already reached mountain villages.
What is the army doing?

20
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,494
What we should really
be worrying about is the Monsters.

21
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,412
Those Monsters are everywhere.

22
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,248
Japanese pirates and Monsters.

23
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,416
Goryeo is doomed. Utterly doomed.

24
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,459
Have you heard?

25
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,671
They say the corpse-eating Monster,
Jomagu, is on this uphill path!

26
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,881
Enough. Are you trying
to make me pee my pants?

27
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,510
Where is it?

28
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,056
What was that?

29
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,892
-What was that sound?
-What…

30
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,727
-Come on.
-Oh, dear.

31
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,980
-Hey!
-What on earth is that?

32
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,782
-That is…
-Oh, no.

33
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,703
-Where are you going?
-What do we do?

34
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,664
-Go and do something!
-Oh, no.

35
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,001
-Gosh. What is that?
-Dear!

36
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,628
-My dear!
-Be quiet.

37
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,171
You will get us all killed.

38
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,888
Jomagu.

39
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,694
Jomagu.

40
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,914
Take this baby…

41
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,336
Take this baby…

42
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,256
Take this baby…

43
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,433
-What was that?
-Dear!

44
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,727
Dear!

45
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,604
What are you doing?

46
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,647
He could have eaten you alive!

47
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:02,070
This baby is cursed.

48
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,405
It must not be born.

49
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,741
Bulgasal will come find our baby.

50
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,243
No. That's not true!

51
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,787
Please snap out of it!

52
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,164
-Bulgasal is coming after us.
-My dear.

53
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,626
Bulgasal is coming.

54
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,003
-Bulgasal…
-Oh, no.

55
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,923
-Come to your senses!
-Bulgasal is coming.

56
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,814
Dear!

57
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,442
Dear!

58
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,864
Dear!

59
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,299
-Oh, no.
-She hanged herself when she was pregnant?

60
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,384
-She hanged herself?
-How could that happen?

61
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,553
-Goodness.
-Why did she do it?

62
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,556
Are you all right?

63
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,737
The baby was born from the dead mother?

64
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,532
Yes. But it does not cry.

65
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,951
It does not cry.

66
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,704
It should never have been born.

67
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,665
It should have died with the mother.

68
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,376
Why would you say such a thing?

69
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,756
Bulgasal has cursed the baby.

70
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,799
-What? Bulgasal?
-The baby is cursed?

71
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,052
It has no soul, so it cannot be killed.

72
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,304
-Bulgasal, an evil spirit.
-What is she saying?

73
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,766
And Bulgasal has a grudge
against your baby from a previous life.

74
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,310
Then what should we do now?

75
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,312
What in the world is Bulgasal?

76
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:45,650
Once it has a grudge against someone,
it will chase their soul to the end.

77
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,485
-Goodness.
-What is this?

78
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,156
Then what will happen to us?

79
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,242
This means we are doomed!

80
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,536
Damn it!

81
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:03,834
10 YEARS LATER

82
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,316
Wait up.

83
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,697
-Gosh.
-Why did it snow so much?

84
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,743
Why did you want
to hunt on a day like this?

85
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,579
-I had nothing to eat.
-My goodness.

86
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,831
Damn it.

87
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,967
That cursed boy.
Talk about having bad luck today.

88
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,302
Come on.

89
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,015
Wait up for me.

90
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,433
Hurry up.

91
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,904
Damn it.

92
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,115
We have been living here
for ten years now.

93
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,658
But we are still in famine,

94
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,328
and my wife is pregnant again.

95
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,872
I thought you had no energy
to even farm without food.

96
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,125
Hey, farming and lovemaking
require a different kind of energy.

97
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,376
-Gosh.
-Oh, my.

98
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,212
Forget it.
How would a bachelor know anything?

99
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,341
Then help me find a nice lady
I can settle down with!

100
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,468
Gu-bong.

101
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,597
No one wants to marry you because of
your ugly face. What can I do?

102
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,057
You are so mean.

103
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,393
Oh, no. My stomach has been feeling
a bit funny for a while now.

104
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,854
Stay here for a bit.

105
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,148
Pal-bong. Why so suddenly?

106
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,028
My goodness.
I thought he did not eat anything.

107
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,989
Goodness.

108
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,586
Why are you taking so long, Pal-bong?

109
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,463
Pal-bong.

110
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,092
Pal-bong?

111
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,681
Pal-bong. Pal-bong?

112
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,378
Pal-bong, where are you?

113
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,297
Where on earth are you? Come on.

114
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,386
Pal-bong.

115
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,307
Pal-bong! Pal-bong…

116
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,919
-Pal-bong!
-Father.

117
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,090
How could this happen?

118
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,969
Gu-bong, did you see it?

119
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,555
Did you see what did this to him?

120
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:55,274
Listen. Four people from our village
either disappeared or died just this year.

121
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,444
Seeing how his intestines are intact,

122
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,488
a mountain animal did not do this.

123
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,364
Neither did Jomagu or Mokgwang.

124
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,825
All the blood in his body is gone.

125
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,245
Then are you saying that thing killed him?
That thing was in the forest?

126
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,830
What else, if not Bulgasal?

127
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,332
-Bulgasal?
-Bulgasal?

128
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,958
-Really?
-Oh, no.

129
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,002
-Damn it.
-Should we leave then?

130
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,670
What do we do?

131
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,673
That boy…

132
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,053
That cursed boy with no name.

133
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,436
You called it here, didn't you?

134
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,165
Hey, stop right there!

135
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,044
I told you to stop!

136
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:07,364
The villagers said
that you were cursed by Bulgasal.

137
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,659
Even your own father ran away out of fear!

138
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,790
Did Bulgasal really come
to this mountain to find you?

139
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,255
Is that a "no"? Or do you not know?

140
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,052
It is your fault!

141
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,638
My father is dead because of you!

142
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:37,371
The villagers said
that you were cursed by Bulgasal.

143
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:50,050
Did Bulgasal really come
to this mountain to find you?

144
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,502
What is it, Yeon-ji?

145
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:11,757
I think something is over there.

146
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,736
-Gil-deok…
-What happened?

147
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,020
Lady!

148
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,818
-Goodness.
-Yeon-ji…

149
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,035
Pal-bong's wife and kids

150
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,621
are all dead.

151
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,207
-Oh, no!
-Yeon-ji is dead too?

152
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,625
-Goodness.
-This is awful.

153
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,879
Oh, no. What do we do?

154
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,138
It is here.

155
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,767
It has come…

156
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,022
all the way to this village.

157
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,316
It even went inside their house!

158
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,069
It is looking for the boy
that has crossed it in his previous life.

159
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,239
Are you sure Bulgasal did this to them?

160
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,243
Yes. Until Bulgasal finds the boy,

161
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,331
it will come knocking
on your doors every night.

162
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,377
Now…

163
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:18,175
everyone in this village will die!

164
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,219
-Oh, no!
-What do we do?

165
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,767
Hey, Gu-bong. Where are you going?

166
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,022
That is…

167
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,735
We must kill that boy.

168
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,530
Kill him?

169
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,158
-We will kill him!
-Yes!

170
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,717
Damn it. Where is he hiding?

171
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,427
Where is that rat?

172
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,514
-We should have killed him ages ago!
-Where is he?

173
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,601
There he is! He is running away!

174
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,395
-He is getting away!
-Hey!

175
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,896
-Stop!
-Get him!

176
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,857
Stop right there!

177
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,195
-I said stop!
-Get him!

178
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,598
-Be careful.
-Come here!

179
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,519
Hey! Come here!

180
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,980
-Get him!
-You go after him!

181
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,606
He is getting away!

182
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,191
We have to kill him!

183
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,074
-What is that noise?
-Go get him!

184
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,453
-Damn it.
-The ice…

185
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,445
That cursed boy.

186
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,407
Hey.

187
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,703
Take this and leave.
Stay away from the village for now.

188
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,288
Something terrible has happened!

189
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,290
I thought you were mute. Are you deaf too?

190
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,876
Did you see anything? Answer me!

191
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,461
Why are you helping that bastard?

192
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,922
He has been cursed by Bulgasal!

193
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,477
What choice do I have? His father
left him with me for a bottle of liquor.

194
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,873
-Over there!
-Hey.

195
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,791
-Get him!
-Get him!

196
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,853
Move aside!

197
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,775
We must protect our families
from Bulgasal.

198
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,694
-Yes!
-You have to die in order for us to live!

199
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,404
No…

200
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,620
No!

201
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,542
What? This bastard can speak!

202
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,087
No!

203
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,756
No…

204
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,307
Come on. Let us end this.

205
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,683
-Right.
-Kill him.

206
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,977
-We must kill him.
-Come here!

207
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,789
Halt.

208
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,016
Mind your own business. Just go.

209
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,353
We are taking care
of our own matters so just go!

210
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,730
You are speaking
to General Dan Geuk of Goryeo.

211
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,106
Show him your respect.

212
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,578
A group of men is trying
to slaughter a child.

213
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,000
Japanese pirates raid our lands,

214
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,503
and Monsters attack our people.

215
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,964
Those with power are interested
in only filling their own stomachs.

216
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,426
But why are commoners like you
committing such a vile act?

217
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,346
What is the reason for this?

218
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,434
It is because
he has been cursed by Bulgasal.

219
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,898
As Bulgasal has a grudge against him,
it has come down to our village

220
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,985
and harmed our villagers in search of him.

221
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,865
Even his own father abandoned him
out of fear, but we took him in.

222
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,784
So this is our burden to carry.

223
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,620
Please turn a blind eye to it.

224
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,216
Killing a boy because of some Monster

225
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,927
is nonsense to me
and I shall not believe it.

226
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:45,056
I want to behead all of you right now.

227
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,767
But I have seen

228
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,812
too much blood on the battlefield today.

229
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,819
What is your name?

230
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,654
I do not…

231
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,743
have a name.

232
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,494
Is that so?

233
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,749
Then from this moment on,

234
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,793
your name shall be Hwal.

235
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,004
Hwal.

236
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,964
It means rebirth.

237
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,269
I will take the boy with me.

238
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,617
You will regret this.

239
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:32,163
You will also get sucked
into his bad karma.

240
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,167
Anyone who stays
by his side will throw up blood

241
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,878
and dirt will get in their eyes.

242
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,964
Not even you

243
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,802
can avoid the curse of Bulgasal, General.

244
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:53,601
The curse of Bulgasal
will not end until the boy dies.

245
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,942
Let's go.

246
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,530
But…

247
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:14,372
The curse of Bulgasal
will not end until the boy dies.

248
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:27,218
17 YEARS LATER, EARLY JOSEON

249
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,286
Leave it. I can pour it myself.

250
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,836
You spent your entire life
hunting Monsters for our kingdom

251
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,589
and even sacrificed
your arm for the cause.

252
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,967
It is time to leave the battlefield
and hold a position in an office now.

253
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,095
I am not cut out for a position like that.

254
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,349
The thought of working
in an office gives me the chills.

255
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:19,187
I am sure you have many soldiers
you can rely on and entrust this task to.

256
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:24,859
There is only one person
that I can entrust this task with.

257
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,781
It is my adopted son.

258
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,784
I taught him everything he knows
ever since he was a boy.

259
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:36,287
But his military arts and bravery
have already surpassed mine.

260
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,830
I heard about him.

261
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,415
People said Bulgasal cursed him,

262
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,669
but now, he is considered
to have been blessed by Bulgasal.

263
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,171
Teoreokson, the water Monster
of Yongsan River,

264
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,632
and Gapsangoe, the Monster
of Mount Gap that killed many people,

265
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,217
all died at the hands of my son.

266
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,680
Those Monsters must fear him
as much as they fear Bulgasal.

267
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,307
And my soldiers call him

268
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,935
the evil spirit who kills Monsters.

269
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,983
I would like to end

270
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,778
this Monster hunt together with my son.

271
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,088
I do not see any activity
in the forest, General.

272
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,967
Over there.

273
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,886
I can feel evil energy from there.

274
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,556
It will show itself soon.

275
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,185
It is the last Monster
in the kingdom of Joseon.

276
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,731
This long battle will finally end today.

277
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,862
I support that, General.

278
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:54,574
Monsters have always revealed
themselves in times of hardship.

279
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,327
Now that we are welcoming
the new era of Joseon,

280
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,165
the Monsters must vanish with Goryeo
as they are both remnants of the past.

281
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,545
Please fulfill your duty of hunting down
the Monsters until there are none left.

282
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,856
Hey.

283
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,400
What is that?

284
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,986
What the…

285
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,356
What are you doing?

286
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,434
Over here! The Dueoksini is here!

287
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,602
Halt!

288
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,813
We are your fellow soldiers! Stop!

289
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,983
It is Dueoksini!

290
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,110
It can rule over your thoughts!

291
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,195
Do not let it deceive you!

292
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,716
It hurts.

293
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,426
It hurts.

294
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,223
It hurts!

295
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,978
It hurts.

296
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,939
It hurts!

297
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,902
It hurts!

298
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,738
The Dueoksini has revealed its true form!

299
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,939
You will pay for this.

300
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,985
I will remember your soul
and I will get my revenge.

301
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,096
He killed Dueoksini!

302
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,099
The Commander has killed Dueoksini!

303
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:16,020
- Hwal!
- Hwal!

304
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:20,858
- Hwal!
- Hwal!

305
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,384
They should be buried in their hometown.
Must it be here?

306
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,262
It is the law to burn anyone
who was murdered by the Monsters.

307
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,515
But the Monster did not kill them.

308
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,810
We did.

309
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,563
We wielded our swords
against our comrades and killed them.

310
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,399
We are no different from the Monsters.

311
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,151
No.

312
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,862
He is the real Monster.

313
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,740
Look at him.

314
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,701
The deaths of these soldiers
do not bother him at all.

315
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,662
He only cares about killing the Monsters.

316
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,038
He was born to kill.

317
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,499
But if it were not for him,
we would have all died.

318
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,251
He is of lowly birth!

319
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,962
He has been cursed by an evil spirit.

320
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,009
How could people
of high status like us be under him?

321
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,304
I cannot accept this.

322
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,663
What are you doing here alone?

323
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,499
It is nothing.

324
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,926
No, this wound is serious.

325
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,055
Blessed by Bulgasal? How ridiculous.

326
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,184
Your life is hanging by a thread.
Be careful.

327
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,896
This is pathetic.
Why are you doing this alone?

328
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,564
Your subordinates can help you.

329
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,483
I prefer to do it alone.

330
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,444
They are scared of me
like they are of Monsters.

331
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,201
You must learn to get along with others.

332
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,578
You need people on your side to succeed.

333
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,206
I have never been interested in success.

334
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,582
There you go again.

335
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,669
That is not something
I ought to hear from my only son.

336
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:50,341
I will be done
once we get rid of all the Monsters.

337
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,013
What is on your mind?

338
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:04,480
I heard Monsters get their revenge
once they hold a grudge against you.

339
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,650
Then are you worried that all the Monsters

340
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,945
you killed in this life
will take revenge in your next life?

341
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,285
I wish…

342
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,707
not to be born again.

343
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,503
If that scares you

344
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:32,258
be born as my real son in your next life.

345
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,095
I will protect you, my son.

346
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,561
You saved this old man's life.

347
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,355
Had you not saved me then,

348
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,776
I would have been eaten
by Teoreokson and come out as its feces.

349
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:58,367
Anyway, we ought to indulge ourselves
with some smiles today.

350
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,578
The last Monster on this land is gone now.

351
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,291
Not yet.

352
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,544
There is one Monster left.

353
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,714
Are you talking about Bulgasal?

354
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,801
People say

355
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:19,555
Bulgasal sucks human blood
and destroys souls.

356
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:23,559
But as it has no soul,
it cannot be killed.

357
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,103
However…

358
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,105
it does not exist.

359
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:32,192
Their fear of Monsters created a Monster
that is far scarier than the rest.

360
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,571
No one has seen it in person.

361
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,697
That is because…

362
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,119
anyone who sees Bulgasal

363
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,748
meets their fate.

364
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,336
The curse of Bulgasal

365
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:55,215
will not end until the boy dies.

366
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,177
Hwal.

367
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,599
Bulgasal does not exist.

368
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,477
We are done hunting Monsters as of today.

369
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,647
You must let go
of your past with Bulgasal.

370
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,817
All right?

371
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,622
General, we have received
an urgent message from your home.

372
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,892
My lady.

373
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,493
The baby came out prematurely.

374
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,495
She has been like this for half a month.

375
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,969
No. Give it back. That is my baby…

376
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,057
It is your fault.

377
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:32,354
My baby did not cry because of your curse.

378
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,027
-She is not to leave her room.
-Yes, my lord.

379
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,072
Father.

380
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,033
Give back my baby. Father!

381
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,118
My baby.

382
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,327
Father!

383
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,371
Father!

384
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,459
-Father!
-I apologize

385
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,336
for my daughter.

386
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,213
Let me…

387
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,718
My baby!

388
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:04,887
Let me take the baby.

389
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,235
Father.

390
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,071
The baby…

391
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,950
The baby is dead, right?

392
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,537
I did not hear the baby cry…

393
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,082
so I figured so.

394
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,341
Father.

395
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,929
Let me touch the baby before you bury her.

396
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,015
Let me say goodbye

397
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,519
to my sister.

398
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:05,966
Father.

399
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,809
It is your fault.

400
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:18,478
My baby did not cry because of your curse.

401
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:22,608
Anyone who stays
by his side will throw up blood

402
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:25,402
and dirt will get in their eyes.

403
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,994
The curse of Bulgasal.

404
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,414
Father.

405
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,587
Father…

406
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:48,884
Father!

407
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,387
Father!

408
00:48:56,308 --> 00:49:00,604
Once it has a grudge against someone,
it will chase their soul to the end.

409
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,888
What are you doing?

410
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,640
You will only hurt yourself.

411
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,017
You are not well. This is dangerous.

412
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,647
I am saving my children from your curse.

413
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,816
My children are ill because of you

414
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,776
and you killed one at birth.

415
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,319
You killed her.

416
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,574
Had it not been for my father,

417
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,494
I would not have married
a man who has been cursed by Bulgasal.

418
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,792
What are you doing?

419
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,503
"The curse of Bulgasal."

420
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,297
I heard that all my life.

421
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,092
It was the first thing I learned to say.

422
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,970
I heard it when I was abandoned…

423
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,850
and when the villagers
showed hatred against me.

424
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,147
I wished I had never been born.

425
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:29,359
I always wanted to die.

426
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,364
Then you should have.

427
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,118
Why did you drag
my children into your curse?

428
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,661
Why did you marry me?

429
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,164
You do not even have any feelings.

430
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,332
Was it because my father made you?

431
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,170
Because you and I are the same.

432
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,552
You are a monster just like me.

433
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,722
A monster…

434
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,277
Father!

435
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,039
You know it too.

436
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,749
Everyone in the Capital

437
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:29,419
and even the servants in our home
consider you different and fear you.

438
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,177
Give me your hand.

439
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,972
You do not need that.

440
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,519
It is all right.

441
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,381
What are you doing?

442
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,427
You see things others cannot see
and things you should not see.

443
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,722
All right. What do you see now?

444
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,212
I saw the woman who saved you.

445
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,424
The woman you keep remembering.

446
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:01,094
Let go of me.

447
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,682
We are both cursed.

448
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,351
However, I will break my own curse.

449
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,271
I will go after Bulgasal.

450
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,981
I will end this curse.

451
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,527
You will die before that happens.

452
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,113
Do as you please.

453
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,288
I will take A-chan with me.

454
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,458
Only then can I break
the curse of Bulgasal.

455
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,215
Never.

456
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,051
Do you want our son to die too?

457
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:44,220
He will not die. I will protect him.

458
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,312
A-chan is carrying my curse.

459
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,399
I will free him from it no matter what.

460
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,708
The soldiers are here. Hey!

461
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,001
The soldiers are here.

462
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,712
Goodness. What is going on? Oh, no.

463
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,924
What do we do? Oh, no.

464
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,520
What brings you here?

465
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:38,066
Bulgasal came here for him.

466
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:40,193
He is going to get us all killed!

467
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,862
-We must kill him to save ourselves.
-Kill him.

468
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,906
-Kill him.
-Die!

469
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,954
Why is that boy tied up?

470
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,600
He is not from here.

471
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,478
He tried to steal our food.
So we beat him and tied him up.

472
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:19,691
He seems to be a violent barbarian.
You saw him, did you not?

473
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:20,817
-Yes.
-Of course.

474
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,943
What did the boy say?

475
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,363
They captured him when he was passing by.

476
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,365
They were going to offer him to a Monster.

477
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,827
So you were going
to make a human sacrifice to a Monster?

478
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,914
If we do not offer human sacrifices,
Bulgasal will be enraged.

479
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,043
And Bulgasal will kill all of us!

480
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,004
So is it true that
you kill people for Bulgasal

481
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,590
and worship that Monster?

482
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:47,552
No one helped us because we are
slash-and-burn farmers, living in hiding!

483
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,345
We were trying to save ourselves!

484
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,514
Please just go on your way!

485
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:55,143
-Go!
-Go!

486
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:59,189
-Go!
-Leave!

487
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,116
It is him!

488
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,119
He is the one.

489
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:18,083
He will bring Bulgasal here.

490
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,587
Bulgasal will kill

491
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,965
everyone here.

492
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:30,220
Everyone's blood,

493
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:35,975
flesh, and organs
will be spread all over the ground.

494
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,940
That man will bring Bulgasal here

495
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:45,068
and get all of us killed.

496
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,569
-No!
-What?

497
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,864
-That man…
-We are all going to die.

498
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,658
Oh, no.

499
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,578
I am here to kill Bulgasal.

500
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,039
Anyone who stands in my way

501
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,542
-No.
-will be beheaded on the spot.

502
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,462
-We will hunt for it in the mountains.
-No.

503
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,589
-No.
-No. He cannot.

504
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,800
-Who told you to do that?
-You cannot do that!

505
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,684
No, you cannot!

506
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:20,854
-Stop them!
-No! We will all die!

507
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,481
-No!
-We must stop them.

508
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,191
You will get all of us killed!

509
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,819
Do you think Bulgasal will let us live?

510
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,780
He should have never been born.

511
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,368
He should have died then.

512
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,715
Commander.

513
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,384
Are you sure that monster is here?

514
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,887
Yes.

515
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,807
It is only a rumor
that those peasants believe.

516
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,559
Bulgasal never existed--

517
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,936
I know because
I used to be one of those peasants.

518
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:04,606
It is here.

519
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,258
Ambush!

520
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:58,701
If you anger Bulgasal, all of us will die!

521
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,748
Do not kill him. He is a mere villager.

522
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,167
They are armed
and refused to follow orders.

523
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,628
Look over there. You cannot stop them now.

524
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:04,160
You did not die that day.

525
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,205
You did not age either.

526
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:12,669
You are…

527
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,178
You are Bulgasal.

528
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,162
-Halt!
-That way!

529
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,880
Are you all right?
You suddenly stood in the way.

530
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,173
Who was that?

531
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,221
We are descending
the mountain immediately!

532
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:54,854
It is all right.

533
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,191
It is fine.

534
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,820
I am sorry about my eyes.

535
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,822
Stop saying that.

536
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:05,907
Mother.

537
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:11,370
Father does not like me
because of my eyes, right?

538
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,457
He hates me, right?

539
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,543
He has never

540
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,464
let me stay by his side.

541
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,843
I have never held Father's hand.

542
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:30,932
And I have never touched his face.

543
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,227
I do not know

544
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,771
how he looks

545
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,398
when I can picture

546
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,443
your face so well.

547
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:54,080
It is because of my eyes.

548
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,417
No.

549
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,420
It is not your fault.

550
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,354
I will free our son from the curse.

551
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,148
You will free A-chan from the curse?

552
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:26,279
When you have never embraced him?
Not even once in his life?

553
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,907
You hate him. You fear him.

554
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:31,993
He…

555
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:37,290
He reminded me of my curse.

556
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,042
You do not deserve to be his father.

557
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,503
The last thing I do

558
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,756
will be what a father ought to do.

559
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,426
The curse of Bulgasal.

560
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,388
I will settle Bulgasal's grudge.

561
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:55,975
Then the curse will be broken.

562
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,811
You will settle Bulgasal's grudge?

563
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,273
And it will kill me for sure.

564
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,359
If I can free A-chan from the curse,

565
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,279
I will accept my death time after time.

566
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,335
Where are you, Bulgasal?

567
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:24,837
Show yourself.

568
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,721
Why did you save me?

569
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,266
Bulgasal.

570
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,939
What is it that you really want from me?

571
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,243
What's wrong?

572
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,038
I feel dizzy.

573
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,374
What?

574
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,378
Come on.

575
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,506
How could you be so frail?

576
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,287
Bulgasal…

577
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:16,323
It is sucking human blood.

578
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,076
Listen up.

579
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,370
We will attack it together.

580
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,407
Mother, what is going on outside?

581
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,745
A beast…

582
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:04,747
I can hear a beast.

583
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,920
That way! The Monster is there!

584
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,095
Help me!

585
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:16,360
Mother. Where are we going?

586
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:18,362
I am scared!

587
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,743
Your father will come and save us.
Wait just a little bit, my child.

588
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:50,269
Mother.

589
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,984
Turn around and run now.

590
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:58,819
Run and find your father.

591
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:01,697
Hurry!

592
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,075
Mother.

593
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:20,507
Father!

594
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:22,384
Father!

595
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,345
Father!

596
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:29,516
Father!

597
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,393
Father!

598
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:32,853
Father!

599
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,992
Father!

600
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:48,869
Father!

601
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,163
Father!

602
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,123
Father!

603
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:34,206
A-chan.

604
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,876
Father…

605
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,215
Yes, my son.

606
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,426
What about Mother?

607
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,322
She is all right.

608
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:08,782
I am glad to hear that.

609
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,744
Father.

610
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:14,955
I…

611
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,542
do not know

612
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,921
your face.

613
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,842
-Your face…
-Stop talking.

614
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,303
Your face…

615
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,098
Your face…

616
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,478
Father…

617
01:12:57,414 --> 01:12:59,124
My son.

618
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,461
No.

619
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,215
No…

620
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,055
No.

621
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,102
No…

622
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:20,896
No…

623
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,203
No.

624
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:38,997
No…

625
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,085
Father.

626
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:50,843
Father.

627
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,140
Father.

628
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:04,940
A-chan.

629
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,453
I should have held

630
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:20,080
my son's hand.

631
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,265
I should have embraced him.

632
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:31,211
GOKOK: SOUL

633
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:58,382
I will be born again
with this scar that you have given me.

634
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,843
Is it true that you have become Bulgasal?

635
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,470
Please kill me.

636
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:05,764
What has happened to that woman?

637
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:11,687
She will reincarnate as a human.

638
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:15,941
Hide in here. Hurry.

639
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,068
-No.
-We have no time.

640
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,529
No matter how many times
you are reincarnated,

641
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:22,989
I will make sure
to find you and get my revenge.

642
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:27,828
