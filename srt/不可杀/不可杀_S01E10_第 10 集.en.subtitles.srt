EPISODE 10

2
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,758
Are you here for Chairman Ok?

3
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,178
He's not home right now,

4
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,679
but I know where he is.

5
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,473
Do you want to get in?

6
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,603
He was born blind?

7
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,981
Are you sure? Is that really what he said?

8
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,152
Yes. That's what Do-yun told me.

9
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,412
What is it? What's wrong?

10
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,040
Do-yun…

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,377
was A-chan.

12
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,881
Because of my curse,

13
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,383
my son was born blind.

14
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,928
And my second child was a stillbirth.

15
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,399
The number you are calling
is currently switched off…

16
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,945
I know you're here to see Chairman Ok.

17
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,155
I'll drive you there.

18
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,073
That's okay.

19
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,076
I'll wait here until he comes back.

20
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,829
And I shouldn't hop into a stranger's car.

21
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,125
But I'm not a stranger.

22
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,753
All I know is
that you're Eul-tae's secretary.

23
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,423
But…

24
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,675
you look unwell.

25
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,970
You should go see a doctor.

26
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,769
Don't you want to know…

27
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,899
where your brother is?

28
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,902
My brother?

29
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,529
Yes. Should I take you to him?

30
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,078
Is he not picking up?

31
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,331
-It's turned off.
-The number you are calling…

32
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,292
What did he say during your last call?

33
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,921
He said he was going to check
if his brother had really died.

34
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,215
He went to meet Ok Eul-tae.

35
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,843
You're going to his place?

36
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,887
Will you be okay?

37
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,096
I'll be fine.

38
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,807
But more importantly,
it's dangerous if you two stay here.

39
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,142
Ok Eul-tae could come for you.

40
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,320
Detective Kwon, didn't you say
you knew Ok Eul-tae's address?

41
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,113
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

42
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,491
Do-yun must have gone there
after I kicked him out.

43
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,077
Was that kid really…

44
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,829
Ok Eul-tae's minion?

45
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,123
I need to bring him back.

46
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,917
Okay.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,835
Make sure you do that

48
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,546
and give him an earful once he returns.

49
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,131
I've already given him enough.

50
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,967
Please send me the address.

51
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,010
I'll text it to you.

52
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,542
INCOMING CALL

53
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,631
-Hello?
-It's me.

54
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,925
Ok Eul-tae.

55
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,303
Why did you call me?

56
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,430
I was wondering where you were right now.

57
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,557
I'm on my way to your place.

58
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,474
Why?

59
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,435
Because of Do-yun.

60
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,479
Oh, I heard.
He said he told you the truth.

61
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,772
Is he there?

62
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,151
I'm not sure. I'm not at home right now.

63
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,904
So you're not at home too, right? Okay.

64
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,621
Who are you?

65
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,622
Hello.

66
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,957
I'm friends with the landlord.

67
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,793
What? His friend?

68
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,629
But he's not home at the moment.

69
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,755
Is that so?

70
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,054
That's fine.
I'm here to see Min Sang-un, not Hwal.

71
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,435
I guess you know who I am

72
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,771
without my having to tell you.

73
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,440
Is your sister home?

74
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,236
No, she's not.

75
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,737
Is that so?

76
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,014
Are you really here alone?

77
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,059
Yes.

78
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,812
Then where is your sister?

79
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,568
She left with Hwal.

80
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,612
That can't be.
Hwal is on his way to my house.

81
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,365
Why would he bring her there?
That's just ridiculous.

82
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,624
Where is she?

83
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,043
Have you been lied to all your life?

84
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,797
Hwal and Sang-un
stick together wherever they go.

85
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,507
He never leaves her behind.

86
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,092
Is that so?

87
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,097
That's really touching.

88
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,018
You're all so determined
to protect Min Sang-un.

89
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,187
Both Hwal and you.

90
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:04,317
When you have no idea
what she's done to you in your past life.

91
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,862
What? What do you--

92
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,123
Don't be scared.

93
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,084
I won't hurt you for Hwal's sake.

94
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,088
What a tenacious relationship.

95
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,384
Your relationship with those two.

96
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,681
Can I look upstairs?

97
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,350
You will even if I say no.

98
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,768
You're smart.

99
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,237
What's that for?

100
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,698
Ok Eul-tae could come looking for you.

101
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,159
If he barges into the house,

102
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,619
you should hide here.

103
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,876
But I can't stay in a space
that's small and dark like this.

104
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,461
Why not?

105
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,714
I'd feel suffocated.

106
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,218
Fifteen years ago,

107
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,889
the day my mom and my sister died,

108
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,144
I hid in a closet by myself.

109
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,064
It was small and dark.

110
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,531
I'll go inside with you.

111
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,227
I don't think I can do it.

112
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,618
Close your eyes.

113
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,996
Imagine this isn't a closet

114
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,331
or a small, enclosed space.

115
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,058
How do you feel?

116
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,936
You seem to be doing better.

117
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,856
I think I'm okay now.

118
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,419
What? He's back already.

119
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,688
Hwal, my sister…

120
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,614
What are you doing here?

121
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,950
Hey, I was taking a tour of the house.

122
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,204
I never said you could enter my house.

123
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,166
After all we've been through,
that's hurtful to hear.

124
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,253
By the way, I'm surprised
by how rundown your house is.

125
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,879
What is this?

126
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,967
I can't believe you're living together
in this dilapidated house.

127
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,720
Is that why
you didn't take off your shoes?

128
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,306
Do you know no manners
since you're not human?

129
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,809
You're right.
Should I remove them right now? I will.

130
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,893
Don't bother.

131
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,145
Keep them on and come outside. Let's talk.

132
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,730
Let's just talk here.

133
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,068
I'd like to chat with Ms. Min Si-ho too.

134
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,405
I doubt she'd want to talk with you.

135
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,824
She hates Monsters like you.

136
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,951
What? You're one to talk.

137
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,037
You're right. She hates me too.

138
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,081
So how about we give her some space?

139
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,168
It's been a while since we had
a lovely chat together. Come out.

140
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,591
"Lovely"? What's gotten into him?

141
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,925
Sounds good.

142
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,516
We're taking the car?

143
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,310
Where are we going?

144
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,896
Why won't you tell me?

145
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,162
-Si-ho.
-Hey, are you okay?

146
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,956
Yes. Thankfully, he didn't see me.

147
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,958
What about you? Are you okay?

148
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,752
You shouldn't worry about me.

149
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,838
I was so terrified that he'd find you.

150
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,257
Thank goodness Hwal returned on time.

151
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,302
Why did that bastard,
Ok Eul-tae, come here?

152
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,180
What an asshole.

153
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,516
I'm sorry, Si-ho.

154
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,353
Why are you sorry?

155
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,984
I can't do this anymore.

156
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,862
I don't think I can stay here any longer.

157
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,490
What do you mean?

158
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,326
I can't put you in danger like this.

159
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,827
I said I was okay.

160
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,080
No. I'm not okay with it.

161
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,130
I'm excited.

162
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,842
Do you want to listen to some music?

163
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:13,389
Since you haven't been talking,
I've been chatting away the whole time.

164
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,099
I thought you wanted a lovely chat.

165
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,395
Where are we? Where are we headed?

166
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,231
Hold on.
We're too far away from your place.

167
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,524
This is enough.

168
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,526
How did you know where I lived?

169
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,029
I told you already
that I knew many things about you.

170
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,240
By the way, where is Min Sang-un?

171
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,035
She's not at my place. She moved.

172
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,247
Moved? Where to?

173
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,415
Why do you care?

174
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,002
Because I want to take her away from you.

175
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,880
She keeps confusing you
by saying I killed your family.

176
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,134
She won't stop with the nonsense.

177
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,012
I told you I'd find out the truth myself

178
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,390
and that I'd come to you once I did.

179
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,434
So you shouldn't have come here.

180
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,104
How dare you barge into my house
without my permission

181
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,732
where my people live?

182
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,988
What are you doing?

183
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,699
I said I wanted
to have a lovely chat with you.

184
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,534
What?

185
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,842
Wait. That really hurts.

186
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:18,097
Did I upset you that much
by barging into your house? Did I?

187
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,390
Come on. Gosh, hold on.

188
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,143
This is enough. This is useless. It's…

189
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,646
It's not like we can kill each other.

190
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,524
We're just wasting our blood.

191
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,235
Why did you drag Do-yun into this?

192
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,363
Why did you send him to spy on me?

193
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:38,492
Isn't it obvious?
I needed to know if you were capable

194
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,204
of helping me break Min Sang-un's soul.

195
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,497
Why him of all people?

196
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,250
Did you send him to me knowing who he was?

197
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,545
What are you talking about?

198
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,505
So you didn't know?

199
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,389
Why?

200
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,475
Is he someone special to you?

201
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,688
Come to think of it,

202
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,400
your son was born blind 600 years ago.

203
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,319
It was because of Bulgasal's curse, right?

204
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,198
I did find it interesting
that Do-yun was born blind too.

205
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,950
So he was your son?

206
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,499
Or maybe you recognized him
since he died by your hands 600 years ago.

207
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,378
This is exactly why
I want to take Sang-un away from you.

208
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,422
She's a bad influence.

209
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,176
I helped you reunite with your son,
and yet you still suspect me.

210
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,136
Where is Do-yun?

211
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,762
Why does that matter right now?

212
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,390
Do you think I hurt him or something?

213
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,976
I can't reach him
ever since he left to see you.

214
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,228
-So answer me!
-Tell me where Sang-un is!

215
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,690
If you don't,
what happened today will occur again.

216
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,443
My people will watch your every move.

217
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,154
Do-yun isn't your priority right now.

218
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,206
Do-yun!

219
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,084
-Is this Dan Hwal?
-Who are you?

220
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,005
We met through that former detective.

221
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,799
I was sad to part ways so soon.

222
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,177
Why do you have his phone?

223
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,722
Do-yun is with me right now.

224
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,895
Where are you?

225
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,523
I won't tell you where we are.

226
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,068
Unlike last time,
I'm not trying to lure you.

227
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,779
I can't even kill you anyway.

228
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,739
Then why are you taking him hostage?

229
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,324
No reason.

230
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,914
I just think this is
the best way to get revenge.

231
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,917
I'm going to put an end to everything.

232
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,678
What's going on?

233
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:08,016
Dueoksini, the woman you bit in the neck.

234
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,893
You know her well, don't you?

235
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,311
Why do you ask?

236
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,523
She took Do-yun.

237
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,858
What?

238
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,122
I dozed off.

239
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,041
I couldn't sleep much last night.

240
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,126
It's okay. Sleep more.

241
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,170
I'm okay now.

242
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:42,259
How far are we from my brother's grave?

243
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,969
Is it still far away?

244
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,263
No. We'll arrive soon.

245
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,349
It won't take too long.

246
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,934
What's her real name?

247
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,688
I know she's one of the Monsters
who served you, so tell me!

248
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,318
Kim Sang-hui. Born in 1987.

249
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,446
Wait!

250
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,246
I'm sure Do-yun will be okay.

251
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,833
I'll help you find him.

252
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,424
First, look into the Hyeongrim-dong case
that happened in 2001.

253
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,772
Come pick me up right now.

254
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:44,446
Gosh! Why did you barge in here like that?
I thought you were Ok Eul-tae!

255
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,990
-Where are the sisters?
-Upstairs.

256
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,326
What in the world is going on?

257
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,286
Where is Ok Eul-tae?

258
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,287
He left.

259
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,998
Both of you need to get out of here.

260
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,833
Once I hide you two,
I need to go somewhere.

261
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,253
-Hurry and pack up.
-What about this house?

262
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,465
It doesn't matter.
Don't come here for the time being.

263
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,259
What about Do-yun? Did you find him?

264
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,264
I will. At all costs.

265
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,476
Did something happen to him?

266
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,186
No.

267
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,188
Go pack up right now. We don't have time.

268
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,109
No. The others don't have to go.

269
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,529
I'll go by myself.

270
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,322
Hold on.

271
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,617
Sang-un, you're not going anywhere alone.
I'm coming with you.

272
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,535
No.

273
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,329
It'll only make things complicated.

274
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,583
I'll be fine.
I just need to lie low for a bit.

275
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,793
Let's go.

276
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,555
Take care of Si-ho.

277
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,141
Sure, I'll do that.

278
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,239
I'll take you somewhere
Ok Eul-tae can't find you.

279
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,159
I'll come for you later,
so don't go anywhere.

280
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,161
Where are you going?

281
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,124
Just tell me already.
I know something's up.

282
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,667
I can tell by your face.

283
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,713
Something happened to Do-yun, right?

284
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,216
Dueoksini took him.

285
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,552
What? Where?

286
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,053
I don't know yet.

287
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,433
I need to find him.
But first, I'll take you somewhere safe.

288
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,935
We don't have much time.

289
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,520
I'll come with you.

290
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,522
What if it's a trap, and you're alone?

291
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,317
I wish it was.

292
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,612
Then at least
he'd be safe until I get there.

293
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,615
If he gets hurt because of me…

294
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,291
Is there a way to locate him?

295
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,252
I'm looking into it.

296
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,801
Come on.
You're going to follow me here too?

297
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,638
I said I'll leave
if you give me that information.

298
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,848
Unbelievable.

299
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,225
The Hyeongrim-dong case?

300
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,727
Why are you interested in an old case?

301
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,939
A woman named Kim Sang-hui
was involved, right?

302
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,774
I need to look into something.

303
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,527
You always come unannounced
and demand case details.

304
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,321
This isn't some complaint center.

305
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,866
Is this related to that detective agency?

306
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,827
No. This is something far more important.

307
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,956
What is it?

308
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,834
Damn it. Just tell me already.
I'm running out of time!

309
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,963
Why are you so cranky today?

310
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,006
Being aggressive won't get you anything.

311
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,092
You know that's confidential information.

312
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,594
Do you think I have an ulterior motive?
You know me!

313
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,806
I'm not doing anything illegal.

314
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,683
Someone I know is involved in this.

315
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,477
Detective Ham.

316
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,437
I'm begging you. Please?

317
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,857
Darn it. Seriously?

318
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,067
Please?

319
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,156
MURDER OF MARRIED COUPLE
AT HYEONGRIM-DONG

320
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,410
Didn't you say
Ok Eul-tae told you about this case?

321
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,954
He did?

322
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,747
He offered to help locate Do-yun,

323
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,709
and told me Dueoksini's real name
and about this case.

324
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,335
CASE REPORT
AT THE SCENE: KIM SANG-HUI

325
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,880
What does this old case
have to do with Dueoksini?

326
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,968
Twenty years ago, a married couple
was murdered in Hyeongrim-dong.

327
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,430
The culprit killed them
with a blunt weapon.

328
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,683
Their only daughter
was also at the crime scene.

329
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,978
But she slept through
the incident and didn't witness anything.

330
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,981
Was that daughter Dueoksini?

331
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,608
I believe so.

332
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,861
Her name is Kim Sang-hui.

333
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,613
Everyone was shocked by how calm she was

334
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,907
despite her parents' gruesome deaths.

335
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:01,328
A colleague who was
in charge of the case told me

336
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,954
that she was very strange.

337
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,458
In the end, she wasn't even a suspect.

338
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,835
A young girl couldn't
have battered adults to death

339
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,880
let alone her own parents.

340
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,716
How old was she?

341
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,135
She was in elementary school.

342
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,392
Dueoksini is known to manipulate
people's thoughts and minds.

343
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,812
I'm certain it was her doing.

344
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,898
Then what about
the incident three years ago?

345
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,400
What happened then?

346
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,278
Her in-laws were murdered.

347
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,074
Her father-in-law enjoyed
hunting and crossbow shooting.

348
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,242
They were shot and killed with a crossbow.

349
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,661
Sang-hui was the prime suspect,

350
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,331
but she was released
due to lack of evidence.

351
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:50,168
Despite the possibility that
his wife may have killed his parents,

352
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,504
her husband defended her until the end.

353
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,839
He argued that
she'd never do such a thing.

354
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,426
He was completely duped.

355
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,137
What does her husband do?

356
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,098
He's a vet in a rural area.

357
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,767
A vet?

358
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,603
Where does he live?

359
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,146
Give me that.

360
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,569
He lives in Gio-myeon, Geumseong-gun.

361
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,323
Gio-myeon, Geumseong-gun.

362
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,828
Mount Padu is there.

363
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,958
Dueoksini lived in
a forest there 600 years ago.

364
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,795
That's the place.

365
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,798
MOUNT PADU: DUEOKSINI'S FOREST

366
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,308
Hey.

367
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,186
Are you sure this is the right way?

368
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,441
Did Ok Eul-tae
really bury my brother here?

369
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,487
What's the problem? It's a nice forest.

370
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,033
I feel happy every time I come here
as if I'm visiting my hometown.

371
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,910
Isn't that strange?

372
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,246
It feels like a place I've longed for.

373
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,999
That's why I married
a guy from a town nearby.

374
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,585
I don't like it.

375
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,796
Why did he bury my brother here?

376
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,923
He didn't even let me know.

377
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,092
He lied about everything.

378
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,180
What an asshole.

379
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,727
I empathize with you.

380
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,146
I hate him too.

381
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,065
-You do?
-Yes.

382
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,443
He betrayed me.

383
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,154
He did this.

384
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,576
We were both used and discarded.

385
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,496
Since we're on the topic,
I have something to tell you.

386
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,247
What is it?

387
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,543
When Ok Eul-tae is ill at night,

388
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,837
he mumbles things
in his sleep that he shouldn't.

389
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,006
He completely forgets that I'm listening.

390
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,175
He mentions things
that others shouldn't hear.

391
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:05,428
But why are you telling me this?

392
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,932
Because it's about you.

393
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,559
What does he say about me?

394
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,187
You must be thirsty.

395
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:16,981
Drink this.

396
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:25,865
Do-yun was your son
in his past life, right?

397
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,166
I saw your face when you heard

398
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,502
that Do-yun was born blind.

399
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,173
I could tell by your face.

400
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,635
Then you must know what a fool I've been.

401
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,098
I finally met my son
whom I had been pining for,

402
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,683
but I couldn't recognize him.

403
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,893
I even drove him away.

404
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,187
How could you have recognized him?

405
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,107
Your only memory of him
was when he was little.

406
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,818
I should still have
recognized him right away.

407
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,903
At least by his voice.

408
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,239
Or his little habits.

409
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,575
I should have recognized him
one way or another.

410
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,287
He's the reason why
I've been doing this for 600 years.

411
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,957
My thoughtlessness put him in danger.

412
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,294
It's not your fault.

413
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,755
No, it is.

414
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,092
Everything is my fault.

415
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,053
He suffered unnecessary pain

416
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,347
just because he was my son.

417
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,310
I let my karma
get to him even in this life.

418
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,521
Just like 600 years ago…

419
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,066
I put him in danger.

420
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,068
I'm to blame.

421
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,406
INCOMING CALL

422
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,952
ACCEPT

423
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,413
-What is it?
-That was quick.

424
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,041
I think I know where Dueoksini is.

425
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:01,461
She didn't go to a hospital
despite the nasty wound I gave her.

426
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,463
But the thing is, her husband was a vet.

427
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,466
So I'm headed to his place just in case.

428
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,884
Do you want the address?

429
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,261
If that's where you're headed, it's fine.

430
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,846
I'm on my way there too.

431
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,933
Really? I'm impressed you found out.
Then where's Sang-un?

432
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,267
You're always together.

433
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,731
Why do you ask?
Planning to kidnap her while I'm there?

434
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,982
No, you can bring her.

435
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,943
I won't touch her until we find Do-yun.

436
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,153
Finding him is our priority right now.

437
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,531
If you can't trust me,
I'll stay away from you guys.

438
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,658
Make your decision.

439
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,701
Look around her husband's area then.

440
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,120
Okay. I'll call you right away
if I find anything.

441
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,458
We need all the help we can get.

442
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,836
Whether it be from an enemy
or a foe from the past.

443
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,248
Did your car break down?

444
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,918
You. Why are you here?

445
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,713
Were you on your way
to find Do-yun? I am too.

446
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:27,755
Hop in.

447
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,258
Are you crazy?
I'm not getting in a car with Bulgasal.

448
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:34,095
We need to join hands to find him,
so let's not argue.

449
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,307
Make up your mind.
I won't wait long for you.

450
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,894
You can wrestle with that rundown car
while his life hangs by a thread.

451
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,747
I'm not going to kill you.

452
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,373
I have no time for that.

453
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,710
I didn't say anything.

454
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,213
Kill me if you want for all I care.

455
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,467
I may kill the others…

456
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,596
but I'll never kill you.

457
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,142
Why? Why won't you kill me?

458
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,775
Enough with your ambiguity.

459
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,817
Tell me.

460
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,779
Are you really trying to save Do-yun?

461
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,864
Have you been lied to all your life?

462
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,242
Then what does this look like? A date?

463
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,120
Stop being gross.

464
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,957
I'm asking if there's an ulterior motive.

465
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,626
You used him in the past.

466
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,669
And now, you're saving him?

467
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,423
I didn't use him. I asked for his help.

468
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,178
That makes no sense when you
made him your pawn by using his brother.

469
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,056
I feel bad for Do-yun's brother too.

470
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,934
I did my best,
but I couldn't save a dying person.

471
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,478
My heart's heavy too, okay?

472
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,772
Believe it or not.

473
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,945
Are you dumbfounded?

474
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,366
Frankly, I feel the same way.

475
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,911
I don't understand why
I'm so worried about that kid.

476
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,292
I can't believe
I'm actually going there to save him.

477
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,629
I watched him grow up,

478
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,298
so maybe he meant more to me
than I thought.

479
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,177
But most of all, I'll have no one

480
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,347
to play games with if he's gone.

481
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,185
Then again, I doubt
he'll play with me ever again.

482
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,291
This is Dueoksini's forest.

483
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,711
It's changed a lot
over the past 600 years.

484
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,648
It's too dark to see anything.

485
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,154
Where are you? We're already here.

486
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,448
Hey, I'm in her husband's town.

487
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,325
I'll look around here.

488
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,492
Wait, Detective Kwon.

489
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,704
It's dangerous to be alone.
Ok Eul-tae could be nearby.

490
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,081
Oh, I've already met him.

491
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,249
What do you mean?

492
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,376
My shitty car broke down on my way here.

493
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,004
Hold on. That's not important right now.

494
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:59,383
I think he can help find Kim Sang-hui.

495
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,385
Will you be okay?

496
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,432
Do-yun is our priority.

497
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,434
And…

498
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:13,147
I'm getting this feeling
that he genuinely wants to find him too.

499
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,578
You don't sense anything?

500
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,166
I don't think anyone is here.

501
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,093
Seriously?

502
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,191
Look. I'm fine now. I can walk on my own.

503
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,527
You don't need to hold my…

504
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,337
Over there.

505
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,298
It's too dark to see,

506
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,717
but she's there.

507
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,712
Stop right there.

508
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,756
Come any closer, and I'll jump.

509
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,842
Where is Do-yun?

510
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,136
Why? Are you worried?

511
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,430
That I might've harmed him?

512
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,183
You better not have touched him.

513
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,853
I didn't.
I drugged him and put him to sleep.

514
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,064
I was very gentle with him.

515
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,861
That's not the face I wanted to see.

516
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,197
I want to see more pain in your eyes.

517
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,366
More.

518
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,034
More.

519
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,952
More!

520
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,748
Or will I see that face
only after Do-yun is dead?

521
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,640
Why do you think
I was standing in this open area?

522
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,726
Whenever those you care about
are in danger,

523
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,354
you don't hesitate to save them.

524
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,189
You stick your neck out too far.

525
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,985
That's it. That's the face.

526
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,446
That face lined with pain.

527
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,952
Is the man with the crossbow your husband?

528
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,162
Yes.

529
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,586
So he was the one who killed his parents.

530
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,464
He was also a Monster, wasn't he?

531
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,550
You're a sharp one.

532
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,511
But it's too late.

533
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,097
Hwal!

534
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,558
Don't come here! There's one more.

535
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:42,314
Is she the one?
Is she the one you talked about?

536
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:46,235
Yes! I promised you
a gift in return for helping me.

537
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,112
She's all yours.

538
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,406
Run!

539
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,086
You're going to lose
both your son and that woman

540
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,505
by the end of this night.

541
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,341
Doesn't that drive you crazy?
Aren't you in pain?

542
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,062
No.

543
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,857
I'm going to save them both.

544
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,278
And just like you did 600 years ago,

545
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,740
you will die here once again.

546
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,884
I know it's too dark to run away!

547
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,137
I know this place
like the back of my hand.

548
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,848
I know you're here. I can smell you.

549
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,852
You're my gift. A gift from my wife.

550
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,939
She promised me a gift

551
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,401
if I treated her wound and hid that boy.

552
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,569
A boy?

553
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,915
Where is that boy?

554
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:28,796
Should I put a hole
through your head or your body?

555
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,675
Fine. You can do
whatever you want with me.

556
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,095
So just tell me where you hid him.

557
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,891
Why are you so curious?

558
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,519
He's just some orphan.

559
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,813
Because there are people

560
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,857
who desperately want him back.

561
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:50,859
Is that so?

562
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,280
I'll tell you if you make this fun.

563
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,534
Run with all your might
even after you get shot.

564
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,619
Crawl if you have to.

565
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,413
Then I'll tell you.

566
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,999
Will you do that for me?

567
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,334
Just like my family did?

568
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,338
It was so much fun.

569
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,591
I had such a blast.

570
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,762
Is the boy here in this forest?

571
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,725
This forest is too gloomy for me.

572
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,437
I hid him at my favorite spot.

573
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,607
Where is that?

574
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,161
My father's house.

575
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,039
I love that there are still traces
of my family's blood.

576
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,751
And I think
this place will grow on me too.

577
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,838
After I kill you, I'll come here often.

578
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,678
Hwal.

579
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,901
You're bleeding because you're too close.

580
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,738
I don't care. It won't kill me.

581
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:00,948
And I won't die either.

582
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,533
But you're in pain!

583
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,249
I know where Do-yun is.

584
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,084
He's at that man's parents' house.

585
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,544
We have to hurry.

586
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,129
Where's Dueoksini?

587
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,422
I don't know.

588
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,675
We fell off the cliff
but I couldn't see where she went.

589
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,136
I doubt she went far, so we should hurry.

590
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,054
Okay.

591
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,767
This will hurt. Brace yourself.

592
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,952
What took you so long?

593
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,831
How did you find me?

594
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,626
What happened to your face? Tell me.

595
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,628
You must have had a rough fight with Hwal.

596
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,047
Where are you going in that state?

597
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,550
To Do-yun.

598
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,011
Where is he?

599
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,971
He's at my in-law's place.

600
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,724
I'm going to kill him

601
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,684
before Hwal finds him.

602
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,061
Is that so?

603
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,563
I see.

604
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,401
That's a shame. You won't be going there.

605
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,070
I'm here to save him.

606
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,124
You?

607
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,004
Why are you laughing?

608
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,673
You see…

609
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,302
I'm not sure if you'll be able to.

610
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,765
What are you talking about?

611
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,643
On our way here,

612
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,522
I told Do-yun something interesting.

613
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:45,445
Something about you
that Hwal should never know.

614
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,281
What?

615
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:49,950
Why would you do that?

616
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,327
Why?

617
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,749
Because I wanted
both you and Hwal to suffer.

618
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,045
He'll wake up soon.

619
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,423
It's going to be interesting.

620
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:10,053
Once he wakes up and Hwal finds him,

621
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,306
you're--

622
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,831
What a nuisance.

623
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,605
Where am I?

624
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,530
Is anyone here?

625
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,657
Anyone?

626
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,076
What the…

627
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,338
Hey! My phone.

628
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,785
HWAL

629
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,497
Whatever.

630
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,713
Do-yun. Where are you?

631
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:50,839
Hwal.

632
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,049
The thing is…

633
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,551
Answer me.

634
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,720
I don't know where I am either.

635
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,640
I was just really terrified.

636
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,310
And you're the strongest person I know.

637
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,646
So I called you.

638
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,692
But I shouldn't be calling you, right?

639
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,111
Are you indoors?

640
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:17,073
No, I'm outside. I'm on a road.

641
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,952
But you know what?
There's absolutely nothing around me.

642
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,913
I see no cars.

643
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,081
I think I was kidnapped.

644
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:28,502
Last time, I was also kidnapped
and put in the trunk of a car.

645
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,296
I guess I'm meant to be kidnapped a lot.

646
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,216
Maybe I look like
I'm from a wealthy family.

647
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,220
You're okay. I know where you are.

648
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,388
I'm on my way.

649
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,308
What? You're on your way here?

650
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,644
Why?

651
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,897
Because I was looking for you…

652
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,442
ever since that day.

653
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,862
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

654
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,155
You're sorry?

655
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,911
Why would you be sorry?
I'm the one who should be.

656
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,916
I lied and deceived you.

657
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,128
Wait there. I'll be there soon.

658
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,007
Okay. Hurry up.

659
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,219
It's really dark and scary.

660
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:23,056
Frankly, I'm afraid of the dark.
I feel like something might come at me.

661
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,725
I just creeped myself out even more.

662
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,939
And I'm hungry. Could you buy some gimbap…

663
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,861
Never mind.

664
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:39,072
I'm scared, so just get here soon. Hurry.

665
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,910
Oh, right. I came here with that secretary
but I don't know where she is.

666
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,037
She told me something odd.

667
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,873
What did she say?

668
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,916
It was about the past.

669
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,167
She said…

670
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,345
How did you find me?

671
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,432
Do-yun!

672
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,362
Why did you do that?

673
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,031
I wanted to talk in private.

674
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,951
I heard my secretary told you something.

675
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,454
Can you tell me what she said?

676
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,833
It was nothing much.

677
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,086
Just something odd.

678
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,338
What was it?

679
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,717
Before that…

680
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,054
don't you have something to tell me?

681
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,057
About my brother.

682
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:51,686
If you answer my question first,
I'll answer yours.

683
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,066
It wasn't anything important.

684
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,860
She said you killed me in my past life.

685
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:03,281
She said you killed
my mom and me 600 years ago.

686
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,117
I told you it was odd.

687
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:08,787
I see.

688
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,750
You're being honest with me.

689
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,640
I met you when you were little.

690
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,853
And I watched you grow up.

691
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,902
You must have grown on me.

692
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,865
You must have really grown on me.

693
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,833
What's the matter, Eul-tae?

694
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,128
Why are you--

695
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:07,137
Eul-tae…

696
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,357
Goodness. Are you okay?

697
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,527
Oh, my goodness. What's wrong?

698
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,011
Something's wrong.

699
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,041
Do-yun!

700
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,128
Do-yun!

701
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,671
No! Do-yun!

702
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,424
Do-yun!

703
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:29,427
Do-yun!

704
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,365
Do-yun!

705
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,042
Do-yun!

706
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,461
He bled too much.

707
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,049
-Do-yun, wake up. Do-yun!
-I called 911.

708
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,676
Why aren't they here yet?

709
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,137
-Do-yun. Wake up, kid.
-What should we do?

710
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,930
What should we do, Detective Kwon?

711
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,711
Do-yun, wake up.

712
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:27,879
You need to live.

713
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,632
You have to.

714
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,511
Don't die on your father…

715
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,433
like you did last time.

716
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,104
You must live.

717
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,859
You have to.

718
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:54,822
You have to live.

719
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,219
You have to live.

720
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,112
I'm sorry.

721
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,447
I'm sorry I failed to protect you.

722
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,074
-You have to wake up.
-Wake up, Do-yun!

723
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,200
Do-yun!

724
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,537
When you first found him,
was there really no one around?

725
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,664
The one who did this to him.

726
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,460
Do-yun.

727
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,337
Where have you been?

728
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,881
Everyone's out looking for you.

729
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,846
Do-yun.

730
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:42,930
Do-yun!

731
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,688
Just the thought of Bulgasal terrifies me.

732
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,191
But for some reason,
I find it hard to hate him.

733
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:54,525
Unlike Ok Eul-tae.

734
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,029
Could I ask you for a favor?

735
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:00,323
I'm worried about Si-ho and Ms. Lee.

736
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,827
I must have hesitated

737
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,829
when I stabbed Do-yun.

738
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,333
Hwal will come to me. I should get ready.

739
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,752
You shouldn't like him. He's Bulgasal.

740
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:13,836
Don't worry.

741
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,921
I don't like him.

742
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,049
We don't know how to kill Ok Eul-tae yet.

743
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,218
I'll handle him from now on.

744
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,260
You stay out of it.

745
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,595
What are you going to do?

746
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:24,931
I'm going to put him in the well.

747
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,974
You said I'm the sword that can kill him.

748
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,604
You called me here to put me
in there instead of Min Sang-un?

749
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,064
That's right.

750
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:36,401
I could separate your head
from your body and lock you in there.

751
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:45,952
Make sure not to let go
no matter how I react.

752
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,120
We have to do it in one go.

753
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:52,458
I told you
that I can't break her last soul.

754
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:53,960
You have to do it!

755
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:58,715
I told you everything you said
in your past life just now.

756
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:06,597
We don't know why
but we shouldn't trust Hwal either.

757
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,933
It can't be…

758
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:15,481
