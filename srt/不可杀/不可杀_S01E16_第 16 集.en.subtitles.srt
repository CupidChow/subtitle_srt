1
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,790
1,000 YEARS AGO

2
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:31,883
Have a seat.

3
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,677
Here.

4
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,223
Take your brother and run away.
Save yourselves.

5
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,102
Go on.

6
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,612
Do not look back at us. Just go.

7
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,660
Stop right there!

8
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,403
It…

9
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,405
It is a Monster!

10
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,437
FINALE

11
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,006
Oh, my goodness.

12
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,468
Oh, dear. Where are you from?

13
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,720
Why are you in this forest
so late at night?

14
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,555
Come inside.

15
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,670
5 YEARS LATER

16
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,505
I don't want that!

17
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,090
Come on!

18
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,009
I don't want it. Stop it.

19
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,761
-Come on!
-Stop it!

20
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,928
Come on!

21
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,972
It's gross!

22
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,224
-Come on!
-I said stop it!

23
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,101
-Come on!
-Mother.

24
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,313
He is bothering me
when I am trying to gather herbs.

25
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,817
If you goof around in the mountains,
the Monsters will come for you.

26
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,985
Did you hear that?

27
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,947
Hey, just look at this.

28
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,699
-Stop following me.
-Be careful.

29
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,868
-I don't want to.
-Come on!

30
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:27,386
JOMAGU: A RAVENOUS MONSTER
THAT EVEN EATS CORPSES

31
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,393
Hey!

32
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,021
Help me!

33
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,465
Thank you for saving my brother.

34
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,801
You should thank her too.

35
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,706
He has been coughing
ever since he was a baby.

36
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,208
Many of the villagers
around here cough like him.

37
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,716
Kids, where are you?

38
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,718
Thank you. We should go.

39
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,219
Kids?

40
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,610
You're infatuated with those children.

41
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,654
You think of them as your own.

42
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,868
I'm afraid that you might leave me.

43
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,829
I will never leave you.

44
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,791
We are the only Bulgasals on this land.

45
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,170
The only Bulgasals…

46
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,292
Wait.

47
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,169
I remember you.

48
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,965
You looked familiar
when you saved my brother.

49
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,676
You saved us back in that cave too, right?

50
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,095
I remember everything now.

51
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,183
Can you not speak?

52
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,227
Do you understand what I say?

53
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,819
What? Are those herbs
for my brother's cough?

54
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,119
Tell her to go away right now!

55
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,872
Mother!

56
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,333
How could you bring someone
from the mountains?

57
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,542
Have you no fear?

58
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,339
People say Bulgasals live
on that mountain.

59
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,508
They deceive us
by disguising themselves as humans.

60
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,510
They feed on our blood and are immortal.

61
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,430
She is not a Monster that eats humans.

62
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,015
She saved us.

63
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,018
She was also the one
who brought us here back then.

64
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,032
Why do you live in the mountains?

65
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,535
Did you lose your house in the war?

66
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,748
Or did some thieves kill your family?

67
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,543
The mountains are terrifying.

68
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,592
It is not easy for me
to raise them here either.

69
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,308
Live with us.

70
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,519
We can protect each other. Please?

71
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,664
In the end,
you abandoned me for the humans.

72
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,500
You lied to me.

73
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,715
Even the scarlet moon bleeds.

74
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,880
I did not abandon you.

75
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,382
I will be gone

76
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:43,095
only until the children have grown up.

77
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,604
The moon has turned countless times.

78
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,023
And no matter how long I wait…

79
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,234
you do not return.

80
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,925
10 YEARS LATER

81
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,102
You should rest today.

82
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,938
I had a bad dream last night,

83
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,814
so I have an ominous feeling today.

84
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,566
Do not worry and rest up.

85
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,859
We will be back soon.

86
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,819
-We should go.
-Okay.

87
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,865
Can you come here for a moment?

88
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,284
Come here.

89
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,170
You have not aged one bit.

90
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,679
The villagers will find it odd,

91
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,347
so cover yourself.

92
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,189
We should go.

93
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,357
-Goodbye.
-Come on.

94
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,402
Take care of yourselves.

95
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,486
We will.

96
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,462
What is it? Do you want
to give it to that girl in the village?

97
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,590
Please.

98
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,550
I was just admiring its beauty.

99
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,054
-Should I pick it for you?
-No.

100
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,523
No!

101
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,198
We should go.

102
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,039
Hurry!

103
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,728
If it was not for her,

104
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,939
we would have died.

105
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,607
What a relief.

106
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,360
But…

107
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,990
I am sure she is not human.

108
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,033
You knew that too, right?

109
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,537
Mother, she is a part of our family now.

110
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,998
She is taking care of us.

111
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,751
Yes. She is a part of our family.

112
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,922
But one day, she must go back
for all of our sakes.

113
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,844
Goodness. But she has grown on us.

114
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,724
But I wonder who that man is.

115
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,441
I heard you were going to Gaegyeong.

116
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,569
I will leave behind my family
and only take my second son with me.

117
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,780
Then what do you plan
to do with your first son?

118
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,532
He is sick.

119
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,451
He coughs up blood.

120
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,911
And he started to go mad
after his mother died.

121
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,621
He cannot succeed me.

122
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,211
I am glad that I have
a second son from a second wife.

123
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,590
My second son takes after me in every way.

124
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,675
He is strong and brave.

125
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,685
Who's there?

126
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,650
What is it?

127
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,195
I cannot find our son, Eul-seo.

128
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,946
He went hunting this afternoon,

129
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,575
but he has not returned
from the forest where there is a Monster.

130
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,829
Send men to the mountains.

131
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,042
Something does not feel right.

132
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,238
I knew it.

133
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,991
You are Bulgasal.

134
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,207
Ever since I was little,
I was able to see things

135
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,667
when I held people's hands.

136
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,795
My mother told me

137
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,256
that I was reading the soul's memory.

138
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,969
But I see nothing in yours.

139
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,763
I heard…

140
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,101
that only Bulgasal does not have a soul.

141
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,687
But…

142
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:12,151
I do not care if you are Bulgasal
or some other Monster.

143
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,821
You saved us and are a part of our family.

144
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,200
But promise me

145
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:24,496
that you will never harm humans,
no matter what happens.

146
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,169
That is enough for me.

147
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,214
I saw you looking at the mountains.

148
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,469
You always have
that expression whenever you do.

149
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,264
Is there something
you long for back there?

150
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,607
We must hurry. Hurry!

151
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,029
Something must have happened
in the village.

152
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,373
Was it a human or a Monster?

153
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,584
Who killed my son?

154
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,085
It was Bulgasal,

155
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,545
Father.

156
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,091
Eul-seo hunted in the mountains

157
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,136
where Bulgasal lives.

158
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,262
Bulgasal?

159
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,807
There is no such thing.
It is only a made-up story.

160
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,850
No, Father.

161
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,311
I saw it.

162
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,105
I even know where it is.

163
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,614
No!

164
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,496
My goodness. What are they doing?

165
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,251
-Goodness.
-Wait.

166
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,170
-How could they treat her like that?
-Oh, dear!

167
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,338
What is going on?

168
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,131
-Hold on.
-Stop that!

169
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,937
What on earth are you doing?

170
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,775
I heard that the one
who killed my son was here.

171
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,194
It must be you.

172
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,697
The one who came from a foreign land.

173
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,838
Oh, my goodness!

174
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,715
-You are Bulgasal.
-That is Bulgasal.

175
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,633
She is Bulgasal!

176
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,468
-Bulgasal!
-Goodness.

177
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,053
How could Bulgasal be here?

178
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,723
No!

179
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,351
Hey!

180
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,855
-No! Don't!
-She is Bulgasal.

181
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,317
She was the one who killed my son.

182
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,488
She disguised herself as human
and fed on human blood.

183
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,825
She neither ages nor dies
because she has no soul.

184
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,909
Look!

185
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,037
She is not dying!

186
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,455
-He is right!
-What do we do?

187
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,372
She is not dying!

188
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,878
She must really be Bulgasal!

189
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,296
-She is Bulgasal!
-She is!

190
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,589
She is Bulgasal!

191
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,635
But promise me

192
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,263
that you will never harm humans,
no matter what happens.

193
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,644
Bind her!

194
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,021
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

195
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,981
Please stop!

196
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,609
She has never killed anyone!

197
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,194
She is right!

198
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,363
Have you two been with her all this time?

199
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,449
No, my lord!

200
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,871
They were immature
and did not know any better!

201
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,166
They are innocent!

202
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,265
I stabbed her heart,
but she is still alive.

203
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,433
What should I do?

204
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,310
We will behead her.

205
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:19,272
And we will bury her deep underground
after chopping off her limbs.

206
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,236
Set the house on fire as well!

207
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,695
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

208
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,448
-Goodness.
-Oh, dear!

209
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,201
Must you set the house on fire?

210
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,945
-Blood!
-What is happening?

211
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,149
Mother!

212
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,525
Mother!

213
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,944
Mother!

214
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,738
Mother…

215
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,823
Mother…

216
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,992
Mother…

217
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:38,995
Mother!

218
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,665
Your neck…

219
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,132
I am all right.

220
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,719
Why are you angry at me?

221
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,472
Why did you do this?

222
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,349
Why did you kill everyone?

223
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,402
Those pathetic humans tried to harm you.

224
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,529
That is why I told you
not to care about them.

225
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,284
It is all over now. Come back with me.

226
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:46,623
Why…

227
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,982
How dare you lowly humans try to kill me!

228
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,278
This is all futile.

229
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,365
Bulgasal does not die.

230
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,284
I will curse every one of you

231
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,578
who has spilled my blood.

232
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,916
Your arm, stained by my blood,
will be chopped off.

233
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,421
Your eyes will fail to see.

234
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:40,927
And your body, drenched with my blood,
will never hold living children.

235
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,347
I will kill you all here.

236
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:48,226
And once you reincarnate,
I will find and kill you all over again.

237
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:56,109
This curse will go on as long as I live.

238
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:01,406
I will never forget my vengeance.

239
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,639
What have you done?

240
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:30,769
Your heart has already been wounded
and I have stabbed mine.

241
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,355
We will die together now.

242
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,361
I can't let them die like this.

243
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,529
My sister…

244
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,740
It is all right.

245
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,867
You will live.

246
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,040
I despise you.

247
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,876
I truly despise you.

248
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,837
I will come back.

249
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,089
And when I do,

250
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,551
I will tear apart
the people who did this to me

251
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,887
and I will drink their blood.

252
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,224
And…

253
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,227
I will find you.

254
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,655
You…

255
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,282
are mine.

256
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,443
What is going on?

257
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,154
Why did you come here?

258
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,244
Is this…

259
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,164
the power you wield?

260
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,919
Can I become like you?

261
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,881
That evil spirit killed everyone.

262
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,173
Run away from him!

263
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:28,511
No. I must take him with me.

264
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,013
I need him.

265
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,324
No…

266
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,450
You cannot take him.

267
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,230
I could not let your brother harm my son.

268
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,609
After all, he is still my son.

269
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,155
If karma brings us together once again,

270
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,617
I will ask for your forgiveness then.

271
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,996
It can't be…

272
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:30,860
The soul will go back to its owner.

273
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:34,030
No…

274
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,118
I refuse to become human again.

275
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,472
Detective Kwon.

276
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,735
I'm sorry…

277
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,072
for running away by myself

278
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,450
and not helping you.

279
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,231
I'll come back for you.

280
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,862
I still have something left to do.

281
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,324
I've been looking for you.

282
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,159
What are you doing here?

283
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,078
I knew you'd come.

284
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,706
Do you recognize this place?

285
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,751
This was your home

286
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:56,047
when you were Bulgasal 1,000 years ago.

287
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,674
After I became Bulgasal,

288
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,928
I came here once.

289
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,098
I was curious about how you lived.

290
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,141
But…

291
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,895
I wasn't able to enter the cave.

292
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,899
Min Sang-un…

293
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,860
She was here.

294
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,746
It seemed like she was waiting for you.

295
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:37,880
She didn't know
that you had died as a human.

296
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,407
But you shouldn't be deeply moved.

297
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,160
She only waited so she could kill you.

298
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,413
She was afraid

299
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,250
you'd kill Si-ho and Do-yun again.

300
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:17,461
The one who protected you from her…

301
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,007
was me.

302
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,260
Are you ready to kill her now?

303
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,430
Are you ready to fulfill your curse?

304
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,290
Are you ready to return
to who you were 1,000 years ago?

305
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,375
You…

306
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,296
Where did that blood come from?

307
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,298
Once Bulgasal gets a taste

308
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,010
of human blood…

309
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:13,017
it's quite difficult to hold back.

310
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,896
I was also disgusted at first.

311
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,440
After all, I was human too.
But you know what?

312
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,568
The more I had, the less disgusted I felt.

313
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,029
The human emotions I once had

314
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,240
slowly dissipated,

315
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,910
and I gradually became a true Monster.

316
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,371
Are you okay?

317
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,807
You will soon become like me…

318
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,394
since you also had a taste.

319
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,485
What have you done?

320
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,040
I consumed as much blood
as I could on my way here.

321
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,377
To give to you.

322
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,131
Drink my blood.

323
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,675
You can have every last drop of it.

324
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,387
This way, you can go back

325
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,722
to being a Monster.

326
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,810
Then…

327
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,564
you'll appreciate all the hard work
I've done for you.

328
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,694
You'll go back to being
who you were 1,000 years ago…

329
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,657
and help me get rid of this dark hole.

330
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,577
Don't you want to go back

331
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,871
to being the Bulgasal you once were?

332
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,207
The one who wiped out the entire village

333
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,043
and whose presence
made everyone bleed to death?

334
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,506
I've always wanted…

335
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,344
to become like you.

336
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,932
No.

337
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,270
I don't want to go back
to the Bulgasal you want me to be.

338
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,023
I won't.

339
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,358
Why not?

340
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,573
Because I want to live as the human I was.

341
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,039
In that case…

342
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,544
I don't need you either.

343
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,707
This is all your fault.

344
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,002
You wanted to kill Hwal as well.

345
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,254
So why?

346
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,549
Why are you pretending
to care about him now?

347
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,009
I told you

348
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,929
that he and I are the same.

349
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:42,977
You're wrong.

350
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,646
He's not like you.

351
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,733
If it weren't for you…

352
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,821
Hwal would have been mine.

353
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:02,079
I shouldn't have let you
meet again in the first place.

354
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,888
No!

355
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,312
Please…

356
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,371
Hwal…

357
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,499
Please…

358
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,335
Don't go.

359
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,883
Please look at me…

360
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,307
Don't go…

361
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,337
Hwal.

362
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,381
We did it.

363
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,049
Let's move him to the well…

364
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,219
He's coming…

365
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,264
What did you say?

366
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,809
He's coming…

367
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,270
Now that he has consumed blood,

368
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,690
there's no turning back.

369
00:46:58,899 --> 00:46:59,983
Hwal.

370
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,808
No!

371
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,021
No!

372
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:39,773
You can't!

373
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,234
You can't!

374
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,213
Why?

375
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,134
Why did you do this?

376
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,387
What can I do to save you?

377
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,682
Take my soul right now.

378
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:15,601
Please?

379
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,240
It's too late.

380
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,368
Why?

381
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,496
We agreed to live together.

382
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,082
So how could you do this?

383
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,461
I had no choice

384
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,631
if I wanted to put an end to everything.

385
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,552
I said I forgave you
for what you did 1,000 years ago.

386
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,222
But I can't forgive myself.

387
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,434
It's unbearable for me.

388
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,605
I can't go back to being human anymore.

389
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,524
As long as I'm alive…

390
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,112
the curse will continue.

391
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,199
What do you mean?

392
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,952
Do-yun will be born blind
over and over again.

393
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,706
And Si-ho will never
be able to give birth.

394
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,127
That can't be true.

395
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,141
I'm sorry…

396
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,604
for everything I did 1,000 years ago.

397
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,774
I thought you had left me,

398
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,360
so I was angry.

399
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,946
I did everything I could
to keep you by my side.

400
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,739
But that only made you hate me.

401
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,701
And I killed those you cherished.

402
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:07,462
I shouldn't have looked for you.

403
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,677
I shouldn't have met you again.

404
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,770
But it still pains me…

405
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,734
to leave you behind.

406
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,448
But after I die,

407
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,493
you, Si-ho, Do-yun…

408
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,415
Detective Kwon, and Hye-seok

409
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,251
will all be okay.

410
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,440
Once I'm gone,

411
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:10,692
everyone…

412
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,654
will be okay in their next lives.

413
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:23,663
I've made you suffer for all these years.

414
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,750
I'm sorry.

415
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,253
Don't be.

416
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,466
Come find me again.

417
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,136
No. I'll look for you next time.

418
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,935
Bulgasal can't reincarnate.

419
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:48,772
I don't care! Reincarnate somehow!

420
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,150
Ask the king of the underworld
to give you another life!

421
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,240
You looked for me all these years.

422
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,991
So next time,

423
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,495
I will find you.

424
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,539
So…

425
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,959
you have to remember me.

426
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,611
Help me…

427
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,823
Father…

428
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,670
I wonder if they're okay.

429
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,799
What should we do if no one comes back?

430
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,133
They will.

431
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:23,927
Don't worry.

432
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:30,976
SANG-UN

433
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,812
Hey, Sang-un.

434
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,063
Si-ho.

435
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,024
What's wrong?

436
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,543
-Sang-un.
-Sang-un!

437
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,550
Where is Ok Eul-tae?

438
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,056
He's dead.

439
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,352
Then where is Hwal?

440
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:24,988
Then…

441
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,368
what about Detective Kwon?

442
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,549
Sang-un…

443
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:24,923
Sang-un.

444
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,676
Are you okay? What's wrong?

445
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,473
What? What happened?

446
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,810
Sang-un, when did you get hurt?

447
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,436
Why didn't you tell me?

448
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,856
I'm okay. I just need some rest.

449
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,816
But first,

450
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,860
I need to show you something.

451
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,196
What are you talking about?

452
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,157
Get on my back.
Let's go to the hospital. Do-yun!

453
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,452
No. You need to see this first.

454
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,996
We shouldn't leave
Detective Kwon there all by himself.

455
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,918
I need to show you where he is.

456
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,052
Sang-un…

457
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,514
I got my revenge on Ok Eul-tae.

458
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,853
But I lost too much.

459
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,355
But…

460
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,067
I'm glad…

461
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,696
that you and Do-yun are alive.

462
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,490
Why would you say such a thing?

463
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,075
Why?

464
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,670
Si-ho.

465
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:46,754
Yes?

466
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,842
You said you wanted to make it up to me.

467
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,762
Then have beautiful babies

468
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,557
and make a big family.

469
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,600
And…

470
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,686
you have to live a good life.

471
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,772
Okay?

472
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,343
Let's not die.

473
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,262
I won't die. So you shouldn't die either.

474
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,599
Let's go back together.

475
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,692
Run away!

476
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,402
Hurry…

477
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,154
Run!

478
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,700
I'm sorry

479
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,371
for running away by myself
and not helping you.

480
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,670
You agreed to return to your family!

481
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:10,922
Let me go.

482
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,507
I have to end this.

483
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,675
A thousand years ago…

484
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,221
I killed Hye-seok.

485
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,015
And I cursed Do-yun, Si-ho,

486
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,393
and Detective Kwon.

487
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,646
So I have no family to return to.

488
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,568
Let me help you.

489
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,362
You've done enough.

490
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,949
It's okay for you to live.

491
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:55,967
No!

492
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,470
But after I die,

493
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:04,225
you, Si-ho, Do-yun,
Detective Kwon, and Hye-seok

494
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,561
will all be okay.

495
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,299
Sang-un.

496
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,020
Sang-un.

497
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,649
Sang-un.

498
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:49,414
Gosh, we've been away
for so long that dust has piled up.

499
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:50,998
I know.

500
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,294
Si-ho.

501
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,131
Let's stay strong.

502
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,843
He promised to reincarnate again,
so we just need to wait here.

503
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,970
What do you mean?

504
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,555
Hwal said so.

505
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,350
He said people who cross paths once
are bound to meet again.

506
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,812
So let's wait for them here.

507
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,774
We promised to live here together.

508
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,821
We should be here
when Hwal and Sang-un come back.

509
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,917
8 MONTHS LATER

510
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,135
Uncle's off to school.

511
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,720
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

512
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:48,055
-Come home early.
-Okay.

513
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,523
-Brush your teeth.
-I don't want to.

514
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,150
6 YEARS LATER

515
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:02,278
-You're late. We need to leave soon.
-No, we don't.

516
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,155
-Hey! Min-seo!
-I don't want to.

517
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,491
Hey! You!

518
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,117
You're in big trouble!

519
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,285
Come here!

520
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:13,956
10 YEARS LATER

521
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,543
Come on. What is it?

522
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,003
What do you want to tell me?

523
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:22,673
Si-ho.

524
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,591
Yes?

525
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:29,972
I'm getting married.

526
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,061
Really?

527
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,562
Yes.

528
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,691
I'm so happy for you.

529
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,405
-Have a drink.
-Thank you.

530
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,949
You can have that.

531
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:50,993
30 YEARS LATER

532
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,286
-It's good.
-Let's drink.

533
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,996
-Eat up.
-It's tasty, Uncle Do-yun.

534
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:54,956
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

535
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,500
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

536
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,180
Mom.

537
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,141
How long will you
live here alone like this?

538
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,602
How about you move in with me?

539
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,903
You found her?

540
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:30,074
50 YEARS LATER

541
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,441
-What is this?
-It's for you.

542
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:30,801
What's wrong?

543
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,929
Are you okay?

544
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,603
What's wrong with me?

545
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:49,737
324, SAN, SANGYONG CITY, GYEONGGI-DO

546
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:13,511
Is anyone here?

547
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,477
Seriously?

548
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,855
Excuse me…

549
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,529
Yes. The house I told you about.

550
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,864
I'd like to buy it.

551
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:20,953
I need to hang up. I'll call you back.

552
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,250
Excuse me, but who are you?

553
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:28,919
Miss.

554
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:34,091
I'm sorry. I should get going.

555
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:40,765
Are you okay?

556
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,060
Yes, I am. Thank you.

557
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,482
Are you okay?

558
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,318
-Oh, it's nothing.
-It looks bad.

559
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:00,034
Right.

560
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,162
I have a first-aid kit in my car.
I'll go get it.

561
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,384
Have we…

562
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:02,513
met before?
