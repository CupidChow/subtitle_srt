1
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,972
GOKOK: SOUL

2
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,736
Why did you do it?

3
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,241
Why did you have to kill
my innocent wife and son?

4
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,368
You could have killed only me.

5
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,288
Tell me why.

6
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,833
Tell me why!

7
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,380
This was all your doing.

8
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,384
What have you done?

9
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,598
You have created more bad karma.

10
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,018
And you have brought upon
another retribution.

11
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,104
I despise you.

12
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,815
I truly

13
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,652
despise you.

14
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,655
What do you mean?

15
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,492
I will be born again

16
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,286
with this scar

17
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,498
that you have given me.

18
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,589
Bulgasal is dead.

19
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,926
You killed that which cannot be killed.

20
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,886
But how?

21
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,600
A sword in his body…

22
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,313
Bulgasal…

23
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,023
Has he become a Monster himself?

24
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,770
Commander.

25
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,121
He is a Monster.

26
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,707
He has turned into Bulgasal.

27
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,210
He is Bulgasal.

28
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,337
He will kill us. He will kill us all!

29
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,182
EPISODE 2

30
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,435
He was not a human, my lord.

31
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,521
We should not have trusted someone
who was of ominous birth.

32
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,441
He sacrificed his family
and subordinates to become Bulgasal.

33
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,654
Where are the bodies
of my daughter and grandson?

34
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,489
He must have taken them with him.

35
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,033
He looked like a beast

36
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,036
as he stared at his dead son.

37
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,577
The Royal Court has ordered Hwal,
who has become Bulgasal, to be killed.

38
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,163
If he cannot be killed,

39
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,957
he must be buried alive
and sealed in the ground.

40
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,877
Tell the Royal Court
that I, Dan Geuk, will do it myself.

41
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,853
There are no traces of him.

42
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,440
The sun will set soon,
and Bulgasal will be rampant.

43
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,984
Where is the General?

44
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,531
Due to his arm, he decided to stay
at the foot of the mountain.

45
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,066
I knew you would come
to find me once I was alone.

46
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,004
Is it true that you have become Bulgasal?

47
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,348
Answer me.

48
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,020
Did you sacrifice your men
and become an evil spirit?

49
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,024
Did you really kill Sol
and A-chan with your own hands?

50
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,825
Please kill me.

51
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,205
What?

52
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,296
I cannot die.

53
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,759
I jumped off a cliff

54
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,971
and stabbed myself with a sword,
but I did not die.

55
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,057
I have

56
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,643
truly become…

57
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,271
an immortal Monster.

58
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,733
I have become an evil spirit…

59
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,655
who feeds off human blood.

60
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,579
So it is true.

61
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,668
The Royal Court wants you dead.

62
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,171
If you cannot die,

63
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,551
I will cut you into pieces
and seal you shut at the bottom of a well.

64
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,314
I will ask you one last time.

65
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,359
Did you really kill Sol and A-chan

66
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,946
with your own hands?

67
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,954
I did.

68
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,874
I dragged them into this,

69
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,627
promising that I would break the curse.

70
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,087
So I led them to their deaths.

71
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,008
I was not able to forget how Bulgasal
had saved me when I was little.

72
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,597
So I let it go
and that has led to their deaths.

73
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,228
Their necks were torn.

74
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,899
And as they lay dying
with their eyes still open,

75
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,153
I could not do anything.

76
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,655
So I am the one who killed them.

77
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,852
Go.

78
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,316
Flee from the humans and live in hiding.

79
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,193
Do not harm them.

80
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,987
Why are you doing this?

81
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,240
I am Bulgasal who feeds off their blood.

82
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,705
You are not a Monster.

83
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,667
You were born a human and lived as one.

84
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,545
You have the heart of a human.

85
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,300
So live no matter what.

86
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,953
Kill it!

87
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,746
Behead it!

88
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,915
I saw everything.

89
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:57,044
That man… No.
That evil spirit wishes to die.

90
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,380
Behead it and put it in the well.

91
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,423
He used to be a human,

92
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,300
so he will not hurt them.

93
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,469
Will you disobey a Royal order?

94
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,097
Monsters must be killed.

95
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,058
He was our comrade
who also sacrificed his life.

96
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,102
He saved our lives many--

97
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,692
I told you not to trust anyone
who was of lowly and ominous birth.

98
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,112
I will tell the Royal Court
that you died while fighting Bulgasal.

99
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,469
Kill it! Kill Bulgasal!

100
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,890
No!

101
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,103
Do you truly wish…

102
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,149
to become a Monster?

103
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,033
Let's go.

104
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,873
Come with me.

105
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,754
Come.

106
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,288
You need to be treated right away.

107
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,083
Let me take you to the village.

108
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,250
It is too late.

109
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,338
Worry about yourself.

110
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,466
Since I have failed,

111
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,929
the Royal Court will send
someone else to do the deed.

112
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,431
It is not too late. Please get up.

113
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,573
Promise me…

114
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,578
that you will never feed off human blood.

115
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,002
Answer me.

116
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,713
Answer me out loud.

117
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,135
Yes, Father.

118
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:55,139
No matter how many centuries go by,

119
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,058
you must remain a human.

120
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,353
Yes, Father.

121
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,150
Good.

122
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,032
Now…

123
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,285
I would like to rest.

124
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,417
Take me to my daughter.

125
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,671
I must ask her for forgiveness.

126
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,843
All my life,
I have been neglectful of Sol.

127
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,555
I avoided her.

128
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,769
Her abnormal power
of reading people's pasts…

129
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,649
Everyone talked behind her back.

130
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,446
I considered her a strange being myself.

131
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,282
I should have treated her better.

132
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,161
I should have embraced her

133
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,123
when she lost her mother…

134
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,170
and her daughter.

135
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,683
Father…

136
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,025
What you said came true.

137
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,612
Those who were
by my side have all perished

138
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,363
due to Bulgasal's grudge against me.

139
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,825
Is there more to the curse

140
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,662
that you have yet to tell me?

141
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:16,632
Oh, Bulgasal.
Please let your anger subside.

142
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,761
Please put an end to this cycle of death.

143
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,181
Please put an end

144
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,476
to this bloody carnage.

145
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,605
Why have I become Bulgasal?

146
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,526
Bulgasal is immortal

147
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,947
because it has no soul.

148
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:45,744
The former Bulgasal took yours.

149
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,039
That is why you have become Bulgasal.

150
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,168
Then what has happened to that woman?

151
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,838
She died as a human.

152
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,677
And she will reincarnate as a human.

153
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,639
She became a human
and will reincarnate as one?

154
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,102
I will be born again

155
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,772
with this scar that you have given me.

156
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,985
You murdered my family

157
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,863
and made me immortal by stealing my soul.

158
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,034
You threw me into this agony.

159
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,373
Then it is my turn to hunt her.

160
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,334
I will let you know

161
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,420
how agonizing it is
to be chased by Bulgasal.

162
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,508
No matter how many times
you are reincarnated,

163
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,885
I will make sure

164
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,764
to find you and get my revenge.

165
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:08,744
YEAR 1593, JOSEON
JAPANESE INVASION

166
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,017
Let's go!

167
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,749
Stop right there!

168
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,503
Stay still!

169
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,588
Let me go!

170
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,473
Do you want to die?

171
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,335
It is a Monster!

172
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,296
Run!

173
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,196
Promise me that you will never
feed off human blood.

174
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,158
No matter

175
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,827
how many centuries go by,

176
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,246
you must remain a human.

177
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:31,404
3 YEARS LATER

178
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,061
Have you seen this woman before?

179
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,981
I have seen a drawing

180
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,900
of the same woman.

181
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,751
How did you know about my drawing?

182
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,806
I spotted this woman
passing by the village.

183
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:45,437
I could not forget
the sight of her so I drew this.

184
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,735
Where did she go?

185
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,906
I killed her.

186
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,367
How long ago was it?

187
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,832
I felt the desire to kill
as soon as I saw her.

188
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:10,670
It felt like I was born to kill her.

189
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,054
I never felt this way when killing others.

190
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,394
Strangely enough, there was
another man who looked for her.

191
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,771
Who was it?

192
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,734
A young man with a dark hole.

193
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,447
He said he was after her soul.

194
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,244
That was when I realized

195
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,539
that I, alongside many others,

196
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:52,087
was after her soul.

197
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,468
You will pay for this.

198
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:03,390
I will remember your soul
and I will get my revenge.

199
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,558
I know now.

200
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,481
The soul you are after is actually mine.

201
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:16,236
You desire to take revenge on me, not her.

202
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:22,242
You were a Monster
in your previous life and I killed you.

203
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,452
You should not have reincarnated
as a human,

204
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,121
but here you are.

205
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,918
That was also what the man
with the dark hole said.

206
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,129
He said I was a murderer

207
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,423
because I was a Monster
in my previous life.

208
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,221
Why was I born like this?

209
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,851
Does this mean I am not human?

210
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,524
Kill me with that sword of yours.

211
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,570
Please…

212
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,128
You are not a human, are you?

213
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,963
I knew it.

214
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,341
Seeing how you do not die,
you must be Bulgasal.

215
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,430
You have no soul so you live forever.

216
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,140
I envy you.

217
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,101
I wonder how that feels.

218
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,146
How does it feel?

219
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,317
I feel endless pain,
so how could you envy me?

220
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,652
This is the underworld.

221
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,488
This is hell!

222
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:49,329
Take this old man's soul, dear Bulgasal!

223
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:55,001
Or will I also turn into Bulgasal

224
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,879
if I ate your flesh?

225
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,961
If you go after that woman again

226
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,421
in your next life,

227
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,715
I will…

228
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,179
kill you then as well.

229
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,377
What should I do now?

230
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,381
Things have gotten quite complicated.

231
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,302
You finally became a human
after taking my soul.

232
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,889
But you also took my karma.

233
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,183
Hang in there.

234
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,689
Before a reincarnated Monster gets to you,

235
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,776
I will find you first.

236
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:49,133
YEAR 2006

237
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,352
You startled me.

238
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,564
My goodness. I thought you were a ghost.

239
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,774
Why are you so startled?

240
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,944
I mean, you suddenly came out of nowhere.

241
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,655
I have a weak heart,

242
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,824
so even the slightest scare
gets it racing.

243
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,410
Maybe I died
after seeing a ghost in my previous life.

244
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,121
That's understandable.
You were at that village after all.

245
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,038
Sorry?

246
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,547
Hey.

247
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,549
Take this and leave.

248
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,551
Stay away from the village for now.

249
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,302
Something terrible has happened!

250
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:37,223
By the way, you could have come
to the detective agency.

251
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,475
Why do we have
to always meet in spooky places?

252
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,686
It's quiet as a grave.

253
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,396
I don't like meeting people.

254
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,523
I have a social phobia.

255
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,157
You're looking

256
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,243
for a woman and a girl?

257
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,494
These are quite old.

258
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,372
They're the same person.
Please look for her.

259
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,208
What? But these are so old. How--

260
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,258
She probably hasn't changed.

261
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,438
YEAR 2006, SANGYONG CITY

262
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,251
Hey, what's wrong?

263
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:51,214
That car has been following me
ever since I left school.

264
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,258
No. Don't look.

265
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,345
Why not? Why is it following you?

266
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,013
Beats me.

267
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,058
That car followed me all the way here.

268
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,227
I even memorized the license plate.
It's 3847.

269
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,271
That's so pathetic.

270
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,525
You've been talking nonsense these days.
You remind me of your sister.

271
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,445
Hey, I agree
that Sang-yeon is a bit strange.

272
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,947
But I'm not like her.

273
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,366
We're totally different.

274
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,327
That's true. She was a top student.

275
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,578
Unlike you.

276
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,915
Are you kidding me?
I can do well if I want to.

277
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,333
I just don't.

278
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,711
But is she really
not coming back to school?

279
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,797
What does she do at home?

280
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,108
I don't know.
She stays in her room all day long.

281
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,277
She doesn't even clean or do the laundry.

282
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,071
When our mom's off to work,
I have to do everything at home.

283
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,574
She's so annoying.

284
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:09,208
But there's one thing she always tells me.

285
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,921
"If a stranger follows you,
run away as fast as you can."

286
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,682
What? He just left.

287
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,144
Seriously, that's so pathetic.

288
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,772
JEON BOUTIQUE

289
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,952
33G 3847

290
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,831
Dad, Grandma bought me these socks.

291
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,923
Sang-un, what's wrong?

292
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:44,637
A strange man was following me.

293
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,482
A strange man?

294
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:02,697
He was tailing me with his car,
so I ran away.

295
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,075
Did you see his face?
What did he look like?

296
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,327
I don't know.

297
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,581
He was wearing a hoodie. It was dark too.

298
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,876
I told you to always wear a mask outside.

299
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,795
It's suffocating.

300
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,465
Did he see your face?

301
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,178
Yes.

302
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:30,057
He got out of the car
and asked to see my shoulder.

303
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,643
He must have been some pervert.

304
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,984
Sang-yeon, what's wrong?

305
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,819
He…

306
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,488
BULGASAL

307
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,282
He's here.

308
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,478
I'm home.

309
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,981
Sorry for being late.

310
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,317
Work ended late.

311
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,363
Did you have cup noodles for dinner again?

312
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,449
Where are your sisters?

313
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,118
They left me here…

314
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,455
and went somewhere.

315
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,956
Where did they go?

316
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,832
Where are we going?

317
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,543
Bulgasal knows where we live.

318
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,170
We need to go where he can't find us.

319
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,463
Where is that?

320
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,883
And shouldn't we at least tell Mom?

321
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,385
She'd be worried.

322
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,812
Sang-yeon.

323
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,273
Sang-yeon.

324
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,900
-What is it?
-It feels like

325
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,904
a cockroach is crawling all over my body.

326
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,365
I'm getting goosebumps,
and my hands are trembling.

327
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,658
Look.

328
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:47,254
Sang-yeon, that bus driver
keeps following us.

329
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,214
Don't look at him.

330
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,090
Keep walking.

331
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,100
Don't follow us.

332
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,144
Sang-yeon.

333
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,437
I think I know you.

334
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,234
-I think I do.
-Keep following, and I'll kill you.

335
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,206
The smell of your soul.

336
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,751
The smell of your soul.

337
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,379
-Who are you?
-Sir.

338
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,423
-Why are you doing this? Go away!
-Who are you?

339
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,266
Hey, Han-su!

340
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,726
What's going on?

341
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,395
Hey.

342
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,439
-What are you doing?
-Stop it.

343
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,942
-Hey!
-Let me go!

344
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,695
-Get a grip!
-Get a hold of yourself!

345
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,699
Who was that man?

346
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,911
-Do you guys know each other?
-He wasn't human.

347
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,963
He may have reincarnated as a human,

348
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,757
but he used to be a Monster.

349
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,134
A Monster?

350
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,510
He's after my soul.

351
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,055
Your hands trembled
and you got goosebumps in the bus, right?

352
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,100
Yes. What was that about?

353
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,270
It means you recognize them as well.

354
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,106
You recognize those Monsters
from the past.

355
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,233
This won't be the last time you meet one.

356
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,068
-Next time--
-Have you always had

357
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,653
that knife with you?

358
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,240
Can't we report whatever it is

359
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,242
that's looking for you to the police?

360
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,036
The police are useless.

361
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,163
We can't trust them either.

362
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,499
Why is it looking for you?

363
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,046
It holds a grudge

364
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,965
from the past.
Specifically, from its previous life.

365
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,009
Previous life?
Are you still on about that?

366
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,053
I told you I remember.

367
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,347
But you don't believe me.

368
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,308
You know what?

369
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,394
Let's just go home.

370
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,688
We can't. It'll hunt us down.

371
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,024
That man you just saw
is nothing compared to it.

372
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,359
The most frightening thing

373
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,653
is Bulgasal.

374
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,363
Bulgasal? I don't care.

375
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,615
I'm going to call Mom
and ask her to pick us up!

376
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,535
That's why I told you not to go outside.

377
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,995
I told you to wear a mask.

378
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,831
Since we look the same,
you'd grab their attention.

379
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,709
If Bulgasal spots you, we'll both be dead!

380
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,674
Do you think I wanted to be your twin?

381
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,925
I never asked for this!

382
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,220
I didn't do anything,
so why should I run away as well?

383
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,807
I agree with my friends.
You're so strange.

384
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,141
I think you're insane!

385
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,852
Everything including Bulgasal is made up!

386
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,030
How much longer do we need to walk?

387
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,699
I'm hungry.

388
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,452
We're almost there. It's that house.

389
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,965
Whose house is this?

390
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,469
A longtime friend's.

391
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,721
She'll help us.

392
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,069
I told you I'd be back.

393
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,530
Is it you, sister?

394
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,159
Is it you?

395
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,745
It's…

396
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,164
It's you!

397
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,258
Sister?

398
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:59,167
Hey, are you done talking?
Can we leave now?

399
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,921
Stay here for the time being.
I have somewhere to go.

400
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,049
Are you telling me
to stay here without you?

401
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,262
Why?

402
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,639
Can't I just tag along?

403
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,309
That'll only put both of us in danger.

404
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,812
So listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

405
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:21,648
I don't want to hear it.
I'm going with you. Where's my bag?

406
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,152
Listen to me. Don't call our house.

407
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,029
You can never go back there.

408
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:31,241
If you don't listen to me,
your family will die because of you.

409
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,411
They're all going to die?

410
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,288
What do you mean by "your family"?

411
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,999
They're your family too.

412
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,626
Promise me you'll do as I say.

413
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:46,214
Promise me you won't go back there.
Answer me!

414
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,678
Fine. I promise.

415
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,515
It won't take long, right?

416
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,352
Be a good girl.

417
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,187
Where are you going?

418
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,569
I need to go back
and put an end to this karma.

419
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,322
This is my final chance.

420
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:14,326
I need to find the sword
that can kill Bulgasal.

421
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,619
The same sword…

422
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,081
that killed me 600 years ago.

423
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,845
She shouldn't have reincarnated like this.

424
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,402
Sang-un, where are you?

425
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,737
Are you okay?

426
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,075
Yes. I'm okay.

427
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,702
Is Sang-yeon with you?

428
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,747
No.

429
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,625
Not anymore.

430
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,669
She's not with me.

431
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:54,217
She said I shouldn't go back home.

432
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,597
She said our entire family would die

433
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,849
if I did.

434
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,479
I don't know what to do.

435
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,898
I'm scared.

436
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:11,151
Where are you?
I'll come pick you up, okay?

437
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,737
Where are you?

438
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,051
You can't go! Come back here.

439
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,763
Hurry up. Good grief. Come, now.

440
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:45,352
She told you not to go back home.

441
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,271
She said you'd die if you did.

442
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,443
You…

443
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,166
HAYONG BUS TERMINAL

444
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,511
33G 3847

445
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,287
Gosh, they're under construction again.

446
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,456
Let's go.

447
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,999
Where's Si-ho?

448
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,667
She's at her friend's.

449
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,669
You look after her tomorrow.

450
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,172
I'll look for Sang-yeon
first thing in the morning.

451
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,381
Okay.

452
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:48,308
APARTMENT STAIRS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

453
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,880
-Sang-yeon!
-Sang-yeon!

454
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,548
I told you not to come here.

455
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,718
Sang-yeon, look--

456
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,929
We have no time. Go somewhere else.

457
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,514
What's going on?

458
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,432
Tell me. I'll--

459
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,600
Stop it!

460
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:33,687
I'm not your daughter.

461
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:37,857
-Sang-yeon.
-Get out of here if you want to live.

462
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,661
Mom.

463
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,341
What is that sound?

464
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,261
Run.

465
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,598
Go.

466
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,566
Hello? There's…

467
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,068
There's something strange
in our apartment.

468
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,950
Well, I don't think it's a person.

469
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,705
If it comes in here,
go next door through this.

470
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,083
-Sang-yeon.
-What is it?

471
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,046
I have something to say.

472
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,550
I…

473
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,510
Well…

474
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,374
Who are you?

475
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,882
It's trying to get inside my apartment.
Please hurry!

476
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,599
Is it a dead end? What should we do?

477
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,977
Stop that!

478
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:43,191
Listen. I'll grab onto it
and buy you some time.

479
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,235
-Run away with your mom.
-What about you?

480
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,823
I'm done for. This was my final chance.

481
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,407
Final chance for what?

482
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,286
I won't reincarnate anymore.

483
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,040
Stop that! The police are coming!

484
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:03,253
Go hide in that room
while I buy you some time.

485
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:06,381
No. I'll protect you two.

486
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,549
I will.

487
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,135
So go hide in your room.

488
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,017
Hide in here. Hurry.

489
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,018
No.

490
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,687
We have no time.

491
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,817
Don't come out of there.

492
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,069
I don't want to be alone.

493
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,618
Listen carefully. You have to live.

494
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,329
Live in hiding, and don't trust anyone.

495
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,247
And…

496
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,001
look for a way to kill Bulgasal.

497
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:46,087
How? How do I look for it?

498
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,465
You'll recognize it.

499
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,759
It's…

500
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,225
Get out of my house!

501
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,144
Get out!

502
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,108
Sang-yeon!

503
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,320
Sang-yeon!

504
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,881
Run.

505
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,543
How could something like this happen?

506
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:50,670
-The police are here.
-It happened up there?

507
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,326
She's alive.

508
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,911
One of them is alive!

509
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,226
Where is your younger sister?

510
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,733
Can you tell me

511
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,027
what happened?

512
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,414
Excuse me.

513
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:10,917
Min Sang-un.

514
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:16,381
Do you remember the culprit's face?

515
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,911
Mom.

516
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,748
Sang-yeon.

517
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,718
Listen carefully. You have to live.

518
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,262
Live in hiding, and don't trust anyone.

519
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:08,349
And look for a way to kill Bulgasal.

520
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,262
PATIENT NAME: MIN SANG-UN

521
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,834
Please…

522
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,421
let us live here.

523
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:40,316
15 YEARS LATER, PRESENT DAY

524
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,688
Who are you?

525
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,695
Oh, I'm looking for someone.

526
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:31,951
Didn't two sisters live here?

527
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,746
-The older sister's name is Min Sang-un.
-Min Sang-un?

528
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,624
I don't recognize that name.

529
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,545
But two sisters did live here
with their grandma.

530
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,589
Where are they now?

531
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:47,133
All three of them vanished into thin air.

532
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:50,595
They ran away in the middle of the night
as if loan sharks were after them.

533
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,932
By the way, who are you?

534
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:56,809
Why are you--

535
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,103
Sang-un is someone I know very well.

536
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,688
I've known her for a long time.

537
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,317
How was she?

538
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,361
She was…

539
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,116
Hyeon-ju.

540
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,452
That's your name, right?

541
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:58,454
You should take a breather.

542
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,790
I'm all done.

543
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:04,043
I heard you're a laundry plant rookie.
Isn't it tough?

544
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,837
Geez. This is a cakewalk.

545
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,298
I've worked all sorts of jobs,
and this is nothing.

546
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,508
Goodness.

547
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,009
She's incredible.

548
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:14,637
Come join us.

549
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,721
Coming.

550
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,183
Gosh, it's hot.

551
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,228
Do you live in Sangyong City?

552
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,855
I do. I recently moved here.

553
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:28,442
I must have itchy feet.
I move around a lot.

554
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,735
Are you married?

555
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:33,197
Goodness. Of course. I must look young.

556
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,283
Then what does your husband do?
Why are you here?

557
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:39,161
All husbands are the same.
He's jobless and at home.

558
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,454
Is he?

559
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:44,250
I guess all husbands, no matter their age,
are a pain in the neck.

560
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,420
I agree. He may look like a grown-up,
but he's still a kid.

561
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,796
Who eats a lot.

562
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,840
And likes to spend money.

563
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:58,222
Oh, right. I'd like to take
today's night shift off.

564
01:06:58,723 --> 01:06:59,682
Would that be okay?

565
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:03,144
What's gotten into you?
You always worked day in, day out.

566
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,772
I need to head home early today.

567
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:07,773
What for?

568
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:09,984
Is it your wedding anniversary?

569
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,111
I guess they're still newlyweds.

570
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,029
Right!

571
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:15,656
Not really.

572
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,451
Today's just a special day.

573
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,370
What kind of a special day?
She's piqued my curiosity.

574
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,457
Gosh, you're always curious
about things. I just don't get it.

575
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,792
I just want to know what today is.

576
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:46,312
WE DEMAND A CLEAR RELOCATION PLAN
FROM THE CONSTRUCTOR!

577
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:57,239
EUNBAEK APARTMENT IS OFF LIMITS
DUE TO DEMOLITION WORK

578
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,729
Hide in here. Hurry.

579
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:29,772
No.

580
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,690
We have no time.

581
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:35,653
No. I'll protect you two.

582
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,279
I will.

583
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,825
Stop that! The police are coming!

584
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:48,666
Sang-un, don't forget what I told you.

585
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:50,334
Sang-yeon!

586
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,795
Sang-yeon!

587
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,643
-Sang-yeon.
-What is it?

588
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,565
I have something to say.

589
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:57,234
I couldn't tell you…

590
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,327
that I was sorry…

591
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:09,580
for not believing you.

592
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:13,584
You're so strange. I think you're insane!

593
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,087
I'm sorry for calling you insane.

594
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,848
I wanted to come one last time

595
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:31,143
before they demolished this place.

596
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:37,233
Today's the day you and Mom died.

597
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:42,988
I'm sorry, Sang-yeon.

598
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:47,993
It took me…

599
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,081
fifteen years to come back here.

600
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,419
I'm sorry.

601
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:04,260
I've been doing as you told me to.

602
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,683
Listen carefully. You have to live.

603
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,101
Live in hiding.

604
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,437
I survived.

605
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,275
And I'm still living in hiding.

606
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:20,859
And don't trust anyone.

607
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,323
I don't trust anyone.

608
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:29,410
And look for a way to kill Bulgasal.

609
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,372
But Sang-yeon…

610
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:36,375
You'll recognize it. It's…

611
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,711
I don't remember what you said after that.

612
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:42,631
It must have been important.

613
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:49,888
But I can't remember.

614
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,603
I'm sorry.

615
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,732
What in the world is Bulgasal?

616
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:09,194
Why have you been searching
for Min Sang-un for the past 15 years?

617
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:13,490
Why are you Monsters
trying so hard to kill me?

618
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:15,033
It was you, wasn't it?

619
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:20,831
Stay away, you murderer!

620
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,666
Where are you going?

621
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,170
I finally found you.

622
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,551
