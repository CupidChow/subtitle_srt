EPISODE 12

2
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,627
This is the end of the valley,
but I don't see Ok Eul-tae.

3
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,631
Maybe he's already left the mountain.

4
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,677
This was my chance to kill him,
but I made a mistake from the start.

5
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,555
I shouldn't have lost him
when we fell into the water.

6
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,599
Let's search again.

7
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,061
Let's go.

8
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,369
This won't do.

9
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,539
You'll collapse before we even find him.

10
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,583
Sit down. Let's rest.

11
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,961
Come on.

12
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,677
Let me see the wound.

13
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,513
I'm okay. We're running out of time.

14
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,932
This is our chance to get him.

15
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,269
He's probably weak from the blood loss.

16
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,271
What will you do with him?

17
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,981
I'll kill him.

18
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,359
That means you'll die as well.

19
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,488
How do you know that?

20
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,657
Si-ho looked into my past life

21
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,076
and heard Kim Hwa-yeon say so.

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,661
She said in order to kill Ok Eul-tae,

23
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,330
you have to die as well.

24
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,171
So even if you do find him,
don't kill him.

25
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,298
Lock him up in that well.

26
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,217
Let's find him first.

27
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,677
Don't change the subject.

28
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,805
Promise me.
Tell me you won't die with him.

29
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,684
Why won't you answer?

30
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,439
Fine.

31
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,987
It's Si-ho.

32
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,784
Hey, Si-ho.

33
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,788
Hey, how did it go? Did you find Hwal?

34
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,583
Yes. He's with me right now.

35
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,045
-Then come home right now.
-We can't go right now.

36
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,924
I can't tell you the details.
I won't. You understand, right?

37
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,967
Anyway, we're both okay.

38
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,095
Sang-un, you do understand

39
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,681
what Kim Hwa-yeon said, right?

40
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,184
You shouldn't trust Hwal either.

41
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,518
You know that, right?

42
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,438
I do. Don't worry.

43
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,732
Is everything okay there?

44
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,860
Yes. Everything's fine.
Don't worry about us.

45
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,403
Okay.

46
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,454
What is it?

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,623
Is something wrong over there?

48
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,877
No, she just called to check up on us.

49
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,017
How did it go?

50
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,603
She won't tell me the details.

51
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,605
She just said Hwal was okay.

52
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,859
What a load of nonsense.
I bet he was beaten to a pulp.

53
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:43,116
Why did Sang-un go there?
Ok Eul-tae could have taken her.

54
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,201
She found a way to kill him.

55
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,453
-She did?
-What is it?

56
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,791
Well, it's…

57
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,335
Tell us already. What is it?

58
00:04:56,087 --> 00:05:00,341
Both Bulgasals have to die
at the same time.

59
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,427
They're the swords
that can kill each other.

60
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,722
So in order to kill Ok Eul-tae,

61
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,433
Hwal needs to die as well?

62
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,852
Don't be ridiculous.

63
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,813
Elaborate. Is he right?

64
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,483
Please calm down.
Sang-un went there to dissuade Hwal.

65
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,570
So that he wouldn't die with Ok Eul-tae.

66
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,700
What are you talking about?

67
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,995
Hwal has to die?

68
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,109
1,000 YEARS AGO

69
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,611
Try getting up.

70
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,954
Please tell me.

71
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,919
I have always wanted to become like you.

72
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,838
I have been waiting all this time.

73
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,592
Even those of low birth live well.

74
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:31,474
So how could someone as noble as me
remain sickly until the day he dies?

75
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,936
Isn't that too unfair?

76
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:41,400
So please tell me.
What do I have to do to become like you?

77
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,363
What?

78
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,075
Gosh, what are you doing?

79
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,081
What? We should stay together.
Ok Eul-tae could come at any moment.

80
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,791
No, thank you. I'll be fine.

81
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,959
Where are you going?

82
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,211
I mean…

83
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,006
This isn't the only room in this house.

84
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,592
Don't you know that men and women
should keep some distance at night?

85
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,635
Wasn't that the norm back in your day?

86
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,679
That was ages ago.

87
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,223
I'm doing this for my convenience.

88
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,269
Or would you feel better if I stayed
outside your door like I did before?

89
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,786
Stop tossing around and go to sleep.

90
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,622
Is it because of your nightmares?

91
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:23,628
No. That's not why.
I just feel a bit uncomfortable.

92
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,214
Why? Because of me?

93
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,426
Isn't that obvious?

94
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,678
We've slept together before.

95
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,432
You better not say that to anyone else.

96
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,101
We didn't sleep together.
We just slept in the same room.

97
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,812
Sharing a room sounds weirder.

98
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,398
It does if you say it like that!

99
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,568
I'm going to sleep now.

100
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,197
I feel more tired after talking with you.

101
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,421
I smell instant noodles.

102
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,510
-But have you ever made that before?
-No.

103
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,180
Aren't these the instructions?

104
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,184
That's right.
I could have cooked instead, you know?

105
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,270
I don't want you to burn down the house.

106
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,359
You know what?
It's nice that someone's cooking for me.

107
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,996
That's a lot of water.

108
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,623
Thank you.

109
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,313
Why are you staring at me?

110
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:07,898
It's good.

111
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,069
Do you have something to say?

112
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,909
I'm bothered by what you said
back at the mountain.

113
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,079
Do you have feelings for me?

114
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,125
That was out of the blue.

115
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,381
What are you suddenly talking about?

116
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,593
You said you didn't want me to die.
You wanted Ok Eul-tae to die,

117
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,597
but you were scared that I'd die too.
What else did you say?

118
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,807
That I was more important
than your revenge.

119
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,142
That everything was ruined.

120
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,228
Is that how you interpreted it?

121
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,522
Well, I guess you're right then.

122
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,069
Why did you fall for me?

123
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,033
I'm not sure.

124
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,242
Since when?

125
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,161
I don't know!

126
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,039
Is this something
I should be interrogated about?

127
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,500
That's because…

128
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,340
there's no way you'd ever like me.

129
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,844
-Why not?
-I don't know.

130
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,555
So tell me the reason why you do.

131
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,393
Well…

132
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,437
If you want a reason…

133
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,022
Right.

134
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,691
Because you helped me.

135
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,486
I was going to kill you.

136
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,987
But you didn't.

137
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,491
I told you I temporarily spared
your life because of my soul.

138
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,452
Still, I know you hesitated
from time to time.

139
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,125
Because deep down, you have a good heart.

140
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,961
Maybe that's why I like you. Happy?

141
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,630
No. I still don't get it.

142
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,715
No one ever said
I was good-hearted either.

143
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,426
And I'm not.

144
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,222
You're the good-hearted one.
You care about those around you.

145
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,893
But that doesn't make me like you.

146
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,688
Well…

147
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,774
Okay.

148
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,235
Can we please stop talking about this?

149
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,238
Goodness. I'd like to eat.

150
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,490
I think I might get indigestion.

151
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,834
But did something happen to you
during the past 600 years?

152
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,588
I said I liked you, but you started
interrogating and suspecting me.

153
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,890
It's just that
no one has ever liked me before.

154
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,355
Even my own wife disliked me.

155
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,400
That's because of your temper.

156
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,195
You're right.

157
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:13,959
What are you doing?

158
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,670
I don't know why I like you,

159
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,797
but I know one thing for sure.

160
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,510
I don't want you to die.

161
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,305
So let's go back to our old selves.

162
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,307
I'll return your soul

163
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,018
and become Bulgasal again.

164
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,730
Why all of a sudden?

165
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,816
I know once you find Ok Eul-tae
you're planning to die with him.

166
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,653
But I won't allow that.

167
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,572
Then will you turn into Bulgasal
and die with him instead?

168
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,701
I'd rather do that.

169
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,996
Because I was Bulgasal to begin with.

170
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,792
So you don't need to sacrifice yourself.

171
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,544
I never thought of it that way.

172
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,337
It's something I have to do.

173
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,841
You, Si-ho, and Do-yun
can't live in hiding forever.

174
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,427
I don't want to live
if it means you have to die.

175
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,263
No one…

176
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,723
wants that.

177
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,729
I'll handle Ok Eul-tae on my own.

178
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,200
Let's go back to our old selves.

179
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,786
I'm sorry…

180
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,082
for dragging you
into this mess I have with Ok Eul-tae

181
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,753
and for making you suffer
for the past 600 years.

182
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,840
I'm truly sorry.

183
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:49,430
Live an ordinary life
with the son you had lost.

184
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,883
I don't know how to live
as a human anymore.

185
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,094
So how can I become one again?

186
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,349
-But--
-You took my soul as you wished,

187
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,850
so I'll do the same.

188
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,269
What will happen to Si-ho if you die?

189
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,229
Then if you die,

190
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,398
what will happen to Do-yun?

191
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,906
Enough of this nonsense.
Let's get some rest.

192
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,129
No. I'll protect you two.

193
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,714
I will. Who are you?

194
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,740
Do-yun.

195
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,910
Why are you up so late
when you still need to recover?

196
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,254
That's refreshing.

197
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,799
I need protein after working out.

198
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,342
I'm rejuvenated now.

199
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,387
All right, so just hurry and get better.

200
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,599
Why are you here at this hour?
And what's all that?

201
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,644
Hey, I'm going to sleep here tonight.
That's okay, right?

202
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,980
Sure. Suit yourself.

203
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,153
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

204
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,821
Well…

205
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,490
I couldn't sleep
and I had things on my mind.

206
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,201
Like what?

207
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,411
Well…

208
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,331
Do you think Hwal will really
kill himself with Ok Eul-tae?

209
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,624
How can I sleep

210
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,835
when he's going through that?

211
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,840
Do you like him?

212
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,924
What?

213
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,179
Well, I guess he can be likable.

214
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,390
Gosh, he's won your heart.

215
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,976
The spy has fallen in love.

216
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,312
Whatever. You're the one who asked.

217
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,355
But why did you ask?

218
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,690
Do you not like him?

219
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,610
I don't dislike him.

220
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,614
But I don't like him either. I don't know.

221
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,409
Every time I look at him,

222
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,370
I feel uneasy.

223
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,791
It feels like something bad will happen.

224
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,925
It was for you.

225
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,427
I did it for you!

226
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,807
To turn you into Bulgasal.

227
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,809
You asked me to turn you into Bulgasal

228
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,228
a thousand years ago.

229
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,484
What are you doing here?

230
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,612
I keep thinking about
what Ok Eul-tae said to me.

231
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,573
What did he say this time?

232
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,628
Don't think about it. Just ignore him.

233
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,924
You can't trust him.

234
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,885
He even blamed me for killing your family.

235
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,722
So don't listen to anything he says.

236
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,016
I know.

237
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,353
But he's the only one
who remembers everything.

238
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,356
What happened 600 years ago
and even before that.

239
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:16,113
I often dreamed
about you stabbing my hand.

240
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,658
But I think it's actually a memory.

241
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,578
And when I found you
at that laundry plant,

242
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,038
I recalled something else.

243
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,626
I'm certain it was a memory.

244
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,755
Ok Eul-tae also said
that it all began, not 600 years ago,

245
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,215
but 1,000 years ago.

246
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,139
There's something that we can't recall.

247
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,643
I need to find out why
you gave me Bulgasal's curse,

248
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,939
how our ill-fated relationship
began 1,000 years ago,

249
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,151
and what kind of person I really was.

250
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,834
Why the long faces?

251
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,711
It's a sunny day.

252
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,172
We were basking in the sun.

253
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,173
Sero…

254
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,841
Something.

255
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,593
We heard it's good for depression.

256
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,180
Are you okay?

257
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,849
I'm okay.

258
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,603
I think Ms. Lee is more upset than I am.

259
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,481
She's very upset with Hwal.

260
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,943
But none of you have to worry.

261
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,237
Hwal won't die that easily.

262
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,196
Why not?

263
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:44,117
As you know,
Ok Eul-tae is extremely cunning.

264
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,746
He won't get caught that easily
which means Hwal will be safe too.

265
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,624
I see. You're right.

266
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,918
They're jagangducheon!

267
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,544
JAGANGDUCHEON: SHORT FOR
TWO CONCEITED BATTLING GENIUSES

268
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,963
What? Jagangducheon?

269
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,799
No, this isn't something
to be happy about.

270
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,384
Can I have a word with you?

271
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,219
Over there.

272
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,553
What?

273
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,973
What is it? I want to hear it too.

274
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,599
Forget it.

275
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,651
What is it? What's wrong?

276
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,070
Well…

277
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,991
I recall you saying
that Bulgasal were scary beings.

278
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,450
That's right.

279
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,788
Does that mean Hwal could also turn
into something scary like Ok Eul-tae?

280
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,166
Why are you asking me this
all of a sudden?

281
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,501
I'm just anxious.

282
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,088
I don't know if I can trust him.

283
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,590
I'm not sure if he's a good person.

284
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,929
You also said before
that you couldn't trust him.

285
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,141
Well, that was because…

286
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,396
What?

287
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,818
What's going on? Are you back for good?

288
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,946
No, we're just stopping by.

289
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,659
I have a favor to ask.

290
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,994
A favor?

291
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,165
Hwal!

292
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,166
Over here!

293
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,252
Hwal.

294
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,796
We need to talk.

295
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,431
What? What is it?

296
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,602
What's your plan?

297
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,437
I wouldn't have let you go alone

298
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,314
had I known about your outrageous plan.

299
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,191
What do you mean?

300
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,820
I know what you need
to do to kill Ok Eul-tae.

301
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,288
Turn Sang-un back
into Bulgasal this instant.

302
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:56,583
-What?
-She was Bulgasal to begin with.

303
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,461
Let them sort this matter out themselves.

304
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,462
You stay out of it!

305
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,588
I can't do that.

306
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,048
-Why not?
-Because…

307
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,557
Your original plan was
to retrieve your soul from her.

308
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,478
So take it back right now
and never see her again. Okay?

309
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,483
Don't tell me…

310
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,529
you're going to sacrifice
your life for her.

311
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,743
Has living together made her grow on you?

312
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,495
What's gotten into you?

313
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,997
That's not why. She's…

314
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,671
Dan Sol's only family.

315
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,966
Sol will be heartbroken if she dies.

316
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,720
Is that your excuse?

317
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,515
Then what about me?

318
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,101
You're my family.

319
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,354
I may have been harsh on you but…

320
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,485
When I was little,

321
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,280
I considered you my father.

322
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,199
As I grew older…

323
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,080
you became an uncle,
and then an older brother.

324
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,002
And now that I'm older than you,

325
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,880
I think of you as my son.

326
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,344
So don't die in her place.

327
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,516
Call me cold-hearted for all I care.

328
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,186
You're my one and only family.

329
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,946
Mr. Dan…

330
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,253
Mr. Dan.

331
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,298
Please don't die.

332
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,687
Please don't die, Mr. Dan.

333
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,533
You want to retrieve your memory
from 1,000 years ago?

334
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,412
Yes. Since you can read a soul's memory,

335
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:43,667
maybe you can read that far back too.

336
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,587
Well, I've never gone that far before.

337
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,464
But why?

338
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,717
Hwal wants to check something.

339
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,429
He said we also met 1,000 years ago.

340
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,308
And that was when it all began.

341
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,687
If it's too much to handle,
you don't need to do it.

342
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,691
No. I want to give it a try.

343
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,567
I'm curious too.

344
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:14,739
I want to know
why Kim Hwa-yeon wanted to kill him.

345
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,912
Hey, you're here.

346
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,164
Is Ms. Lee very upset?

347
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,792
No, it was nothing serious.

348
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,671
Sang-un told me that you want to know

349
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,091
what happened 1,000 years ago.

350
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:36,052
Do you think you can do it?
It could take a toll on your body.

351
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,972
It's okay. I'll give it a try.

352
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,126
I have to kill both Bulgasals.

353
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,587
I have to kill them.

354
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,341
Are you okay? Let me see.

355
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,438
Who are you?

356
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,943
What? It's Hwa-yeon.

357
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,197
Come on. Let's go inside.

358
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,745
Don't look.

359
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,373
You shouldn't look at past lives.

360
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,751
Hye-seok, what are you talking about?

361
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,212
Go back!

362
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,430
What are you doing? Let go of her.

363
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,058
You shouldn't look at
this soul's past lives.

364
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,434
Everyone will die if you do.

365
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,062
Once the memories are recalled,
everyone will die.

366
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,773
So go back and never come here again!

367
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,233
Leave!

368
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,860
Si-ho.

369
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,199
She told me to go back.
She said I shouldn't look at the past.

370
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,200
Who said that?

371
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,412
Ms. Lee.

372
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,502
That little girl you saved
from the fire told me

373
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,879
that once we retrieved the memories,

374
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,674
everyone would die.

375
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,391
Si-ho. Your hand.

376
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,737
You're already leaving again?

377
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,989
What a waste of gas.

378
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,323
You know I have to go.

379
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,871
Why are you so quiet?
You were worried sick about him.

380
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,038
What?

381
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,000
When was I worried sick?

382
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,502
You're always overreacting, you know that?

383
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,880
What is it? Do you have something to say?

384
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,550
Can we go back to the old house with you?

385
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,718
No.

386
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,053
He's right. You'll only get in the way.

387
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,348
Come on. You're so harsh.
Am I a burden or something?

388
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,227
Look. Is there anything I can do?

389
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,230
It feels suffocating to stay here.

390
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,523
-Maybe I should come--
-No.

391
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,360
He's right. You'll also get in the way.

392
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,490
You little brat. I was lenient with you
because you were injured

393
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,367
and even cut you some slack
when you were a spy.

394
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,952
This is really upsetting.

395
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,621
What? Upsetting?

396
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,414
Do you even know how that feels?

397
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,583
No, I don't. So?

398
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,751
-I knew it.
-So what?

399
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,461
Where's Hye-seok?

400
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:01,132
She doesn't want to see you,
so she won't come out.

401
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,719
You should be lying down.

402
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,430
I'm okay.
I was only dizzy for a little bit.

403
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,517
But do you have to go too?

404
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,812
I should keep an eye on him
so he won't do anything reckless.

405
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,230
Don't worry.

406
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,690
How could I not
when you're acting like this?

407
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,108
You always say that.

408
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,070
Here.

409
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,533
What is this?

410
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,369
Side dishes. I know there's no food there.

411
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,621
They're from Ms. Lee.

412
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,040
And she said she's sorry.

413
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,668
What? For what?

414
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,586
I don't know either.

415
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,966
Tell her I said thank you.

416
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,435
Ms. Lee, what are you doing?

417
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,819
Hwal and Sang-un have left.

418
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,905
Right. She thanked you
for the side dishes.

419
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,534
Did you and Hwal argue?

420
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,416
You still should've seen them off.

421
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,173
Ms. Lee, what are you wiping?
Let me do it.

422
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,052
They should not have crossed paths again.

423
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,307
-They should not have met again.
-What?

424
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,933
They shouldn't have met.

425
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,937
It's starting again.
It will happen once more.

426
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,689
What do you mean?

427
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,983
They should not have crossed paths again.

428
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,902
-It's starting again.
-Ms. Lee.

429
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,737
-Ms. Lee!
-Yes? What?

430
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,907
You mumbled something odd.

431
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,743
I did? I was wiping the floor.

432
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,495
You said they shouldn't have met

433
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,624
and that it would start again.

434
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,042
What did you mean?

435
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,214
I thought Si-ho
would have been able to see.

436
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,634
But we failed.

437
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,762
-I guess so.
-But are you really not going to tell me?

438
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,015
About what?

439
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,351
About what Ok Eul-tae said.

440
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,562
You're shaken by what he said.

441
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,484
You're so tight-lipped.

442
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,444
How stubborn.

443
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,656
Then what's your plan now?

444
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,325
We don't know
what happened 1,000 years ago.

445
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,702
There's still another way.

446
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,036
Be quiet and I'll spare you.

447
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,037
Yes, sir.

448
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,292
Where is Ok Eul-tae?

449
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,170
He's not here.
He hasn't returned since yesterday.

450
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,639
DAN HWAL

451
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,086
He's still at the mountain?

452
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,963
I'm certain he's still there.

453
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,299
He's lost too much blood to get away.

454
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,635
I'm sure he's there.

455
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,679
This is our opportunity to get him.

456
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,457
You know what to do, right? Wait here.

457
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,200
OK EUL-TAE

458
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,419
I guess Bulgasal can be pretty weak too.

459
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,048
The terrifying and immortal Bulgasal

460
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,300
looks like a corpse now.

461
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,846
That's because I'm only half Bulgasal.

462
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:14,268
Are you here to end me?

463
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,145
Yes.

464
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,230
But I have a question before that.

465
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,025
Depending on your answer,
you could end up in the well alone,

466
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,069
or I, the root of all this,

467
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,529
could die with you right here.

468
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,865
I came here to make that decision.

469
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,951
So tell me everything you know.

470
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,829
What kind of person was I 1,000 years ago?

471
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,499
Why did I ask you
to turn me into Bulgasal?

472
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,169
Why did Min Sang-un
give me Bulgasal's curse?

473
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,090
Then kill her for me.

474
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:45,966
What?

475
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,470
I'll tell you everything
after you kill her.

476
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,432
I'll tell you everything you don't know.

477
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:58,437
Kill her and bring her body to me.

478
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,151
You're not in your right mind.

479
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,738
You're still obsessed with her
despite being on the brink of death.

480
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,658
She's been running away from us
for the past 600 years.

481
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,869
It's time to let her go now.

482
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,789
You're the one
who's not in your right mind.

483
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,876
What is she to you?

484
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,338
Do you even know what she did to you

485
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:29,176
a thousand years ago?

486
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,053
I don't care.

487
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,140
I may have wanted
to kill her when she was Bulgasal,

488
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,560
but I want to save the person she is now.

489
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,941
You made the same choice 1,000 years ago.

490
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,529
And after all that she's done to you,
here you are again.

491
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,908
Your damned one-sided love.

492
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,705
Aren't you sick of it?

493
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,542
What are you talking about?

494
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:06,338
In the end, she will end you for good.

495
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,259
She will ruin everything for you.

496
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,470
Fine.

497
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:16,807
I won't expect anything from you anymore.

498
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,478
Since you have chosen her over me,

499
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:25,357
I will take everything you have
the next time we meet.

500
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,903
Even your son, your father, and your wife.

501
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,906
I will kill everyone you cherish.

502
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,164
Okay. Do as you wish.

503
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:44,293
Stab my heart or cut it out if you want.

504
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,128
But you better hurry.

505
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,214
There's not much time left.

506
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,051
No. I have plenty of time.

507
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,219
You're wrong.

508
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,721
You're running out of time.

509
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,043
You're not allowed to park here.

510
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,255
Oh, really? I won't be here for long.

511
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,465
I'll leave soon.

512
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,846
Please step out of the car
and show me your ID card.

513
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,432
Why? I wasn't going to stay here for long.

514
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,685
Then I'll just leave right now.

515
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,186
You're Min Sang-un, aren't you?

516
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,107
I'm running out of time? What do you mean?

517
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,818
I called one of my men.

518
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,155
I thought you'd come back

519
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,033
with Min Sang-un,

520
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,744
the woman you never leave behind.

521
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,469
Who are you?

522
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,814
I said I'd kill everyone you cherished.

523
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,865
Don't go.

524
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,992
Don't go.

525
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,452
Don't go.

526
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,456
Just…

527
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,541
Just…

528
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,544
let her go.

529
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,297
Focus on me.

530
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,883
Focus on me.

531
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:00,262
This is your chance to kill me.

532
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:04,642
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

533
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,688
So let go of her and come to me.

534
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:16,028
Please don't go.
Let go of her and come to me.

535
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,531
Don't go…

536
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,959
Don't go…

537
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:51,980
Are you okay?

538
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,654
You were stabbed.

539
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,697
It's not that serious.

540
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,658
I'm okay.

541
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,034
You bled a lot.

542
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,954
This isn't my blood.

543
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,707
I think I stabbed…

544
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,836
someone.

545
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,474
He's gone.

546
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,811
He left me behind.

547
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,440
He abandoned me.

548
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,816
Chairman Ok.

549
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:41,947
What about Min Sang-un?

550
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,366
Is she dead?

551
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:46,827
No, sir.

552
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,246
She attacked me.

553
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,581
You were attacked?

554
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,499
She suddenly became strong.

555
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,918
She wasn't herself.

556
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,587
Is that so?

557
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,089
I'm sorry, sir.

558
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,716
I see.

559
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,053
Come here and help me up.

560
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,349
Hurry.

561
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:10,851
It's okay.

562
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,897
Help me up right now.

563
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,440
Come on.

564
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,354
I may have wanted
to kill her when she was Bulgasal,

565
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:59,274
but I want to save the person she is now.

566
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:32,808
Let me see.

567
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,525
Are you okay?
Are you really not going to the hospital?

568
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,779
If I do,
I'll have to go with Detective Kwon.

569
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,198
Then Si-ho will find out.

570
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,908
I don't want her to worry.

571
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,122
And this isn't that bad anyway.

572
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,501
We need to stitch it up
to stop the bleeding.

573
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,587
Can you do it?

574
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:05,215
I've done all sorts of things
for the past 600 years.

575
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,595
But I can't guarantee
that it'll look pretty.

576
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,767
That's okay.
I have no one to show it to anyway.

577
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:28,905
Do you think

578
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,366
that cop will be okay?

579
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,580
Don't feel guilty about it.
It was self-defense.

580
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,587
But I stabbed a man.

581
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,715
He attacked you first. You could've died.

582
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,675
I did it involuntarily.

583
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,054
What do you mean?

584
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,513
I don't remember much

585
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,016
after getting stabbed.

586
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,895
When I came to…

587
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,900
I was holding the knife.

588
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,780
This happened once before.

589
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,783
I felt like a lunatic.

590
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,244
You did well.

591
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,166
I don't care if you went crazy.

592
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,001
Just don't die.

593
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,713
I would've put Ok Eul-tae in the well
if I knew this would happen.

594
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,384
Did you see him?

595
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,469
I thought you didn't.

596
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,597
Why didn't you do it?

597
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,392
I don't know.

598
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,896
I couldn't think straight.

599
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,816
Because I was worried you might die.

600
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,866
Let's treat your wound first.

601
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,945
I don't know why I like you,

602
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,906
but I know one thing for sure.

603
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,992
I don't want you to die.

604
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,873
I'm sorry…

605
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:29,044
for dragging you
into this mess I have with Ok Eul-tae

606
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:33,173
and for making you suffer
for the past 600 years.

607
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:35,801
I'm truly sorry.

608
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,976
SI-HO

609
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:51,817
Sang-un?

610
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,486
It's me, Hwal.

611
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,280
I see. Where's my sister?

612
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,283
She wasn't feeling well,
so she went to bed.

613
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,744
What? How is she not feeling well?

614
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,287
I'll tell her to call when she wakes up.

615
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,706
How are you guys doing?

616
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,624
Not good.

617
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,335
We're safe here,

618
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,504
so that makes us
more worried about you two.

619
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,467
You may be worried, but I'm at ease.

620
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,427
So stay there for now.

621
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,137
-What?
-I'm hanging up.

622
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,472
Wait.

623
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,520
Please take good care…

624
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,690
of Sang-un.

625
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,484
Why are you suddenly--

626
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,319
Please don't betray her.

627
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,238
Keep her safe until the end.

628
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,866
And take care…

629
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,994
of yourself too.

630
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,497
I wanted to tell you that.

631
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,042
I'll hang up now.

632
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,142
Did you speak with Sang-un?

633
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:08,602
No.

634
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,230
She wasn't feeling well,
so she went to bed early.

635
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,150
I wonder what's wrong. It's worrying me.

636
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,070
-Detective Kwon--
-No.

637
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,698
I refuse.

638
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,701
I didn't even ask yet.

639
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,288
You obviously want to go there.

640
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,498
Ok Eul-tae is still alive and well.

641
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,876
You'll only get in the way.

642
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:36,171
Come on. We'll make sure
we don't get in the way.

643
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,631
Why are you coming?

644
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,926
You should stay here.
It's too dangerous for you.

645
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,802
Gosh, what a traitor.

646
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,889
-You're going there alone?
-Of course.

647
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,099
Don't be ridiculous.

648
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,519
Hwal told me to make sure
no one left this house.

649
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:55,148
I see. So you're his henchman?

650
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,734
What did you say?

651
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,320
Sang-un isn't feeling well.

652
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:05,325
Instead of staying here and worrying,
let me just go there.

653
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,409
Come on.

654
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,829
They wouldn't like that.

655
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,209
No. This won't do.

656
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:17,253
-I can't do this anymore.
-What's wrong with her?

657
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,380
Wait.

658
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:21,633
She's prophesying like she did before.

659
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:22,759
I can't do this.

660
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,594
-Ms. Lee, are you okay?
-I can't.

661
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,972
I can't do this.

662
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:28,765
Damn it, I just can't!

663
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,101
I'm feeling suffocated in here.

664
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,103
I'm not the type to sit still and worry.

665
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,856
Plus, there's no TV here.
All I see are trees and mountains.

666
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,733
Everything is so green.

667
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,696
Who cares about Ok Eul-tae?
I'm getting out of here. Pack up.

668
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,031
Hey, let's go.

669
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,575
Awesome.

670
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,702
-She's amazing.
-Hey.

671
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,162
-Hey, guys.
-She's so my type.

672
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,539
She's my role model.

673
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:11,850
Are you up?

674
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,854
How long was I asleep?

675
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,480
About three to four hours.

676
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,358
Sleep more if you want to get better soon.

677
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,568
I'm thirsty.

678
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,361
Hold on.

679
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:28,992
Here.

680
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:30,910
Thank you.

681
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,719
What is it?

682
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,891
You don't have a fever.

683
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:58,980
You know, you did the same thing
when Do-yun got hurt too.

684
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,274
You treat us well when we're injured.

685
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:02,984
I should get hurt more often.

686
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,531
I'll treat you well
even if you're not injured.

687
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:11,576
So don't get hurt.

688
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:16,122
Okay. I was just teasing you.

689
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,796
Did you wipe the blood off my body?

690
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,381
Yes. Just where I could see.

691
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,261
I'm still wearing the same clothes.

692
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:40,897
What's wrong? What is it?
Why are you following me?

693
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,525
Let me help you change.
It won't be easy to do it alone.

694
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,112
It's okay. I can do it myself.

695
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,281
Stay here.

696
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,016
What are you doing?

697
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,270
There's blood in my hair.

698
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:06,065
I want to wash it off
but I'm having trouble.

699
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,818
You can do that later.

700
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,196
It's blood. It feels unpleasant.

701
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,744
Okay. Sit here.

702
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,377
What are you going to do?

703
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,889
I can do it.

704
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,391
Stay still. I know it hurts to move.

705
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:49,984
Let me see.

706
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,216
By the way,

707
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,719
I'm sorry you lost Ok Eul-tae.

708
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,598
What a shame. It was your chance.

709
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:22,850
I can catch him again.

710
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,646
Did you ask him
about what happened 1,000 years ago?

711
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,690
I did.

712
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,943
What did he say?

713
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,074
He said you'd end me.

714
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,201
That you'd ruin everything for me.

715
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,831
I'd do that? But why?

716
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:49,961
I don't know.

717
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,422
And?

718
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,674
What else did he say?

719
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,302
He said I…

720
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,389
It's nothing. It was all nonsense.

721
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:05,893
Like you said…

722
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,733
I don't think I should listen to him.

723
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,943
I'll only be shaken.

724
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,488
I'm just going to rely on what I remember.

725
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,748
Good. I think that's right.

726
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,875
I'm going to do the same.

727
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,586
I'll judge the situation for what it is.

728
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,131
I won't be swayed
by what Kim Hwa-yeon said.

729
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,051
What is it? Did she say something else?

730
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,138
Well…

731
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,434
When Si-ho looked into my past,

732
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,269
Kim Hwa-yeon said

733
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:53,441
that you and Ok Eul-tae
had to die at the same time.

734
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,613
She told me not to trust you.

735
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,076
Well…

736
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,536
She might be right.

737
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,750
Don't be absurd.

738
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,252
You're the only one I can trust right now.

739
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,924
You and I may have been enemies
in our past lives.

740
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:21,177
And Kim Hwa-yeon may have wanted you dead.

741
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,721
But you're the only one

742
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,265
who has been helping my sister and me.

743
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,436
So how can I not trust you?

744
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,697
Should we get up now?

745
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:45,326
Okay. Wait here.
I'll dress your wound again.

746
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:29,495
What?

747
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,373
It's in the same spot

748
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,585
as Sang-yeon's scar.

749
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,831
I will be born again

750
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:17,210
with this scar that you have given me.

751
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,543
What's wrong? Are you okay?

752
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,419
What's going on?

753
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:34,871
Why did you…

754
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,249
do that?

755
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:49,260
Who are you?

756
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,015
Who…

757
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,437
Who exactly are you?

758
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:44,065
It's different from the dreams
I had when I was young.

759
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,275
You were the one standing
among the dead bodies.

760
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,110
Why did you come back here?

761
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:53,366
Now, I will destroy him completely.

762
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,077
We received a report that
a murder suspect was here.

763
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,578
-Arrest them!
-No!

764
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:58,913
-Why are you doing this?
-Let go of me!

765
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:01,165
Where are they right now?

766
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,501
Where they are is not what's important.

767
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:05,419
You should be asking why I took them.

768
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,797
If you lay even a finger on them

769
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,256
I'm going to kill you all.

770
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:14,136
