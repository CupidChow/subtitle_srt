1
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,624
She said…

2
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,879
you were the sword

3
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,215
that could kill Bulgasal.

4
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,683
Please help me.

5
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,232
Help me.

6
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,235
You want me to help you?

7
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,436
EPISODE 5

8
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,585
Hey.

9
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,669
Mister!

10
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,553
I've been looking for you.
We should leave together.

11
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:00,930
What?

12
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,142
Who…

13
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,226
Who is she?

14
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,187
Just go.

15
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,898
This has nothing to do with you.

16
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,151
Seriously? I saved you earlier.

17
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,070
You're ditching me right away? Come on.

18
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,864
But how did you get here?

19
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,326
Some guy drove me here.

20
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,495
Wait. That's the guy!

21
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,540
There.

22
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,183
Is he alive? Is he okay?

23
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,393
He's unconscious.

24
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,606
Call 911 right now.

25
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,610
Hello? A man is hurt.

26
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,029
Where am I? I'm…

27
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,280
It was you, right?

28
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,367
You're the one who asked Mr. Gu
to find Min Sang-un.

29
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,452
And you're the one
who killed her family, aren't you?

30
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,121
Who the hell are you?

31
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,296
We meet again like this.

32
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,926
I missed you and was happy to see you.

33
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,658
Stop chasing me now.
It will be dangerous for you.

34
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,869
Father.

35
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,847
Sir! Are you all right?

36
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,849
Wake up, sir!

37
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,560
Can you hear me?

38
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,978
-Give me some gauze.
-Okay.

39
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,479
Sir!

40
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,609
Sir, you shouldn't move!

41
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,820
Do you know where you are?

42
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,040
Bulgasal.

43
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,374
Bulgasal!

44
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,960
You shouldn't be moving right now!

45
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,591
You have to stay still.

46
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,929
Where did the cars from the accident go?

47
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,015
The body…

48
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,476
Where's the dead body?

49
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,186
You were the only one here.

50
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,521
Are you okay?

51
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,619
Father…

52
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,666
What about Mother?

53
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,644
That's so dope. The stab wound was huge.

54
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,772
Are you like Wolverine?
Do you have healing powers?

55
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,900
Damn, that's awesome.

56
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,862
But you can still feel pain, right?

57
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,447
Wait. Sir.

58
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,622
Her soul is mine.

59
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,960
She's indebted to me as well.

60
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,227
Sang-yeon! No…

61
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,646
Sang-yeon!

62
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,709
Run.

63
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,672
Run.

64
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,987
What?

65
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,614
You're twins.

66
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,741
Your soul was split into two?

67
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,326
What are you scheming?

68
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,412
Stop it.

69
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,790
It won't make a difference.
I'll just destroy both.

70
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:43,833
No.

71
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,752
You will never be able to kill her.

72
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,963
You won't be able to touch her.

73
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,343
What are you talking about?

74
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,470
The dark hole won't go away.

75
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,392
She will…

76
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,357
put everything back in its place.

77
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,240
Is that so?

78
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,160
There's only one way to find out.

79
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,996
You're first.

80
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,979
No!

81
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,577
Find that man.

82
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,413
He will help you.

83
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,012
Sang-yeon. Don't die. You can't die.

84
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,097
Sang-yeon.

85
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,351
Sang-yeon. Please don't die.

86
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,144
Sang-yeon.

87
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,515
What? What is this?

88
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,481
Do you dream like humans do?

89
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,615
Where am I?

90
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,367
My house.

91
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,579
Why did you bring me here?

92
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,166
I can't let that bastard take you.

93
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,757
Why does he want to kill you?

94
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,803
I don't know.

95
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,638
My sister didn't explain why.

96
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,890
Are you saying
your sister knew everything?

97
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,231
I know this might sound really strange.

98
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,984
But my sister told me
she remembered her past lives.

99
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,777
She knew he would try to kill me

100
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,655
and that you would help me.

101
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,198
Me?

102
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,076
Help you?

103
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,495
Yes.

104
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,290
She told me to find the man
with a scar on his right hand.

105
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,710
Did she really say that?

106
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,799
She told you to find me?

107
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,846
I'm sure that's what she told me.

108
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,349
Didn't you look for me
so you could help me?

109
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,896
So I could get revenge on him
for killing my family.

110
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,066
Help you get revenge for your family?

111
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,236
You…

112
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,991
of all people are asking me to do that?

113
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,994
Even after what you have done?

114
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,290
What…

115
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,125
What are you talking about?

116
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,216
Do you really not remember?
Or are you pretending?

117
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,935
Hold on!

118
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,145
I need to go check on my sister.

119
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,107
You'll never see her again.

120
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,281
What are you…

121
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,872
Hey. Why did you lock the door?

122
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,292
Why are you locking me inside? Hey!

123
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,004
JUNGJONG MOTEL

124
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,675
The number you are calling
is currently switched off.

125
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,511
Please leave a message after the tone.

126
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,015
Sang-un. What's going on?

127
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,643
Why did you turn off your phone?

128
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,109
Who is it?

129
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,240
-Is that you, Sang-un?
-I'm the owner of the motel.

130
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,785
How much longer will you stay here?
You need to pay extra for an extension.

131
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,872
Okay. I'm sorry.

132
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,504
How much…

133
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,048
Gosh. You shouldn't open
the door so easily like this.

134
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,800
-You should be more careful.
-What?

135
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,969
-Goodness.
-Hey! Who are you?

136
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,139
That hurts! My head is stuck!

137
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,059
I'm on your side.

138
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,603
I came here to take you
because it's dangerous here.

139
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,566
-You're lying!
-That hurts!

140
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,403
Someone your sister knows sent me here!

141
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,365
-My sister?
-Yes!

142
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,242
I thought my head was going to break.

143
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,493
Why are you so strong?

144
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,370
Oh, my head.

145
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,627
My head…

146
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,047
Goodness, my neck too.

147
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,971
Hey! My goodness.

148
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,474
He works for me.

149
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,060
He looks scary, but he's such a softie.

150
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,023
Did my sister really send you?

151
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,609
Gosh, you ask so many questions.
Is this all you have?

152
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,069
I changed my mind.

153
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,695
I'll wait for her here.

154
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,030
How can I trust you?

155
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,574
You're not safe here.
Bad people might come.

156
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:59,203
Exactly. How can I be sure
you're not one of them?

157
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,205
Gosh! Do I look like them?

158
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,874
Like Bulgasal
or those reincarnated Monsters?

159
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,418
You know about Bulgasal?

160
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,586
You bet I do.

161
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,631
Seriously. That jerk is driving me crazy.

162
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,468
Anyway, someone you know
sent me here to get you.

163
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,345
Someone I know? Who is it?

164
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,681
You've known him for a long time.
I heard a lot about you too.

165
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,850
You see weird stuff when you touch people.

166
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,813
Who told you that? Who is it?

167
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:30,609
-Ma'am, who is he? Who is it?
-Gosh. That's enough! Let's just go!

168
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,237
I'll introduce you to him later.

169
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,739
Later. Okay?

170
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,798
Hey.

171
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,591
Did you get her?

172
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,218
I brought her here safe and sound.

173
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,765
Why didn't you tell me she has a temper?

174
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,894
Did you see anyone suspicious?

175
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,647
No. She's completely safe here.

176
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,525
A butcher's market scares away even thugs.

177
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,818
We all work with knives.

178
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,404
Even so, be careful. He might go there.

179
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,239
Who? The other Bulgasal?

180
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,492
It's you who should be careful.
Why would he come here?

181
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,122
By the way, when will you go to the well?

182
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,708
You said you'd reclaim your soul
and lock her up there.

183
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,625
Not yet.

184
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,670
Now that I know
there is one more Bulgasal,

185
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,505
it's too dangerous
to become human right now.

186
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,593
I need to find out
who he is and why he's after her.

187
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,344
But…

188
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,598
How come you didn't know
there was another Bulgasal?

189
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,559
Are you there?

190
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,823
Did you just ask
how many Bulgasals there are?

191
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,037
Don't ask me a ridiculous question.
Just keep your eyes on the water.

192
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:10,000
Before Teoreokson jumps out of the water
and eats both of our heads.

193
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,631
At the northernmost tip of the swamp,

194
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,675
there is a mountain
where Bulgasal supposedly lives.

195
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,845
You are talking about Bulgasal again?

196
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,639
You do not even know if it exists.

197
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,599
Stop saying it does not--

198
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:29,311
Do you know
when people first heard of Bulgasal?

199
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,522
It was 400 years ago.

200
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:37,653
There was a myth that Bulgasal
killed everyone in a mountain village.

201
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,531
Ever since then, no one has seen it again.

202
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,450
There are only rumors.

203
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:47,996
And the rumors said
there was only one Bulgasal.

204
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,461
I was told there was only one Bulgasal.

205
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,381
But the other Bulgasal
is stronger than you.

206
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,966
Because he drinks human blood.

207
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,222
You know, I'm too old
to get mixed up in creepy stuff like that.

208
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,184
I want to live comfortably in my old age.

209
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,310
So what's your plan?

210
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,645
I have to find him quickly.

211
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,438
So do you know how to kill him?

212
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,148
Do you have a plan?

213
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,900
Nagging came with your old age too.

214
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,444
Just look after her for me.

215
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,530
Hey. Hello? Hey…

216
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,323
Goodness.

217
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,426
What are you doing?
You're breaking apart my house.

218
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,054
I can explain.

219
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,807
I just opened it. But it fell off.

220
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,727
Maybe your house is too old.

221
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,069
Forget it. Just leave.

222
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,030
You want me to leave now?

223
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,366
I told you I had no place to go,
so I would stay here.

224
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,285
You said it was okay.

225
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,331
More importantly,
you don't have any food at home.

226
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,207
Do you not even eat?

227
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,500
What do you eat?

228
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,212
People without families
or friends like you.

229
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,134
Come on. That's a messed-up joke.

230
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,844
Why would he joke about…

231
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,766
You're not serious, right?

232
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,187
-Just leave.
-I knew it. You were joking.

233
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,188
It was a joke.

234
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,157
What are these canisters
inside the fridge?

235
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,159
Seriously? You're using your power?

236
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,662
If it weren't for me,
you would still be at the mountain

237
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,831
with the sword in your stomach.

238
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,792
I can be quite useful.

239
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,713
Okay.

240
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,133
I won't touch anything.
I'll be quiet. Not a peep from me.

241
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,139
But even if I do have to leave…

242
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,976
I'm starving right now.

243
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,354
Right. The lady in the room
must be hungry too.

244
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,444
Go buy some food.

245
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,406
Buy a lot of bandages at a pharmacy too.

246
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,324
Okay.

247
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,953
But the grocery store is really far away.

248
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,540
Can you drive me there, bro?

249
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,084
Can I call you that?

250
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,087
Bulgasal Bro.

251
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,050
Who told you that?

252
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:51,054
Oh, that? The man we left behind told me.

253
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,098
What did you do to cross him?

254
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,642
He wanted to find you so badly.

255
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,064
Are you serious right now?

256
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,692
There's a case! Why won't you believe me?

257
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,069
It was a simple car accident.

258
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,571
Go to Traffic Management.

259
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,408
I saw a man biting someone's neck
with my own eyes.

260
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,702
Did you drink and drive?

261
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,328
Drink and drive?

262
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,748
Hey. Investigate the scene properly.

263
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,459
There were bloodstains at the crime scene!

264
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,878
When I was in charge--

265
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,839
If you keep it up, I'll charge you
with obstruction of justice!

266
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,591
Hey!

267
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,135
Did I damage public property now?

268
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,470
Fine. Let's follow the law. Sounds great!

269
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,222
-Let's do it.
-Stop it.

270
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,558
Let go of me.
I used to be a detective too.

271
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,228
I took down gangsters with
just two punches back in my day.

272
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,148
Hey! Have you not heard
of Fedor at Sangyong Police Station?

273
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,858
Let go of me, you jerks.

274
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,611
Get your captain! I want Detective Ham!

275
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,737
Ho-yeol!

276
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,956
Damn it.

277
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,126
Why make a scene in front of your juniors?
Don't embarrass yourself.

278
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:04,878
Embarrass myself?

279
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,547
That used to be your specialty.

280
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,675
When you were a rookie,
you threw up after seeing dead bodies.

281
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,802
You peed your pants
after fighting a culprit.

282
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,387
Who had your back?

283
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,265
Stop bringing up the past. Okay?

284
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,268
Why are you here?

285
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,020
I'm not done talking about the past.

286
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,148
Do you remember
the cold case from 15 years ago?

287
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,442
The murder of a mom and daughter.

288
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,528
Yes. Why are you bringing that up now?

289
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,907
I found the twin sister that ran away.

290
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,284
And I also found the culprit.

291
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,786
The culprit?

292
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,038
After the incident,

293
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:43,208
a man looked for Min Sang-un for 15 years.

294
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,001
I even know where his house is.

295
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,838
You guys have to investigate him.
He's the key to solving this case.

296
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,384
-What are you talking about?
-I got into an accident while tailing him.

297
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,803
Do you know what I saw at the crime scene?

298
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,348
I saw a man biting someone's neck.

299
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,016
He wasn't human.

300
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,643
Like the culprit of that murder--

301
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,436
Are you still on about that?

302
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,439
Seriously.
When will you come to your senses?

303
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,776
-What?
-You resigned because of that case.

304
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,280
You kept talking nonsense
about how there were monsters and stuff.

305
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,240
While helping you, Su-gyeong…

306
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,035
Damn it.

307
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,540
It's about time you forgot
about that case.

308
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,834
You should just go.

309
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,920
Let me know if you need anything
for your private detective agency.

310
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,631
And you should stop talking about monsters

311
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,174
and things that don't exist…

312
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,720
What I need

313
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,390
is for you and your team
to investigate the murder case. You jerk!

314
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,766
It hurts!

315
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,561
And control that temper of yours.

316
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,812
Wait and see.

317
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,107
I'm going to bring you proper evidence.

318
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,400
You just wait.

319
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,879
I'm not hungry.

320
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,592
How much longer will you keep me here?

321
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,887
Tell me everything you know
about that Bulgasal.

322
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,684
Or stay here until you want to talk.

323
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,187
Wait.

324
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,733
Let me use the bathroom.

325
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,028
I've been locked up all this time.

326
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,550
What are you doing there? Close the door.

327
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,635
You're going to watch?

328
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,430
Seriously? Are you a pervert?

329
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,010
Don't try anything funny.

330
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,303
Wait.

331
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,723
-I have to go to my sister.
-Deal with it.

332
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,684
Being in the same place
with you disgusts me too.

333
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,605
What?

334
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,317
I've been sensing it the whole time.
Why do you hate me?

335
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,778
Why do you look at me
like you want to kill me? Why--

336
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,946
You can get out of here once I kill him.

337
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,491
So tell me everything you know about him.

338
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,913
He is Bulgasal just like you.

339
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,956
He killed my family 15 years ago,

340
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,668
and is still after my soul.

341
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,586
Why?

342
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,631
That soul isn't even yours.

343
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,468
It's not my soul?

344
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,013
You said I could kill him, right?

345
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,223
Do you know how?

346
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,934
I don't know.

347
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,061
She only said
you were the sword to kill Bulgasal.

348
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,687
Where can I find that bastard?

349
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,856
I don't know that either.

350
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,401
How come you don't remember anything?

351
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,904
All of your past lives.

352
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,157
Because I'm an ordinary human being.

353
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,159
Unlike my sister, I don't--

354
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,953
What are you plotting?

355
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,872
Why did you split the soul
and be born as twins?

356
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,668
How come you survived instead
of your sister who remembered everything?

357
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,004
I don't know.
I don't know what you're talking about.

358
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,757
Why are you acting innocent?
What are you trying to do?

359
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,595
Why are you asking me for help?

360
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,182
-You're hurting me.
-You don't remember?

361
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,395
It hurts!

362
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,524
What are you really trying to do?

363
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,110
Then what about you?

364
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,580
INCOMING CALL
RESTRICTED NUMBER

365
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,419
That was fast.

366
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,296
Who is this?

367
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,507
You're hurting my feelings.
Did you forget my voice already?

368
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,217
We just met yesterday!

369
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,524
We have a lot to talk about.
Why don't we meet?

370
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,832
Keep a close eye on that woman.

371
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,085
Don't let her out
and don't even talk to her.

372
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,253
Why not?

373
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,633
You said you wanted to stay here.
Do as I say.

374
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,637
Can't you at least tell me
why you're locking her up?

375
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,639
This seems wrong
and I feel kind of guilty.

376
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,141
It might not seem like it
but I go to church on weekends.

377
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,853
She killed my family.

378
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,314
She's a murderer?

379
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,527
Bro! Where are you going?

380
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,378
You're late.

381
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,966
Exactly 23 minutes late.

382
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,512
I'm disappointed.

383
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,222
I've been around for a long time.

384
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,391
But I hate wasting my time
even for just a few minutes.

385
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,937
-There was traffic.
-There was traffic?

386
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,397
Okay. So that's your excuse?

387
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,233
That's the excuse you're giving me?

388
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,360
You should have left earlier then.

389
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,113
You still haven't adapted
to the modern world?

390
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,911
You know what? I ordered anything for you.

391
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,121
You don't eat anyway. Right?

392
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,708
A Monster eating human food?

393
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,960
You can't even taste it.

394
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,004
Being able to taste it is not the point.

395
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,507
I have to look the part
in this world of humans.

396
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,509
It's not like the good old times anymore.

397
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,886
When Monsters like us
ate humans in broad daylight.

398
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,681
"Monsters like us"?

399
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,392
Are there more besides us?

400
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,644
Gosh, no. It's just you and me now.

401
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,396
Somebody killed all of them.

402
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,773
A man, crazy about
hunting Monsters 600 years ago.

403
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,526
But he turned into one.

404
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,153
What do you think? Isn't it funny?

405
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,446
Why did you want to see me?

406
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,618
I had a feeling you wanted to find me.

407
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,912
I didn't want you to waste your time.

408
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,414
We ought to get along.

409
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,125
We're both Bulgasal.

410
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,003
You want to be friends now?

411
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,838
After being strangers for 600 years?

412
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,008
Were you busy chasing after her?

413
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,010
No. That's not it.

414
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,680
Look. Let's go over this.
You weren't always Bulgasal, right?

415
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,348
You were once a human before.

416
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,976
So you're Bulgasal on the outside,

417
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,770
but you're still human on the inside?

418
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,356
Right. I noticed
that you don't drink human blood.

419
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,735
Gosh. This is…

420
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,073
Gosh. That's amazing.

421
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,161
Wait. Without their blood,
your body must feel like it's burning.

422
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,329
How do you endure that?

423
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,165
Hey, you're weak
because you don't drink their blood!

424
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,377
Lower your voice.

425
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,633
How's your wound?
I was pretty hard on you yesterday.

426
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,642
That's enough bullshit.
Just get to the point.

427
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,814
I want to avoid rush hour.
I've adapted too, you know.

428
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,111
Where is the woman?

429
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,572
I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

430
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,449
Oh, my. Why are you so hostile?

431
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,660
I have no intention of fighting you.

432
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,995
We're not enemies.

433
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,998
She's our enemy.

434
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,087
And she's the one who needs to die.

435
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,028
Who's there?

436
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:05,032
Hey. I'm locked up in here.
Can you open the door?

437
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,618
Don't go.

438
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,870
I know you're there.

439
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,959
Can you open the door? Please?

440
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,628
Well, the thing is,

441
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,922
he told me not to open it.

442
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,342
Did he go somewhere?

443
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,970
I think he went to the grocery store.

444
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,556
He'll be back soon. He'll be right back.

445
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,767
Wait. Who are you?

446
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,228
Do you know him well?

447
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,232
I know enough.

448
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,569
You could say that I'm helping him.

449
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,530
Well, he did help me a little too.

450
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,575
We're like a damage dealer
and a supporter. Will she get that?

451
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,536
Right, I shouldn't be talking to her.
I'm leaving.

452
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,581
Wait! I have a younger sister.

453
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,084
Can you help me make a call?

454
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,127
A sister?

455
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,879
Please help. Please?

456
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,672
Gosh. I can't do that.

457
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,841
I think you're about
the same age as my sister.

458
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,176
Are you in school?

459
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,637
School? I'm in my thirties!

460
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,681
Don't think you can push me around.

461
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,350
I've lived a rough life too.

462
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,020
You know, when I was in the slammer,

463
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,857
I saw a lot of murderers like you.
It was filled with them.

464
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,275
Murderer?

465
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,944
What do you mean?

466
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,572
Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

467
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,201
Open it.

468
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,953
Open the door. Come on.

469
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,712
Don't you want to get rid of your enemy?

470
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,714
The woman who killed your family.

471
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,516
How do you know about that?

472
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,852
My goodness. Why are you doing this to me?
There are people here.

473
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,647
I'm not here to start a fight with you.

474
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,358
Fine. I'll tell you.

475
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,652
Come here.

476
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,280
Or we can settle it right here.

477
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,950
Everyone in here will die,
and there will be a bloodbath.

478
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,952
Can you handle the consequences?

479
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,995
I, on the other hand, can handle it.

480
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:17,873
Do what you want.

481
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,252
They are mere strangers to me.

482
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,257
That's great.

483
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,343
You really lost a lot of your humanity.

484
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:34,223
Right. You did live
a long time as a Monster.

485
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:37,852
But when you are as old as I am,
you'll get to know much more.

486
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,605
Like the fact that there was a baby
who was born with Bulgasal's curse.

487
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,152
And I know the reason

488
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,113
why you were cursed by that woman too.

489
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,825
You know the answers to all of that?

490
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,287
Are you curious? I can tell you.

491
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,373
But in return,
you have to help me destroy her soul.

492
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,169
Why are you trying so hard
to destroy her soul?

493
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:08,007
You Monsters used to live in the mountains
in hiding and kill any humans you saw.

494
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,968
She used to be your kind.

495
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,349
My kind?

496
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,835
Humans also go after their own kind.

497
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,214
They kill and steal from each other.

498
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,550
We're just like humans.

499
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,596
Once something goes wrong,
we can't go back.

500
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,766
Even if hundreds of years pass by

501
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,644
and it's just the two of us in the world.

502
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,279
This is her curse.

503
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,450
No amount of blood
or years will heal this wound.

504
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,329
It keeps rotting
and healing over and over again.

505
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,164
And the pain repeats too.

506
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,959
For a thousand years…

507
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,420
the pain won't stop.

508
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,020
Gosh. I got carried away.

509
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,114
This hole will heal
once the woman is gone.

510
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,325
And I want you to help me.

511
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,578
How?

512
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,289
Only Bulgasal can destroy one's soul.

513
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:07,585
And when a soul has been destroyed
eight times, it cannot reincarnate.

514
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,838
So you killed her every time
she was reincarnated?

515
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,757
You did that seven times?
So this must be the last time.

516
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,634
Yes. That's it.

517
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,720
But I can't seem to do it one last time.

518
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,014
I'm sure the older sister did something.

519
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,932
Whenever I try to destroy her soul,

520
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,643
dark blood keeps seeping out
from the dark hole.

521
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,605
So I want you to do it for me.
What do you say? Simple, right?

522
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,651
It is simple.

523
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,446
But you know
that the soul you want me to destroy

524
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,324
used to belong to me, right?

525
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,908
Please. Don't do that.

526
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,411
You need to make that sacrifice.

527
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,788
Destroying her soul
and getting rid of her for good

528
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,249
will be the perfect revenge.
It's perfect for both of us.

529
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,668
What if I say no?

530
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,050
What if my goal isn't getting rid of her,
but reclaiming my soul?

531
00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:00,387
Then we'll do this over and over again.

532
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,474
First…

533
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,561
I'll find her and kill her.

534
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,188
I'll do it again when she's born.

535
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,565
I'll find her and kill her every time.

536
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,026
Find her and kill her. Rinse and repeat.

537
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,486
This cycle will continue.

538
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,155
I may not be able to destroy her soul,
but I can kill her.

539
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,783
Then it will be hard
for you to get your soul back.

540
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,577
I always find her before you do.
I always have.

541
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,461
Hundreds of years…

542
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,923
is not a long time for me.

543
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,551
But can you last that long?

544
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,137
How can you stay alive
without drinking human blood?

545
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,317
Wait. Why are you getting up?

546
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,945
I have so much left to say
as I've lived for so long.

547
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,784
The bottom line is
that you cannot destroy her soul.

548
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,162
That's all I need to know.
I'll get going before rush hour hits.

549
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,091
Was I too nice?

550
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,593
You don't get it.

551
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,054
I'm not making you an offer

552
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,266
because we're not equal.

553
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,477
You can't beat me. You know it firsthand.

554
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,282
Bring the woman here.

555
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,785
Don't believe anything she says.
She's lying to you.

556
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,663
Oh, right. My name is…

557
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,541
Ok Eul-tae.

558
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,503
I thought you should know
my name, Mr. Dan Hwal.

559
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,394
-I can't hear you.
-Hey. Open the door.

560
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,354
-Gosh. Come on.
-Let me just make a call.

561
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,315
No is no, for crying out loud!

562
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,485
-She's driving me crazy.
-Open the door. Please.

563
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,361
Open the door, please!

564
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,947
It's like I'm hearing in surround sound.

565
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,157
Seriously.

566
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,701
Hey.

567
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,038
Is he back?

568
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,333
Goodness. What took him so long?

569
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,586
What took you so long?

570
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,424
-What?
-You brat. It's you again?

571
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,675
Why are you here?

572
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,511
I thought you were him.

573
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,388
Hey. Mister!

574
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,224
Where's the creepy guy who lives here?

575
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,850
He's not here. He's out.

576
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,352
Why did you barge in here?

577
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,938
Mister. Are you a gangster or something?

578
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,232
Are you a dog guarding an empty house?

579
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,150
How come it's always you here?

580
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,778
Right.

581
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,031
You were there last night too.

582
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,326
How could you be so heartless?

583
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,119
You left me on the street like that?

584
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,998
Mister, I'm the one who called 911.

585
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,750
I saved your life!

586
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,293
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

587
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,586
You still left me there!

588
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,672
This is why there's no point
in helping others.

589
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,674
Seriously. I shouldn't have called 911.

590
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:24,967
I bet your grades are low.

591
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,011
Gosh. That's just mean.
Why are you talking about my grades now?

592
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,347
Whatever. Just leave.

593
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,891
-Just go.
-This isn't your house.

594
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,519
Not there.

595
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,940
Come on. It's just me here.
What are you doing?

596
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:42,693
Not there?

597
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,488
Why not?

598
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,406
Well…

599
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,910
Are you hiding something?
What are you hiding?

600
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,455
No, I'm not hiding anything.
Just leave already.

601
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,212
What's that noise?

602
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,424
It must be coming from next door, right?

603
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,593
You bastards. What did you do?

604
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,469
Mister!

605
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,766
He told me not to open the door.
There's a murderer in there!

606
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,518
Mister…

607
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,867
Min Sang-un?

608
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,786
It's you, right?

609
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,789
Who are you?

610
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,293
I was the detective

611
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,254
on the case from 15 years ago.
Do you remember me?

612
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,299
You said Bulgasal was chasing you.
You said Bulgasal did it.

613
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:48,967
Bulgasal.

614
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,344
KWON HO-YEOL

615
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,263
Bulgasal. Bulgasal is coming.

616
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,806
He's coming to kill us.

617
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,061
Are you sure it was Bulgasal?
Are you certain?

618
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,357
-You have the wrong person.
-It is you.

619
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,400
The middle schooler from the hospital.

620
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,445
Why did you run away?
The police could have helped you.

621
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,031
I don't need their help.

622
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,700
-I can't trust them.
-What?

623
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,578
You don't need to help me.

624
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,080
That was in the past.

625
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,082
You were locked in here just now.

626
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,168
The man who lives here
brought you here, right?

627
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,462
Did you know

628
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,924
that he had been looking for you
for the past 15 years?

629
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:33,887
Hey.

630
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:34,805
Bro.

631
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,439
How did you…

632
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:48,026
You bastard. You abducted a woman.

633
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,778
I caught you red-handed.

634
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,704
Your arm will break.

635
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,872
Just give it up.

636
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:01,790
Stop it.

637
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,834
Stop what? You evil bastard!

638
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,461
I said stop it!

639
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,299
You won't remember or understand.

640
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,676
But don't get in my way. Leave.

641
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,262
I'll do whatever it takes to lock you up.

642
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:17,848
What have you done to that poor woman?

643
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,559
"Poor woman"?

644
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,439
She killed my family.

645
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,649
What?

646
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,069
You bastard. Are you high?

647
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,615
I see. You must be strong
because you're a junkie.

648
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,058
Don't stand in my way. Leave.

649
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,186
It will all come to an end today.

650
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,737
One of us won't make it out alive today.

651
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,490
Stop!

652
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:23,830
Stop it.

653
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,832
He didn't kidnap me.

654
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,834
Why do you keep lying?

655
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,004
-I saw that you were locked up.
-I know him well.

656
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,715
He's been…

657
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,931
helping me.

658
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,313
Bring the woman here.

659
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,983
Our real enemy is her.

660
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,085
You should go, Detective.

661
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,339
I'm really fine.

662
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:17,300
I know you said no earlier,
but you are Min Sang-un, right?

663
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,555
I believe you when you say
that Bulgasal is coming.

664
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,639
I can help you.

665
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,101
No. No one can help me.

666
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,313
Only that man…

667
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,817
can help me.

668
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,112
Who the hell is he?

669
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,590
What on earth is going on?

670
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,638
I know, right?
Where are they going all of a sudden?

671
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,807
What a classic case of CDO.

672
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,602
CDO?

673
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,189
Chaos, destruction, and ob--

674
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,650
Damn it. Forget it.

675
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,153
I'll tail them to find out.

676
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:22,240
Hey. You can't all leave me here.

677
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,534
It's scary being here alone.

678
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,223
Let me call my younger sister.

679
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:51,811
You don't have to call her
or worry about her anymore.

680
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:56,816
Hey. She's my sister.
Why do you keep saying--

681
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,444
Staying with you
will only put her in danger.

682
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,529
She could get hurt because of you.

683
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,448
How could you keep her by your side?

684
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,492
That's because…

685
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,872
I couldn't send
my younger sister to a stranger.

686
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,209
I have to protect her.

687
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,671
She's my only family.

688
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:19,839
Family?

689
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,344
Someone I know is taking care of her.

690
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,513
It's much safer than being with you.

691
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,725
Who is it? Where is she? Tell me!

692
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,568
Hey.

693
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,738
You told me not to trust you.

694
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,284
But I will.

695
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,079
You said my sister was safe, right?

696
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,622
I'll believe that too.

697
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,375
And I'll stop asking
where we're going. But…

698
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,673
I really need…

699
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,676
your help.

700
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,972
My sister and I want
to live like everyone else.

701
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,058
We want to worry about simple things
like rent and what to eat for dinner.

702
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,769
Just like everyone else.

703
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,314
So I'll trust you.

704
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,192
You told me not to trust you…

705
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,196
but I will.

706
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,201
Don't believe anything she says.
She's lying to you.

707
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:55,018
The number you are calling
is currently switched off. Please…

708
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,270
Gosh, Sang-un. Why…

709
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,188
SANG-UN

710
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:02,776
Hey, you should have told me
if you got the call.

711
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,278
Look at you. I've been too nice.

712
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:07,405
I should slice your flesh instead.

713
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:11,034
That restaurant specifically orders
rump round and chuck tender regularly.

714
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,929
Did you check the storage?

715
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,807
Seriously? Come with me.

716
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:39,187
HAPPY BUTCHER SHOP

717
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,261
Goodness. We had it in stock.

718
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:14,222
Mr. Park from Jin's Restaurant is always…

719
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,809
What? Where did she go?

720
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,858
Gosh. Oh, no. What should I do?

721
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:32,949
Get out.

722
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,183
Follow me. We're going up the mountain.

723
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,961
Goodness.
Is it so hard to slow down for me?

724
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:13,091
What's taking you so long? I'm waiting.

725
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,553
I told you to be punctual.

726
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,639
I'm almost there.

727
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,850
Really? You're almost here?

728
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,644
You brought the woman too, right?

729
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,216
Don't wait.

730
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,218
I can't let you have the woman.

731
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:02,765
I thought you understood me earlier.

732
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,560
Was I not clear enough?

733
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,770
Did the hand on your wound heal?

734
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:08,771
Yes.

735
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,815
If you reclaim your soul
and become a human,

736
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:12,317
your wounds won't heal.

737
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,526
I don't care.

738
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,070
Mr. Dan. Why are you doing this to me?

739
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,281
Don't go down this road
when I'm still civil.

740
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:22,035
Destroying her soul is good for you too.
Don't you get that?

741
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,036
How is it good for me?

742
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,498
You really don't know anything.

743
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,459
Fine. I'll explain it to you.

744
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:33,630
If your soul disappears,
you can be Bulgasal in the truest sense.

745
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,381
You won't have tedious emotions.

746
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,801
You will be stronger beyond compare.
Just like me.

747
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,513
Like you? The thought of it disgusts me.

748
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,893
You cannot be reasoned with.

749
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:50,688
Hey. Listen carefully.

750
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:56,069
The moment you become a human,
I'll find you.

751
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:59,155
You'll die in a few seconds
when I suck your blood like before.

752
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,866
And I'll find and kill you
every time you are reincarnated.

753
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,159
I don't care.

754
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,036
As long as I can get my revenge on her,

755
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,705
you can kill me all you want.

756
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:08,915
I'll be waiting.

757
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:57,922
It's me. Get started.

758
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,638
Who were you talking to just now?

759
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,975
I was canceling an appointment.

760
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:16,983
By the way…

761
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:22,530
what on earth is this place?

762
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,199
A prison.

763
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,828
-What?
-I made this well

764
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,914
a long time ago to lock up
the person who killed my family.

765
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,295
I see. You had a family?

766
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,258
But who did such a thing?

767
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:51,267
I've been waiting to find
and bury that person here alive.

768
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:55,229
I've been wanting to make them immortal,
so that they can forever undergo

769
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,941
the same pain I had to go through
for the past 600 years,

770
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,694
locked up inside this well.

771
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:05,323
I've been dreaming of this day.

772
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,451
The day the well meets its prisoner.

773
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:14,499
Who's the prisoner of the well?

774
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,877
Who are you going to lock up?

775
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,297
Bulgasal.

776
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:26,385
Then did that man kill your family too?

777
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,887
That Bulgasal?

778
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,223
This isn't about him.

779
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,564
This is about you.

780
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,567
What?

781
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,613
What are you talking about?

782
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,698
Bulgasal killed your--

783
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,534
You were Bulgasal 600 years ago

784
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,160
and you killed my son and wife.

785
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,704
My blind son

786
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,082
desperately called for me
and begged to be spared.

787
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,293
But he died after you bit into his neck.

788
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,379
And my wife…

789
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,215
couldn't even close her eyes

790
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,093
as she tried to protect our son.

791
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,304
To settle your grudge with me…

792
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,141
you killed…

793
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,687
my family brutally.

794
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,481
You even stole my soul.

795
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:25,862
And I could not even die
to escape from this dreadful pain.

796
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,283
No…

797
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,412
It wasn't me. What are you doing?

798
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,581
Let go! Let go of me.

799
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,548
You're lying, right?

800
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:48,926
I couldn't have been Bulgasal.

801
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,013
Wait. I'll make you regain your memories.

802
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,724
Once you become Bulgasal
after losing your soul,

803
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,184
you will remember everything.

804
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,438
How evil you were in your past life…

805
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,901
and what you did to me.

806
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,070
This can't be.

807
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,284
What about my younger sister?

808
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,078
What did you do to her?

809
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,872
You really don't remember anything.

810
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,876
It doesn't matter.

811
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,461
It's over now.

812
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:26,255
This long-lasting curse of Bulgasal.

813
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:27,673
And now…

814
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:30,551
I can finally rest.

815
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,103
Wait!

816
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,900
Don't come in here! I'm almost done.

817
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,526
The girl…

818
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,112
The girl is gone!

819
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,324
I think someone took her.

820
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,437
I told you to watch her closely!

821
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,606
She vanished within seconds.

822
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,359
I kept calling you.
But you have way too many phones.

823
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,152
So I couldn't reach you.

824
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,445
What do we do?

825
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,117
Call your sister right now.

826
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,161
The girl that's gone…

827
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,290
Are you talking about my sister?

828
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,346
Where are you, Si-ho?

829
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:06,313
Hello. I've always wanted to meet you.

830
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,606
Who is this?

831
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,402
My sister. Where is my sister?

832
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:15,031
She's here with me.

833
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:20,369
He told me you would come if I had her.

834
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:22,913
Dark Hole.

835
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,750
He told me that.

836
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:36,510
Where do I need to go?

837
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,117
Why are you here
in the middle of the night?

838
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,786
What are you going to do to her?

839
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:05,706
Ms. Min, are you all right?

840
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,425
What are you doing?

841
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,636
-Let me borrow your car.
-What?

842
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,515
Get out. Do you want to die?

843
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,391
Don't you know it's a trap to kill you?

844
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,310
Get out of my way. I don't care.

845
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:30,064
My sister will get hurt if I don't go.
So I have to go.

846
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:31,357
You can't save her.

847
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,984
Don't be stupid.
Just wait here. I'll go save her.

848
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,820
How can I trust you?

849
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:37,738
Up until a moment ago,

850
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,366
you were going to kill me.

851
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,617
What?

852
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,453
I knew it. You bastard.

853
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:52,336
Damn it.

854
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:55,214
You can't go after her.

855
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,841
Didn't you hear us just now?

856
01:08:56,924 --> 01:09:00,094
I heard you loud and clear.
You tried to kill her.

857
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,972
If she goes alone, she'll die.

858
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:05,683
Her sister was kidnapped.
We don't have time.

859
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:09,395
What the…

860
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,065
What's going on here?

861
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,821
The kidnapper told her
to come to the reservoir?

862
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,532
We should call the police first.

863
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:22,908
They won't be of help.

864
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,953
Gosh, that again? Why the hell not?

865
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:10,748
It's Teoreokson!

866
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:13,375
TEOREOKSON:
A WATER MONSTER WITH HAIRY HANDS

867
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:16,462
Everyone, be on your guard!

868
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,479
Does your arm hurt?

869
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:19,024
You just focus on driving.

870
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:35,291
Stay in the car. Don't go near the water.

871
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,502
What was that?

872
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:40,796
Does he think he's my dad or something?

873
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,472
Si-ho!

874
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:52,308
Si-ho!

875
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:05,297
Let go of me.

876
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,925
I told you it was dangerous. It's a trap!

877
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:10,094
Si-ho is on that boat.

878
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:11,804
Get yourself together!

879
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,181
My sister is on that boat!

880
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:34,618
You said

881
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:37,955
my sister was safe.

882
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,711
You said she was much safer
than when she was with me.

883
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:49,174
Why did it have to be her…

884
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:51,927
and not me?

885
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:22,583
See? Because you didn't destroy her soul,
an innocent girl got hurt.

886
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:23,792
Are you behind this?

887
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,171
No. Some people are impatient.

888
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:29,298
He was a Monster in his previous life too.

889
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:30,883
I bet it was Teoreokson.

890
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,052
You gave him intel
and told him what to do.

891
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,345
Are you blaming me?

892
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:37,222
No. This is more your fault than mine.

893
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,184
The Monsters you killed are trying
to take revenge on you.

894
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:42,394
So they're after Min Sang-un
who has your soul.

895
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:45,647
Once your soul is destroyed,
they will stop.

896
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,692
So bring her here
before other people get hurt.

897
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:50,652
I'll give you a day.

898
01:14:52,362 --> 01:14:54,031
And let me remind you again.

899
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:56,700
You and I are not enemies.

900
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,035
Our real enemy…

901
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:02,080
is that woman.

902
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:20,599
Was that him?

903
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:24,228
Tell him to take me.

904
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,398
No. Tell him that I'll come to him.

905
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,817
He can have my soul or whatever he wants.

906
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:35,280
But tell him to let my sister go.

907
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,077
I don't care if I die.

908
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,703
Call him back now.

909
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:47,960
No. I will save your sister.

910
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:51,380
You asked me to kill Bulgasal, right?

911
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:53,632
To get revenge for your family.

912
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,635
You said I was the sword
that could kill him.

913
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:03,809
I will help you, but you will help me too.

914
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,145
Find a way to kill him.

915
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:10,732
Until I kill him…

916
01:16:12,776 --> 01:16:13,860
I will…

917
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,617
let you live as a human.

918
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:10,834
He can have my soul or whatever he wants.

919
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:12,461
Tell him to let my sister go.

920
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:14,546
No. I will help you.

921
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,215
Find a way to kill him.

922
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:19,885
I need to win Dan Hwal over at all costs.

923
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:21,511
Whose fingerprints are they?

924
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,597
They couldn't be identified.

925
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,973
What is it this time?

926
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,392
Why would you barge in here
and pester him?

927
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,810
I finally get to meet you.

928
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,063
Run!

929
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,816
He's still fighting him.

930
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,485
I need to help.

931
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:41,740
