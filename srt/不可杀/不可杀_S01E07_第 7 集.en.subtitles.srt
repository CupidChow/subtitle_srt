1
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,828
A scar on my shoulder?

2
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,957
When I checked your sister's dead body,
I saw the scar.

3
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,001
Since you two shared my soul,

4
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,128
you must have that scar as well.

5
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,219
Like you said, she had a scar
on her shoulder from birth.

6
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,889
But I didn't have one.

7
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,891
That means…

8
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,811
I wasn't Bulgasal.

9
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,274
Who exactly are you?

10
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,152
I want to know too.

11
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,321
Are you sure I'm the one…

12
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,783
you want to take revenge on?

13
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,248
We can find out.

14
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,499
Let's go and check.

15
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,543
Right now.

16
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,589
EPISODE 7

17
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,476
Hey! You need to take more…

18
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,603
Gosh, that brat.

19
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,440
Goodness. Oh, my.

20
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,777
Ms. Lee, don't you think
we bought way too much stuff?

21
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,279
He might give us an earful.

22
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,739
We have more packages coming too.

23
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,909
What choice did we have?
There's nothing in this house.

24
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,578
Why are you hugging that?

25
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,205
Go and tell them to come out.
We have too much stuff.

26
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,540
Okay.

27
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,542
We get to have rice starting today.

28
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,713
Why is he so excited?
Hasn't he had rice before?

29
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,678
Well, it's only a dress.
He won't be mad, right?

30
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,723
This dress is totally me.

31
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,808
It looks great on me.

32
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,936
-Ms. Lee!
-Oh, my goodness.

33
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,023
-What is it?
-No one is here.

34
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,150
Hwal and Sang-un aren't here either.

35
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,776
I wonder where they went.

36
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,278
What?

37
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,617
SANG-UN

38
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,370
I'm sorry. Can you tell me that again?

39
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,750
Sure. You said you didn't have
any headaches or ringing in your ears.

40
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,711
-No vomiting or nausea?
-Right.

41
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,379
You're fine then.

42
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,091
By the way, she's your niece?

43
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,595
Well…

44
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,513
She's my sister's daughter.

45
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,308
I see. But are you not going to marry?

46
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,935
You could have had a daughter her age.

47
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,479
Do you want me to set you up?
I know a friend who's single.

48
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,813
Shut up, you quack.

49
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,318
So does she have a concussion or not?

50
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,153
I don't think so.

51
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,030
Do you want her to take an X-ray?

52
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,032
Yes. Get her an X-ray.

53
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,118
Wait. I have a question.

54
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,328
Yes?

55
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,672
Is it safe for a pregnant woman
to get an X-ray?

56
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,757
What? Pregnant?

57
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,151
Hey.

58
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,864
Who's the father? Your boyfriend?

59
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,993
My ex-boyfriend.

60
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,579
Your ex? Did you guys break up?
Does he know that you're pregnant?

61
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,208
Yes. He said he wanted no part in this.
So I said okay.

62
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,752
What? Why are you the only one
taking care of the baby?

63
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,129
What an asshole.

64
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,798
You should have dated a nice guy.

65
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,301
Do you think I knew he was
a jerk from the beginning?

66
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,720
I dated him because
he was nice to me at first.

67
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,763
Besides, he's handsome.

68
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,974
I tend to fall for hot guys.

69
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,477
Hot guys? It's not like
you can live off of their looks.

70
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,979
Why do you keep nagging me?

71
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,064
This is hard on me too.

72
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,026
Besides, I can just be a good mother.

73
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,653
Don't you know
how hard it is being a single…

74
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,700
I mean…

75
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,204
I'm old enough to be your dad.

76
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,666
I'm just worried like any parent would be.

77
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,919
How would you know how parents feel?

78
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,629
You're not even married.

79
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,506
Well, right.

80
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,384
I'm not married.

81
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,059
Well…

82
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,686
thank you, detective.

83
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,939
For taking me to the hospital

84
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,233
and for helping my sister.

85
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,318
Don't mention it.

86
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,405
I feel responsible
for the case from 15 years ago.

87
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,866
And I'm personally interested
in Bulgasal too.

88
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,202
Why personally?

89
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,162
I just am.

90
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,124
Is there anything you know about Bulgasal?

91
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,045
Oh, I heard a name from my sister.

92
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,296
Ok Eul-tae.

93
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,673
Ok Eul-tae?

94
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,888
Ok Eul-tae.

95
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,646
Hey, Sang-un. I'm on my way home.

96
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,361
What? Where?

97
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,823
I'm just out.

98
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,159
Yes. He's with me too.

99
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,704
Gosh. Don't worry.

100
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,039
See you at home.

101
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,794
What did the doctor say?

102
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,338
-She's fine.
-That's good.

103
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,757
What?

104
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,927
Are you worried about my sister?

105
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,558
Come to think of it, you were also worried
about her when she was abducted. Why…

106
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,833
Why are we here? There's nothing here.

107
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,546
There used to be a house

108
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,548
that two families lived in.

109
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,050
But it burned down
in the middle of the night

110
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,635
fifty years ago.

111
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,431
So why are we at a place where
a fire took place 50 years ago?

112
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,643
Their eldest daughter was you.

113
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,395
What?

114
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,942
I'm talking about your past life.

115
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,529
My past life?

116
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,532
Your name was Kim Hwa-yeon.

117
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,534
You were about the same age.

118
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,042
BULGASAL

119
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,295
YEAR 1971

120
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,130
According to her neighbors,

121
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,466
Kim Hwa-yeon always stayed at home.

122
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,136
And she never set foot outside the house.

123
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,639
They said she was afraid of something.

124
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,820
Her parents were worried about her,
so they tried everything.

125
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,865
Including rituals and drugs.

126
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,743
Take your medicine.

127
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,370
Please take it. Please?

128
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,913
Hwa-yeon.

129
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,460
-Hwa-yeon.
-Hwa-yeon!

130
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,837
What on earth is wrong with you?

131
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,134
Father, don't.

132
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,304
-Please don't.
-Her neighbors just thought she was crazy.

133
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,724
Father, stop it. Please.

134
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,356
Only her younger sister accepted her
for who she was and took care of her.

135
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,149
Are you okay, Hwa-yeon?

136
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,992
Hwa-yeon.

137
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,537
-No, you can't go in there.
-One day, a fire broke out at the house.

138
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,498
The neighbors said

139
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,376
that the crazy elder daughter
set the house on fire before running away.

140
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,669
Please help them!

141
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,051
The fire killed her parents

142
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,679
along with another family
that was renting rooms from them.

143
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,431
No! Mom!

144
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,477
The younger sister who worked late
at a factory was the only survivor.

145
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,440
Her name was Kim Go-bun.

146
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,153
Why? Why did you do that, sister?

147
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,364
You shouldn't have run away like that!

148
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,742
It came after you left.

149
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,452
Our house was engulfed in flames.

150
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:23,706
Our parents were trapped inside the house.

151
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,500
That can't be.

152
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,254
I killed my parents in my past life?

153
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,714
There was a witness.

154
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,342
The police got a statement
from a neighbor who saw her

155
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,637
running away into the mountains
after setting the house on fire.

156
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,931
So what happened to Kim Hwa-yeon?

157
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,032
It was here.

158
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,786
She died here
when Ok Eul-tae came after her.

159
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,457
Kim Hwa-yeon's belongings
were found nearby,

160
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,876
but her body was gone.

161
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,961
Ok Eul-tae probably took it.

162
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,132
She ran away to the mountains,
but Ok Eul-tae killed her?

163
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,550
He killed her here?

164
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,095
Do you remember anything?

165
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,485
No.

166
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,487
This is where you died a seventh time.

167
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,615
I don't remember anything.

168
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,411
But are you sure
Kim Hwa-yeon set the house on fire?

169
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,330
Why would she do that?

170
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,211
It was to run away from Ok Eul-tae
by faking her own death.

171
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,176
She sacrificed her family
just to save herself?

172
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,972
Only an evil spirit would do such a thing.

173
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,516
You keep forgetting
that you weren't human.

174
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,268
Just look at Ok Eul-tae.

175
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,520
Human lives didn't matter to you at all.

176
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,233
Are you sure I was Kim Hwa-yeon?

177
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,277
I don't have a scar on my shoulder.

178
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,903
Are you sure I was Bulgasal?

179
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,447
Yes, you were.

180
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,157
I don't know what you're up to,

181
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,534
being born without the scar
and without memories.

182
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,121
But you were Bulgasal who killed people.

183
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,792
Just keep going.
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

184
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,212
The sun will go down soon.
And you'll walk slower.

185
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,797
That's why I wanted to come
once my ankle healed.

186
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,841
But you didn't listen to me.

187
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,017
What?

188
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,020
Are you going to carry me on your back?

189
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,230
Why? That's a hassle.

190
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,442
Hey.

191
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,277
Hey.

192
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,239
We're here. Goodness.

193
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,533
Hold on. I think you can put me down now.

194
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,785
Hey! Goodness.

195
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,705
You're unbelievable.
Do you think I'm a piece of luggage?

196
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,499
You're heavy for a girl.

197
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,920
I'm tall! My bones are heavy. That's all.

198
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,755
We need a place to stay for the night.

199
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,966
Aren't we going home?

200
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,301
We're not going back
until you remember something.

201
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,472
Listen. How can ordinary people
remember their past lives?

202
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,182
But you're not ordinary.

203
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,226
Your sister remembered them.

204
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,436
She was…

205
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,191
Gosh, he's impossible.

206
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,955
Right.

207
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,209
But how do you know so much
about a case from 50 years ago?

208
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,841
Because I came to find you
the day the house was set on fire.

209
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,593
But I was late.

210
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,637
It was after Ok Eul-tae
had already found and killed you.

211
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:57,396
Ok Eul-tae was good at finding me
in my past lives and still is.

212
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,525
But I know nothing about him.

213
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,445
I only know his name.

214
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,866
Ok Eul-tae?

215
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,666
Who is Ok Eul-tae?

216
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,502
That's what I need you to find out.
Find out what he does.

217
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,130
Bullshit. You want me
to do that with just his name?

218
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,341
Come on. I don't have
a lot of proper work these days.

219
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,764
And my VIP client hasn't called lately.

220
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,894
He was scary,
but he was so generous with money.

221
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,607
Oh, the client who wanted you
to find a woman?

222
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,400
I guess he already found her.

223
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,654
What? You think so?

224
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,405
Damn it.

225
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,661
How much will you pay me for Ok Eul-tae?

226
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,372
It's a personal request
so I can't pay you much.

227
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,000
Why are you looking for him?

228
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,254
He's the killer from my case
that happened 15 years ago.

229
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,673
The killer?

230
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,176
Don't you have any colleagues
who still work at the station?

231
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,596
I do have one.

232
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,351
But he's such an asshole.

233
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,733
That's hot. Be careful, Captain Ham.

234
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,569
I don't drink sugary coffee.

235
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,905
What? Why are you here again?

236
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,366
I wanted to ask you something.

237
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,744
Have you heard of a guy named Ok Eul-tae?

238
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,706
Never heard of him. Who is Ok Eul-tae?

239
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,875
It's about my case from 15 years ago.

240
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,294
The higher-ups closed my case abruptly.

241
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,423
And I think that guy, Ok Eul-tae,
might be behind that.

242
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,882
What are you talking about?

243
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,927
Remember the guy
who suddenly turned himself in?

244
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,846
And the higher-ups told us to close it.

245
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,264
That was all set up.

246
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,390
That was because…

247
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,061
the detective in charge launched
a coercive investigation,

248
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,855
and the suspect committed suicide.

249
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,818
Hey, take it. You should leave now.

250
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,070
I don't want to talk about this

251
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,488
over a cheap cup of coffee.

252
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,951
Hey. Then who told you
to wrap up the recent case?

253
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,245
The murderer who died in the pool.

254
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,621
He didn't commit suicide.

255
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,623
Who told you to wrap up the case?

256
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,334
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

257
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,670
Both cases have to do with Ok Eul-tae.

258
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,882
-He must be behind these cases.
-What?

259
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,188
Hey, that guy looks familiar.

260
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,607
He's the Mayor.

261
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:51,487
He was the prosecutor in charge
of Min Sang-yeon's case 15 years ago.

262
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,404
Right.

263
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,073
So what?

264
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,574
Why is he here?

265
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,035
What's the Mayor doing
at a police station?

266
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,454
Did he…

267
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,707
come to the station frequently

268
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,752
during the swimming pool case?

269
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,423
Well, I didn't see him every time,
but I know he was here.

270
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,944
Wait.

271
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,695
What?

272
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,573
Don't go after the Mayor.

273
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,409
I heard a few things.
He's really dangerous.

274
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,203
Just listen to me.

275
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,949
What is this place?

276
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,247
Seriously?
Why must I wear this every time?

277
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,624
We're not here to play games.

278
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,462
He's been meeting so many people
for a long time, so it gets confusing.

279
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,965
SANGYONG CITY MAYOR

280
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,425
This way.

281
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,354
He called all of you?

282
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,274
Come on. He didn't tell me
that you would all be here.

283
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,902
-We should come running if we're summoned.
-That's right.

284
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,530
Hey, are you already flattering him
to be on his good side?

285
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,740
This is your first term.

286
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,785
You also came running like a dog.
Don't be like that.

287
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,914
You're still wet behind your ears.
Do you have a death wish?

288
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,709
Why the hell are you fighting
on a good day like this?

289
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,295
Sit down.

290
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,888
You should get along with others
to be good people. Okay?

291
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,934
Brief me.

292
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,894
Did you check the deed?

293
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,062
Yes.

294
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,065
All right. Let's see.

295
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,652
The house belongs to…

296
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,487
What? Ok Eul-tae?

297
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,698
He's the guy you're looking for.

298
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,576
Nice. How did you find him?

299
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,037
This is Ok Eul-tae's house?

300
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,040
The relocation of the terminal

301
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,459
is getting delayed due to the residents.

302
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,212
We compensated them but they won't budge.

303
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,630
Tear them down.

304
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,217
Well, there's another problem
besides the residents.

305
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,636
An environmental organization
has raised problems.

306
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,098
It might affect
the preliminary feasibility tests.

307
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,808
Just find a way to tear them down.

308
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,768
Yes, sir.

309
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,646
-All good, right? No more questions. Done.
-But…

310
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,523
I just don't understand

311
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,984
why you're staying in Sangyong City,
and not the capital.

312
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,279
You are too good
to stay in this rural city, sir.

313
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,908
SANGYONG CITY MAYOR
SANGYONG CITY CONGRESSMAN

314
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,536
A very long time ago,

315
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,664
I did business all over the capital.

316
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,457
But it was too exhausting.

317
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,169
People kept coming to me.
There were so many moochers.

318
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,296
You get me, right?

319
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,882
I'm comfortable here
because this city is completely mine.

320
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,177
I know everything
that goes on in this city.

321
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,306
Who was that? Your daughter.

322
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,641
Does she still do drugs?

323
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,184
Pardon?

324
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,812
Gosh. What drugs?

325
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,897
She never did drugs.

326
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,401
What? Why does he say that?
You can't say that to me, Mr. Mayor.

327
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,654
I know everything that goes on here.
Why are you lying to me?

328
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,328
I can easily plant people
to be my eyes and ears.

329
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,582
I do that because
humans try to stab me in the back

330
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,959
and take a mile when I give them an inch.

331
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,885
Hey, what's up?

332
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,929
Dan Hwal went with her?

333
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,473
What? They're getting along.

334
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,434
It sounded like he was going to kill her
and take her soul.

335
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,062
Okay. Find out where
they went together and let me know.

336
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,898
I need to know what they are up to.

337
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,276
Okay. Thanks.

338
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,844
ACCOMMODATION

339
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,222
Are we really getting one room?

340
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,559
It's dangerous to be alone.

341
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,479
Ok Eul-tae might be watching us even now.

342
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,816
What? Do you snore?

343
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,821
I don't snore.
I just have disruptive sleep behavior.

344
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,825
You might be uncomfortable. I don't care.

345
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,552
Here. Change your bandages.

346
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:14,703
Hey. Aren't you cold?

347
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,581
Are you okay?

348
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,462
Are you sleeping?

349
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,207
-What?
-What happened?

350
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,834
-Do something!
-There are people inside!

351
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,671
-My goodness.
-They're still in there.

352
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,675
Oh, no. What do we do?

353
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,468
Mom…

354
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,767
I'm relieved.

355
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,688
Mom. Dad. Run away.

356
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,651
I'm relieved that you are in agony.

357
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,155
I want you to suffer…

358
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,908
because of…

359
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,036
the evil deeds you have committed.

360
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,559
Gosh, I feel so stiff.

361
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,950
What? Why are you staring at me?

362
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,411
You're very different at night.

363
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,705
In what way?

364
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,503
Did I talk a lot in my sleep?

365
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,758
Gosh, you lovebirds
must be on a romantic trip.

366
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,261
We're not a couple.

367
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,225
Goodness. The honeymoon phase is sweet.

368
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,688
You don't want anything, Mr. Boyfriend?

369
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,316
I'm fine.

370
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,819
I bet. You must be full
just by looking at her.

371
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,868
Gosh. What is she thinking?

372
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,287
Why didn't you say anything?

373
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,165
It doesn't matter.

374
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,293
Eat up quickly. We need to go somewhere.

375
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,296
What? Where?

376
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,633
We're going to meet
Kim Hwa-yeon's neighbors

377
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,010
who remember what happened 50 years ago.

378
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,390
You might remember something
when you talk to them.

379
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,684
Well…

380
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,438
I guess so.

381
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,945
I'll be in the car.
Eat up and meet me there.

382
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,869
I think I might get indigestion.

383
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,136
Come on. Is she serious?

384
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,596
How could she spend the night out
without telling me?

385
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,682
She should know how dangerous that is.

386
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,600
Is that Sang-un? Where is she?

387
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,019
I don't know.
She won't tell me where she is.

388
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,021
She just tells me not to worry.

389
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,316
What? You're still eating?

390
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,193
You two are the slowest eaters.

391
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,029
Finish up before the packages come.
We have work to do.

392
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,990
What? What work?

393
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,288
This isn't right.

394
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,751
Here. I'll clean the living room.

395
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,793
Clean the bathroom.

396
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,254
What? No.

397
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,300
You should clean the bathroom.

398
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,512
Hey, this bathroom is a dump.

399
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,640
I was abducted pretty recently.

400
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,393
So my head hurts,
and I feel nauseous. Okay?

401
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,729
Stop lying. The doctor said you were fine.

402
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,691
I moved all that stuff yesterday.
You didn't see it. But it was heavy.

403
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,360
My wrist hurts.
Look. My wrist is messed up.

404
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,571
Don't you feel bad making me work?

405
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,656
No. I pity myself more
for getting abducted

406
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,533
and being on the run without a home.

407
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,536
-So you should clean it.
-I'm homeless too.

408
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,873
I grew up in an orphanage.
I don't have any family.

409
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,958
Hey, I don't have parents either.

410
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,419
I lost them in an accident as a kid.
I only have Sang-un.

411
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,296
You at least have her. I'm all alone.

412
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,507
You're frustrating.
I bet you were bad at math.

413
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,467
Hey, this isn't about math.

414
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,676
Be quiet, you brats.

415
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,137
I told you to clean. Why are you chatting?

416
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:10,892
Ms. Lee, she keeps
bringing up my painful past.

417
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,852
-I had to say something.
-You little…

418
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,062
Your painful past?

419
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,857
Gosh. You think
you're the only one with a sob story?

420
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,610
Here's a story about a girl.

421
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,445
She lost her parents in an accident,

422
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,656
so she had a tough life at an orphanage.

423
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,991
She married a man
who wasn't even good to her.

424
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,827
When she was pregnant,

425
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,204
he had an affair
with another woman and left her.

426
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,915
She tried so hard
to have the baby by herself,

427
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,958
but she miscarried.

428
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,377
She tried everything to end her life,

429
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,672
but she couldn't
as it wasn't her time yet.

430
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,674
Gosh, what a tough life.

431
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,384
Who is that woman?

432
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,679
Me.

433
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,391
So who's going to clean the bathroom?

434
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,143
We should do it.

435
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,186
-We'll do it.
-Right.

436
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,730
Okay.

437
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,250
Ms. Lee, do you need help with anything?

438
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,503
I'm good. I'm almost done.

439
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,755
No, let me help you.

440
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,140
By the way,
there's something I've been curious about.

441
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,100
How did you meet that man, Hwal?

442
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,935
Him?

443
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,273
I told you I was orphaned
because I lost my parents in an accident.

444
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,568
Hwal saved me from the accident.
He supported me at the orphanage too.

445
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,236
He saved you from the accident?

446
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,654
How?

447
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,823
I don't remember.

448
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,825
I lost my memories
because of the accident.

449
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,037
You lost your memories?

450
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,623
Yes. It happened when I was six years old.

451
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,041
I have no memories before then.

452
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,586
Then everything you know

453
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,714
must be what that man, Hwal, told you.

454
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:05,757
Right.

455
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,886
Aren't you curious?

456
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,012
About what?

457
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,389
Were you really in an accident?

458
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,516
Do you think he could have lied to you?

459
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,727
Gosh. What are you talking about?
Why would he?

460
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,939
I don't know.

461
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,734
I just didn't think
Bulgasal would want to help people.

462
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,197
Which brings me to my point.

463
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,074
Should I take a look?

464
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,785
-Take a look at what?
-Your past.

465
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,412
Right! Hwal told me.

466
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,289
You can see people's pasts, right?

467
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,916
Oh, right.

468
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,211
Didn't you say that
at the motel when we first met?

469
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,379
That he knew me well.

470
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,130
How does he know about me?

471
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,425
Oh, that? I'm not really sure.

472
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,470
We're busy today.
Let's talk some other time.

473
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,223
My goodness. My legs.

474
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,855
This? I had it ever since I was young.

475
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,440
It must be from the accident.

476
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,194
It looks like a burn.

477
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,697
Then the accident you were in…

478
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,074
Was it a fire?

479
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,411
Well, I wouldn't know. Give me that.

480
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,122
Fire?

481
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:23,543
Yes. The fire that took place
at Kim Hwa-yeon's house 50 years ago.

482
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:26,212
Why are you asking me that?
Did you hear the rumor?

483
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,090
Are you from a TV station?

484
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,342
To tell people
that our village is haunted?

485
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,427
Haunted?

486
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,178
Don't ask me any more questions.

487
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,724
If you go around and ask people
about the fire, they'll beat you up.

488
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:41,269
Ma'am. Please help us.
Tell us what you know.

489
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,270
Please.

490
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,563
I don't know!

491
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,694
Do you know Kim Go-bun,
the younger sister of Kim Hwa-yeon?

492
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,115
Kim Go-bun is my grandmother.

493
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,828
I think I'm related to Kim Hwa-yeon.

494
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:01,914
What?

495
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,806
Well…

496
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,934
there have been
a lot of fires in our village.

497
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,854
A gifted shaman here said

498
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,024
it's because it is haunted
by Kim Hwa-yeon's spirit.

499
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,445
We would have a few peaceful years
after performing a ritual.

500
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,990
But there was another fire a while ago.

501
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,868
Ms. Ulsan who lived alone…

502
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,039
Goodness.

503
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,629
What do you think happened?

504
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,632
Did someone set the house on fire?

505
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,844
Kim Hwa-yeon died 50 years ago.

506
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,601
But there have been fires
for years even after her death?

507
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:09,482
Could it be Gapsangoe?

508
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,819
GAPSANGOE: A MONSTER IN THE MOUNT GAP AREA
THAT KILLS PEOPLE WITH FIRE

509
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,838
Drum harder!

510
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,302
Gapsangoe hates the sound of drums.

511
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,306
That Monster burns people to death.

512
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,730
I see fire! Get ready!

513
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,827
Kim Hwa-yeon's family?

514
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,913
Yes. Do you remember Kim Go-bun,
Kim Hwa-yeon's younger sister?

515
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,291
I think it was her granddaughter.

516
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,962
I was wondering if she would be able
to coax the spirit out of here

517
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,506
since she's Kim Hwa-yeon's family.

518
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,343
I will meet with her. Where did she go?

519
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,220
I think she went that way.

520
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,766
A reincarnation of Gapsangoe?

521
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,312
Starting from 50 years ago,

522
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,231
this village suffered
repeatedly from fires.

523
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,860
This so-called Kim Hwa-yeon's spirit
is Gapsangoe.

524
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,114
Just like the other Monsters,
it must've come here following her scent.

525
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,824
And it must still be here.

526
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,660
Then Kim Hwa-yeon didn't start that fire

527
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,495
from 50 years ago.

528
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,707
I believe it was Gapsangoe's doing.

529
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,501
Then let's find Gapsangoe.

530
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,921
If it's still here, I can find it.

531
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,089
We have to find out
what happened 50 years ago.

532
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,473
Follow the fire. The fire.

533
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,228
50 YEARS AGO

534
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,606
-What do we do?
-How did this happen?

535
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,228
Mom!

536
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,897
Mom!

537
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,066
Mom!

538
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,260
Come here.

539
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,055
Have you seen this woman?

540
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:14,226
That's the landlord's eldest daughter.

541
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,853
Where did you last see her?

542
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,316
She ran away.

543
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,569
To that mountain.

544
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,200
But, mister…

545
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,786
what about my mom and dad?

546
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,455
They're still inside the house.

547
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,842
If you go down that way,
you'll see your neighbors.

548
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,061
Going after her is pointless.

549
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,440
She's dead.

550
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,569
Dark Hole destroyed
her soul and killed her.

551
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,323
How do you know that?

552
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,911
If you want to find her, follow the fire.

553
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,330
The fire.

554
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,174
What are you talking about?

555
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,435
The baby should have been killed when
it was covered in its dead mother's blood.

556
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,645
The curse of the blood
should have ended then!

557
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,940
If it ended then,
this wouldn't have happened!

558
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,400
This wouldn't have happened!

559
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,327
Are you here…

560
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,331
because of my karma too?

561
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,002
Why…

562
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,325
Come on.

563
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,911
My arm hurts.

564
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,246
If you don't want to do it, forget it.
I'm busy.

565
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,915
I'll do it. I will.

566
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,334
I'm just nervous.

567
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,794
I've never purposely done this.

568
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,296
Right.

569
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:50,007
Why are you so curious about my past?
I just don't get it.

570
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,594
I want to check
if that man really saved you.

571
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:59,099
If I know he's not a bad man,
I wouldn't worry when they're together.

572
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,647
But I don't believe in stuff like this.
I don't even go to shamans.

573
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,774
You think I'm a shaman?

574
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:10,402
-You're not?
-What? Of course, I'm not.

575
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,697
When I touch people's hands,
I just see their pasts.

576
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,867
I had a tough childhood because of this.

577
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,829
The pasts I saw were mostly bad.

578
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,293
Don't be nervous.

579
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,587
I'm just an old, boring woman.

580
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,590
Here.

581
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,468
I'll do it now.

582
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,576
Mom!

583
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,621
What's wrong?

584
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,518
Where am I going?

585
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,354
You'll come with me.

586
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,358
You will be helpful to me someday.

587
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,071
Who is it?

588
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,782
Who's watching me?

589
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,826
You're watching my soul's memories, right?

590
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,749
If you are, take them.

591
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,586
Take all of my soul's memories.

592
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,546
They're painful!

593
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,892
Your nose is bleeding!

594
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,731
You talked to me.

595
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,485
What are you talking about?
You're not making any sense.

596
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,659
What's wrong? What on earth did you see?

597
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,285
Gosh. Your body is cold as ice.

598
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,788
Wait here.
I'll go and bring some honey water.

599
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,055
Goodness. What just happened?

600
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,057
I shouldn't have asked her to see my past.

601
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,570
Ms. Lee.

602
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,990
-Ms. Lee!
-Yes?

603
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,451
Yes. Goodness. What is it?

604
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,829
You were spacing out for a second.

605
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,999
Our packages will arrive soon.

606
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,333
-Already?
-Yes.

607
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,960
Gosh. I'm not done cleaning yet.

608
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,462
Did you clean the living room?

609
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,005
Already done.

610
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,383
Since I'm done cleaning,
I'll go out for a while.

611
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,885
I need to be somewhere.

612
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,179
Where? You said you had no friends.

613
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,055
Are you leaving to avoid cleaning?

614
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,475
Gosh. I also have a personal life.

615
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,062
Be back before dinner. Okay?

616
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,065
Gosh. That was kind of touching.

617
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,569
That sounded like something
you'd say to your family. Right?

618
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,029
As if.

619
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,531
Hwal might come home before you.

620
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,824
We should get scolded together.

621
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,285
It's not like he'll hurt us.

622
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,746
Besides, why isn't he coming home?

623
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,664
I have no idea.

624
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,750
They left to find her memories.

625
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,002
Those so-called enemies
seem to get along well.

626
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,382
Where are we?

627
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,302
You said we were meeting
a witness from 50 years ago.

628
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:49,139
This shaman's son was the witness
who saw Kim Hwa-yeon

629
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,307
set the house on fire.

630
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,944
Don't come out. Watch from here.

631
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,196
What will you do?

632
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,956
Excuse me.

633
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,543
Are you the shaman's son?

634
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,002
Yes. Why?

635
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,883
I'm looking into the fires
that took place here.

636
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,054
I have nothing to say.

637
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,390
The police told me not to say anything.

638
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:36,144
Fifty years ago, you said Kim Hwa-yeon
ran away after setting the house on fire.

639
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,064
That was a long time ago.
I don't remember it.

640
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:46,196
I smell something funny in your car.
It smells like paint thinners.

641
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,199
I use them for rituals.

642
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,286
I'm preparing for a ritual
because a fire broke out.

643
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:53,829
Could you look over there?

644
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,509
Stop bothering me. Or I'll call the cops.

645
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,235
Was it him?

646
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:29,865
It wasn't him. I didn't sense anything.

647
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,450
That can't be.

648
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,706
Your hand…

649
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,967
I'm sure it's coming from inside.

650
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,345
But my hand is barely shaking.

651
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,431
This is odd.

652
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,796
Oh, my. Am I dreaming or what?

653
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,758
I have been waiting for a very long time.

654
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:35,180
I couldn't leave this world
because I had to see you.

655
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:39,351
Come here. Let me see you.

656
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,287
Gapsangoe. It's been a while.

657
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,873
You set up a nice hideout here.

658
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,960
Do you know me?

659
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,295
Who are you?

660
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:11,842
I don't remember meeting you.

661
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,803
If you did,
you would've wanted to kill me, not her.

662
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,488
Did you cause the fires here
for the past 50 years?

663
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,784
Yes, I did.

664
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:43,206
At first, I was deceived by Dark Hole.

665
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,126
So I set that woman's house on fire.

666
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,755
But the fire was so beautiful.

667
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:55,177
And I loved hearing people scream too.

668
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,814
You have a lot of drums.

669
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,275
You didn't like
the sound of drums in your past life.

670
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:14,821
My son put all of those here.

671
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:20,160
That bastard is watching me,
just like his father.

672
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,414
In case I go out and set houses on fire.

673
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:29,544
He keeps playing the drums day and night

674
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,296
and it's torturing me.

675
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:34,966
It hurts as if I'm possessed by a spirit.

676
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:43,642
But my son told me something
that made me proud today.

677
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,811
What did he say?

678
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,397
He told me a woman from another region

679
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,859
is asking around
about the incident from 50 years ago.

680
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,320
I realized at that moment

681
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:58,532
that the dead Kim Hwa-yeon had come back.

682
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:05,789
If I knew she would come
and find me here on her own,

683
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,626
I wouldn't have asked him to do that.

684
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,005
Do what?

685
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:19,427
I told him…

686
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,232
that this was the last time

687
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:38,697
and that I wouldn't start another fire
if he killed that woman.

688
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:45,036
My son probably went
to grant me my last wish.

689
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,091
What did you just say?

690
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,344
You sent your son
to kill me as your last wish?

691
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,600
He went to start a fire.

692
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,186
No…

693
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,906
Where are you going?

694
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,365
We have to stop him.

695
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,701
Later. Focus on
getting your memories back.

696
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,745
Stop talking like a Monster!

697
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,872
-What?
-Just like 50 years ago,

698
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,833
innocent people might die because of me.

699
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,712
I ran away that time,
but I'll stop the fire this time.

700
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,758
Let go of me unless you'll help.
I don't have much time.

701
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,434
Hold onto it.

702
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,978
I'll be back soon. Wait for me here.

703
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,230
Whatever you do, don't enter her room.

704
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:55,815
You're going alone?

705
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,068
It's faster this way.

706
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,904
Do you know where her son went?

707
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,322
It's obvious.

708
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,163
ACCOMMODATION

709
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:14,417
The village chief and I were
going to pay the shaman a visit.

710
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:18,713
My mother isn't feeling well these days.

711
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,757
We have to postpone the ritual.

712
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,550
By the way…

713
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:28,223
a woman who looks like her
is staying here, right?

714
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,977
Gosh, she looks just like that woman.

715
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,687
She's staying here.

716
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,692
-Hurry, Mom.
-Okay.

717
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,443
-Hello.
-Hello.

718
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,028
-Rest up.
-Okay.

719
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,697
You have a lot of customers today.

720
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,032
I had a busy week.

721
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,909
A lot of families came.

722
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,621
They're quite unlucky.

723
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,998
And so are you.

724
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,166
Pardon?

725
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,669
It's over now. It's over.

726
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,806
Right, Mom?

727
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,369
The man you came with isn't human, right?

728
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,415
He smells

729
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:39,294
just like the man with the dark hole

730
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,921
that I met 50 years ago.

731
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,923
Why are you with him?

732
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:48,094
He's the same as the man who killed you.

733
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:50,805
You…

734
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,142
tried to kill me in my past life, right?

735
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:59,022
Because you ran away

736
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,233
after abandoning your family.

737
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,112
Are you sure?

738
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,870
You're feeling bad about it?

739
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,414
What's so awful
about running away to save yourself?

740
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,044
You were born that way.

741
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,296
You're like me.

742
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,424
You were born as a human,

743
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,928
but you don't have any human emotions.

744
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,351
But I was close.

745
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,978
I chased after you,

746
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,607
but Dark Hole had already killed you.

747
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,568
I resented him so much for it.

748
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:56,746
I did see something interesting
after that though.

749
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,083
Something interesting?

750
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,129
Dark Hole.

751
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,964
His…

752
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,299
secret.

753
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,722
Dark Hole?

754
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,560
Ok Eul-tae's secret?

755
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,115
-You have a visitor.
-I know.

756
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,751
You're here.

757
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,059
I'm so tired.

758
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,729
The walk to your house
from the bus stop is too long.

759
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,439
It is? Thanks. Come here.

760
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,024
Sit down and get some rest.

761
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,692
Gosh, thanks for coming here.

762
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,070
Sit. You must be thirsty.

763
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,490
Here.

764
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,162
Sir, can't we just talk
on the phone next time?

765
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,914
Why? This way, I get to see you.

766
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,583
Also, I told you to call me by my name.
Why won't you?

767
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,293
Right.

768
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,754
It doesn't roll off my tongue.

769
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:31,090
By the way,
why did you want to see me today?

770
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,098
Nine.

771
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,563
This is why you wanted to see me?

772
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,525
-Eul-tae. You have no friends, right?
-No.

773
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,071
Don't you play new games?

774
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,156
You can buy gaming devices. You're rich.

775
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,283
Gosh. They give me headaches.

776
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,993
I'm old school, you know.

777
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,703
Goodness.

778
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:04,415
Right. Hwal didn't even have
an old computer at home.

779
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,127
Now that you stayed
with him for a while, how is he?

780
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,004
He's ill-tempered.

781
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,300
But he's not scary. I was really worried.

782
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,344
By the way,

783
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:19,013
I really almost died
when I was staging our encounter.

784
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,564
But thanks to him,
you easily got acquainted with Hwal.

785
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,233
Eul-tae, I'm not Bulgasal like you.

786
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,402
It really hurt like crazy.

787
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,864
But how much longer
do I have to watch Hwal?

788
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,951
It doesn't feel right.
I feel like I'm lying to him.

789
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,536
You don't have to feel bad.

790
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,705
This is actually going to help Hwal.

791
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,249
We're trying to protect him
from Min Sang-un.

792
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,171
But about that woman, Min Sang-un…

793
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,549
She's different from what you described.

794
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,301
She seemed ordinary.

795
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,053
Are you sure she's a bad person?

796
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,347
She only seems that way
because she lost her memories.

797
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,807
Her nature won't change.

798
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:06,519
It's in her nature to kill humans
and feed on human blood like a Monster.

799
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,315
Okay.

800
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,777
I see.

801
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:24,412
But if it's too much for you,
you can stop.

802
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,335
But aren't you curious
about your older brother?

803
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,296
How is he?

804
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,215
His treatment is going well.
He's gotten much better.

805
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,677
And here's a surprise present for you.
He might be discharged this year.

806
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,222
Really? Are you serious?

807
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,515
Thank you, Eul-tae.

808
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,310
Gosh, I wasn't fishing for gratitude.

809
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:50,772
You know that I care a lot
about the kids from your orphanage.

810
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:53,399
I'm especially attached to you brothers

811
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,693
because I met you when you were little.

812
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:59,030
I should thank you.
You are doing me a huge favor.

813
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,865
No, I'll keep trying.

814
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,954
But can I ask you one more question?

815
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,706
Sure. Ask away.

816
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,126
Did you have Si-ho abducted too?

817
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,754
-You didn't, right?
-I did. I told him to do it.

818
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,757
I see. Why?

819
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,804
Because I'm desperate.

820
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:27,892
I need to catch
Min Sang-un as soon as possible.

821
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,024
What did you see?

822
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:36,651
What's his secret?

823
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,737
I…

824
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:43,116
saw it.

825
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:46,494
I saw…

826
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,539
-Hey.
-Whatever you do, don't enter her room.

827
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:55,044
I saw it.

828
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:10,935
I saw it.

829
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:12,729
What did you say?

830
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:18,776
I saw him kill you.

831
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,321
And…

832
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:28,953
I saw him fall apart.

833
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,916
Are you disappointed
because I told him to abduct her?

834
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:36,919
Yes.

835
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,131
I don't want to hurt other people.

836
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:42,091
You said you were only after Min Sang-un.

837
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,719
Don't do that next time.
Si-ho is a nice person.

838
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:49,015
She might be sharp-tongued,
but she's had a difficult life.

839
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,810
Okay. I won't do that.

840
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,981
I'll never do that.

841
01:02:58,816 --> 01:02:59,942
Thank you.

842
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,195
I should get going.

843
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,863
I have to get back before dinner.

844
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,076
What about me?

845
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,496
Pardon?

846
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,040
I also had a harder life than you think.

847
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,418
You should look out for me too.

848
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,588
Come on. Seriously?

849
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:23,090
I'll come back.
Let's play a new game next time.

850
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,635
This one is so boring.
See you next time, Eul-tae.

851
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,562
My life has been the hardest.

852
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:42,318
His weakness is…

853
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,903
Tell me again.

854
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:51,160
His weakness is…

855
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,413
What is his weakness?

856
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,208
…you.

857
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,794
Right. I forgot to tell you something.

858
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:02,171
I found out
where Hwal and Min Sang-un went.

859
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,508
They went to the village
she lived in 50 years ago

860
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:08,010
to find her memories of her past life.

861
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,391
Do you know where that is?

862
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:15,893
Gapsangoe.

863
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,663
I finally got you.

864
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,915
I have been waiting for 50 years.

865
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,001
Come with me.

866
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,168
Let's die together!

867
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,010
Eul-tae.

868
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:51,387
Are you all right? Eul-tae!

869
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:19,290
I saw it when Dark Hole killed you.

870
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:22,627
When he stabbed you
in the stomach with a sword…

871
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,420
What's wrong?

872
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,924
I'm all right. Just go.

873
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,092
-What's wrong? Are you hurt?
-Leave!

874
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,687
…his stomach was also bleeding.

875
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,441
What's the bond between you and him?

876
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,117
You were the one who was stabbed.

877
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:59,497
Why was he in pain?

878
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,154
I told you not to come in.

879
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,286
Watch out.

880
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:09,817
Please. Let me have that woman.

881
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:14,739
Give me that woman.

882
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:16,866
No.

883
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:23,247
She's mine.

884
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:28,753
Your life of burning people
to death is over.

885
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,922
Never be born again.

886
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,064
Are you all right?

887
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,858
I have to kill her.

888
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:36,278
If I want to be free from this pain,

889
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,073
I have to kill her as soon as I can.

890
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,751
What about Gapsangoe? Is Gapsangoe dead?

891
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,716
Just like Teoreokson…

892
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:43,304
another Monster was born as a human.

893
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,639
But why did she kill people?

894
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,641
Because she wasn't human.

895
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:51,770
She can't live as a human like you can.

896
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,861
You stopped the fire, right?

897
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,404
What about Gapsangoe's son?

898
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,408
Don't tell me you killed him.

899
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:07,536
I handed him over to the cops
and stopped the fire.

900
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,583
I'm glad to hear that.

901
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:15,920
Are we going back home now?

902
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,297
There is one last place to check out.

903
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,966
Gapsangoe's son told me something.

904
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:53,666
Is that…

905
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,377
really me from my past life?

906
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:03,801
Gapsangoe's son saw
his mother bury your body.

907
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:09,431
Gapsangoe didn't even want
to lose your body to other people.

908
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:16,063
Do you remember anything
from seeing your past life?

909
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:21,986
But how come I didn't die in the fire?

910
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:26,907
Because you ran away

911
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,493
after abandoning your family.

912
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,537
The fire killed her parents

913
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,081
along with another family
that was renting rooms from them.

914
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:44,508
Why did this woman run away alone
instead of trying to save

915
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:47,052
the others?

916
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,515
Was it because she was evil

917
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,268
in her past life like you said?

918
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,604
I really…

919
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,358
didn't want to accept that.

920
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:05,070
But she abandoned the people
who were dying because of her…

921
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,908
and ran away alone just to save herself.

922
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,994
What she did was something
no human would do.

923
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,207
She probably died
all alone on this mountain.

924
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,418
But I don't even feel bad for her.

925
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,381
What on earth was I?

926
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,676
I really have no idea now.

927
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:10,594
You're slowing us down.

928
01:13:11,428 --> 01:13:12,346
The sun will set soon.

929
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:14,932
I'm coming.

930
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:24,817
What? So you can put me
over your shoulders again?

931
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,735
I can walk just fine.

932
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:31,407
Get on my back.

933
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:33,826
The sun will go down soon.

934
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,626
Don't complain about my weight.

935
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:01,520
You can easily carry me.
Is it because you're Bulgasal?

936
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,983
This is the first time
a man is carrying me on his back.

937
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:08,360
My father passed away when I was young.

938
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:12,156
If it's too much, you can put me down.

939
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:14,324
Are you listening?

940
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,452
Hey.

941
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:18,745
Hey.

942
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,335
It's Dan Hwal.

943
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:27,337
What?

944
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,590
My name is Dan Hwal.

945
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:33,427
So stop saying "Hey." It's distracting.

946
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,904
I should meet with Hwal.

947
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,907
He and Sang-un seem
to be getting along better than I thought.

948
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:22,286
When this photo was taken,
his name was Ok Sang-yeong.

949
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:25,455
I think he changes his identity
every 30 years.

950
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,249
I said not to do anything dangerous.

951
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:30,586
How can I just stay still
when a monster is roaming around?

952
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,756
Were you following me?

953
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,176
Does anyone know you're here with me?

954
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,304
It's hard to find missing people
in these areas.

955
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,847
I knew the truth.

956
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,058
I knew that you were
the true owner of her soul.

957
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:57,154
The moment that person
regains their memory,

958
01:16:57,237 --> 01:17:00,907
everyone here will die.

959
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:06,747
