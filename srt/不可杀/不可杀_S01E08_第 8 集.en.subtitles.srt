00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,870
EPISODE 8

2
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:19,871
Hey.

3
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,415
If it's too much, you can put me down.

4
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,294
Hey. Are you listening?

5
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,217
It's Dan Hwal.

6
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,219
What?

7
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,471
My name is Dan Hwal.

8
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,391
So stop saying "Hey." It's distracting.

9
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,167
What on earth was I?

10
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,586
I really have no idea now.

11
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,684
Oh, it's raining.

12
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,945
Instant noodles taste so good
on a rainy day.

13
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,616
You know…

14
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,077
I feel bad to be
the only one eating all the time.

15
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,704
Can you not eat at all?

16
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,165
I can, but I don't taste anything.

17
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,584
That must be hard.

18
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,253
Having good food is
the greatest pleasure in life.

19
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,214
I find no pleasure in living,
so it's fine.

20
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,931
So what are you planning to do
once you take my soul?

21
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,726
You mean what I'll do with you?

22
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,189
No. I'm too terrified to hear about that.
I'm asking about you.

23
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,735
What are you planning to do
once you become human again?

24
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm going to die.

25
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,657
-What?
-I have no desire to live.

26
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,204
I used to feel that way too.

27
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,790
When my mom and my sister died,

28
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,792
and I was the only one who survived.

29
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,128
The guilt was overwhelming.

30
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,464
I thought I'd be better off dead,

31
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,466
but then Si-ho would have been all alone.

32
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,885
That's why I strived to live.

33
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,387
Then at times, I felt joy.

34
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,556
I even laughed sometimes.

35
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,851
What are you getting at?

36
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,813
So what I'm trying to say is

37
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,649
don't blame yourself.

38
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,984
You should let go and move on.

39
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,406
What else do you want other than revenge?

40
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,533
What would make you want to live?

41
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,956
For example, would you like to be reunited
with your reincarnated family?

42
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,873
No.

43
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,422
I have one.

44
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,093
I can't wait to see
my sister's beautiful baby.

45
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,431
I also want to see her
get married to a decent man.

46
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,977
But most of all,
I want to break free from Ok Eul-tae…

47
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,314
and live an ordinary life.

48
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,777
An ordinary life with Si-ho.

49
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,864
I know that's impossible as of now.

50
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,706
Don't try to evoke sympathy.

51
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,582
It won't work on me.

52
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,837
Gosh. Did it not work?

53
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,130
Let's go if you're done.

54
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,382
Okay.

55
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,738
What are you doing?

56
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,368
You should dry your face.
It's bothering me.

57
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,911
You don't catch colds, do you?

58
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,539
I'll do it.

59
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,588
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,969
I'm sorry for everything I've done.

61
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,682
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,394
I said that won't work on me.

63
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,562
I know.

64
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,065
I know this won't
make you feel any better,

65
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,816
but I still want to say it.

66
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,696
I want to apologize
to everyone who has suffered

67
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,407
because of me in my past life.

68
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,496
So hear me out.

69
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,668
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,725
Dad's here!

71
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,060
That's all it is.

72
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,269
-That tone.
-Yes.

73
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,605
-I know someone who loves your tone.
-It's Jae-yul, right?

74
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,940
Dad's here!

75
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,484
-He said you were his role model.
-He loves my tone?

76
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,694
-Oh, Jae-yul?
-Yes.

77
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,572
Sang-un, what took you so long?

78
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,573
What happened here?

79
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,326
Gosh, the TV is huge.

80
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,037
What's all this?

81
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,666
I heard you told Ms. Lee
to buy anything we needed.

82
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,460
Ms. Lee, he's here.

83
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,382
What is all of that?

84
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,096
What are you doing in the dark?

85
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,859
The one with no memory is here.

86
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,776
What?

87
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,782
The moment that person

88
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,493
regains their memory,

89
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,665
everyone here will die.

90
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,293
The one with no memory?

91
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,797
In the same way
that they died in their past lives,

92
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,091
their necks will be bitten into.

93
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,510
They will bleed from every orifice

94
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,345
and die.

95
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,273
What?

96
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,985
What happened here?
Everything's different.

97
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,740
What's going on?

98
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,951
What's that sound?

99
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,537
Oh, dear! The kettle is all burnt!

100
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,708
When did you get here?

101
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,714
What? Why are you all looking at me?

102
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,021
What was that back there?

103
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,856
You were prophesying.

104
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,608
That's never happened before.

105
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,152
What? What are you talking about?

106
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,820
Don't you remember what you just said?

107
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,948
What did I say?

108
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,326
Did you see the house?
I hope you're not angry.

109
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,120
They were on sale,
so they didn't cost much.

110
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,916
How much was the total again?

111
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,169
Do you want the receipt?

112
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,632
Everyone here will die?

113
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,051
What's that nonsense?

114
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,513
Ms. Lee said
that we were all going to die.

115
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,765
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

116
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,766
You heard her too.

117
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,184
What was it again?

118
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,562
She said we were going
to bleed from our noses.

119
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,313
That's what you got from that?

120
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,856
Just cut it out.

121
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,692
-I'm sorry.
-But it's true.

122
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,152
Detective Kwon, what brings you here?

123
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,240
I have something to tell you.
But first, take this.

124
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,494
What's this?

125
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,704
It's beef.

126
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,708
I heard the news at the hospital.

127
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,253
Well, I don't know much about it.

128
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,423
But I feel like she should eat well.

129
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,926
Oh, thank you.

130
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,054
Why does she need to eat well?

131
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,391
She already eats enough.
She doesn't need to get any stronger.

132
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,852
Whatever. You're too young to know.

133
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,645
I'm too young to know what?

134
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,023
What? What is it?

135
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,525
Be quiet. Come here.

136
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,778
-What?
-Be quiet.

137
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,406
Is your mother doing okay?

138
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,658
Yes, she is.

139
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,744
I see.

140
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,290
Then let's leave those two here
and talk in private.

141
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,508
The man in this photo

142
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:39,680
is the Bulgasal who is after you, right?

143
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,808
Yes. It's him.

144
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,894
Where did you get this photo?

145
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,689
I did some investigating.

146
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,734
When this photo was taken,
his name was Ok Sang-yeong.

147
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,946
I think he changes his identity
every 30 years.

148
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,240
I even found out where he lives.

149
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,451
You know where Ok Eul-tae lives?

150
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,536
Yes.

151
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,998
He lives in a large house
and invites all sorts

152
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,417
-of influential people--
-Why are you so reckless?

153
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,673
Reckless?

154
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,092
I had a lot of free time.

155
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,843
I said not to do anything dangerous.

156
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,303
I told you to stay out of it!

157
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,640
Why do you keep ordering me around?

158
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,185
How can I just stay still
when a monster is roaming around?

159
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,312
No human can catch Bulgasal.

160
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,022
You could get everyone killed.

161
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,649
Then what do you want me to do?

162
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,235
Should I just sit back
and watch him eat people?

163
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,945
We won't just sit back and watch.

164
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,572
We will kill him.

165
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,954
I thought Bulgasal couldn't be killed.

166
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,163
There is a way.

167
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,332
I haven't found it yet,

168
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,293
but I'm sure it's in my memory.

169
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,629
So until we find a way to kill Ok Eul-tae,

170
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,965
please stop investigating on your own.

171
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,383
It's too dangerous.

172
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,980
We need to talk.

173
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,774
We've been talking all along.

174
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,401
I'll stop investigating. Happy?

175
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,862
Why are you so fixated on Bulgasal?

176
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,740
Why do you care?

177
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,325
It's none of your business.

178
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,662
Tell me. I need to know.

179
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,746
Let go.

180
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,082
What do you think you're doing?

181
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,544
Why do you hate Bulgasal so much?

182
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,338
Tell me. I'm concerned about you.

183
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,716
Concerned? Why would you be?

184
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,177
Do you have feelings for me?

185
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,137
What?

186
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,222
Can't you take a joke? Move aside.

187
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,233
-Get in.
-Where are we going?

188
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,076
Cheers.

189
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,673
What are you doing?
Making an offering to the dead?

190
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,092
I don't drink.

191
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,178
I have a bad memory regarding alcohol.

192
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,013
You want me to drink alone?

193
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,643
-Gosh. I'm leaving.
-Fine. I'll drink.

194
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:36,982
Happy?

195
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,568
So you do know how to drink.

196
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,320
You know,

197
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,948
talking over some drinks

198
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:47,535
helps people open up
and bond with each other.

199
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,250
Now that I think of it,
I don't know much about you.

200
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,671
Tell me about your family.
I've met your mother already.

201
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,923
What about your father?

202
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,759
He left when I was little.

203
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,136
My stepfather raised me.

204
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,180
Goodness.

205
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,641
That must have been hard.

206
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,519
Are you close with your stepfather?

207
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,817
He was a good man. I didn't deserve him.

208
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,239
After being abandoned by my father,

209
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,201
he was the only person
who treated me decently.

210
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,874
I thought you might have had
a difficult past.

211
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,586
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-No.

212
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,506
Stop asking me questions.
Tell me why you're fixated on Bulgasal.

213
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,426
You're no fun.

214
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,554
You're so cold.

215
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:01,066
Fifteen years ago,
when I was in charge of Ms. Min's case…

216
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,403
Do you remember the culprit's face?

217
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,574
A suspect confessed to the crime
and turned himself in.

218
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,452
A suspect?
But Ok Eul-tae was the one who did it.

219
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,662
Ok Eul-tae probably sent him.

220
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,956
Now, it all makes sense.

221
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,252
The suspect knew about the crime
down to the very last detail.

222
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,422
I wanted to find out
why the suspect had surrendered

223
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,300
and who was behind it.

224
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,344
So I kept interrogating him.

225
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,889
But he ended up committing suicide.

226
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,517
Because of that, the case was closed.

227
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,394
And I was punished for it.

228
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,816
But I couldn't let go of the case.

229
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,486
Detective Lee Su-gyeong, a junior of mine,

230
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,863
continued to investigate in my place.

231
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,281
She…

232
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,826
went to the deceased suspect's house.

233
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,036
And the following day…

234
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,634
She was found hanged in that house.

235
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,971
Was it suicide?

236
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,391
She had texted
her husband before she died.

237
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,395
She felt guilty
that the suspect had killed himself.

238
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,614
But I swear she didn't kill herself.

239
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,159
I'm sure she was killed
by Ok Eul-tae because of me.

240
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,247
Is that why you're after him?

241
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,082
Is that your reason?

242
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,294
Please wake up.

243
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,005
Wake up.

244
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,637
Yes.

245
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,724
That's the only reason.

246
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,229
Then stop.

247
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,399
-What?
-I'm sorry about what happened,

248
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,443
but it's not worth risking your life.

249
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,194
It wasn't your fault.

250
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,196
She really could have committed suicide.

251
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,871
Look. She died on the eighth of July.

252
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,206
That was three days
before her son's birthday.

253
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,251
Who kills themselves
three days before their kid's birthday,

254
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,629
knowing he'll have to live
with that for the rest of his life?

255
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,477
Who is this man?

256
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,270
Her husband.

257
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,105
Why?

258
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,496
What were you doing in Gangwon Province?

259
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,247
What happened to your neck?

260
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,587
Sang-un, what's been bothering you?

261
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,630
What is it?

262
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,175
I'm just concerned about Ms. Lee.

263
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,469
She was so different.

264
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,055
You're right.

265
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,432
Speaking of which,

266
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,976
I don't think she's ordinary.

267
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,521
What do you mean?

268
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,397
To be honest…

269
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,901
I looked into her past.

270
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,946
You did? Why? You don't like doing that.

271
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,906
I had no choice.

272
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,117
Anyway…

273
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,538
something strange happened
when I was seeing her past.

274
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,333
Normally, it's not supposed to happen.

275
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,546
But her younger self spoke to me.

276
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,049
She said I could read her soul's memory.

277
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,303
She spoke to you in the memory?

278
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,266
Yes. And then,
I saw a very old memory of hers.

279
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,977
I think I saw…

280
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,402
So you can see people's past lives too?

281
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,821
I'm not certain.

282
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,990
Speaking of which,

283
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,994
you went to Gangwon Province to find
memories from your past life, right?

284
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,705
-Right.
-Then how about

285
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,373
I give it a try?

286
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,794
Who knows?
Maybe I'll be able to see your past life.

287
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,468
No. Don't do it.

288
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,685
Are you worried that I might see
how Mom and Sang-yeon died?

289
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,023
No.

290
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,901
There was this guy
I liked in middle school.

291
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,944
He was my first kiss.

292
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,280
I don't want you to see that.

293
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,742
Do you want to see my first kiss?

294
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,203
Stop it. That's gross.

295
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,080
-Tell me.
-Forget it. Just go to bed.

296
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,585
I'm ready to get a good night's sleep.

297
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,590
It's nice to be home.

298
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,593
I'm going to sleep now.

299
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,893
Did you just get back?

300
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,146
Why are you awake?
Did you have another nightmare?

301
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,150
No, I just couldn't sleep.

302
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,986
I need to talk to you.

303
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,071
Do you have time?

304
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,991
Not now. I have a lot on my mind.

305
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,577
It won't take long. It's about Ms. Lee.

306
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,669
The strange things she said earlier.

307
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,505
She said everyone would die
if someone regained their memory.

308
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,550
Does that mean something?

309
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,468
It's not your concern.

310
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,430
Of course, it is.
She was talking about me.

311
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,392
Is she gifted or something?

312
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,069
Six hundred years ago,
a baby was born from a dead mother.

313
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,823
A shaman from the village said
that the baby had Bulgasal's curse,

314
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:09,870
and that one day, the baby and those
around him would be killed by Bulgasal.

315
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,664
Did that happen in your past?

316
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,625
Why are you telling me this?

317
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,337
Hye-seok was that shaman.

318
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,884
Did her prophecy come true?

319
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,388
That's why we're in this situation.

320
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,564
So she was foretelling the future.

321
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,568
Does that mean I'll kill everyone
once I regain my memory?

322
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,738
It's likely. So don't do anything
for the time being.

323
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,573
Don't try to remember anything.

324
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,492
Not until I find a way.

325
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,507
The one with no memory is in this house.

326
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,136
If that person regains their memory,

327
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:35,098
everyone there will die.

328
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,458
What are you doing? Get the rice ready.

329
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,628
Try this.

330
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,257
It's a bit salty.

331
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,552
As you age, food gets saltier
since you lose your sense of taste.

332
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,471
Right. I saw that on TV.

333
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,640
What are you on about?

334
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,016
Just eat whatever I prepare.

335
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,809
Or start cooking for yourselves.

336
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:23,063
Si-ho, you're the one
who lost your sense of taste.

337
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,233
Gosh. You just eat a lot.
I told you to cut down.

338
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,527
Okay, I guess you're right.

339
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,409
But the soup tastes good.

340
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,578
Hey, you're up.

341
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,336
Why are you standing there?

342
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,046
Let me help.

343
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,262
By the way, where is Hwal?

344
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,472
He left early in the morning.

345
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,900
YANGHYANG MART

346
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,069
Give me just one bottle!

347
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,947
What are you doing?
Are you going to cause a scene?

348
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,617
Do you want me to call the police?
Do you? Get lost!

349
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,663
You always drink and never work.

350
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,665
You already owe me a lot of money!

351
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,126
Take this and go!

352
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,172
Don't ever come back!

353
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,758
Damn it.

354
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,986
MIN SANG-UN

355
00:26:55,405 --> 00:27:00,493
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please try again later.

356
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,382
You're out here again?

357
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:20,221
You look like someone
who's waiting for her lover to return.

358
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,975
Actually, I'm waiting for Hwal.

359
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,228
When will he return?

360
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,899
Beats me. He comes and goes as he pleases.

361
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,860
Let me.

362
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,904
I can do it by myself.

363
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,991
I'm good at this.
I used to work at a laundry plant.

364
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,590
Do I…

365
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,509
make you uncomfortable?

366
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,512
What? Gosh. What makes you think that?

367
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,060
It seems like you know
about my relationship with Hwal.

368
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,772
I don't care
if you're each other's worst enemy.

369
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,399
That has nothing to do with me.

370
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,446
Anyway, thank you for treating me well.

371
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,490
And my sister too.

372
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,450
Si-ho brightened up a lot.

373
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,453
And she seems to really like you.

374
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,833
She thinks you're cool and tough.

375
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,086
Is that so?

376
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,549
Well, I am sometimes told
that I'm girl-crush material.

377
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,552
I'm more suited for this generation.

378
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,806
I can see why Hwal relies on you so much.

379
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,184
He doesn't rely on me.
He takes me for a doormat.

380
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,479
Come on. You're the only one
who can boss him around.

381
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,441
You see,

382
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,820
he may seem cold-hearted,
but he actually has a soft heart.

383
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,989
Plus, I feel bad for him.

384
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,118
Gosh, I'm rambling to you.

385
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,914
No. I agree with you.

386
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,124
He seems…

387
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,627
like a good person.

388
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,920
What?

389
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,006
What? What did you just say?

390
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,257
-Ms. Lee.
-Yes?

391
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,760
-Ms. Lee!
-What is it? I'm busy.

392
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,846
I got a splinter in my finger
while moving a broken chair.

393
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,639
How do I take it out? It's bothering me.

394
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,058
Where? Gosh, it's hard to see.

395
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,810
Let me see. I'll do it.

396
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,021
What? That's okay.

397
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,397
No, let me.

398
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:41,654
Si-ho was clumsy
and used to get splinters all the time.

399
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,659
There. Done.

400
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,081
Okay. Thank you.

401
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,793
Be careful.

402
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,378
It could get infected.
I'll get a band-aid.

403
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,010
Gosh.

404
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,179
Why is my heart racing?

405
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,015
Is it because I'm scared of her?

406
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,684
We shouldn't become friends.

407
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:15,814
You're right. Why does she have
to be so kind and make me sway?

408
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,899
I shouldn't let her grow on me.

409
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,027
Why isn't Hwal coming back?

410
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,302
Darn it.

411
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,929
Go!

412
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,851
Darn it, just go around. Hey!

413
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,787
Let's go home.

414
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,176
My house!

415
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,849
Goodness. Thank you.

416
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,323
Are you his son?

417
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,639
Get your hands off me, you punk.

418
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,438
Who are you?

419
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,524
I just ran into you on the street.

420
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,610
Oh, is that so?

421
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,656
Thank you for your help.

422
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,200
Don't mention it.

423
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,913
What are you doing? Go buy some alcohol!

424
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,209
We should serve him some drinks
for helping me.

425
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,338
That's fine.

426
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:47,966
Are you deaf?

427
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,052
Go buy some alcohol.

428
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,890
Give me money.
It's embarrassing to buy things on credit.

429
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,727
What? How dare
you talk to your father like that!

430
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,230
You scumbag.

431
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,858
After all I've done for you,
that's how you talk?

432
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,238
Your mom abandoned you and died.

433
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,491
She died without saying anything to me.

434
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:17,453
She died and made me
take care of you all by myself!

435
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,752
You useless piece of shit! Come here!

436
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,839
What is it?

437
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,718
Where are you going?

438
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,760
That's enough!

439
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,642
Your kid did nothing wrong.

440
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,313
Once again, you're blaming your kid
for your wife's death.

441
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,153
What do you know?

442
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,697
He didn't want to kill his mother.

443
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,159
He never asked to be born with a curse.

444
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,165
But you just left
and abandoned your child.

445
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,085
You pushed him away
when he tried to hold on to you.

446
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,713
Why?

447
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,967
Why did you sell him
for a bottle of liquor?

448
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,764
He waited for you
to come back every night.

449
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:23,519
He trembled in fear
in case Bulgasal might come and kill him.

450
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,773
In that empty house…

451
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,193
he kept waiting…

452
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,863
for his father.

453
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,121
He resented you…

454
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,459
but also hoped that you were happy.

455
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,339
But you're a complete mess.

456
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,463
You're back.

457
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,133
You came late. I was waiting for you.

458
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,719
Why?

459
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,596
I need to talk to you.

460
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,685
What? Did you get hurt?

461
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,645
What is it about?

462
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,067
Well…

463
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,403
The thing is…

464
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:42,700
We haven't finished talking
about Ms. Lee's terrifying prophecy.

465
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,577
I said I'd take care of it.

466
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,953
But…

467
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,081
Frankly, I'm scared.

468
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,918
Now that I know what Kim Hwa-yeon did,

469
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,711
I'm scared that

470
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,173
I might turn into a different person
once I regain my memory.

471
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,759
Hearing what Ms. Lee said
makes me more anxious.

472
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,931
But you're the only person
I can talk to about this.

473
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:10,186
I feel like you're the only person
who would understand my situation.

474
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,437
Understand?

475
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:16,150
Bulgasal curses and kills people,
and you expect me to understand you?

476
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,903
-What?
-I don't care about your concerns.

477
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,197
Leave me out of it.

478
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,951
Have you forgotten about our relationship?

479
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,411
I haven't.

480
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,707
-I know but--
-Whenever…

481
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,045
I see that expression on your face,

482
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,465
I mistake you as human.

483
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,262
So I feel sorry for you at times.

484
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,432
I think

485
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,769
my memory has faded over time,

486
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,855
and I've become soft
because I've lived for so long.

487
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,858
After all, you were the cause of all this,

488
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,987
not Ok Eul-tae.

489
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,201
I'd do anything to end this curse.

490
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:12,206
Those around me continue
to suffer because of your curse.

491
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,667
My father…

492
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:19,130
His wife hanged herself
in both this life and the past.

493
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,966
And once again, he hates his son.

494
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,926
Everyone that I loved died…

495
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,264
because of you in their past lives.

496
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,644
But she said you'll kill them again

497
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,815
if you regain your memory.

498
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,241
What are you guys doing?

499
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,961
What did he just say?
You're going to kill someone?

500
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,840
No. You heard it wrong.

501
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,717
Don't lie. Just tell me.

502
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,178
You always keep things to yourself.

503
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,432
If you don't tell me, I'll ask him myself.

504
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,487
I…

505
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,868
I was Bulgasal in my past life.

506
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,122
-What?
-I killed his family 600 years ago

507
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,334
and stole his soul.

508
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,962
That soul was split into two,
and I was born as twins.

509
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,007
Sang-yeon remembered
that she used to be Bulgasal,

510
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,136
but I didn't.

511
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,973
What are you talking about?

512
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,476
I'm confused.

513
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,519
What I'm saying is

514
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,939
the person with no memory
that Ms. Lee was talking about…

515
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,442
is me.

516
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,780
If I regain my memory,
I'll become just like Kim Hwa-yeon.

517
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,033
Who's that?

518
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,827
Me 50 years ago.

519
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,830
Her family and neighbors were all dying,

520
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,416
but she ran away to save herself.

521
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,878
I'm scared of who I am, Si-ho.

522
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,257
That can't be true. It's a lie.

523
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,010
I don't want to believe it either.

524
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,305
The fact that I was
an evil spirit like Ok Eul-tae--

525
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,099
No. That's absurd.

526
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,559
What about Sang-yeon?

527
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,853
That means she was evil too.

528
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,563
Is that what you think?

529
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:45,526
She ran away from home
to save her family from Bulgasal.

530
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,194
She wanted to save Mom and me.

531
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:52,032
So how could you compare her
to Kim Hwa-yeon who abandoned her family?

532
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,290
Si-ho, do me a favor.

533
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,792
I need to go somewhere
without Hwal knowing.

534
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,378
Where?

535
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,943
Were you up all night again?

536
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:10,903
Yes.

537
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,489
My chest hurts.

538
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,159
I should meet with Hwal.

539
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,747
He and Sang-un seem
to be getting along better than I thought.

540
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,334
It's not that.
He's just protecting his soul.

541
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,963
That's why I need to remind him
about what happened 600 years ago.

542
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,301
What's wrong with your hand?

543
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,762
I think I've aged.

544
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,516
I've been holding it in for too long.

545
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,776
Should I accompany you?

546
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,350
I said not to do anything dangerous.

547
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,934
I told you to stay out of it!

548
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,981
How ridiculous.
Who is he to worry about me?

549
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,971
Where did he go?

550
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,798
Were you following me?

551
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:23,303
I was just driving by,
but these cars were blocking my way.

552
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,555
So I came out to check.

553
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,432
Is that so?

554
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,395
That's odd.
There's nothing at the end of this road.

555
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,941
But there's no one in the truck.

556
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,068
Do you know where the driver is?

557
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,155
No.

558
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,908
-But are you a stalker?
-What?

559
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,871
You've been following me from my place
all the way to this dead end.

560
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,675
I'm sorry. Our warehouse is nearby.
We'll pull our truck out.

561
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:04,178
That's okay.
How much are the apples? They look tasty.

562
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,263
-Oh, can you hand me a bag?
-Here.

563
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,514
-Here.
-Here's 50,000 won.

564
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,640
Gosh.

565
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,392
-We don't have change.
-It's okay.

566
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,518
I see. Thank you.

567
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,854
-Thank you.
-No problem. Goodbye.

568
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,400
Shall we have a chat?

569
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,612
Detective Kwon?

570
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,136
Grandma, I'm here.

571
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:49,973
It's been too long, hasn't it? I'm sorry.

572
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,852
I need to ask you something.

573
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:59,399
Do you remember Ms. Kim Hwa-yeon?

574
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,110
She was your older sister.

575
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:08,575
I want to know
what kind of person she was.

576
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,773
Go-bun.

577
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,321
It's me, your sister.

578
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,161
Hwa-yeon.

579
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,874
Do you remember me?

580
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,588
Hwa-yeon?

581
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,299
Hwa-yeon.

582
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:08,969
Hwa-yeon.

583
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,013
Where's…

584
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,889
Where's Mom?

585
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,142
Where's Dad?

586
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,477
They're…

587
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,147
at home.

588
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,481
Really?

589
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,068
It must have been a dream then.

590
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,196
I had a really scary dream, Hwa-yeon.

591
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,907
Our house was on fire.

592
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,410
I screamed and cried.

593
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,832
I'm sorry, Go-bun.

594
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,418
It's all my fault.

595
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,295
It's my fault.

596
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:46,590
We should've believed you back then.

597
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:50,218
But none of us did.

598
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,223
What are you talking about?

599
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,935
On the day the fire broke out,

600
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,605
you told us and our neighbors

601
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:06,276
that Bulgasal would be coming soon
and that we should run away.

602
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,278
I told you to run?

603
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,905
I tried to save people?

604
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,365
It's all his fault.

605
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,909
He caused everything.

606
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,829
You told us
that it was all because of Dark Hole.

607
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,623
What do you mean?

608
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,249
It was all Ok Eul-tae's doing?

609
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:25,837
A man with a scar on his hand
has been after you for 600 years.

610
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:31,301
It's because Dark Hole killed
that man's family 600 years ago

611
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,095
and made it look like you did it.

612
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,647
Do you want one?

613
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,445
No, thanks.

614
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,280
Just get to the point. I'm busy.

615
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,116
I'm drinking with someone later.

616
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,703
Drinking in broad daylight?

617
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,122
I'm not sure if you can make it though.

618
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,417
Why not? Are you going
to eat me or something?

619
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,754
I'm old so I won't taste good.

620
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,256
Why would I?

621
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,552
-Because you're Bulgasal.
-Did Min Sang-un say that?

622
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:14,886
Min Sang-un?

623
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:18,807
-Who's that?
-Don't feign ignorance.

624
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,019
How are she and Dan Hwal doing?

625
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,896
I don't know who you're talking about.

626
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,774
How reckless of you to tail me
knowing that I am Bulgasal.

627
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:28,984
What if I kill you?

628
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,364
-Like you did with Su-gyeong?
-Who is that?

629
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,409
Do you not remember her name?
She was a colleague of mine.

630
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:40,620
You killed her and disguised her death
as suicide 15 years ago.

631
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,622
She was investigating Min Sang-un's case…

632
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:48,003
I remember now.
She was that female detective.

633
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,589
-But I didn't kill her.
-What?

634
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,215
It wasn't me.

635
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,385
I told my men
to stop her from investigating,

636
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,345
not kill her.

637
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,266
Frankly speaking,
there was no need to kill her anyway.

638
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,978
Think about it. She was on her own.
She wouldn't have been able to catch me.

639
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,646
Just like you can't right now.

640
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:12,652
Is that the reason why
you followed me deep into this forest?

641
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,868
You know Kwon Seung-in, don't you?

642
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:22,913
You've been mentioning
many names I don't recognize. No, I don't.

643
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,208
He was a serial killer in Gunam City
who poisoned his victims in the '70s.

644
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,502
So? What does that have to do with me?

645
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,963
He was killed by Bulgasal.

646
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,137
Where's Dad?

647
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,932
He had two kids,

648
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,434
and Bulgasal killed his daughter as well.

649
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,063
Why are you asking me this?

650
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,982
There's another Bulgasal that you know.

651
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:57,364
What do you mean?
There's another Bulgasal?

652
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,492
Answer me. What's this about?

653
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,203
I have a question too.

654
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,872
Does anyone know you're here with me?

655
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,752
I guess not.

656
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,681
You really are reckless.

657
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,564
Are you terrified of me?

658
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,441
When the one next to you
is more frightening?

659
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,909
CONTRADICTIONS
A NOVEL BY YANG GUI-JA

660
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,244
But then again,

661
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:48,540
you don't see its true self
because it has lost its memory.

662
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,388
It murdered its victims in cold blood.

663
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,560
But I only kill because I have to.

664
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,104
I have my reasons,

665
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,900
so don't think of me as some evil monster.

666
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,694
And tell Hwal

667
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,821
that I…

668
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,366
can't wait any longer.

669
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,336
Why are you here?

670
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,047
I saw that the detective was tailing you.

671
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:40,383
What will you do about him?
He'll continue to be bothersome.

672
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,643
Just let him go. Don't touch him.

673
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,629
I thought I was going to--

674
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,319
It's all his fault.

675
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,571
He caused everything.

676
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:47,367
You told us
that it was all because of Dark Hole.

677
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,289
DETECTIVE KWON

678
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,002
Hello, Detective Kwon.

679
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,963
Excuse me. Are you Ms. Min Sang-un?

680
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,716
Whom am I speaking to?

681
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:10,056
-What do you think you're doing?
-We need to market our products.

682
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,976
I told you no more product placements.
Why do you keep doing this?

683
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,978
-Are you going to stop or not?
-I'll stop.

684
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,439
-You better! Or I'm going to be angry.
-Okay.

685
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,648
What?

686
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,566
Hey--

687
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,152
What? Did you say something?

688
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,071
I couldn't hear you over the TV.

689
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,323
Where is Min Sang-un?
I haven't seen her all day.

690
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,325
Oh.

691
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,078
She's sleeping upstairs.

692
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,788
She's not feeling well.

693
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,250
What? She isn't? Why didn't you tell me?

694
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,797
Where are you going?

695
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,637
I just want to check on her.

696
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,639
It's fine.

697
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,059
She just needs to sleep it off,
so just let her be.

698
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:02,692
SANG-UN

699
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,408
Hey. Why are you calling?

700
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,620
Gosh. Is she very sick?

701
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:17,207
She did chores yesterday
when I didn't even ask her to.

702
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,875
That must be why she's sick.

703
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,252
Should I buy some medicine for her?

704
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,337
Should I go?

705
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,465
How about you go instead?

706
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:29,344
Buy some abalone on your way home.
I should make her some porridge.

707
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,137
-What are you doing?
-What?

708
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,515
I told you not to be too nice to her.

709
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,558
Did you forget
what you'll be doing to her?

710
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,435
Is this being too nice?

711
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,687
Can't I make
some porridge for a sick girl?

712
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:43,399
Unbelievable. I can't believe
she even complimented you.

713
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,359
What?

714
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,987
Hey, can you take this?

715
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,574
Sang-un said it's an emergency.

716
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,662
Is she that ill?

717
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,914
I thought you were home. Where are you?

718
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:01,292
Some woman called and said
she took Detective Kwon hostage.

719
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,836
She gave me an address.

720
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:04,879
He was kidnapped?

721
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,173
Kidnapped?

722
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,510
Is Ok Eul-tae behind this?
Was he investigating on his own?

723
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,304
I'm not sure.

724
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:18,893
But what's strange is that
she wants you there, not me.

725
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,564
She said she knew
you were the true owner of my soul.

726
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:24,983
What?

727
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:30,155
She said that she was Dueoksini.

728
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,868
Why isn't he picking up?

729
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,953
Oh, Eul-tae.

730
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:22,081
Do-yun, what a surprise.
Why did you call me?

731
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,211
Is Detective Kwon with you?

732
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,463
-What?
-Did you kidnap--

733
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,091
Did you kidnap him?

734
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,178
You shouldn't have done that.
You said you were only after Sang-un.

735
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,746
Stay away.

736
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,790
Stay away!

737
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:08,795
Don't move.

738
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:17,387
So you're Dueoksini?
Why did you call me here?

739
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,764
Why did you kidnap him?

740
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:23,226
I'm sure you know
the answers to those questions.

741
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,021
You killed me in my past life.

742
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,031
How do you know that?

743
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,617
Did Ok Eul-tae tell you?

744
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:44,372
When the other Monsters
were after Min Sang-un,

745
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,457
I knew the truth.

746
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,378
I knew that you were
the true owner of her soul.

747
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:59,762
I knew that you were the real enemy.

748
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,895
I injected you with poison.
That amount could kill dozens.

749
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:11,858
Are you okay?

750
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,776
It's painful, isn't it?

751
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,240
I may not be able to kill you,
but I knew I could catch you like this.

752
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,368
I've been serving Ok Eul-tae
for a long time,

753
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,288
so I know a lot about Bulgasal.

754
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,125
And I know what your weakness is.

755
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:34,005
I know how to make the pain
even more unbearable.

756
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,097
No…

757
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,904
It's already wearing off.
You'll recover soon.

758
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:34,649
It would have been better had you taken
your soul back from Min Sang-un

759
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:37,360
and become human.

760
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:42,323
Then I could have killed you
without going through this hassle.

761
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,724
How are you fighting this poison?

762
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,275
Then how about this?

763
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,131
No!

764
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,758
Don't kill him!

765
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:44,802
I can't kill him even if I want to.

766
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,771
How about you die instead
and make it more painful for him?

767
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,876
I told you not to touch him.

768
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,119
Hey.

769
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,621
Hey.

770
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,458
Hey. Can you hear me?

771
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,798
Don't die. Stay awake!

772
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,759
I need to call 911.

773
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,931
Don't bother. He'll be okay.

774
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:15,059
Give that back. He's going to die.

775
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,520
He'll bleed out…

776
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:26,571
His wound is recovering
on its own. But how?

777
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:28,656
Because he's Bulgasal.

778
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:30,658
Just like me.

779
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,390
Poor you.

780
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,060
The poison must be strong.
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

781
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:40,269
Shut up.

782
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:44,774
Where's Dueoksini?

783
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:48,235
I don't want to talk about her.
She's a tenacious one.

784
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,738
She ran away in that state.
Incredible, right?

785
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:52,823
Why are you here?

786
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,659
Were you behind this?

787
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:57,912
Did you tell her
to keep him hostage then capture me?

788
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,997
No. She was avenging herself.

789
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,792
You saw how I saved you.

790
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,419
Why did you do it?

791
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:07,171
To win your favor.

792
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,674
What for?

793
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:11,550
Because I need you.

794
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:17,264
Are all Bulgasal brazen like this?

795
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,309
Despite what you
and Min Sang-un have done to me,

796
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,687
you ask for my help
and say that you need me.

797
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:28,109
Don't get too close to her.

798
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:30,861
That won't happen.

799
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,738
I'm serious.

800
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,949
Or you could get in serious trouble.

801
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,327
What do you mean?

802
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:42,164
Don't trust her too much.
Don't be fooled by her.

803
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:46,335
You need to be smart.
She put Bulgasal's curse on you

804
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,587
and murdered your entire family.

805
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,215
What do you think
an evil spirit like that would do

806
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:53,676
the moment it regains its memory?

807
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,851
On the other hand,

808
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:06,230
I will never hurt those around you.
I just proved it to you.

809
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:09,817
That's because

810
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:14,030
my only desire is to get rid
of Min Sang-un once and for all.

811
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,866
I'll do anything you ask for

812
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:19,618
if I can close up this hole
that she has made in my chest.

813
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,537
So I beg you.

814
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,915
Please help me. Will you?

815
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,302
Why is she here?

816
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,889
What is this? I didn't know you were here.

817
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,933
Now, this is a spectacle.

818
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:46,270
The main characters from
that old story are all present.

819
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,483
Where's Detective Kwon?

820
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:51,525
He's safe.

821
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,820
I told you to go home.
Why did you come here?

822
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,656
Dueoksini was after you.

823
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,574
I was worried.

824
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,790
This is hilarious.
Look at her. Look at that face.

825
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,541
She's feigning innocence.

826
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:12,463
How do you feel? Are you swayed
because she looks human? Are you?

827
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,257
Tell me.

828
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:19,095
Has she grown on you?
She's your enemy who murdered your family.

829
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,850
But I remember everything!

830
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,852
I remember…

831
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,773
the Bulgasal she once was

832
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:33,984
and how she wanted to kill you
and your family 600 years ago.

833
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:42,493
She will kill you one day.

834
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,412
In the same way she killed your family.

835
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:48,082
No. That's not true.

836
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,708
It was you who killed them.

837
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,085
What did you say?

838
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,840
The one who murdered
your family 600 years ago

839
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,217
wasn't me.

840
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,344
It was Ok Eul-tae.

841
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,020
What…

842
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,356
What do you mean?

843
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,650
Don't believe her.

844
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,611
Don't believe anything she says.

845
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:06,076
I thought he went to help,
not get hurt himself!

846
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,494
Did you know Hwal was Bulgasal?

847
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:11,290
Min Sang-un is coming between Hwal and me.

848
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,042
You bring her here.

849
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:15,294
Have you looked for your son?

850
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,962
How could I ever face him again?

851
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:19,506
And I only know how he looks as a child.

852
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,426
I won't be able
to recognize him as an adult.

853
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:26,764
-Oh, my goodness.
-Si-ho!

854
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:28,474
What? You're really pregnant?

855
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,436
I sent you a text.

856
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:34,688
I don't think I can do it.

857
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:37,942
But if you don't do it,
things will get out of hand.

858
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,902
I would have to bring her here myself.

859
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:43,489
Then the people
in that house will get hurt.

860
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,285
I heard you asked Mr. Gu
to look into Do-yun's supporter.

861
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:49,662
Do you know who it is?

862
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:53,916
You pretended to get along
with the people you had to spy on?

863
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,584
It was all a show?

864
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,337
If I ever see you again,
I'm going to kill you.

865
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:04,301
