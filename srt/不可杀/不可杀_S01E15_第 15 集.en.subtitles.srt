EPISODE 15

2
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,861
What is it? Are you still sad?

3
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,031
That we're leaving again
when we just came back?

4
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,495
A bit.

5
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,749
But it's okay
because we're together again.

6
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,213
I'll go to the hiding place
where Si-ho and I used to live.

7
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,548
No, not there.

8
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,883
Let's go back to the house
in the mountains.

9
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,761
That place is still safe.
And there's somewhere we need to go.

10
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,260
Do-yun.

11
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,054
-What are you doing?
-What?

12
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,184
Oh, these are Ms. Lee's clothes.
She must have left them here.

13
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,315
When she nagged us to make sure
we didn't leave anything behind.

14
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,150
Goodness.

15
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,278
Give them to me. I'll hold onto them.

16
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,863
Okay.

17
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,580
Do-yun, let's keep our chin up.

18
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,457
We have to stay on our toes now.

19
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,584
It's not the time to give up
and mope around.

20
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,463
What do you mean?

21
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,634
To be honest, I don't know what Hwal
and Sang-un are going to do.

22
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,805
I'm afraid they might go after Ok Eul-tae
because of what happened to Ms. Lee.

23
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,128
You still can't see with this eye?

24
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,339
No.

25
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,052
-It's not healing as fast as I thought.
-It's okay.

26
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,098
But I told the three of you to leave.
Why did you come back?

27
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,600
You could have just left me behind.

28
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,313
I told you.
I just couldn't leave you there.

29
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,440
I couldn't leave you on your own.

30
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,151
Even after hearing

31
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,654
that I asked Ok Eul-tae
to turn me into Bulgasal?

32
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,323
Do you think Ok Eul-tae is lying?

33
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,366
No.

34
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,868
I know it's true.

35
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,954
When a part of my memory came back,

36
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,207
I saw you and Ok Eul-tae together.

37
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,712
You looked like friends
rather than enemies.

38
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,757
But you still chose to stay by me?

39
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,844
As I told you before,
that doesn't matter now.

40
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,933
Any other memories?

41
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,644
I didn't have any flashbacks after that.

42
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,231
I think it was just temporary.

43
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,910
All done.

44
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,664
But didn't you say we had somewhere to go?

45
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,255
It's that mountain.

46
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,757
What happened there?

47
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,593
That's where the villagers believed

48
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,595
Bulgasal lived 600 years ago.

49
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,931
It all began on that mountain.

50
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,735
It's where I was born

51
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,529
and where I met you.

52
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,407
It's where my family died

53
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,367
and where I…

54
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,204
became Bulgasal.

55
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,457
I wanted to let you know

56
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,375
and wanted to come here one last time.

57
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,588
"One last time"?
Don't say things like that.

58
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,589
It will be.

59
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,593
Don't stop me anymore.

60
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,889
It's what Kim Hwa-yeon
and your twin sister wanted.

61
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,267
For Ok Eul-tae and I,
both Bulgasals, to die.

62
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,728
Wait. Then you brought me here
because you wanted me

63
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,148
to get my memories back
by looking at that mountain?

64
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,984
So that I would want you
and Ok Eul-tae to die together?

65
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,494
You once asked me why I liked you.

66
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,007
Other than my family,
I've never trusted or been worried

67
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,009
about someone the way I have with you.

68
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,303
So I thought I liked you.

69
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,680
But I was wrong.

70
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,475
What I feel right now goes beyond that.

71
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,895
There's something more.

72
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,355
What do you mean?

73
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,900
I don't think I can handle
not having you by my side.

74
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,238
If you're not there,
it'll feel as if half of me is gone.

75
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,575
And that terrifies me.

76
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,286
So I need to know why.

77
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,621
I know something happened between us

78
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,667
even before 600 years ago.

79
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:51,220
I can't let you die
before I find out what happened.

80
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,973
And…

81
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,143
you can't lose them again.

82
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,769
What are you talking about?

83
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,732
You called Si-ho Dan Sol.

84
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,153
And you always called Si-ho
and Do-yun your family.

85
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,070
They were…

86
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,867
your family in their past lives, right?

87
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,455
Yes. They were my family
who died 600 years ago because of me.

88
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,041
And you're still going to die?

89
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,667
When your family is right here?

90
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,213
That's all the more reason
why Ok Eul-tae and I must die.

91
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,298
Because I don't want to lose them again.

92
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,842
I don't want to live
in guilt or regret anymore.

93
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,263
After I die…

94
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,017
please look after my family.

95
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,359
You didn't tell us you'd go out.

96
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,195
We were just talking.

97
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,905
Is everything put away?

98
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,408
Yes. It didn't take that long.

99
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,620
Let's eat. We haven't had anything.

100
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,872
We only have instant noodles.

101
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,000
Sit with us, Hwal.

102
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,794
No, I'm good.

103
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,088
Please join us.

104
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,468
Sit with Si-ho and Do-yun.

105
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,909
Go ahead.
The noodles are going to get soggy.

106
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,494
Okay.

107
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,126
What?

108
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,338
They aren't soggy at all. Or even cooked.

109
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,173
Really?

110
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,259
Maybe I didn't cook them enough.

111
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,762
Sorry. I was distracted by my thoughts.

112
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,600
Seriously? You told me
to stay on my toes earlier.

113
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,311
Stay on your toes? What do you mean?

114
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,980
Oh, that? It's nothing.

115
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,525
But what about Detective Kwon?
Did he call you?

116
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,860
He should know we're here.

117
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,071
Oh, I called him earlier.

118
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,866
But he didn't pick up. I'll try again.

119
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,285
No, go ahead and eat. I'll call him.

120
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:29,629
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, SAFE NATION

121
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,927
DAN HWAL

122
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,599
I'm not the one

123
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,810
who killed your father and your sister.

124
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,729
It was Hwal,

125
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,231
the man that's been
by your side all this time.

126
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,018
What are you doing here?

127
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,478
You bastard.

128
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,272
Are you really working for Ok Eul-tae?

129
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,650
Remember where we are.
People are watching.

130
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,362
So you care about what they think,
but not your conscience?

131
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,073
-Do you know what he's capable of?
-I do! That's why…

132
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,119
That's why I'm cooperating.

133
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,621
If I don't, he'll kill me right away.

134
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,167
It's better to work for him
and further my career at least.

135
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,710
You bastard.

136
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,381
Where's Ok Eul-tae?

137
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,425
Why do you ask? So you can go to him?

138
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,385
Do you have a death wish?

139
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,180
Get rid of Hwal or whatever his name was.

140
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,348
He's your enemy.

141
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,975
I'll take care of him myself.

142
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,728
-Tell me where Ok Eul-tae is.
-I can't tell you.

143
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,857
It will put my family in danger too.

144
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,533
Bye.

145
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,037
Hwal, we bought everything
they wanted, right?

146
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,706
Yes.

147
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,292
Give them to me.
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

148
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,835
Come on!

149
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,504
Don't you know
teenagers recover super fast?

150
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,550
Hey.

151
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,179
Hwal, can we stop by
that place before we go back?

152
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,847
-Where?
-There.

153
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:55,524
GALAXY PHOTO STUDIO

154
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,739
We have to wait for a bit.

155
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,866
What photo are you printing?

156
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,368
Oh, it's nothing much.

157
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,080
This one.

158
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,629
-Let's take a photo.
-A photo?

159
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,923
-A photo? Yes.
-Let's do that.

160
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,301
Sure. We never took a photo together.

161
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,719
Right.

162
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,429
-Okay.
-Everyone, look over here.

163
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,598
One, two, three!

164
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,519
Hwal, come on. Show us a smile.

165
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,145
-Okay.
-Goodness.

166
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,022
One, two, three.

167
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,734
Let's take one more. One, two, three.

168
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:39,777
That's nice.

169
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,660
I just wanted to print one out.

170
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,497
And I thought about printing
this one too, but I didn't.

171
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,549
Goodness. I'm so out of it today.

172
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,009
I forgot to ask how big
you wanted your photo to be.

173
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,344
What size do you want?

174
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,805
-The size?
-Yes.

175
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,942
Damn it.

176
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,117
I'm not sure.

177
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,120
The standard size will do.

178
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,582
Then I'll make it
a four-by-six-inch print. Okay?

179
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,003
By the way, how long
have you been living here?

180
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,087
What?

181
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,924
I was born and raised here.

182
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,844
Most of the residents here
have been here since birth.

183
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,262
But why do you ask?

184
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,017
-It's nothing.
-I see. Hold on.

185
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,812
Goodness. Where are you going?
Where have you been?

186
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,523
Where have you been?

187
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,903
-I was looking for you to give you this.
-You shouldn't have.

188
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,779
-Don't worry about it.
-Thank you.

189
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,115
You called it here, didn't you?

190
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,327
It is your fault!

191
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,663
My father is dead because of you!

192
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,045
You're so pretty!

193
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,963
How does she get prettier by the day?

194
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,883
-I have no idea.
-I'm glad you don't take after your dad.

195
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,094
Hey, move.

196
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,640
Bulgasal came here for him.

197
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,351
He is going to get us all killed!

198
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,811
-We must kill him to save ourselves.
-Kill him.

199
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,066
What is it, Hwal? Do you know them?

200
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,946
Yes, I knew them
a long time ago in their past lives.

201
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,032
Gosh, really?

202
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,534
Awesome.

203
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,496
They still live here.

204
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,501
I guess people who cross paths once
continue to meet each other.

205
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,754
How pretty.

206
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,507
Then…

207
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,344
your family might be
somewhere together too.

208
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,808
Yes.

209
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,690
Were you close with those people?

210
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,484
No.

211
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,530
I used to hate them.

212
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,366
But if I think back on it now,

213
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,660
they were hurt because of my curse.

214
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,121
I'm the one to blame.

215
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,549
Wait up.

216
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,093
-What are you doing? Come on.
-Come on. Wait for me.

217
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,970
-What do you want to do?
-What are we doing?

218
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,847
-Hey. I found a place.
-What is it?

219
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,099
Let's go to the Internet cafe. Look.

220
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,184
-You want to go now?
-Let's go now.

221
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,020
-Let's play League of Legends.
-Okay.

222
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,105
-Okay.
-Let's go now.

223
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,440
Let's play for three hours.

224
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,776
Do you want to go back to school?

225
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,154
Well…

226
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,073
going to school was never my thing.

227
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,783
Your thing? Come on.

228
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,660
Go back to school once this is over.

229
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,371
-You should be studying.
-Fine.

230
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,670
Then can I commute to school
from your house?

231
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,262
I was wondering
if I could just live with you.

232
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,101
Never mind. I wasn't being serious.

233
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,187
No.

234
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,980
We should live together.

235
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,485
What? Really? You can't take it back.

236
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,237
Then what about Si-ho and Sang-un?

237
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,741
Oh, right.
Can Detective Kwon live with us too?

238
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,327
The more the merrier. Right?

239
00:17:58,952 --> 00:17:59,787
You promised.

240
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,269
Si-ho!

241
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,858
Why did you buy so much stuff?

242
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,151
Give me some of that.

243
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,945
It's okay.

244
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,447
No way. How can we ask
a pregnant woman to carry bags?

245
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,867
-Give me that.
-I said I got it.

246
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,869
-Give it to me.
-I got it.

247
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,373
-Come on. Seriously?
-Gosh. Hey!

248
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,583
I said I got it!

249
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,336
-You could have given it to me. Oh, no.
-Gosh.

250
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,879
How are we going to eat this?

251
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,422
I'll eat them all.

252
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,841
And stop nagging too. Okay?

253
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,385
Let's head inside.

254
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,225
After I die, please look after my family.

255
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,395
What? How did you find me?

256
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,356
What are you doing here
on the street like a homeless man?

257
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,444
Let's talk. I looked for you all night.

258
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,721
What are you doing?
I thought you didn't drink.

259
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,267
The mayor has been missing
for several days.

260
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,812
I know. I saw it on the news.
What about that?

261
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:36,443
He's the one who told Captain Seo
to go to Hwal's house that day.

262
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,321
It seems he's been working for Ok Eul-tae.

263
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,407
Ok Eul-tae probably used him,
and something must have gone wrong.

264
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,869
So? What do you want from me?

265
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,711
Here.

266
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,797
What's this?

267
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,268
-This is--
-If I tell you where Ok Eul-tae is,

268
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,727
you can get rid of him, right?

269
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,981
I don't want to go missing like the mayor

270
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,816
after being used by Ok Eul-tae.

271
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,320
Are you sure about this?

272
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,574
I can't go with you.
So giving that to you is all I can do.

273
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,619
You know I'm a coward.

274
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,666
I have a young daughter too.
So that's all I can do for you.

275
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,094
Where is Ok Eul-tae?

276
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,018
We're almost there.

277
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,940
I'm not remembering anything.

278
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,860
I figured.

279
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,280
You didn't remember anything
at Kim Hwa-yeon's house either.

280
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,242
But that doesn't matter.

281
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,831
We didn't come here to help me remember.

282
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,042
We didn't?

283
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,712
We're here to end things where they began.

284
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,631
You'll become human again

285
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,634
and I'll become Bulgasal.

286
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,597
We should go back to our rightful places.

287
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,475
So you can die with Ok Eul-tae
in place of me when we do?

288
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,518
I'm not doing it for you.

289
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,395
I should have done this from the start.

290
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,940
I used to be Bulgasal,
so it's only fitting that I end this.

291
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,486
So you should go back to your family.

292
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,614
Don't think about dumping them onto me.

293
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,410
You were human and should have
never come in between Ok Eul-tae and me.

294
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,332
You used to be human,
so you can never beat Ok Eul-tae.

295
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,334
So let's go back to how things used to be.

296
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,087
Forget it. I told you
we aren't doing things your way.

297
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,004
Let's go back.

298
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,633
No.

299
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,096
You won't have a choice.

300
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,560
What are you doing?

301
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,521
If I stab my neck right now,

302
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,397
I'll just die.

303
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,691
To save me, you'll have to take my soul

304
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,485
and turn me into Bulgasal.

305
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,488
Hwal.

306
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,741
Thank you for everything.

307
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,246
Who said you could die?

308
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,747
You want to become Bulgasal?

309
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,624
Do you know what it's like?

310
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,254
I do. I watched you by your side
more closely than anyone.

311
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,006
I will become Bulgasal
and die with Ok Eul-tae.

312
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,383
It's not your problem now.

313
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:52,430
You've done enough by saving my life.

314
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,892
I can't let you go. I can't.

315
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,769
I can't do that.

316
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,985
For all my life I only thought about you.

317
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,078
You saved me from
the villagers when I was a kid.

318
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,457
I was sorry that you died for me,
so I only thought about you.

319
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,586
And because I hated you
for killing my family

320
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,212
and taking my soul,

321
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,133
I thought about you
and looked for you for 600 years.

322
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,137
Now that I know the truth,

323
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,306
I have no one to get revenge on or resent.

324
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,142
And I have no reason
to protect or kill anyone.

325
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,562
I could have moved on with my life.

326
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,609
But I lived with only thoughts of you.

327
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,112
So I can't let you go.

328
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,031
I can't let you die with Ok Eul-tae.

329
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,620
You told me that you didn't want me to die

330
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,039
because it would feel like
losing half of yourself.

331
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,666
But it's different for me.

332
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,922
It's not just half,
but all of me that will feel lost.

333
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:13,345
Because my whole life was
about finding you.

334
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,404
Sang-un.

335
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,739
What happened?

336
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,620
What did you guys do this time?

337
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,247
Hwal.

338
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,791
-I did it to myself.
-Why?

339
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,379
I wanted to give back his soul

340
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,339
and become Bulgasal.

341
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,342
Don't tell me

342
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,095
you were going to fight Ok Eul-tae
and sacrifice your life.

343
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,305
No. That will never happen.

344
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,807
I'll kill Ok Eul-tae myself.

345
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,559
Then you'll die too.

346
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,229
You said we'd be together yesterday.

347
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,315
You promised.

348
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:12,195
Were you secretly deciding
on who was going to die?

349
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,656
You still haven't learned
your lesson after Ms. Lee?

350
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,201
Have you thought about
the people who would be left behind?

351
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,246
Don't think about dying.
Come up with a way to live!

352
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,208
I can't believe you guys.
This is ridiculous.

353
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,127
You have to send Do-yun back to school

354
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,087
and be there when my baby comes.

355
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,756
Don't say that
you're sacrificing your life for us.

356
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,552
I don't want any of my family
to die anymore.

357
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,891
Please.

358
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,187
Can't we try to find a way
to survive this together?

359
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,116
Mr. Kwon.

360
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,749
What's going on here?

361
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,709
Did something happen?

362
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,919
It's nothing.

363
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,050
I found out where Ok Eul-tae is.

364
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:20,055
He's at the mountain where the well is?

365
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,474
Yes. Detective Ham told me.

366
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:23,892
It's a trap.

367
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,227
A trap?

368
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,481
He probably leaked it to you
on purpose through that detective.

369
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,732
I doubt that.

370
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,735
Detective Ham wants
to get away from Ok Eul-tae too.

371
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,570
Regardless of what his intention is,

372
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,448
Ok Eul-tae wants me to come to the well.

373
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,992
He wants to lock me up in the same well

374
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,244
I tried to put him in.

375
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,376
Si-ho says the food is ready.

376
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,192
Gosh. This looks great.
You two put a lot of effort into this.

377
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,029
I was hungover,
so I was craving some bean sprout soup.

378
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,492
I'll be giving birth in seven months.

379
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,913
Once I have the baby, I'll learn
butchery to run a shop like Ms. Lee.

380
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,417
I'll make deliveries to you once I do.

381
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,795
And my kids and I will guard the well
where Ok Eul-tae will be locked up.

382
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,965
I'll take over Ms. Lee's duties.

383
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,133
Wait, Si-ho.

384
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,593
It looks like you two came up
with a plan without us.

385
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,554
So I'm telling you what my plan is.

386
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,306
Here's what I need from you, Sang-un.

387
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,601
It's hard to raise a baby alone,
so I'll need your help.

388
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,311
I don't have a mother.

389
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,313
So you will assume that role.

390
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,109
You have to attend
my child's events at school.

391
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,993
Then I'll go back
to high school next year.

392
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,953
I'll commute from Hwal's place.

393
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,038
Teach me how to drive once I'm legal.

394
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,832
You promised me a car.

395
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,669
And we should go on a trip
once we lock up Ok Eul-tae.

396
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,256
And I also want…

397
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,759
Okay, I understand. You can stop now.

398
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,056
We'll find a way for both of us to live.

399
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,434
So you can stop now.

400
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,615
It's from Detective Ham.

401
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,658
I was an ex-cop,
so I'm the best shot here.

402
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,869
So I can shoot Ok Eul-tae from a distance.

403
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,622
I'll help too. Let me go with you.

404
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,581
No.

405
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,751
Right. You should stay with Si-ho.

406
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,381
Don't worry. It's three against one,
so we have a shot.

407
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,301
Outnumbering your enemy is
the best tactic in a fight.

408
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,403
How is it?

409
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,989
I can't taste anything.

410
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,075
You don't have to force yourself.

411
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,576
No.

412
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,121
It feels weird
not to eat anything at the table.

413
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:33,998
I want to practice.

414
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:39,420
We'll have a lot more
of these meals in the future now.

415
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,221
Let's eat.

416
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,615
We'll be back soon.

417
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,118
Yes, I know.

418
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,412
Of course, you will.

419
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,601
Detective Kwon.

420
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,358
Please protect them.

421
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,446
They're both willing
to give up their lives to protect us.

422
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,036
And you need to be careful too.

423
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,705
Don't lose your temper
and go after Ok Eul-tae recklessly.

424
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,707
Okay.

425
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,711
I'll do everything in my power
to send your sister back alive.

426
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:05,089
No! I want the three of you to come back!

427
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,678
And…

428
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,722
What else?

429
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,141
Buy hair dye on your way back.

430
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,894
You look old.

431
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,774
Once you come back, I'll dye your hair.

432
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,527
Gosh. Look at your beard.

433
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,613
Fine.

434
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,282
Why are you nagging me?

435
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,452
Bye.

436
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,048
Here.

437
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,473
Take it with you.

438
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,856
The weather is awfully nice.

439
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,108
And we'll have to fight Ok Eul-tae soon.

440
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,860
Right.

441
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,657
The three of us will be able
to go back home safely, right?

442
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,244
Yes. Everything will go as planned.

443
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,954
I'll make sure of it.

444
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,164
And…

445
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,792
once we lock Ok Eul-tae up in the well,

446
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,004
I have a favor to ask you.

447
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,841
I want to go back to being human.

448
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,093
Can I?

449
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:18,973
Of course.

450
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,104
What do you want to do
once you become human again?

451
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,400
I just want to live a normal life.

452
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:33,112
I want to pass the days
and die when I'm old.

453
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,489
Before my son.

454
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,326
You'll be able to.

455
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,162
Are you sure? You'll suffer a lot
when you become Bulgasal.

456
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,457
-You'll be lonely too.
-Well…

457
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,252
I'll be going back to who I was.

458
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,465
Living this life as a human brought me
a lot of pain and suffering too.

459
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,674
I lost my family

460
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,427
and was always chased
by Monsters and Ok Eul-tae.

461
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,514
But they won't chase me anymore.

462
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,892
And I'll be strong once I become Bulgasal.

463
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,478
So I like that I'll be able
to protect Si-ho and Do-yun.

464
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,440
I'll protect you
from reincarnated Monsters too.

465
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,902
And when I get sick of living as Bulgasal,

466
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,570
we can switch then.

467
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,366
You want to go down that path again

468
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,700
after everything we did?

469
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,077
Aren't you sick of it?

470
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,079
Not at all.

471
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,540
Bulgasal needs something
to look forward to.

472
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,335
In your next life, I'll come find you.

473
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,049
No matter how long it takes.

474
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,053
Let's not die.

475
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,598
I won't die. So you shouldn't die either.

476
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,686
Let's go back together.

477
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,754
We're okay.

478
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,178
Oh, right. Detective Kwon.

479
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,471
I'm reminding you just in case.

480
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,682
If Hwal's heart is wounded,

481
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:28,769
you must not shoot
Ok Eul-tae in the heart.

482
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,980
It might kill Hwal too.

483
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,319
Let me see if I understand correctly.

484
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,446
So to kill Bulgasal,

485
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:43,367
both Bulgasals' hearts must
be fatally wounded. Is that it?

486
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,245
Before one's heart recovers,

487
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,373
the other must be shot
in the heart, right?

488
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,251
Right. That's correct.

489
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,176
By the way,
you don't seem like your usual self.

490
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:03,638
I'm just nervous.
I have an important job today.

491
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,851
It's been my lifelong mission.

492
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,242
What should we do?

493
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,121
Should we all go in?

494
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,706
It's small and dark inside.

495
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,251
If we go in together,
Ok Eul-tae will kill us all.

496
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,299
I'll go in alone.

497
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,050
And then what?

498
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,802
I'll tire him out.

499
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,888
I was able to give him a heavy blow
because he let his guard down.

500
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,931
But not this time.

501
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,892
After he strikes me down,
he'll come out to kill you.

502
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,854
That's when you should shoot him.

503
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,732
If Ok Eul-tae is hurt and moves slowly,

504
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,693
I can get him from a distance.

505
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,071
If he's wounded and shot at the same time,
he won't be able to move.

506
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,198
And then…

507
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,702
it'll be your turn.

508
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,999
That's the poison Dueoksini had.

509
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,419
Okay. I'll handle this.

510
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,465
You have the most important job.

511
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,676
You have to shoot him and bring him down.

512
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,470
But don't shoot him in the heart.

513
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:09,847
Okay.

514
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,405
Don't worry.

515
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,699
I'll do everything to bring him down,

516
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,452
so that he doesn't come out here.

517
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:35,414
That's not my concern.
You just be careful.

518
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,584
Your family is waiting at home.

519
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,597
I've been waiting for you. Welcome.

520
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,651
The tables have turned.

521
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,946
Right. Last time,
you wanted to put me in the well.

522
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,366
But this time, I'll be putting you inside.

523
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,351
Let me see.

524
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,645
Have you changed since I last saw you?

525
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,690
You must have been very upset
that your family almost died.

526
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,859
You seem more okay than I thought.

527
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,947
I wished you would act more like Bulgasal.

528
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,326
I hoped you would kill
the detectives who took your family.

529
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:40,039
But killing one shaman wasn't enough.

530
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,541
You had an ill-fated relationship anyway.

531
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,585
You two never had any bond.

532
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,337
Your son, your wife,

533
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,464
and your father should have died.

534
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,592
No.

535
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,887
Killing her was enough.

536
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,931
I'm here, after all.

537
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,141
Right.

538
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,645
You did come even when you knew
you'd be buried here.

539
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,398
Did you want to fight me that badly?

540
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,985
No. I wanted to talk to you.

541
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:14,823
I'm sorry.

542
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,617
What?

543
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,328
Everything you said until now was true.

544
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,746
Sang-un has started
to regain her memories.

545
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,415
She told me that she saw you
saving me in your past life.

546
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,668
You killed my family 600 years ago

547
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,589
because you were trying
to turn me into Bulgasal again.

548
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,343
Everything you did was for me.

549
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,262
I shouldn't have blamed you.

550
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,180
Why all of a sudden?

551
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,432
Have you lost your mind?

552
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,893
Do you want a fresh start with me?

553
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,479
You think I will fall for your trick?

554
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,523
I'm not tricking you.

555
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,276
I'm saying I shouldn't have blamed
or resented you.

556
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,278
Everything was my fault.

557
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,905
You didn't do anything wrong.

558
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:01,120
I'm sorry that I couldn't do anything
when you tried to take care of me.

559
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,956
I'm sorry…

560
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,878
I couldn't fill that dark hole.

561
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,221
You're sorry?

562
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,101
Yes.

563
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:28,772
And…

564
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,610
I'm sorry that I plan
to lock you up in this well forever.

565
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,254
Even after everything…

566
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,381
Let's end this.

567
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,352
You said you were sorry.

568
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,064
You said…

569
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,860
you believed me now.

570
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:43,365
You said you knew
that I saved you 1,000 years ago.

571
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,288
But why are you doing this? Why?

572
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,916
Are you listening?

573
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,845
I'm exhausted.

574
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,308
I really need to end this fight with you.

575
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,312
Get locked up in this miserable well

576
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,984
and live an eternal life of suffering.

577
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,612
And regret…

578
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,826
that you betrayed me
and took Min Sang-un's side.

579
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,417
Before I put you away in the well,

580
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,086
I'll kill her in front of you.

581
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,802
What?

582
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:31,223
You should be
taking your revenge on Hwal, not me.

583
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,031
No!

584
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,497
What are you doing?

585
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,134
What are you doing, Detective Kwon?

586
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,094
I told you not to shoot him in the heart!

587
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,138
Bulgasal…

588
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,726
Both Bulgasals must die!

589
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,492
-What are you doing?
-Move.

590
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,870
Get off him.

591
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:38,373
-Why are you doing this?
-Both Bulgasals must die!

592
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,709
I will end it here.

593
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:44,087
Why? Why are you trying to kill Hwal too?

594
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,051
-Get off him!
-I can't!

595
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,554
He's not just Bulgasal.

596
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,848
It's Hwal.

597
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:58,727
He saved us multiple times.

598
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,980
It's Hwal.

599
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,193
If you don't, Dad will beat you again.

600
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,552
We should get rid of
Ok Eul-tae first. Please?

601
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,681
We have to poison him first.

602
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,909
Detective Kwon, you're bleeding…

603
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,715
How is he already…

604
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,512
He drank Hwal's blood,
so he must have recovered quickly.

605
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,347
I have to inject the poison right now!

606
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,551
I finally got you.

607
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,472
How long has it been
since I grabbed you like this?

608
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,611
Run away now!

609
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,070
Didn't you hear Hwal?

610
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,655
You have to live, Sang-un.

611
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,158
I'll go back with Hwal. So…

612
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,410
Detective Kwon!

613
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,336
That's enough.

614
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,133
You gave me no choice but to do this.

615
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,224
Run! Run away!

616
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,977
Hurry…

617
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,395
You won't be able to recover for years
if you don't drink human blood.

618
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:33,108
Then you won't be able to die or live.

619
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,114
Well, that doesn't matter now.

620
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,304
You can't go.

621
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,223
I won't let you go after Sang-un.

622
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,851
I won't let you.

623
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,811
Stop it, please.

624
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,066
What a miserable life you have.

625
00:53:56,858 --> 00:54:00,236
You always end up
in the middle of all this.

626
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,322
Six hundred years ago,

627
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,909
a thousand years ago, and now too.

628
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,662
You still got dragged into all of this.

629
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,964
That's enough. Rest now.

630
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:23,718
And I'm always grateful to you.

631
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,554
Thank you

632
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,308
for bringing Hwal and Min Sang-un here.

633
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,843
I can't run away like this.

634
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,764
I won't leave alone.

635
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,933
I will finish Ok Eul-tae here.

636
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:15,854
And I'll go back home with you
and Detective Kwon.

637
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,160
We'll all go back to our family.

638
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,080
Let's go back home.

639
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,932
Hwal.

640
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,187
Hwal. Are you there?

641
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,011
A long time ago, when I was a kid,

642
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,555
Bulgasal killed my father.

643
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,102
My father was

644
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,772
a reincarnated Monster who killed people.

645
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,817
And my baby sister died

646
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,570
because of Bulgasal that day.

647
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,325
The day that she died…

648
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,957
has always stayed with me.

649
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,628
Even after all this time has gone by
and I've become an old man,

650
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,549
I could never let go of that day.

651
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,801
I couldn't

652
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:14,055
apologize enough to my sister.

653
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,995
The kid that day…

654
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,540
Why did you do that?

655
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,086
Why did you do that?

656
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,172
Why did you just leave us?

657
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:51,134
I get that you killed my father
because he was an evil man.

658
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,846
But you could have saved my sister.

659
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,140
You could have saved her.

660
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,934
You knew that we were hiding there.

661
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,769
Why didn't you help us?

662
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,614
I couldn't forgive you
when I found out you had left us there.

663
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,827
But I can't kill you now,

664
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,623
even if I waited
for this moment my whole life.

665
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,044
Because…

666
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,714
I've become attached to you.

667
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:37,472
I won't be able to face
my sister when I die.

668
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,519
Detective Kwon.

669
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:48,650
Hwal.

670
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,194
Were you awake?

671
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,489
Are you okay?

672
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,076
We don't have much time.

673
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,412
Ok Eul-tae went after Sang-un.

674
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,830
You have to save her.

675
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,757
I know that you don't drink human blood.

676
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,554
But can you make
an exception just this time?

677
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,180
No…

678
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:23,017
This is the only way
you can defeat Ok Eul-tae.

679
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,523
No, I can't.

680
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:32,110
I'll give you my blood.

681
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,863
No, not that.

682
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:40,118
It doesn't matter because I'll die anyway.

683
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,044
I'm sorry.

684
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,884
I ruined everything.

685
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,845
And…

686
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,601
tell Si-ho…

687
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,315
she can…

688
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,737
dye my hair some other time.

689
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,490
Detective Kwon.

690
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:27,707
Detective Kwon.

691
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,584
Detective Kwon!

692
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,097
Father.

693
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:45,933
Let's go.

694
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,562
Come with me.

695
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:03,701
Be born as my real son in your next life.

696
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,746
I will protect you, my son.

697
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:10,083
Father.

698
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:47,472
The evil spirit
that fed off its father's blood

699
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:53,227
will rise up from the dark hole.

700
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:17,460
1,000 YEARS AGO

701
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,747
What have you done?

702
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,916
I despise you.

703
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,254
I truly despise you.

704
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,006
This will not kill me.

705
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,342
I will come back.

706
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:07,927
And when I do,

707
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,638
I will tear apart
the people who did this to me

708
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,932
and I will drink their blood.

709
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:14,684
And…

710
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,019
I will find you.

711
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,188
You…

712
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,275
are mine.

713
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,347
I shouldn't have

714
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,475
let you meet again in the first place.

715
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,813
I still have something left to do.

716
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,773
We will behead them.

717
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:06,819
And we will bury them deep underground
after chopping off their limbs.

718
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,405
I refuse to become human again.

719
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,240
I had no choice.

720
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,827
You'll go back to being
the Bulgasal you once were

721
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,246
and help me get rid of this dark hole.

722
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:24,253
