1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,050


2
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,016
   

3
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:40,030
   

4
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,100
My private warehouse is guarded in three shifts day and night.

5
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,719
How could mere water bandits possibly sneak in and steal things?

6
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,859
Moreover, no one has reported any thefts previously.

7
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:01,100
It must be those water bandits spouting nonsense.

8
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,780
They said this fire oil was rare and hard to come by.

9
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,080
They secretly hid a jar before committing arson.

10
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,839
Let's bring them up in a moment. Compare the two oils, and it'll become clear.

11
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,580
Why would these water bandits burn your garden for no reason?

12
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,300
They were hired by someone, paid to do the job.

13
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,779
Who has the audacity to harm my Floral Envoy?!

14
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:34,490
Your Majesty, the water bandits confessed that it was

15
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,510
County Princess Ji An.

16
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:54,800
Your Majesty, I've never met this person. This is slander.

17
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:59,580
You Zhen is a lady of the inner chambers. What would she know about fire oil?

18
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,780
There must be some misunderstanding.

19
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,020
If the County Princess says no, I certainly believe it.

20
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,580
What truth could possibly come from the mouths of water bandits?

21
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,160
They probably stole the fire oil and wanted to frame the County Princess.

22
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,239
However, the oil has burned down to just 50 barrels. There's no further evidence.

23
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,059
We don't know how much they actually stole at the beginning.

24
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:31,859
What if they hid more than one jar? What if they have other accomplices?

25
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,059
Wouldn't that mean Chang'an is in grave danger?

26
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,700
Jingzhao Prefecture stop overseeing this matter. Leave it to Ministry of Justice.

27
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,019
On what date was the fire oil confiscated? How long did it remain in the treasury?

28
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,200
Through whose hands did it pass? Do the water bandits have accomplices?

29
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,460
Have they hidden any other dangerous items?

30
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,260
You must investigate all this thoroughly.

31
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,379
Yes, Your Majesty.

32
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:08,339
No need to investigate further. I'm the one who did it.

33
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,420
Your Majesty, I was dissatisfied because my husband cared for his ex-wife.

34
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,339
This drove me to irrationality and I sought revenge.

35
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,140
I stole fire oil from my father's treasury and had Fragrance Garden set on fire.

36
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,060
You Zhen, you're so muddled!

37
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,099
This now involves the Ministry of Justice.

38
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:37,299
I don't wish my mistake to tarnish my father's reputation, bringing him trouble.

39
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:40,739
I'm terrified and full of regret.

40
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,820
I beg Your Majesty for forgiveness.

41
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:51,480
Previously, Liu Chang searched my store, and now you set fire to my garden.

42
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,979
You two are taking turns targeting me.

43
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:59,339
Is it because you're jealous Mu Dan and I are in love and wealth is pouring in for us?

44
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,400
Your Highness, you must stand up for me.

45
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,020
Otherwise, I'll never dare to set foot in your mansion again.

46
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:18,380
Rest assured, Sui Zhi. I'll give you a proper explanation.

47
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,539
A prince who commits a crime is subject to the same punishment as a commoner.

48
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:28,390
This is You Zhen's fault.

49
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,380
Without punishment, it won't appease the public's anger.

50
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,399
Official Ren handle this according to the law.

51
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,579
For intentional arson, it warrants...

52
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:47,299
three years of penal servitude and exile of 2,000 li.

53
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,199
Okay.

54
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,260
However, considering her voluntary confession,

55
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,060
the punishment can be reduced.

56
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,650
Why not...

57
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:08,060
Why not impose a light punishment as a warning? Your Majesty, what do you think?

58
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,179
Your righteous stand against personal ties truly sets an example for all ministers.

59
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:27,339
No matter what, You Zhen is my niece.

60
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:30,539
Receiving punishment in public would be disgraceful to the royal family's dignity.

61
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:34,659
Just punish her privately in the palace and give the people an explanation.

62
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,779
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,620
The one who suffered from this is Sui Zhi. Does this handling of it satisfy you?

64
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,380
Your Majesty is wise, I'm certainly satisfied.

65
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:53,940
Public grievances are appeased, but funds for repairing the garden are still needed.

66
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:01,260
I'll have the money for repairing Fragrance Garden sent to your residence tomorrow.

67
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:04,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

68
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:32,639
Your Highness, it's time.

69
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:24,800
♫  The Luo River cleanses the ridges of the moonlight  ♫

70
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,603
♫  Flowing into a scorching, endless river  ♫

71
00:08:31,603 --> 00:08:37,015
♫  A beauty refuses the temptation of the mortal world  ♫

72
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:44,428
♫  Youthful splendor charts its own wandering course  ♫

73
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:49,303
♫  Do not let the mundane world bind you,  ♫

74
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:52,371
nor shallow, presumptive gazes question you ♫

75
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:58,967
♫  Laugh as storms overturn the dust  ♫

76
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:04,818
♫  A blooming flower with proud spirit reflects the color of the sky  ♫

77
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:06,719
♫  And never withering  ♫

78
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:13,919
♫  Don’t let time tarnish the beauty of the fragrance  ♫

79
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:52,760
Did the fire in Fragrance Garden burn vigorously?

80
00:09:56,319 --> 00:10:02,240
Is appreciating flowers under the glow of the fire unique?

81
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,200
Thanks to you, the great fire created a new type of peony, Burnt Bone Red Jade.

82
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,240
It also burned you, Li You Zhen.

83
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,140
It seems the karmic cycle of the world is indeed interesting.

84
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,620
A mere merchant, and you dare speak to me like this.

85
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,819
Even if I suffered a punishment, so what?

86
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,340
I'm the County Princess of the current dynasty.

87
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:48,280
In the future, as long as I wish, do you think you can stay alive?

88
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:53,740
When we joined forces in Luoyang, you knew I had no feelings for Liu Chang.

89
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,779
Why still repeatedly plot against me?

90
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:02,520
Because of you, I'm unable to bear children.

91
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,120
Because of you, Zi Shu won't even spare me a glance.

92
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,659
Do you know the worse than death feeling of being torn apart in marriage?

93
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,690
Each day Zi Shu can't let go of you,

94
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,900
you living is a sin.

95
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,820
But I'm not the only one you harmed.

96
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,039
What wrong have those innocent people in Fragrance Garden done?

97
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,579
Those ants are only fit to be in your company.

98
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:42,900
What does their life or death have to do with me?

99
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,179
In your eyes, common people are all ants.

100
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:51,740
But isn't your luxurious lifestyle

101
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,380
built on the grain and bricks laid down by these ants?

102
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,099
Being so obsessed over someone who doesn't love you,

103
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:07,340
turning into a bloodstained monster, doesn't it make you feel sorrow?

104
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:18,220
Without obsession, how can one speak of love?

105
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,900
You don't even know what I've been through before.

106
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:33,699
As women, it isn't easy for us to establish ourselves and make a living.

107
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,179
Some are treated as pawns in the struggle for power and profit.

108
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:42,640
While others can only serve as playthings for men's amusement.

109
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,519
There are even women who can't be called human, discarded like worn-out shoes.

110
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:53,260
Many times, we have no choice.

111
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:00,299
Since this is the case, why not live for ourselves when we have the choice?

112
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,800
Why make things difficult for each other?

113
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,179
Being rigid leads to breakage, holding on leads to delusion.

114
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,140
There isn't only one person to love, nor only one thing to seek in this vast world.

115
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,790
I hope you take care of yourself

116
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,340
and not harm others and yourself anymore.

117
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,500
Mu Dan.

118
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,579
Only these are left to be moved.

119
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,620
Da Fu, you've worked hard these days. Thank you for helping me move.

120
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,420
It's nothing.

121
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,319
When you got married, Master Jiang said sweet words, like he couldn't live without you.

122
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:07,619
How long was it before he got engaged to someone else?

123
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:09,539
You worked so hard to earn so much money for him.

124
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,040
He didn't treat you well and even drove you away, so heartless.

125
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,299
You misunderstood. Jiang Chang Yang didn't drive me away.

126
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,179
I wanted to leave myself. It has nothing to do with him.

127
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:23,020
At this point, you're still speaking up for that heartless man.

128
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,639
It's true, Jiang Chang Yang isn't like that.

129
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,419
He said peonies are useless.

130
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:34,020
A person who was so afraid of fire risked his life to save the flowers for me.

131
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:41,020
There are many things between him and me that only we know about.

132
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,240
In short, he's a very good person.

133
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,740
The world has misunderstood him far too much.

134
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,779
Don't blame him.

135
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,659
The feelings between men and women are really hard to understand.

136
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:59,980
But since you said so, I believe you.

137
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:05,140
I just hope you won't be too sad and treat yourself a little better.

138
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:08,880
Rest assured, I'm fine.

139
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:46,500
   

140
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:58,840
   

141
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,050
   

142
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:19,419
Does Master Jiang regret it and want to keep you?

143
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:21,040
Da Fu, give that to me.

144
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,500
Go inside and see if anything was left behind, go on.

145
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:46,480
I'm back to pack up things, and return these back to their owner.

146
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,220
   

147
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,599
I'll the divorce letter.

148
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,519
It only counts once the names are filled in.

149
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,359
I'll fill it in now. Where's the brush and ink?

150
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,580
I haven't prepared them.

151
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,860
What do you mean by this?

152
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,019
You're about to get married. It's not appropriate for me to stay here any longer.

153
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:20,470
Rest assured, I'll explain to Xue Xi.

154
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,380
- I won't let her misunderstand us. 
 - When was I marrying Xue Xi?

155
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,739
I have only sibling feelings for her.

156
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:31,939
Are you leaving because of this?

157
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,919
It's... not just because of this matter.

158
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:46,879
No matter what the cause is, this is all a misunderstanding.

159
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:51,019
The Royal Princess didn't decree the marriage, and I won't marry Xue Xi.

160
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:53,720
I've already driven away the people the Imperial Workshop.

161
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,060
As long as the Jiang Residence stands for a day, this courtyard will always be yours.

162
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,480
You already know.

163
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,820
I vow to live alone for life, not marrying anyone.

164
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,079
Do you truly... have no one you admire?

165
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,900
No.

166
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,119
Isn't it good to be free and unrestrained?

167
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,040
Indeed.

168
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:56,739
Being carefree is quite good.

169
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,699
Regarding the matter of the oil, Prince Ning and Li You Zhen must bear a grudge.

170
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:10,179
If you move away now, it'll not only arouse their suspicion,

171
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:13,620
but your safety might also be at risk.

172
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:19,739
I know, this is a temporary measure.

173
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:22,340
You can only bear with it for a while longer.

174
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:28,319
Keep this divorce letter safe for now.

175
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:33,079
Once you're safe, you can fill in the date at any time

176
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,079
and disengage and leave.

177
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:42,390
   

178
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:53,259
With you being so righteous, how could I feel wronged?

179
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:57,619
At this critical moment, if anything happens at the Jiang Residence,

180
00:20:57,619 --> 00:21:00,499
Prince Ning will seize upon it, bringing us trouble.

181
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:03,319
We should be more cautious and careful.

182
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:12,820
Since the act must continue,
how can this evidence remain?

183
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,299
How is You Zhen's injury?

184
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:49,839
The royal medicine was applied, and it has scabbed over already.

185
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,399
The physician said it won't scar.

186
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:59,399
You Zhen's punishment this time was quite unjust.

187
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:04,919
Only you can soothe this grievance.

188
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,419
I understand. I'll surely accompany You Zhen well.

189
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,419
Your Highness, You Zhen was punished, and the fire oil confiscated.

190
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:26,100
Even the military arsenal outside the city has temporarily ceased operations.

191
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,820
Do you still believe Jiang Chang Yang is innocent?

192
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:35,979
   

193
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:39,380
His Highness has sent me to investigate secretly.

194
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:45,699
The hidden losses we've suffered over the years weren't caused by him.

195
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:50,019
When I came to the capital to take office, I specifically visited the Jiang Residence.

196
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:55,319
Jiang Chang Yang was subtly asking me for favors.

197
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,540
In my view, he doesn't care who holds the reins of power.

198
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,960
He only cares about how much gold he has.

199
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,860
Better to judge a person's intent than their outward appearance.

200
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,280
But judging intent isn't as good as choosing the means.

201
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,960
Jiang Chang Yang repeatedly claims to desire wealth and women.

202
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,519
It's seemingly flawless, but in reality,

203
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,900
this outcome caused Your Highness considerable loss.

204
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,280
Zi Shu's words are indeed true.

205
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:36,699
Whether intentional or not, this person must be investigated.

206
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:38,699
Your Highness is wise.

207
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,100
Master Jiang indulged in pleasure for years, and everyone's guard is down.

208
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,900
If it was all an act,

209
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,340
seeing his close relationship with His Majesty, how could one not be afraid?

210
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:59,459
The wild goose leaves its mark as it passes. Where do you think his mark lies?

211
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:05,759
Because of the Royal Princess's guarantee, we weren't able to search his residence.

212
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,799
I wanted to insert new spies inside but it's never been successful.

213
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,639
Currently, the only person who understands the Jiang Residence the best is her.

214
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:25,100
Lian Zhou volunteered to serve at Captain Pei's mansion to make amends for past wrongs.

215
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,040
The valuable rewards that were obtained have all been taken away.

216
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,104
Only these are left.

217
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:37,219
Lian Zhou wasn't favored, spending all day withering at the Jiang Residence.

218
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,380
When idle, she copied garden scenes and painted fan surfaces.

219
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,200
How have Consort Shu's sleep and meals been lately?

220
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,459
Your Majesty,

221
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:15,800
after using Miss He's sachet, she can sleep for eight hours every night.

222
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,119
The meals tastes much better as well.

223
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:25,300
I can rest assured then. After giving birth, her stomach is weak and she's fatigued.

224
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,499
Even though it's hot, she must not indulge in coldness.

225
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:32,499
Eat fewer chilled lychees and have her soak her feet in hot water before bed.

226
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:34,320
I'll return now.

227
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,830
   

228
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,500
   

229
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:19,699
This game was played beautifully.

230
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:27,179
Someone is getting restless and is about to make a move.

231
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,380
Are you playing chess or exchanging riddles here?

232
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,780
So profound and unfathomable.

233
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:41,219
You aren't only handsome, but possess extraordinary chess skills.

234
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:44,699
Truly an elite among men.

235
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,259
Your words are so sweet today.

236
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:50,379
Are you trying to sell something you made to Third Young Master again?

237
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:52,699
Why can't Mu Dan praise me?

238
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:56,499
Exactly, I've always thought Third Young Master has extraordinary presence.

239
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:59,600
Not like your group of riff-raff friends.

240
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:05,699
You'll surely become a famous scholar. Could you write a calligraphy piece for me?

241
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:08,380
I want to hang it at Floral Haven to decorate the place.

242
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,699
Could you write The Best in the World for me?

243
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:13,879
What's so difficult about that? Don't you have several shops?

244
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:15,499
- Yes.
 - I'll write one for each shop.

245
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:17,319
- Good, very good. 
 - Wait.

246
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:21,100
Wait a minute, you seem very strange today.

247
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,340
Did something happen just now when you entered the palace?

248
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:30,179
Speaking of entering the palace, it causes such a headache.

249
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:33,580
Consort Shu's illness truly worries me.

250
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,580
What's wrong with Consort Shu?

251
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,820
She has contracted a strange illness.

252
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,259
It's tricky and easy to treat at the same time.

253
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:48,319
It's just lacking a medicinal guide, but this guide is hard to find.

254
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:53,079
What medicinal guide?

255
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,739
This is the medicinal guide.

256
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:39,639
Master Jiang, His Highness is here.

257
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,900
Your Highness,

258
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,159
kill me. If I don't die,

259
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,860
the blood of Prince Qin will be tainted.

260
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:11,900
I'm willing to die to prove Your Highness's innocence.

261
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:21,219
Your Highness, the Prime Minister's achievements are so great and mustn't be killed.

262
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:25,100
Think through it, Your Highness.

263
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,110
All these years,

264
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,060
you've governed the nation and authored books.

265
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,580
Sui Zhi, I toast you.

266
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,140
You Zhen and Zi Shu are foolish and disturbed your peace.

267
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,620
The good wine, good food, and this good show,

268
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,856
I hope can dispel your resentment.

269
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:53,780
Please don't harbor any animosity towards me.

270
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,620
Your Highness is overthinking it.

271
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,319
You always think of me. How could I blame Your Highness?

272
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,140
Let's not mention these unhappy things. Let's drink this cup to the fullest.

273
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,040
Drink to the fullest.

274
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:14,139
Just now, I heard you said you had prepared a gift for Sui Zhi.

275
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:19,659
So many chests were brought in. I thought a beauty would come out of them.

276
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:23,660
But who knew it was just a few puppets.

277
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:28,100
I heard that Sui Zhi loves to watch this.

278
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,939
I just got a new show, so I brought it to Jiang Residence to enjoy together.

279
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:34,860
Do you like it, Sui Zhi?

280
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,459
Your Highness is thoughtful.

281
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:41,659
But I prefer plays about talented scholars and beautiful women.

282
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:46,219
A group of men scheming against each other isn't interesting.

283
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,580
The Prime Minister has passed away.

284
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:14,300
Prime Minister Lu served as the imperial regent under the First Emperor.

285
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:22,499
He rendered great service to the Qin Dynasty, yet ended up with such a fate.

286
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:26,219
What a pity!

287
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:28,939
I really dislike the First Emperor.

288
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:32,860
Brutal and unkind, repays kindness with enmity.

289
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:40,159
Seeing Prime Minister Lu makes me sigh deeply.

290
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:47,940
I'm getting old, I should... retire and live in seclusion.

291
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,100
Your Highness thinks too much.

292
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,240
His Majesty and Your Highness are brothers.

293
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,200
How can the First Emperor compare to Prime Minister Lu?

294
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,499
My brother.

295
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:09,050
Your Majesty.

296
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,939
These years, it's thanks to you for sharing my worries.

297
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:19,340
The civil and military officials in the court make my head ache with their quarrels.

298
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,240
The officials in the prefectures are never at peace for a day.

299
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,659
I can't do without you.

300
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:34,480
We're blood-connected. You must help me.

301
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:43,060
Your Majesty, the court affairs occur frequently, the household is hard to keep stable.

302
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:48,860
I'm exhausted. A solitary tree cannot support itself.

303
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:56,900
It's been a long time since we've spoken like this.

304
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,979
My brother.

305
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:08,780
Sui Zhi, I heard there is good wine hidden in the mansion.

306
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,019
I just acquired ten jars of top-quality Frozen Spring.

307
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:16,960
I'll go fetch them. Today, we drink till we're merry.

308
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,939
- Okay.
 - Sui Zhi.

309
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:23,639
There's no need for you to fetch it. I'll have a servant go get it.

310
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:25,620
No need to trouble Your Highness, I'll go myself.

311
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,659
Sui Zhi.

312
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,259
The Jiang Mansion isn't a fairy palace maze.

313
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:41,699
Is it possible my people can't even find a jar of wine?

314
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,780
Reward them!

315
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

316
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:02,280
My brother.

317
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,040
You're drunk.

318
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:20,139
Vice Minister Liu, well…

319
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:25,280
Invited by His Highness, we're entering the mansion to seek wine.

320
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,420
Yes.

321
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,380
Today's wine is good, the play is good.

322
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,300
I'll play a piece for Your Majesty and Your Highness.

323
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,979
With music to accompany the wine, is that not wonderful?

324
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:50,780
- Good.
 - Bring my zither.

325
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,580
Yes.

326
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,680
   

327
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,300
 The fan depicts a house from the Jiang Residence. 

328
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,499
 Both sides should have equal structure and uniform layout. 

329
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:45,780
 But the west courtyard has a window, while the east becomes a wall. 

330
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,860
 The stone foundation underneath is also somewhat different. 

331
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,839
 I'm afraid there might be a secret chamber hidden underneath this wall. 

332
00:36:54,939 --> 00:36:58,839
 Please allow me to investigate the Jiang Residence. 

333
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,380
Vice Minister Liu it has two doors and four windows like the west courtyard.

334
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,800
- Guest room, one door and two windows. 
 - Vice Minister Liu,

335
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,799
all the fine wines of the Jiang Residence are here. You may select at will.

336
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:13,979
There's no need to mobilize so many people.

337
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:19,820
Aged fine wine has been stored too long. I'm afraid you might miss some.

338
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,479
Let me go and look for it myself.

339
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:25,879
This place is near Young Madam's courtyard.

340
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:29,280
In recent days, she's troubled by headaches due to Fragrance Garden's renovations.

341
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,380
She can't bear the noise.

342
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,059
How about you sit in the side hall while I invite Young Madam...?

343
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,680
Miss He is unwell and should rest properly.

344
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,280
The social matters between gentlemen shouldn't trouble the women.

345
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:10,180
Sui Zhi has already nodded. Are you disrespecting your master?

346
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:15,860
Or do you not respect His Highness?

347
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:19,220
I dare not.

348
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,860
Since there are many imperial gifts in the mansion,

349
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,199
I'm afraid you might damage something that can't be compensated.

350
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,799
- How about I lead the way for you? 
 - No need, search.

351
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:42,059
Sui Zhi's zither skills have truly improved.

352
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:49,120
Brother, don't just focus on the music, drink.

353
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:05,039
- Your Majesty. 
 - My brother, sit.

354
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:45,059
My brother, there's no more wine. When will it arrive?

355
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:47,590
Your Majesty, don't worry.

356
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:53,030
Good wine will take some time.

357
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:06,619
Okay now.

358
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,680
This piece is your specialty, how did you play the wrong note?

359
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,959
Have your skills dulled or is something on your mind?

360
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:46,940


361
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:56,796
 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining 

362
00:41:56,796 --> 00:42:03,870
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

363
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:12,384
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

364
00:42:12,384 --> 00:42:20,476
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

365
00:42:20,476 --> 00:42:28,728
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫ 

366
00:42:28,728 --> 00:42:37,125
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

367
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:45,312
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

368
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:53,628
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

369
00:42:53,628 --> 00:43:01,628
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

370
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:29,780
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫ 

371
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:37,231
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

372
00:43:37,231 --> 00:43:45,317
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫ 

373
00:43:45,317 --> 00:43:53,526
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫ 

374
00:43:53,526 --> 00:44:01,888
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

375
00:44:01,888 --> 00:44:10,044
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

376
00:44:10,044 --> 00:44:18,572
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

377
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:26,672
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
