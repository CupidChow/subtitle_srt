1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040


2
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:37,152
   

3
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:40,000
   

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,759
Bravo!

5
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,920
- Dismount.
  - Yes, Sir! 

6
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,840
Make way!

7
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,640
Bravo!

8
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:17,279
Captain Pei, you give me too much credit.

9
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:22,659
Young Master is currently in the palace with Miss Xiao and the Royal Princess.

10
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:25,499
Why would he come all the way here just for me?

11
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,260
Honestly, in his eyes,

12
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,640
I'm merely a humble wife who earns money for him.

13
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,900
After my death, all my property will go to my husband's family.

14
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,580
If he were to cry for me for one day, it would mean he got sentimental.

15
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,099
You bet on the wrong person.

16
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,860
When he sobers up tomorrow in the residence,

17
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,740
he might not even notice that I haven't returned to the residence.

18
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,300
You're pouring me a drink, yet you tie my hands.

19
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,460
How am I supposed to drink it?

20
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,460
Rather than waiting with me until tomorrow, why don't you untie me first?

21
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,979
How about I accompany you to enjoy the moon and drink together?

22
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,900
It seems I won the bet.

23
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,499
If Jiang Chang Yang dies before you,

24
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:34,710
I wonder...

25
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,470
how many days you would cry.

26
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:49,152
Jiang Chang Yang!

27
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,900
Don't move!

28
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,740
Put down the knife and tell your people to leave.

29
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,368
Quick!

30
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:25,820
You love your wife so dearly,

31
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,940
so you should know how painful it is to have your loved one taken away.

32
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,859
Xue Xi and I share only sibling-like feelings.

33
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:38,859
She avoids you only because she hasn't yet gotten over the last event.

34
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:42,820
You can't fulfill His Highness's task, so you take your anger out on me.

35
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,900
- That isn't proper, right?
 - It sounds nice.

36
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,219
During the Lantern Festival, weren't you paired up with her!

37
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:54,580
Traveling with a beauty while unable to let go of your beloved wife.

38
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,280
You're a flirt, you don't need Xue Xi.

39
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,779
- But I'm different. 
 - Even if you do this,

40
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:05,840
whether I'm around or not, Xue Xi won't marry you.

41
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,016
For the Xiao family and His Highness's dignity, she hasn't said anything.

42
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,239
Why don't you quit while you're ahead?

43
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:14,380
Even if this marriage can't happen,

44
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,659
there will still be many opportunities to serve His Highness.

45
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,960
But if you anger the Xiao family and anger me,

46
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,659
aren't you afraid of disturbing His Majesty?

47
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:47,779
Sui Zhi, I have no intention of being your enemy.

48
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:52,700
It's just that I have no means of dealing with Xue Xi.

49
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,460
If you really want to ease Prince Ning's worries,

50
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,199
just lend me a hand and persuade Xue Xi more.

51
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,940
Although Xue Xi seems fragile, she's got a determination.

52
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,140
It' extremely hard for her to turn back after she's made a decision.

53
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,060
I can't control how she chooses a husband.

54
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,024
Forget it.

55
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,040
Thank you for the reminder.

56
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,859
I was muddled today.

57
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:26,299
Take her away.

58
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:49,559
Hurry and go! There's a trap!

59
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,460
Jiang Chang Yang! Jiang…

60
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:28,539
Without you, there won't be anything between me and Xue Xi.

61
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,076
Young Master, the sword!

62
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,419
Open the secret room!

63
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,699
Even someone as notorious as you has people willing to die for you.

64
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,419
Utterly ridiculous.

65
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,059
Open the secret room, or I'll kill you now.

66
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,500
I belong to Prince Ning. Do you dare?

67
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,539
Come on!

68
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,340
Jiang Chang Yang!

69
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,579
This is an imperial sword. Ask yourself if I dare.

70
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,620
Open it!

71
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,220
Mu Dan.

72
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,772
Mu Dan.

73
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,384
Where's the antidote?

74
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:40,020
Even with the antidote, she probably won't survive like this.

75
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,860
If she dies, you'll be buried with her.

76
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,699
The antidote.

77
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:51,079
Quick, go get the antidote.

78
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:52,550
Yes, Sir.

79
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:06,299
Jiang Chang Yang, so what if you can afford top experts to protect your life?

80
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:10,939
Do you think those noble ladies dare marry you?

81
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:17,620
Only such lowly merchant women would be willing to go to hell with you.

82
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,360
I won't kill you now,

83
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,279
only because her safety is more important than you.

84
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:32,980
If you dare harm my people again, I'll take your life.

85
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:40,980
You pretend to be righteous and loyal.

86
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:45,079
How are you better than me?

87
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:52,939
Everyone knows you're full of evil deeds and have enemies everywhere.

88
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:59,500
Someone like you is destined to harm your wife and friends.

89
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,679
Abandoned by all, you'll live a lonely life.

90
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,600
Shut up!

91
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,819
Make way!

92
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,419
How is she?

93
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:50,440
Will this poison leave any residual problems? When will she wake up?

94
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,300
According to Physician Fu's instructions, after acupuncture for three days

95
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,380
the remaining toxins will be removed. It poses no harm to the body.

96
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,059
She should wake up within the next two hours.

97
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,879
You can send someone to prepare some soft and sticky porridge.

98
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,112
Chuan Yu.

99
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:10,299
It was due to my poor handling that Mu Dan was dragged into this.

100
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:14,519
Pei Zhong came for me. I harmed her.

101
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:16,559
Young Master Liu!

102
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,579
Since you can't protect her, why not let her leave?

103
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:23,999
- It's all because of you that she's been in so much danger. 
 - Enough.

104
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:26,939
It's all my fault. Please don't blame him.

105
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:30,839
Because of your own confidence, you put my sister in danger.

106
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,299
What did my sister do wrong for her to suffer this unforeseen disaster?

107
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,659
Young Master Liu, Mu Dan is fine now.

108
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,048
Calm down.

109
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,679
This time she's fine, but what about next time?

110
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,140
I have only one sister left.

111
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,400
I don't want to lose her as well.

112
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:54,479
 Someone like you is destined to harm your wife and friends. 

113
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:58,799
 Abandoned by all, you'll live a lonely life. 

114
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:39,140
Mu Dan, you're awake.

115
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,340
- Da Fu.
 - Sister.

116
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,168
Young Master Liu.

117
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,896
Be careful.

118
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:59,659
Where is Jiang Chang Yang?

119
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,492
He's dead.

120
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,080
What did you say?

121
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,640
Don't listen to his nonsense. He's fine, doing well.

122
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,200
Why isn't he here?

123
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:14,059
Do you care about him that much?

124
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:17,880
Only Da Fu and I are here guarding you. Does this disappoint you?

125
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,868
You clearly know…

126
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:25,640
You know that's not what I meant.

127
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,419
Today's situation was critical.

128
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,559
Not seeing him makes me uneasy.

129
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,459
He has you and guards protecting him. What danger could he be in?

130
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,500
Enough, Young Master Liu.

131
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,760
Young Master Jiang is truly fine. He's gone back.

132
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,419
Just now he sent Chuan Yu with food.

133
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,679
He also sent donkey hide pudding.

134
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,140
When you encountered danger, were you truly unafraid of death?

135
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,500
Have you ever thought if something happened to you,

136
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,619
me, Da Fu, Xiao Chun, and everyone at Fragrance Garden and Floral Haven,

137
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:04,659
what would we do?

138
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,900
At that moment, I didn't have time to think so much.

139
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:16,340
I only knew I couldn't let him face any danger.

140
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,659
You're wholeheartedly devoted to Jiang Chang Yang.

141
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:23,839
What about him? Is he worth such devotion from you?

142
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:31,699
I know you've always been quite biased against him.

143
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,819
But do you know?

144
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:39,419
Whether in Luoyang, the military camp, or Chang'an,

145
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:44,959
he repeatedly pulled me out of darkness.

146
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:51,380
I don't know if he has ever asked himself if it's worth it for me.

147
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,392
I only know

148
00:15:55,324 --> 00:16:00,928
to die for someone who understands you,
you'll have no regrets.

149
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,056
Jiang Chang Yang.

150
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:33,360
It's late and the dew is heavy. You be resting in bed and recuperating.

151
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,699
I'm just here to test the waters.

152
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:40,220
If Young Master Liu hurt you, I can't afford to compensate.

153
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,340
We'd have to move overnight.

154
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,360
It was such a nice Lantern Festival.

155
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,380
I almost caused you to miss seeing this full moon.

156
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,279
You don't need to blame yourself. You helped me so much before.

157
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,299
This time, consider it me paying you for your kindness.

158
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,819
I help you because I have the ability to do so.

159
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,220
What about you?

160
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,939
What do you mean by that?

161
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,520
Our marriage was a façade, meant for outsiders to see.

162
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,839
It wasn't mutual affection.

163
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,739
There's no need to act as if we're bound by life and death.

164
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,219
From now on, don't take risks for me anymore.

165
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,580
I came to find you, and this is what you say to me?

166
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,900
Jiang Chang Yang, what's wrong with you?

167
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,720
I'm just scared thinking about today's events.

168
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:31,856
Mu Dan,

169
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,620
I'm very fortunate to have you as a close friend.

170
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,659
That day in front of Prince Ning, you helped me hide the secret chamber.

171
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,900
I'm very grateful.

172
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,680
But today you risked your life to save me.

173
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,844
For me...

174
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,140
it's a heavy burden.

175
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,812
Burden?

176
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:22,300
You're He Wei Fang, the leader of flower merchants.

177
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,780
The owner of Floral Haven.

178
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:27,839
You rely on no one else.

179
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,820
You've created a world of fragrance with your own hands.

180
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,359
You should live freely and unrestrained.

181
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,460
You shouldn't compromise for anything. You certainly shouldn't...

182
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,340
put yourself at risk for anyone.

183
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:57,950
Yes,

184
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,380
living freely and unrestrained is how I should be.

185
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,860
You're right.

186
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:09,780
I've taken your words to heart.

187
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:17,000
From now on, we owe each other nothing, dear friend.

188
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:21,884
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫ 

189
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:25,880
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫ 

190
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,912
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫ 

191
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:34,764
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫ 

192
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,672
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫ 

193
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:43,900
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫ 

194
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,932
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫ 

195
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:52,416
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫ 

196
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,892
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫ 

197
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:09,540
 ♫ The heart is boundless ♫ 

198
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,868
 ♫ Only wish to cherish day and night ♫

00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:21,659
 ♫ The flowers bloom and fall, searching with you ♫ 

200
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:24,839
- Young Master.
 - No need.

201
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,179
Have you thought it through? Are you really going to give up telling her?

202
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,820
It was after this event that I realized something.

203
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:43,880
I'm already used to countless dangers.

204
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,699
But how can I ask her to get used to it too?

205
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:55,459
I shouldn't selfishly try to keep her by my side.

206
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:00,230
All of this,

207
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,650
take it down.

208
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:12,240
I've walked alone through the long night for too long.

209
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,540
I no longer dare to hope to last until sunrise.

210
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:23,499
Having a distant moon to look at is already a blessing.

211
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:29,279
Why turn this moon into a paper lantern?

212
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:35,459
If the great enterprise isn't accomplished in the future,

213
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:40,340
it means forcing her to extinguish with me.

214
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:45,040
But outsiders all believe that Miss He is your beloved concubine.

215
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,000
If you become true lovers, there's no difference from the current situation.

216
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,200
When this feeling isn't revealed,

217
00:22:57,939 --> 00:23:00,150
if another crisis arises,

218
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,380
I can still persuade her to leave as a friend.

219
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,680
If she knows my feelings,

220
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:10,259
with her personality,

221
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,599
no matter the peril she faces, she would never abandon me.

222
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,960
I don't fear death,

223
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,050
but I fear...

224
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,100
her dying because of me.

225
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,759
But Young Master, I think…

226
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,200
What about Pei Zhong?

227
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,790
Tell She Yan...

228
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,490
to handle things according to the old rules.

229
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:58,580
The Prince Ning's secret forces in Chang'an are all under Pei Zhong's command.

230
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,440
Following this lead, She Yan can figure out all of Prince Ning's forces.

231
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,459
If Pei Zhong is killed at this time,

232
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:09,300
Prince Ning might appoint someone, making it hard to trace.

233
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,060
The great cause has not yet succeeded. Please think thrice.

234
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:18,900
We can spare his life,

235
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:25,340
but I must avenge Mu Dan.

236
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,419
A gentleman can wait ten years to seek revenge,

237
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,019
but as the Floral Envoy, I can do it for my own heart's content.

238
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:36,140
Yes.

239
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,140
Let go of me!

240
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:56,540
Jiang Chang Yang, you wretched scoundrel!

241
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,839
Jiang Chang Yang!

242
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,380
He is so reckless.

243
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,720
Not only did he hurt me and insult me, but also spread this all over Chang'an.

244
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,240
Now outsiders all laugh at me.

245
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,128
In this manner,

246
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:15,820
he shows such disregard for Your Highness.

247
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,259
I request Your Highness to stand up for me.

248
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:25,820
The verdict is based on evidence, not intentions.

249
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,019
He left no evidence behind.

250
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:32,739
How can a judgment be made solely on your words?

251
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:38,300
I saw with my own eyes that the one leading to harm me was his guard.

252
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,219
Aside from you, are there any other witnesses?

253
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,900
You plotted to frame him.

254
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,548
Given his disposition, only stabbing you twice and beating you up

255
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:55,739
already shows me great respect.

256
00:25:56,979 --> 00:26:00,540
Xue Xi came the day before yesterday.

257
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,000
Guess what she said to me.

258
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,939
I don't know.

259
00:26:08,939 --> 00:26:12,259
You two vied for her favor,

260
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,599
but Xue Xi was constantly defending Jiang Chang Yang.

261
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,340
In the matter of winning a lady's favor, you really ought to learn from him.

262
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,940
- Your Highness, Jiang Chang Yang's profligate ways… 
 - Just admit defeat.

263
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,459
If grace remains, perhaps you can somehow get the upper hand.

264
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:36,960
Xue Xi's inclinations aren't important.

265
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:44,900
What is important is to not neglect the Xiao family.

266
00:26:46,699 --> 00:26:48,436
Yes.

267
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,950
   

268
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,300
   

269
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,140
Mu Dan! Mu Dan!

270
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,699
What's wrong?

271
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:07,399
It's been hard to wait for the reopening of the voyage.

272
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:09,659
But our merchant ships heading south have all been intercepted.

273
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,380
- Why? 
 - I went around to inquire.

274
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,760
The people at the dock were all polite, but they all hesitated.

275
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,620
They said it was orders from the higher-ups.

276
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,540
What is your purpose in intercepting my merchant ships?

277
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:32,419
Today, I was promoted and the "deputy" removed from my title.

278
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,520
And today,

279
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,140
nothing much.

280
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:42,419
I just wanted to see you.

281
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,699
Accompany me for a drink and watch the sunset for a while.

282
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:51,100
Tomorrow your merchant ships can surely leave the port.

283
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,000
My merchant ships don't have to only go down this water route.

284
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,419
I hope you'll let me take the goods away.

285
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:06,340
My shop is very busy. Forgive me for not accompanying you.

286
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:16,380
Take this. It'll allow your ships to pass unimpeded.

287
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:42,159
Today, I only want you to accompany me for a while, just a while.

288
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,060
Do you have to avoid me so quickly?

289
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,060
Even when I avoid you,

290
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,040
my place was set on fire and my house raided.

291
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,280
If you pester me, wouldn't I be left with no life?

292
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,040
That's because you belong to Jiang Chang Yang.

293
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,380
He competes jealously with Pei Zhong, yet got you poisned and in danger.

294
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:07,259
If you stay with such a playboy, your future days won't be peaceful.

295
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,079
I heard for those with broken legs, the cold is the hardest to endure.

296
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:18,140
You're burning two fire pits.

297
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,540
It seems the old injury still hurts, doesn't it?

298
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,879
Don't forget you're Prince Ning's son-in-law.

299
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:39,160
Prince Ning is wise and tolerant.

300
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,060
If you can be of use to him,

301
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,219
you can traverse all the nation's trade routes freely.

302
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:49,820
In less than three years, Floral Haven will surely spread throughout the lands.

303
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:56,219
After all this talking, you force me to reveal myself just for money.

304
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,739
Why do you have to pretend here?

305
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,280
To the outside, I endure humiliation for the greater good.

306
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,540
That's to clear away obstacles for our future.

307
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,559
Before you, I never pretend.

308
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,060
Don't you like peonies?

309
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:28,560
When Floral Haven has spread across the world,

310
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,179
we'll spend the winter in the south.

311
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:38,380
I can always ensure peonies surround you.

312
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:52,359
Liu Chang, you really make me laugh.

313
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,699
Before, you and I were at daggers drawn.

314
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:57,839
Now, you're pretending to be affectionate here.

315
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,559
Your persistence is nothing more than for your own ambitions.

316
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,939
For your own selfish desires.

317
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:06,459
This isn't love at all.

318
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,912
This isn't love?

319
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:16,459
When I learned that you were going to marry Jiang Chang Yang,

320
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,699
I was like a puddle of mud,

321
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:21,680
imprisoned in that filthy dungeon.

322
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,820
My heartache then far exceeded the pain of this broken leg.

323
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,300
Isn't this called love?

324
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,540
Do you know what love is?

325
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:38,659
True love is to love what they love and feel the pain they feel.

326
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:40,699
Fulfillment isn't confinement.

327
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,060
A heart full of love shouldn't be a sword that hurts people.

328
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,480
It's the bright moon, quietly guarding, enduring forever.

329
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,540
- Do you truly love Jiang Chang Yang?
 - Yes.

330
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,404
Impossible!

331
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Jiang Chang Yang is corrupt and lawless, wild and unruly.

332
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,739
How could he win your heart?

333
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,559
I didn't understand what love was before.

334
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,019
It was Jiang Chang Yang who made me understand what it means to love someone.

335
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:22,499
And you, are quite the opposite.

336
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:25,259
You ignored the County Princess, pestering me repeatedly.

337
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:27,179
This made her jealous and set Fragrance Garden ablaze.

338
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:30,760
You were the one who hurt everyone.

339
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,499
Liu Chang, I'm married to the one I love.

340
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,759
There has long been nothing between us.

341
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,419
Treat the County Princess well and don't persist anymore.

342
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,240
Nothing between us?

343
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:00,412
What are you doing?

344
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,830
Go away!

345
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,240
Don't come over!

346
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:10,839
You loathe me this much?

347
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,392
Give it to me.

348
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:20,264
Don't hurt yourself.

349
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,879
You're overthinking it.

350
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:26,659
How could I hurt myself over someone like you?

351
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:28,984
Don't move.

352
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:36,839
Liu Chang, I'm warning you for the last time.

353
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,359
In the future, if you dare hurt me or those I love again,

354
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:45,760
I will surely point my sword at you and fight you to the death.

355
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,139
Why did you come back so late?

356
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,499
Today is your birthday.

357
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,079
Why did you go drinking alone?

358
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,380
The night is beautiful. How about I accompany you for a few more drinks?

359
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,960
You put down your pride

360
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:21,080
just to spend a birthday with the one you love.

361
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:24,280
But things didn't go as you wished.

362
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,900
He just doesn't have you in his heart.

363
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,340
Why go through so much trouble?

364
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:12,079
On your birthday, you got promoted.

365
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,660
I prepared this jade crown as a celebration gift.

366
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,820
Do you want to try it, Zi Shu?

367
00:36:17,419 --> 00:36:19,128
No need.

368
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:30,900
If you don't like it, just tell me and I'll take it away.

369
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,800
Why destroy it in front of me?

370
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:52,360
Pursuing without success, yet persisting relentlessly.

371
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:26,360
We're the same.

372
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,292
It's pathetic.

373
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:49,140
   

374
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,404
Did Liu Chang hurt you?

375
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:21,230
   

376
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,600
Young Master Jiang, you mobilized such a large force.

377
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,419
If I had returned any later,

378
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:32,820
you might have taken up your sword to go on a killing spree, right?

379
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,780
Aren't you afraid that Prince Ning and the Princess will turn against you?

380
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,059
If I did go, I would've prepared excuses.

381
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:43,280
It wouldn't reach Prince Ning's ears.

382
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,619
Indeed, you've thought it through.

383
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:53,720
But why do you need to go to such lengths for a mere friend?

384
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,320
- Doesn't this harm your reputation as the Floral Envoy? 
 - I…

385
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:05,696
Liu Chang took over the river transport.

386
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:07,740
Not only your ships,

387
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,160
any trade that cannot benefit Prince Ning will be obstructed.

388
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,099
But those ships that sail smoothly

389
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:17,860
are all involved in smuggling valuable artifacts and reselling tributes.

390
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,400
Liu Chang's control has already incited much dissatisfaction.

391
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:25,740
I'm worried that you might be implicated by him.

392
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,280
I'm not someone who maintains lingering attachments.

393
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,139
Today, I met Liu Chang and made clear what needed to be said.

394
00:39:41,139 --> 00:39:44,979
All inappropriate delusions have been severed.

395
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:48,880
Please rest assured, Young Master Jiang.

396
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:55,452
That's good.

397
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,099
Since I am the owner of Floral Haven,

398
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,579
I'll resolve any issues that arise within this shop.

399
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:06,839
And it should rightfully be resolved by myself.

400
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:10,340
I hope you can trust my ability

401
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,019
and stop worrying about my affairs.

402
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:21,039
If there's nothing else, I'll be leaving first, dear friend.

403
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:53,760
Young Master, why don't you tell Young Madam

404
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,900
that Liu Chang will be eliminated in three days

405
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,260
and that her merchant ships will sail unimpeded thereafter.

406
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,839
She would be delighted,

407
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,260
and perhaps she won't be so cold towards you.

408
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:09,059
I asked for it, so I must endure it.

409
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:12,399
You don't need to mention it in front of her.

410
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:17,104
Yes.

411
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:31,990


412
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,604
 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining
