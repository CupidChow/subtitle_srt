1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,020


2
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:37,100
   

3
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,990
   

4
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,380
This piece is your specialty, how did you play the wrong note?

5
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,659
Is it your skills have dulled or is your heart burdened?

6
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:10,420
Have your skills dulled or is something on your mind?

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,039
Sui Zhi, don't worry. It's important to enjoy ourselves today.

8
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:21,180
If anything in your residence is damaged, I'll compensate you twice over.

9
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:29,119
I'm not worried about inanimate objects, but I'm afraid it might scare my pet deer.

10
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,420
Zi Shu isn't someone with poor judgment.

11
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,519
He knows what to touch and what not to.

12
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,380
Your Majesty,

13
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:50,080
could it be that you've given Sui Zhi some extraordinary treasure I don't know about?

14
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,180
Your words overwhelm me, Your Highness.

15
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,080
When has His Majesty ever forgotten you when there are good things to share?

16
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,819
The downside of this large residence is it takes forever to fetch wine.

17
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:15,719
Sui Zhi, once the wine arrives, you must punish yourself with three cups.

18
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,379
Yes.

19
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:23,300
Your Highness went through such trouble, so I have to drink to my heart's content.

20
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,900
Sui Zhi, with your great capacity for wine, don't pretend to be drunk to fool me.

21
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:36,999
It seems the wine has been found.

22
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,279
How did you end up knocking down his wall looking for wine?

23
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,260
If not for this,

24
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:19,879
how could we know those closest to us have a hidden side?

25
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,719
- Zi Shu. 
 - Yes.

26
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,299
People have many desires, I do have a side I don't wish to share with others.

27
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:37,979
Could Your Highness do me another favor?

28
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,779
Sui Zhi, you seem nervous. It seems this secret room has many mysteries.

29
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,940
Sui Zhi, you're a close minister to His Majesty.

30
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,299
For the sake of his safety, I can't fulfill your wish.

31
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:58,650
Furthermore, Your Majesty

32
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,920
isn't worried about what might be hidden below?

33
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:22,460
Sui Zhi has been by my side since he was young.

34
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,299
We eat at the same table and travel together.

35
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:30,480
If I can't trust him, who can I trust?

36
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:34,820
Everyone has their secrets. Why must you expose them, Brother?

37
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,859
Your Majesty is magnanimous,

38
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:42,800
but I must fulfill my duty to protect you against even the slightest thing.

39
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:57,479
- Zi Shu. 
 - Yes.

40
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,760
Your Majesty, please.

41
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:19,150
   

42
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,119
Well, well, Sui Zhi, you've hidden quite a treasure here.

43
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:29,319
It's even more vibrant and aromatic than my harem.

44
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,059
It's a place of romance and bedroom secrets.

45
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,299
It isn't a sight for others, but since His Majesty and Highness have spoken,

46
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,419
I have no choice but to comply.

47
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,319
Now that everyone has seen it, I hope you're satisfied.

48
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,840
As the ancients said, food and sex are the great desires of people.

49
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,679
Sui Zhi, there's no need to feel ashamed or concerned.

50
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,960
Zi Shu, what have you found now?

51
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:20,299
These are rare treasures gathered from various places.

52
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:23,659
If you like it, I can give you one or two.

53
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:26,579
But I forgot your legs aren't well, it might be hard for you to do.

54
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,479
Who wants to look at these filthy things!

55
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,539
Why are you so angry?

56
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,279
Did you remember that scandal at Liu Mansion when you saw this sheer curtain?

57
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,500
- You…
 - Sui Zhi.

58
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,980
I'm not bringing this up to disrespect you, Your Highness.

59
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,640
Liu Chang has truly gone too far.

60
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,860
The County Princess burned my beloved concubine's garden,

61
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,100
and now Deputy Liu dismantled my house under false pretense.

62
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,280
This secret room was set up behind Mu Dan's back and can't be hidden anymore.

63
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,279
Do you want to see my household in chaos and take advantage of the situation?

64
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:02,980
Your Highness, I have no such intention.

65
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,579
It's easy to say, but look at what you've done.

66
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,140
If His Highness insists on partiality, may His Majesty intercede for me.

67
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:16,539
Liu Chang went too far in this matter.

68
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:20,459
How can you be so reckless when visiting someone's mansion?

69
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,620
Brother, you mustn't be partial.

70
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,579
His Majesty is right. Today was all a misunderstanding.

71
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:33,579
My people acted rashly, and they deserve to be punished.

72
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,900
Zi Shu, hurry and apologize to Sui Zhi.

73
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,699
It was my reckless behavior and lack of consideration.

74
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:54,380
I'll punish myself to drink three cups and hope the Floral Envoy can forgive me.

75
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,520
I dare not drink your wine.

76
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:02,900
You married into Prince Ning's Mansion, but still covet my concubine.

77
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,640
If not for His Highness' sake, I would've broken your other leg long ago.

78
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:14,699
Your Highness, you used to treat me with confidence and trust.

79
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:18,200
Why did you start doubting me after Liu Chang married in?

80
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,919
Is it that I'm not sincere, or does he have ulterior motives?

81
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,580
Now that my private asset has been checked and secret room searched,

82
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,500
if there's anything else you're worried about, why not deal with it all together?

83
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,100
So I won't be worried in the future, not knowing how to place myself.

84
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,840
Sui Zhi, quickly get up. Get up.

85
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,230
What are you talking about?

86
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,699
Today's events were all done by Zi Shu on his own.

87
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:52,579
Sui Zhi, you're like family to me. How could I suspect you?

88
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:57,740
I believe that this matter wasn't ordered by my brother.

89
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,380
Since the misunderstanding is cleared, why are we still standing here?

90
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,140
Brother, let's not go home sober today.

91
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,299
Let's not. Come on, please.

92
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:11,279
Let's go, Sui Zhi. We're not leaving sober.

93
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,860
Thank you so much for today, Mu Dan.

94
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:37,010
   

95
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,000
Turns out, Mu Dan, guessed my identity.

96
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:53,900
I didn't intend to hide it. It's just a poorly kept plan harms success.

97
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,380
Your Majesty, you cherish the state&gt; and secretly aided me many times.

98
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,299
I'm deeply grateful and will certainly keep your secret.

99
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:12,559
Prince Ning has left, and the play is over. Everything is okay now.

100
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,340
When Liu Chang nearly searched the mansion before, I should've been on guard.

101
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,599
I've pretended to be a playboy for too long, thinking it was flawless.

102
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:24,959
Yet I never expected someone to come break my walls down.

103
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:30,760
I underestimated Prince Ning's suspicion, I should've prepared a backup in advance.

104
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,059
No one is a sage. How can anyone predict the enemy perfectly every time?

105
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:39,100
Just be more careful in the future.

106
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,620
The lives of countless people are tied to me.

107
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,579
If I take one wrong step, years of planning will come to nothing.

108
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:51,539
Even if I use my life as payback, it'd still be hard to atone.

109
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,860
The burden of the empire is something you carry with me.

110
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,880
You've given your utmost, so you shouldn't blame yourself.

111
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,220
This matter is due to my lack of consideration.

112
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,620
That's right, Your Majesty. Didn't we agree beforehand?

113
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,279
If we're exposed, you immediately sever ties with me.

114
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,140
Outside the secret room, you should've agreed with Prince Ning, not defend me.

115
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,139
I did promise you. But when the moment came, how could I bear it?

116
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:29,240
Precisely because we're like brothers, you should put righteousness above loyalty.

117
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,319
If such danger arises again, Your Majesty must let go of me.

118
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,980
Third Young Master, for the peaceful world we seek,

119
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,720
promise me.

120
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:07,520
Sui Zhi.

121
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,710
I promise you.

122
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,020
A kingdom's business requires good advisors and heroes to accomplish things.

123
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,620
Though a mere flower merchant, I'm driven by loyalty and righteousness.

124
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,479
In the future, if I can be of any help,
I am willing to offer my full support.

125
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,240
Mu Dan, please rise.

126
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:50,059
Mu Dan, with your righteousness, Sui Zhi is lucky to have you.

127
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,299
Meeting you is also a fortunate event for me.

128
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,620
You and I are more than just ruler and subject.

129
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,420
When acting is needed, just treat me as Third Young Master, no need for formalities.

130
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,660
Did you believe Jiang Chang Yang's slander?

131
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,900
I have no ulterior motives at all.

132
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,160
He mentioned Miss He as intentional provocation.

133
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:47,980
Whether I believe him doesn't matter. What I want are results.

134
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,000
I was incompetent, couldn't catch Jiang Chang Yang's flaws.

135
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,459
But with his nervous demeanor today, Jiang Residence must have secrets.

136
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:01,380
How could I not notice?

137
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:07,480
It's just several attempts revealed no flaws.

138
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,659
He'll surely be on guard, so be careful with future actions.

139
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:17,619
If you can't hit the mark in one strike, you mustn't rush.

140
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,319
Yes, I understand.

141
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,780
This is the whip I use for interrogating people.

142
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,040
Recently, through renovating, I learned many beautiful and cheap decoration methods.

143
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,440
With this cunning merchant assisting you, I guarantee steady profits.

144
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,140
Jiang Chang Yang, in the future, you don't need to pretend with me anymore.

145
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,279
What I do is fraught with danger.

146
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,459
You could peacefully run your small business, why get involved?

147
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,419
A petty person seeks personal gain, a gentleman seeks the country's welfare.

148
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,540
Though I'm a woman, I also have the heart to serve the country.

149
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,340
Moreover, if corrupt officials are in power, people's livelihoods will deteriorate.

150
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,319
What good days will we merchants have?

151
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,480
I do these things not only for you, but also for myself.

152
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,140
Alright, don't put on a long face.

153
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,939
Your sour look doesn't match the scenic wonderland I've set up for you.

154
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,820
I haven't even asked yet, how did you pull it off in so little time?

155
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,800
 Young Madam. 

156
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,839
 You're also one of his people. 

157
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,739
 Great, help me set this up. 

158
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:18,420
 Set what up? I've moved all suspicious items away. 

159
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,159
 Why are Jiang's people so foolish? 

160
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,979
 If Prince Ning comes and sees nothing, he'll definitely become suspicious. 

161
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:29,300
 After all, no one would bother to hide an empty house.  

162
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,400
 Got it? 

163
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,800
 - Hurry up.
 - Okay. 

164
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,859
 Wait. 

165
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,860
 What is this? 

166
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,659
 This was mistaken as a secret message, it hasn't been dealt with yet. 

167
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:48,380
 I'll take it away now. 

168
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,019
 No need. It's useful, keep it. 

169
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,919
Young Master.

170
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:56,340
Where is She Yan?

171
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,739
He was afraid of being scolded, so he flew away early.

172
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:03,239
This happened suddenly, it was normal to miscalculate.

173
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:05,580
However, today we owe it to She Yan.

174
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,559
With him flying around, he saved me a lot of effort.

175
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,620
If it were just me, I couldn't have set up all this before Liu Chang arrived.

176
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,300
She Yan asked me to thank Young Madam for him. He also prepared this.

177
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,459
Why so courteous?

178
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,960
These tolling bells have wild goose feathers on them.

179
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,259
It symbolizes growing old together.

180
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,979
She Yan said you two were about to celebrate your first anniversary.

181
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:33,060
He's afraid he won't be in Chang'an and wants to send a gift in advance.

182
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,820
You two haven't forgotten such an important event, have you?

183
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,839
No, how could we forget?

184
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,000
Time does fly.

185
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,880
I wonder how many more years I can spend with you.

186
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,219
At the New Year's Eve court session,

187
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:35,620
countries from afar sent envoys here, truly a blessing for our nation.

188
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,039
Today is the Beginning of Spring feast.

189
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:45,259
I specially invited you and your families to celebrate these glorious times!

190
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,739
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your grace.

191
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:52,039
I bow and pray for Tang dynasty's eternal prosperity.

192
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,480
 Pray for Tang dynasty's eternal prosperity. 

193
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:30,359
Wait a moment.

194
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:50,340
His Majesty granted Nanzhao bamboo rice tribute to all on New Year's Eve.

195
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,739
Does Vice Minister Jiang think merchants don't deserve such noble items?

196
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:57,800
You didn't send one for Young Madam to try?

197
00:24:58,428 --> 00:25:01,100
The festive season Floral Haven's busiest time.

198
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,380
I have countless accounts to check.

199
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,100
How can I care about meals?

200
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,960
Your stench of money is intolerable.

201
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,419
No matter how heavy the stench of money is, it's others who endure it.

202
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:18,219
Once the courtyard gate is closed, living comfortably is most important.

203
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:20,119
Don't you agree?

204
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:26,939
Vice Minister Jiang.

205
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:32,400
My wife's hands have always been for gardening and doing what she likes.

206
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,259
These miscellaneous tasks have always been my responsibility.

207
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:43,000
You make money every day and can buy whatever you want.

208
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,960
But you mustn't neglect your husband, either.

209
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:52,359
After the festival, how about we go to stay
for a few days at Mount Li?

210
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,780
Your Majesty, the swordsmanship of the noble warriors is unparalleled.

211
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,739
My younger daughter Ashina Dan has always wanted to seek instruction.

212
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:48,919
I wonder if Your Majesty would consent.

213
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,959
Please.

214
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
Great!

215
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:33,239
- Impressive. 
 - Good! Good!

216
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,900
Well done.

217
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,060
- Impressive.
- Nice.

218
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,320
Nice.

219
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,119
Everyone says Princess Ashina Dan is the steppe's Heavenly Maiden Flower.

220
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:58,140
Now that I've seen it, she's indeed bright and imposing, rivaling any man.

221
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,660
Your Majesty, if the Heavenly Maiden Flower

222
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:06,060
is paired with a true dragon, what a good match that would be.

223
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,960
Royal Father.

224
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,540
The Princess truly has great skills.

225
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:19,680
But a bit embarrassing for noble warriors to be outmatched by a woman.

226
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,019
Our country is one of etiquette where guests are honored.

227
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:30,459
During a contest, one should naturally afford courtesy.

228
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,659
The envoy spoke inappropriately.

229
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,179
Better take a few volumes of the Nine Classics back to study

230
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:40,739
to avoid improper manners.

231
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:50,799
The Princess is radiant and captivating.

232
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,380
The warriors, eager for beauty, naturally show mercy.

233
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,620
Princess, would you like to spar with me?

234
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,420
Sure.

235
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:05,919
- Impressive.
 - Juebei Princess hit the target!

236
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,279
Consort Shu hit the target!

237
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:16,860
The spear and sword skills are evenly matched, even archery skills are too.

238
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,979
When will we see a result?

239
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:20,400
Indeed.

240
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,979
After Consort Shu gave birth to the prince, it's said she's taking medicine.

241
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:29,979
Continued competition like this may exhaust her strength.

242
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:35,779
If we lose, it'll be the royal family's dignity.

243
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,939
Consort Shu hit the target. Juebei Princess hit the target.

244
00:29:57,939 --> 00:29:59,640
Again!

245
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,739
Your Majesty.

246
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:05,639
Shooting the target is boring. Let's change to shooting plum blossoms.

247
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:09,680
The buds are small, swaying in the wind and difficult to hit.

248
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,620
It can determine the winner and add elegance.

249
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:19,079
Consort Shu, Princess, what do you say?

250
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,219
Consort Shu wins.

251
00:30:58,219 --> 00:31:00,599
- Well done!
 - Nice.

252
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,399
Great.

253
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:07,860
Consort Shu is a remarkable warrior, and the Princess unmatched in elegance.

254
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,499
This contest was truly a delight to watch.

255
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:13,199
Indeed.

256
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:18,259
Consort Shu, your skills are superior. I'm sincerely convinced.

257
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:21,499
I'm truly delighted to make friends through martial arts.

258
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:24,580
Our dynasty has a tradition of giving plants to friends as a gesture.

259
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,319
Princess, you've come from afar. This plum branch shall be my gift to you.

260
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:31,219
Thank you, Consort Shu.

261
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,419
The plum blossom buds are sparse and small, which is rather shabby.

262
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:45,140
I heard this country is known for peonies of unparalleled beauty.

263
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,739
But today, we don't get to see them.

264
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:53,960
Do you look down upon our frontier lands and intentionally hide them?

265
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:58,639
Envoy, your words are incorrect.

266
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,979
The way of Heaven is constant, and it doesn't flourish or perish for anyone.

267
00:32:03,979 --> 00:32:08,340
Now isn't the blooming season for peonies. No one is hiding anything.

268
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,580
It seems the prosperity of the great nation is merely a facade.

269
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,340
Once winter arrives, the scenery loses its charm.

270
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:19,739
Unlike Nanzhao, where it's spring year round, thriving and prosperous.

271
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:25,380
Even with spring year round, can it prevent flowers from withering?

272
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:31,939
Nanzhao merely follows the natural seasons, why be so arrogant?

273
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:36,580
Porcelain, tea, cotton, and silk,

274
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,760
when you no longer purchase these from Tang,

275
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,499
then you may boast.

276
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:47,620
It's said that His Majesty is the Son of Heaven.

277
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:55,240
If so, can he defy the timing of Heaven and make peonies bloom in the snow?

278
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,820
The Son of Heaven pacifies states internally and secures peace externally.

279
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:22,960
Cultivating flowers a waste of his talent. This, my wife could easily do.

280
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:31,979
I've heard that women of the great nation are only indoors, commanding servants.

281
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:34,699
You wife can grow flowers?

282
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,580
My wife not only can grow flowers,

283
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,419
but she's also the renowned owner Floral Haven, He Wei Fang.

284
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:02,080
The famous Sleeve Lingering, Jade Terrace,

285
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,060
and Fire Gold Peony were all developed by her.

286
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:14,300
Your Majesty.

287
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,499
In Juebei, winter is long and warm days short.

288
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:20,340
Snow covers the ground all year, we've never seen flowers in the snow.

289
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,900
If the great nation can cultivate peonies in the snow,

290
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,660
it would be a great spectacle for us to behold.

291
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,780
I shall not fail my mission.

292
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:40,260
In eight days, I'll present snow peonies to showcase the great nation's elegance.

293
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,979
Enjoying flowers further demonstrates our dynasty's friendly relations with others.

294
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:53,140
When the peonies bloom in the snow. I'll invite everyone to visit the imperial garden.

295
00:35:11,164 --> 00:35:17,139
♫  The Luo River cleanses the ridges of the moonlight  ♫

296
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:18,840
Shopkeeper, have some water.

297
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,099
- Thank you. Give it to Da Fu and the others. 
 - Okay.

298
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:28,951
♫  A beauty refuses the temptation of the mortal world  ♫

299
00:35:28,951 --> 00:35:36,564
♫  Youthful splendor charts its own wandering course  ♫

300
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:41,139
♫  Do not let the mundane world bind you,  ♫

301
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,207
♫  nor shallow, presumptive gazes question you  ♫

302
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:50,903
♫  Laugh as storms overturn the dust  ♫

303
00:35:50,903 --> 00:35:56,654
♫  A blooming flower with proud spirit reflects the color of the sky  ♫

304
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,555
♫  And never withering  ♫

305
00:35:58,555 --> 00:36:05,483
♫  Don’t let time tarnish the beauty of the fragrance  ♫

306
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:09,900
Quickly, close the door. Don't let the heat escape.

307
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,260
Why are you delivering the food today? Where's Da Fu?

308
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,619
Da Fu and Chuan Yu are having a snowball fight.

309
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:21,760
Come and eat. Cold food hurts your stomach.

310
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,400
It's so good.

311
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:58,119
What's this?

312
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,419
Today is the Shunxing Festival.

313
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,619
I planned to go to Kaiyuan Temple today to light a candle for my mother.

314
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:10,919
But I was so busy that I forgot.

315
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:16,660
Your fake husband went for you and even filled up the fragrant oil.

316
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,619
These flower lanterns were brought from the temple.

317
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:23,220
According to custom, nine lanterns should be lit in succession.

318
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,999
This way, the immortals will bless your new year with happiness and success.

319
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,760
Here.

320
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,280
We're grasshoppers tied to the same rope.

321
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,220
If you have bad luck, I naturally won't fare well either.

322
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:01,579
So, half of these blessing lanterns should go to you.

323
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,419
Jiang Chang Yang, you brought me a midnight snack.

324
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:26,900
You visited my mother and even helped me light the candles.

325
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:33,280
You've done so much for me.

326
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,760
You said it yourself. We're allies.

327
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,780
You're busy here because of His Majesty.

328
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:54,519
I'm not good at growing flowers, but I can handle other things, right?

329
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:03,580
The promised time is approaching.

330
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,760
Will these peonies really bloom on time?

331
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,939
Of course.

332
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,039
They can't speak. How do you know?

333
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,820
I can predict their blooming time by feeling the softness of the buds.

334
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,720
Really?

335
00:39:22,419 --> 00:39:23,700
Look.

336
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:30,760
If this bud is as hard as your knuckles, then it'll take another month.

337
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,539
When it gets as soft as your fingertips, there's about five days left.

338
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,560
When it gets as soft as the side of your palm…

339
00:39:47,979 --> 00:39:49,779
Jiang Chang Yang.

340
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,319
Why are your cheeks so red?

341
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:00,600
The greenhouse is too hot. I'm going out for some air.

342
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,400
Wait a moment.

343
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,800
It's cold outside. Put something on.

344
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:19,300
Be careful not to catch a cold.

345
00:40:50,080 --> 00:41:00,010


346
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,200
 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining 

347
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:15,281
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

348
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:23,795
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

349
00:41:23,795 --> 00:41:31,887
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

350
00:41:31,887 --> 00:41:40,139
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫ 

351
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:48,436
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

352
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:56,623
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

353
00:41:56,623 --> 00:42:05,039
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

354
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:13,039
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

355
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:41,191
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫ 

356
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:48,642
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

357
00:42:48,642 --> 00:42:56,728
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫ 

358
00:42:56,728 --> 00:43:04,937
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫ 

359
00:43:04,937 --> 00:43:13,299
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

360
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:21,455
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

361
00:43:21,455 --> 00:43:29,883
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

362
00:43:29,883 --> 00:43:38,083
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
