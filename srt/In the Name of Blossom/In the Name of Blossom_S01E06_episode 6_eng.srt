1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,980


2
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:36,890
   

3
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,940
   

4
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,040
Miss He, quick, get out.

5
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,039
Miss He, you go first!

6
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,339
- Madam Tang, quick.
 - You go first.

7
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:03,700
- You go first, quickly.
 - Go.

8
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:09,539
Quick, go call someone, quick!

9
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,679
- Miss He, be careful.
 - Quick, someone come over!

10
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:14,439
There's a fire, quick, someone come over!

11
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,800
Someone come!

12
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,860
 Open the door! 

13
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,900
 Is anyone there? 

14
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,619
I'll say it one last time.

15
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:39,520
Move aside.

16
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,939
 Quick, someone come! 

17
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:44,099
Unless I'm dead.

18
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,540
Make them open the door, open it!

19
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,439
 Quick, someone come! Is there anyone to help? 

20
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:17,140
 Is there anyone? Come on! 

21
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,719
 Quick, someone come! 

22
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,180
A'Xiang!

23
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,339
Mu Dan, quick, run!

24
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:31,139
Quick!

25
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,599
Xiao Chun. Gui'ze.

26
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,260
- Run!
 - Hurry up!

27
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,379
Xiao Chun, I'll leave the injured people to you.

28
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,620
- Okay.
 - Quick.

29
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,219
I'll catch you.

30
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:55,600
- Shopkeeper.
 - A'Man, come.

31
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,399
Go quickly.

32
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:03,619
Go quickly.

33
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:06,819
Is there anyone else to help?

34
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,519
Young Master Liu, hurry.

35
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,940
Quick, water, more water.

36
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,840
Coming!

37
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,960
Quickly, go.

38
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,660
Coming.

39
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,119
Fetch water. Quick, wet yourself.

40
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,820
Bear with it.

41
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,020
Xiao Chun, where's Mu Dan?

42
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,120
- Mu Dan is still inside rescuing people. 
 - Zuixiang Tower collapsed!

43
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,439
People are trapped underneath. Quickly, follow me to save them!

44
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,460
Chuan Yu, Da Fu, go rescue people quickly.

45
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,460
- Yes. 
 - The oil's catching fire!

46
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,899
A'Tao!

47
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,220
Mu Dan!

48
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,200
Mu Dan!

49
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:48,219
Jiang Chang Yang!

50
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,520
Mu Dan!

51
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,239
Third Young Master.

52
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,579
Third Young Master, wake up.

53
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,300
Sui Zhi.

54
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,980
My sister.

55
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:39,500
Don't worry about me. You all should go.

56
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,480
We came together. We must leave together.

57
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,879
Sui Zhi, listen to me.

58
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,160
This fire is strange. It probably started because of the Crown Prince.

59
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,339
You're his study companion. You must ensure his safety.

60
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,659
Listen to me, get the Crown Prince out first, then come back to save me.

61
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,040
I'll wait here for you.

62
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,779
Wait for me.

63
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,420
Third Young Master.

64
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,960
Sister!

65
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,600
Jiang Chang Yang.

66
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,739
Jiang Chang Yang.

67
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:17,119
Wake up, Jiang Chang Yang.

68
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,480
Don't worry, I'm here. The fire won't reach you.

69
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,380
We'll get out together.

70
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:26,899
Come on,

71
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,700
A'Tao!

72
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,459
Everyone together.

73
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,199
Come, quickly, everyone together.

74
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,119
- Apply this medicine to her in a moment.
- Xiao Chun!

75
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,299
A'Tao.

76
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:03,600
Mu Dan.

77
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
- Are you okay?
 - Here, give it to me.

78
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,280
- Come on.
- A'Tao, wake up.

79
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,120
- Madam, how are you?
 - I'm fine.

80
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,839
How are the other places doing?

81
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,559
Zuixiang Tower burned the most seriously, as well as the greenhouse for cultivating peonies.

82
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,760
Da Fu, water.

83
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,299
Mu Dan, you just saved people and now you want the flowers?

84
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:23,100
No, Floral Haven relies on that room full of peonies this winter.

85
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,260
No matter how precious the peonies are, they're not more important than your life!

86
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,579
It's okay, Jiang Chang Yang, let me go.

87
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:30,939
Let me go, I'm fine on my own.

88
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:34,200
- Mu Dan.
 - Mu Dan.

89
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,460
- Shopkeeper.
 - Mu Dan.

90
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,839
Mu Dan, you're awake. How are you?

91
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,960
Is your head still dizzy? Is there any discomfort in your body?

92
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:05,179
Xiao Chun, how is everyone?

93
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,879
They're fine.

94
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,659
What about Fragrance Garden? How is it?

95
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:17,419
You're still injured.

96
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:21,740
Help me, help me down.

97
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,240
You want…

98
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,020
How could this happen?

99
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,000
How could this happen?

100
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,980
The Jingzhao Prefecture is already investigating. They'll surely give us an explanation.

101
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm not confident with their investigation. We must investigate ourselves.

102
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:58,839
The greenhouse.

103
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,020
Let's go, Xiao Chun. Quickly, check the greenhouse.

104
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,000
- Alright. 
 - Mu Dan!

105
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,699
Mu Dan, quick, look!

106
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,320
Wasn't the greenhouse destroyed? How are these flowers…?

107
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,059
That night, Fragrance Garden was in chaos.

108
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,659
Everyone was rescuing the injured and trapped. They had no time for the flowers.

109
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:24,839
But there was one person who was as anxious as you were.

110
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,359
 Mu Dan! 

111
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:31,199
 - Shopkeeper. 
 - Mu Dan. 

112
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,340
 Xiao Chun, help me take care of Mu Dan. 

113
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,840
 Alright. 

114
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:40,215
♫  If the heart were like frost, what's a lifetime of solitude?  ♫

115
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:50,097
♫  Yet you are the light, piercing through my heart  ♫

116
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:56,903
♫  If love were like frost, there would be a candle flickering in the wind  ♫

117
00:11:56,903 --> 00:12:01,656
♫  Never saying a word, but always moving towards you  ♫

118
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:03,279
There are also flowers with severe burns.

119
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,660
Master Jiang hired a floriculturist to protect the roots in time. They were just brought back.

120
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,960
Who was it before who scolded others about wanting flowers more than life?

121
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,079
Are you alright?

122
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:52,079
You saved the capital for Fragrance Garden to rise again. Thank you.

123
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,579
It's…

124
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,959
MasterJiang returned to the fire many times. The smoke hurt his throat and lungs.

125
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,000
So it's better to speak less and take care of your throat.

126
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,539
You were most afraid of fire, but you risked your life to save these flowers.

127
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,620
I owe you such a big favor. How can I repay you?

128
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:24,500
Master Jiang means that, indeed, he's afraid of fire.

129
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,299
But he's more afraid of his beloved wife perishing in the fire,

130
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,059
afraid you would be heartbroken as your hard work was destroyed.

131
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,939
This isn't an ordinary favor, this is…

132
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,080
Quickly, go.

133
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,680
Let's go.

134
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:49,760
Got it, you need to put on an act in front of them.

135
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,440
Firework signal?

136
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,500
You mean when there's danger next time,

137
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,559
when the signal goes up, you'll come when you see it.

138
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,120
Don't be sad.

139
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:51,779
Don't be sad, at worst we'll start over.

140
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,440
I'll be with you.

141
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,979
I'll take it seriously then.

142
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,880
Done smashing? I can leave now?

143
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,419
Are you in a hurry to see He Wei Fang? She's not dead. Are you satisfied?

144
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,160
What's the use of smashing those things? Why not just set me on fire as well?

145
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,699
Just like Wu Ping Zhi.

146
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:02,399
Wouldn't it be more satisfying to find a new husband?

147
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:07,020
You know?

148
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,640
So you think I'm vicious and ruthless, and avoid me like the plague, right?

149
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:25,740
My last marriage was like a cage or a prison.

150
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,260
I couldn't break free, so I destroyed that cage!

151
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:37,399
That's why I cherish and love you so much.

152
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,240
I can't bear your love and affection!

153
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,539
Why must it be me?!

154
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:46,920
Only by loving you can I feel free.

155
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,120
All I seek for the rest of my life is you.

156
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,579
But I have to watch you thinking of He Wei Fang and missing He Wei Fang!

157
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,100
What else can I do besides kill her?!

158
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:03,500
What else can I do? What?

159
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,879
Li You Zhen, why do you still not understand?

160
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:19,399
Even without He Wei Fang, I no longer have feelings for you.

161
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:31,159
But if you kill her, you're forcing me to hate you for a lifetime.

162
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,900
I don't understand. Didn't you say we'd pledge our hearts to each other, swearing never to part?

163
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,359
Why can't you keep me in your heart and try again?

164
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:47,780
When we pledged our hearts to each other, we already missed the chance.

165
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,340
Since then,

166
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,780
we've been forcing ourselves and acting out of necessity.

167
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:06,540
If we continue to torment each other, we'll just grow old together in resentment.

168
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,760
Why bother?

169
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,300
Then let us be a resentful couple growing old together.

170
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,419
I'll torment He Wei Fang, and you torment me.

171
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:21,680
I'm telling you, I'd rather live like this for a lifetime. I won't let go.

172
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,340
I can try to be nicer to you,

173
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,520
to make you feel less jealous and less pain.

174
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,280
But I have one condition, do not hurt her anymore.

175
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,259
Do you feel sorry for her or pity me?

176
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,580
Think it through.

177
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:27,019
I promise you.

178
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,290
Don't stay at Taoguang Courtyard anymore.

179
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,480
Come home, okay?

180
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:34,259
Young Master Liu, it's time to eat!

181
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:41,439
Alright, let's eat first, come on.

182
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:44,439
- Be careful. 
 - Nowadays, everything needs money to fix.

183
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:47,100
After repairing the courtyard, there's no money for the house.

184
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,119
The furniture is quite damaged and we need new ones.

185
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,380
Madam, why don't we repair the courtyard first?

186
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,219
Let's wait until spring to open Zuixiang Tower and hold a few spring banquets.

187
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:00,780
What do you think?

188
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,219
Mu Dan, you're thoughtful. Let's proceed as you suggested.

189
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,179
Why is it so plain again?

190
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:14,939
I'm craving flavor and want roasted mutton.

191
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,040
You want to drink too, don't you?

192
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,900
Xiao Chun said you have quite a few burn wounds on your body.

193
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,540
It's hot right now. If boils develop, it'll be difficult to handle.

194
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,740
Before scabbing, fishy-tasting foods and mutton that incites inner heat, and what else?

195
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,179
- Liquor.
 - Yes, they mustn't enter the mouth.

196
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:37,879
I'm really useless. I couldn't save you.

197
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,620
I can't even protect myself.

198
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,060
The garden is short of manpower now, yet I can only rest here.

199
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,739
I still have to trouble Madam Sun to bring us food.

200
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,580
It's nothing.

201
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,499
You used to do the cooking. Now let me try my hand.

202
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:55,180
- Exactly, Young Master Liu. Don't blame yourself. 
 - Try this.

203
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,100
Your cooking skills are really getting better and better.

204
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,380
Of course, I added some crushed lotus leaves to the soup.

205
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,780
It moistens the lungs and generates fluids, perfect for patients.

206
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,040
You two should drink more bowls.

207
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,780
Master Jiang's throat endured smoke, it fits the symptoms perfectly.

208
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,900
How about we send him two bowls later?

209
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,800
Sure.

210
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,439
- Young Madam. 
 - Chuan Yu.

211
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,739
His Majesty learned Master Jiang was injured and granted a lotus seed and turtle soup.

212
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:30,459
He thought of your injury, and asked me to bring a bowl over.

213
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,040
How can we let down Young Master's intentions?

214
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,839
I haven't tasted this soup since I made it. What's the flavor?

215
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,300
Come on, give it to me. I'll drink it.

216
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,179
How can that be? We can't let down your intentions even more.

217
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,079
I'll drink both bowls.

218
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,780
How is his injury? Is it better?

219
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,019
He can speak now.

220
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:54,140
He's thinking about your roasted meat and fine wine, saying it multiple times a day.

221
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,480
His Majesty assigned a physician, worried he'll break the diet and won't recover well.

222
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,799
Right, the grill in the pavilion and those jars of Peach Blossom wine,

223
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,660
I must take them away. Otherwise, if these two secretly meet at night,

224
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,200
- who knows when the illness will be cured? 
 - Da Fu, eat first.

225
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,779
I'll help you.

226
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,859
Let's eat.

227
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:31,680
Young Master, the fiercest burned spots have traces of kerosene being poured.

228
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,580
It seems as you guessed.

229
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,000
Those people hid the kerosene in the wooden meal delivery boxes.

230
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,159
With such a large amount, they probably couldn't wait to burn Young Madam to ashes.

231
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,960
These burn marks are very unique.

232
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,499
Especially these cracks, only combustion explosions cause them.

233
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,300
This kerosene must have a significant origin. Continue investigating.

234
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,800
Yes, Sir.

235
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,800
Timber, ten strings.

236
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:19,540
In the old days, we used to roast meat and drink here together.

237
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,860
I wonder what he's doing right now.

238
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,300
He's more seriously injured, he's likely taken medicine and is resting now.

239
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:43,259
Forget it.

240
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:48,659
- Six, five. 
 - Seven.

241
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,759
Alright, you lost.

242
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,879
- Again. 
 - Come on.

243
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:58,160
- Seven. 
 - Six.

244
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,900
This is strong enough.

245
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,790
Hu cakes!

246
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,580
- You didn't call me to get food. 
 - I thought you were asleep.

247
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,100
What would you two like to order?

248
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,140
Our meat is plentiful and satisfying, both tender and delicious.

249
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,040
Please have a seat.

250
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,880
Let me turn your meat for you.

251
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,499
The meat needs frequent turning to be delicious. I'll do it for you.

252
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:29,440
I think this meat smells quite good. How about we…?

253
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:36,680
This meat is perfectly cooked, fatty but not greasy.

254
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,979
Be sure to eat a few more pieces.

255
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:42,939
This wine is mellow and fragrant, with a long-lasting aftertaste.

256
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:44,979
Let me drink this cup to the fullest.

257
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:04,499
Luckily, we ran into each other. Otherwise, we wouldn't have resisted.

258
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,580
Having someone to share the longing makes it bearable.

259
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:15,779
Indeed, today's restraint is for better days of eating meat and drinking wine in the future.

260
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,800
The smell of the roasted meat was just too strong.

261
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,300
If I go back now, Da Fu will definitely think I went to sneak a bite.

262
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,060
I'll fan you to get rid of the smell.

263
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
Then fan more.

264
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:58,100
Jiang Chang Yang, most people love a full moon.

265
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,459
But I find the crescent moon more captivating than the full moon, do you know why?

266
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:05,059
Why?

267
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,140
Because the crescent moon is curved and bright, it looks much like something.

268
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:13,019
What does it look like?

269
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,739
It looks like the eyes of someone who loves to laugh.

270
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,900
Turn around, I'll fan you from behind.

271
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,879
Don't hit me.

272
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,060
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

273
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,680
Is this going to work or not?

274
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,900
You'll know once you try it.

275
00:28:48,316 --> 00:28:49,880
   

276
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,380
Sachet, come and take a look!

277
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:02,960
Twenty pots of roses for this jade ornament.

278
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,240
Sir, this would make us lose too much.

279
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,300
Usually, we sell these flowers, one pot for one string in the shop.

280
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,760
How about you throw in a set of white jade cups for us?

281
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,839
Well…

282
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:20,620
If it's too difficult, just forget it.

283
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,320
Alright. I'll wrap it up for you.

284
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,040
Thanks for your effort.

285
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,620
This saves quite a bit of expenses.

286
00:29:35,699 --> 00:29:39,400
Da Fu, give this to me, right.

287
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,839
Floral and avian against aquatic and insect life, this two look like a pair.

288
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,359
Is it for... Young Master Jiang?

289
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,340
- What do you think?
 - It's good.

290
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,919
The gifts the Floral Envoy usually receives are all translucent and flawless jade.

291
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,699
He probably wouldn't think much of ordinary white jade.

292
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:08,499
They say love for a house extends to all within, he wouldn't care if it's translucent.

293
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:11,140
What matters is the intention.

294
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:13,599
You're right.

295
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:18,879
But usually, I've never given him any proper items.

296
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:22,720
Would suddenly giving this be a bit odd?

297
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Why? You're always decisive in business matters.

298
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,219
Going back and forth today, hesitating, that's what's strange.

299
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:34,720
Master Jiang saved people and flowers and he's your husband.

300
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,659
Giving a hairpin is very appropriate.

301
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,860
But in a bit, I have to go see the carpenter repairing the garden.

302
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:51,040
Da Fu, help me give this hairpin to him.

303
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,740
Okay.

304
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,300
Master Jiang would be delighted upon receiving this, right?

305
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,040
Sister Da Fu!

306
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,680
Madam Sun accidentally sprained her ankle. You should go look.

307
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,939
Sprained her ankle? Is it serious? Did they invite a physician?

308
00:31:06,939 --> 00:31:10,879
Xiao Chun has already seen her, but I'm not quite sure what the specific injury is.

309
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:13,240
Sister Da Fu, go on. I'll deliver the hairpin for you.

310
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,860
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

311
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,900
By the way, Young Master Liu, when you deliver it,make sure to tell him,

312
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,150
that Mu Dan selected this carefully. Don't let her down.

313
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,580
Rest assured, I'll definitely convey it.

314
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,419
- Thank you. Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

315
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:25,919
Over here.

316
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,620
With Mu Dan's stingy nature, she's giving me something?

317
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,560
Mu Dan is grateful for your kindness in saving the flowers. This is a thank you gift.

318
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:58,140
There are some words she can't say plainly, so she has to express it through objects.

319
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,660
Your thoughts are clear, so you'll surely understand.

320
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:09,719
I understand.

321
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:42,499
 A hairpin is an object signifying commitment. Breaking it signifies ending it. 

322
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:48,919
 Did she sense my affection and intends to remind me to end this thought? 

323
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,100
The government hasn't found the arsonist yet.

324
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,739
They even shirk responsibility, saying it was our own carelessness that caused the fire.

325
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:04,419
We can all see those black oil stains left on the ruins.

326
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:07,900
Are Official Ren's eyes blind?

327
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:13,384
We definitely can't rely on the government and can only suffer silently for now.

328
00:33:14,464 --> 00:33:20,079
Madam, take the old putty you scraped off earlier and ask the oil merchant we know.

329
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,499
We must find out where this oil came from.

330
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:25,099
Alright.

331
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:40,019
Most of the flowers Master Jiang saved are still growing well.

332
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:44,860
Only these haven't encountered the big fire. I'll find someone to handle them.

333
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,019
Madam, come. Gardener Hu, come quickly.

334
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,419
Look, it's sprouting.

335
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:07,019
- That's amazing. 
 - It truly is.

336
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:10,380
The soil of this flower is completely burned, and the branches look withered.

337
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,419
I thought it was dead.

338
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:17,439
I tried so many times before to cultivate this new species, but couldn't keep it alive.

339
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:21,539
I didn't expect that after such a burning by fire, the moisture would dissipate,

340
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:25,879
and the spring fertilizer would mature. Now it suited the nature of this flower.

341
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,120
Withered branches, charred bones, and crimson petals.

342
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,339
How about calling it Burnt Bone Red Jade?

343
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:39,079
- Good. Sounds nice. 
 - Good. A good name.

344
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:44,839
Our Fragrance Garden is truly blessed. Surviving a great disaster and being reborn.

345
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:46,739
That's great.

346
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,019
Would you like to add some more tea?

347
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:50,920
No, thanks.

348
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,720
- Mu Dan. 
 - Xue Xi.

349
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,739
I was just about to ask for your help, and you've come.

350
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,579
Come on, sit down quickly.

351
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:08,359
How has your recovery been?

352
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,519
I'm pretty much recovered. What do you need, Xue Xi?

353
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,900
My birthday is approaching, and I want to celebrate it in the residence.

354
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,419
Could I ask you to organize a banquet for me?

355
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:23,839
Fragrance Garden caught fire, and needs funds and resources for repairs.

356
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,959
Fortunately, we've a generous client like her to take care of business, it's a double win.

357
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:32,919
Thank you for your kindness, Xue Xi. I'll certainly do my best.

358
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,099
What is this flower that you brought? Is it dead?

359
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:43,099
It's not dead. You saved this flower.

360
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,459
New sprouts have grown from the scorched earth.

361
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:51,560
I named it Burnt Bone Red Jade, it can bloom in the coming year.

362
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,579
The flowers will proudly stand on the branches, as crimson as the sun.

363
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,359
If I'm still here next spring, I'll be able to see this scene.

364
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:13,000
I came this time to thank you again.

365
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,380
Also, did you receive my gift?

366
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,280
It's not that I didn't hesitate. I thought for a long time before finally choosing it.

367
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,539
Do you... understand?

368
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,920
Of course, I understand.

369
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,779
There's been a lot of work from His Majesty. I'm afraid I'll only be back after curfew.

370
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:59,300
With the busy repairs at the Fragrance Garden, you don't need to worry about me.

371
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:05,200
Let's manage our own matters. If we can sometimes drink together, that'll be nice.

372
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,780
Okay.

373
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:29,680
Mu Dan, I already know that your marriage is fake,

374
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,600
so there's no need to put on an act with me.

375
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:38,380
I don't want you two to feel uncomfortable because of me.

376
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,780
Xue Xi's keen perception caught on, so I didn't hide it any longer.

377
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,839
I trust her character.

378
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:54,959
Rest assured, I'll keep your secret safe.

379
00:37:57,019 --> 00:37:58,819
Thank you, Xue Xi.

380
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:04,660
So what kind of mystery are you two playing at?

381
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,479
If you have something to say, just say it directly to Sui Zhi.

382
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,200
What I wanted to say has already been made clear.

383
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,779
Master Jiang is wise and will surely understand what I mean.

384
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,012
I've got things to do in my garden. You two chat, I'll head back now.

385
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:31,200
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫ 

386
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:35,807
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫ 

387
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:40,135
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫ 

388
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:44,024
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫ 

389
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:49,164
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫ 

390
00:38:55,039 --> 00:39:00,380
I went to inquire. Master Jiang is wearing an old hairpin given Lady Xiao gave him.

391
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,740
He wore it for a long time and hasn't had the chance to replace it.

392
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,760
Don't overthink it. Let him change it when he comes back.

393
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,120
Come on, have some water.

394
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,320
 I misunderstood. I shouldn't have rashly given him the hairpin. 

395
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,700
Miss Xiao is an outsider, after all.

396
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,300
Have the banquet here is one thing, but Master Jiang asked you to organize it too.

397
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,619
How could they?

398
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:39,860
It's not him, it's Xue Xi.

399
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,820
Xue Xi did it to support our business.

400
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,660
For a single banquet, she gave us 500 strings.

401
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:51,059
This money is enough to renovate all of Fragrance Garden.

402
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:54,879
We must put our heart into it and not let down their goodwill.

403
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:03,640
Da Fu, you can't paste it like this.

404
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:09,080
You need to paste each piece of flower neatly, so it looks like a carpet.

405
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,700
Look, don't leave too many gaps.

406
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,459
These crape myrtle flowers were expensively shipped from Jiangnan.

407
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:22,019
They could live a few days more in a vase. It's a pity to cover the ground with them.

408
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,120
Are all nobles this extravagant?

409
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,499
You can't say that.

410
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:28,560
Since we've taken their money and accepted the order,

411
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,340
we should do it well according to their requirements.

412
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,539
How can we complain about the client just because of our own reluctance?

413
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:38,439
Sister, take a break. I brought some tea over.

414
00:40:39,419 --> 00:40:41,959
- Come on, let's take a break. 
 - Alright.

415
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,499
Do you want to have some water?

416
00:40:46,499 --> 00:40:49,300
- Thank you, Shopkeeper, it's not necessary. 
 - Thank you for your hard work.

417
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,840
Let's go.

418
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,760
Thank you, Young Master Liu.

419
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,019
I found out from A'Hui, no wonder so many flowers are needed.

420
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:10,680
This setup is because Miss Xiao wants to confess her feelings to Master Jiang.

421
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:17,939
She may express it herself, but Master Jiang might not accept it.

422
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:23,380
Excuse me, is that the dilapidated house beside the garden?

423
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:27,099
What dilapidated house? That's our residence.

424
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:28,699
What's the matter?

425
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:36,800
Are you both from the Imperial Workshop? Is Jiang Residence going to be renovated?

426
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,600
Indeed, Miss Xiao likes pavilions and towers.

427
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,579
The Royal Princess sent us to inspect here.

428
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:44,440
She said to demolish two dilapidated houses by the garden, dig a channel for water,

429
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,800
and build a water pavilion for Miss Xiao to enjoy.

430
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:58,940


431
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,774
