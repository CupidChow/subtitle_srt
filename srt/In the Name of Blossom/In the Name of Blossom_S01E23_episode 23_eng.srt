1
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:40,000
 

2
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Release arrows.

3
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,399
Defensive formation!

4
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,960
Charge!

5
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,000
Attack!

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,519
Archers, loose!

7
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,559
Reload and fire!

8
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:56,800
Form the formation!

9
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,519
Cavalry, charge!

10
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,759
Your Highness.

11
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:43,839
It seems Yu Zheng
has truly inherited Yu Chang's legacy.

12
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:49,400
50,000 soldiers held out this long.

13
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,439
Add fire oil!

14
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,199
Charge!

15
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,920
They deployed hundreds of crossbowmen
in the beginning.

16
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,560
The Central Army's fire oil consumption
is faster than I thought.

17
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,560
At this rate, Prince Ning's fifty barrels
of fire oil will be depleted by nightfall.

18
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,399
The battlefield aligns perfectly
with your predictions.

19
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,960
We'll raid their rear under the cover
of darkness for a surprise attack.

20
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,480
My lady.

21
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:01,800
 

22
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,199
The Central Army's flaming arrows
came faster than anticipated.

23
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,600
Mr. Jiang will lead the raid tonight.

24
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,519
Success hinges on this moment.

25
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:17,879
Reports say Prince Ning's flaming arrows
ravaged the Hedong Army.

26
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,959
Did Mr. Jiang foresee our disadvantage?

27
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,119
Hence, the planned night strike
against Prince Ning.

28
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,680
This raid must proceed
regardless of battlefield developments.

29
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,600
Firstly, capture the leader to cripple the foe.

30
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,519
If Jiang Chang Yang can infiltrate
and capture Prince Ning,

31
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,680
the war could end swiftly,

32
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,239
sparing countless soldiers' lives.

33
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,399
And secondly, the Central Army's camp
between Twin Peaks gives escape routes.

34
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,279
Even if the Hedong Army wins this battle,

35
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,399
Prince Ning could retreat
through the mountain passes.

36
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,680
That terrain favors defense over assault.

37
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,639
He's prepared an exit strategy.

38
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,120
Should he reach Chang'an and twist the narrative,

39
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,319
endless troubles would follow.

40
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,839
Our troops lie concealed at...

41
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,920
Report. Mr. Jiang.

42
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,319
The Central Army halted the flaming arrows,
and crossbowmen were withdrawn.

43
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,319
What of their commanders?

44
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,879
The imperial general and two military governors
are still leading the assaults.

45
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,960
But Prince Ning retreated
to the rear under escort.

46
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,240
Perfect timing.

47
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,720
He quit the field before nightfall.

48
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,559
Seems like he is overconfident of victory.

49
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,560
Prepare arms! Bring my warhorse!

50
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,360
Yes.

51
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Hide hooves.

52
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,040
Yes, hide hooves.

53
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,600
- Yes, hide hooves.
- Yes.

54
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
Report. General.

55
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,199
What happened?

56
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,160
When our light cavalry approached Prince Ning's
main camp, they encountered a crossbowmen ambush.

57
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,920
Fire oil ignited simultaneously,
and flaming arrows rained down,

58
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,079
all targeting the light cavalry squad.

59
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,160
Mr. Jiang reacted promptly, leading the vanguard
to raise shields and deflect arrows with sabers.

60
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,519
However, many soldiers' clothing
caught fire and horses fell.

61
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,040
Only a dozen men remain in the squad.

62
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,399
Did they retreat according to plan?

63
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,800
Yes. During the retreat, Mr. Jiang
shot three consecutive arrows at Prince Ning.

64
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,920
Unexpectedly, Prince Ning used a soldier
as a shield to block the first two arrows.

65
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,320
The final arrow hit Prince Ning's shoulder.

66
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,440
How severe is Prince Ning's injury?

67
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,279
Seeing him retreat to the main camp,
I rushed back to report.

68
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,840
His exact injury remains unclear.

69
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,400
Crossbow fire persisted during my return.
The squad may not return soon.

70
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,520
Rear units, keep up!

71
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Mr. Jiang, look.

72
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,079
Accelerate return to camp.

73
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,000
Water! Bring more water!

74
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,120
More water! Fetch more water!

75
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,920
Hurry!

76
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,280
Hurry!

77
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,840
Around three-quarters past the hour of Yin,
shortly after the commander left,

78
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,320
we saw warning smoke rising
in the Central Army's rear.

79
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,240
Then, death warriors
suddenly broke into the east side of our camp.

80
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,960
Mr. Jiang warned never to
underestimate enemies at night,

81
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,480
so we doubled the night guards deliberately.

82
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,679
We quickly captured the death warriors.

83
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,240
But two warriors, seeing their failure,
forced their way into the supply tents

84
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,440
and set fire to provisions.

85
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,319
The fire was too fierce.
Nearly all stored grains were destroyed.

86
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,799
Did they poison themselves?

87
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:12,319
Yes. They swallowed poison
after being captured, but we kept one alive.

88
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,919
Any interrogation results?

89
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,200
They were hiding on the east side
of the mountain before the battle began.

90
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,279
Small numbers and hiding in bushes
kept them undetected.

91
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,159
Death warriors said Prince Ning
ordered them to wait for the signal.

92
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,080
When our army weakens,

93
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,200
they'd sneak in to assassinate
our commander, but...

94
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,440
Our night raid alarmed Prince Ning,
forcing him to improvise.

95
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,600
Warning smoke rose early tonight,
forcing their desperate charge.

96
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,120
These death warriors have been lurking nearby.

97
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,240
Had they attacked when our morale was low,

98
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,360
the consequences would be dire.

99
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,639
Now, with Prince Ning's sudden order
and our tight camp security,

100
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,040
we have actually minimized the danger.

101
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,559
This was Prince Ning's
final assassination strategy.

102
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:05,480
However, Prince Ning's current panic
has prematurely revealed his hidden plans.

103
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,839
This may not necessarily
be bad news for the Hedong Army.

104
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,720
However, our night raid failed to capture him,

105
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,320
and this battle may likely drag on longer.

106
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,240
Mr. Jiang, you mustn't blame yourself.

107
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,759
If Prince Ning becomes desperate, it will directly
impact the main battlefield situation.

108
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:27,000
The Hedong Army still has hope.

109
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,200
Our initial strategy for a quick victory
is now compromised by lost provisions.

110
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,959
Even the bravest Hedong warriors
cannot fight hunger and cold indefinitely.

111
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,320
Recheck our remaining grain reserves
to determine how many days they'll last.

112
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,359
Starting tomorrow, portion sizes
will be halved at every meal.

113
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,520
We must defend the Dongwei Pass at all costs.

114
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,959
Yes!

115
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,240
 

116
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,730
Madam, Mr. Jiang has instructed me

117
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,200
that if an accident occurs, I must take you all
and leave Hedong for Xinluo as soon as possible.

118
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,799
The cargo ships are docked. We'll depart tonight.

119
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,799
I will ensure your safety and well-being.

120
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,080
If the empire falls into chaos
with the people suffering...

121
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,639
How can any Tang citizen
speak of safety and well-being?

122
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,919
But men need food, and horses need fodder.

123
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:44,159
If this war prolongs, wouldn't the Hedong Army
be driven to extinction?

124
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,400
Prince Ning secured his own escape route.
But what about us?

125
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,519
The Hedong Army's camp
backs against the Fan River.

126
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,240
If we can't win, could we escape by boat?

127
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,759
Yu Zheng and Jiang Chang Yang aren't cowards.
They'd never flee battle.

128
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,320
Moreover, Prince Ning has smeared
the Hedong Army as rebels.

129
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,600
Fleeing would confirm these false accusations.

130
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,520
What would become of the Hedong civilians then?

131
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,639
The Hedong Army
stands ready to die honorably in battle.

132
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,520
They wouldn't prepare escape vessels in advance.

133
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,679
We have cargo ships
that can carry thousands of tons.

134
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,039
If we load provisions and transport them
to the Hedong Army...

135
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,000
Are you suggesting we cross the Fan River?

136
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,559
But the camp lies on the southwest bank.

137
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,919
Crossing would require
sailing upstream against the current.

138
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,440
The Fan River is wide with treacherous rapids.

139
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,679
If we encounter hidden reefs or rough waves,
we could die and vanish without a trace.

140
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,000
But if successful, delivering provisions
could turn the tide for the Hedong Army.

141
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,559
It would significantly
improve our chances of victory.

142
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,479
I await your orders, Madam.

143
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,639
I'll immediately inventory our stored grain.

144
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,639
I'll have the crew
load the provisions onto the ships.

145
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,919
Wait, this won't be enough.

146
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,759
Yun Niang, take people to borrow grain
from Hedong shops using promissory notes.

147
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,600
- Grain, fodder, collect whatever's available.
- Understood.

148
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,320
Remember to stamp our shop seal
and promise tenfold repayment.

149
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,120
Slow down.

150
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,160
Ms. Feng.

151
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,559
Mr. Yang? What brings you here?

152
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,919
This fishing boat belongs to my father-in-law.

153
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,240
Though not large, it can still
carry over a dozen dan of millet.

154
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,639
Furthermore, the northern regions are cold.

155
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,120
The soldiers exposed to the elements
are prone to catching colds.

156
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,039
I've brought medicinal soups and pills
for the Hedong Army as emergency supplies.

157
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,000
The turbulent Fan River makes crossing perilous.

158
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,360
I appreciate your kindness,
but please, don't take further risks.

159
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,840
It's fine, you drove away
the Juebei bandits for us,

160
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,080
then guided us to prosper through commerce,
ensuring ample food and clothing.

161
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,120
Now it's our turn to repay you.
Don't refuse our help.

162
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,919
Moreover, Hedong faces a crisis
and General Yu is fighting on the battlefield.

163
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,120
We Hedong citizens can't stand idly by!

164
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,519
Exactly! That's right.

165
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,120
Ms. Feng, you set an example of integrity
and righteousness as a merchant.

166
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,600
Though not from Hedong, you are willing
to take risks and deliver provisions for our army.

167
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,519
How could we locals
not contribute to our frontline soldiers?

168
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,040
- Exactly!
- Let's all do our part!

169
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,120
In that case, I gratefully accept your assistance.

170
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,559
Fu, load the ships.

171
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,879
- Yes!
- Loading now!

172
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:46,879
Come with me.

173
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,440
- Come, pass me one!
- Over here!

174
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,480
- Careful, the deck's slippery!
- Ms. Feng.

175
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,120
My wife preserved many pickles.
They'll arrive shortly.

176
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Thank you. Thank you.

177
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,080
Ms. Feng, our shop has prepared
a small cargo vessel too.

178
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,799
It can carry substantial grain.
Our staff will deliver it soon.

179
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,039
Excellent, thank you.

180
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,320
You're welcome. Let's go.

181
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,120
Thanks.

182
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:33,799
Mr. Jiang, Prince Ning's flaming arrows
are coming incessantly.

183
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,960
We're running out of even rice gruel.
This can't continue...

184
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,000
Order the light cavalry to prepare arms
and assemble in 15 minutes.

185
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,759
Do you intend to lead the charge personally?

186
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,200
Mr. Jiang, you've lived in Chang'an for years
without battlefield experience.

187
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,480
I may lack Yu Zheng's military prowess,
but I have martial skills.

188
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,720
Each enemy slain is a life saved for our side.

189
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,759
Two kills mean double the gain!

190
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,480
- Mr. Jiang...
- The night raid strategy failed.

191
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,719
With General Yu fighting at the front,
how can I hide in camp like a spectator?

192
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,680
Understood, sir.

193
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,480
Report!

194
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,559
Suspicious boats sighted
on the Fan River behind camp!

195
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,440
Look! We've arrived!

196
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,159
Mu Dan!

197
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,559
This shipment contains rice, flour,
and pickles made by Hedong locals.

198
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,400
It can sustain the troops for two to three days.
I'll find more if needed.

199
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,200
Thank you so much.

200
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Tell the soldiers that the people
of Hedong stand with them.

201
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,440
Urge them not to lose heart.
We await their victorious return!

202
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,960
What's this?

203
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Thank you.

204
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,079
Of course, Lady He.

205
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,960
Fu, Mr. Yang's small fishing boat has no shelter.

206
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,279
If we encounter waves and collisions,
these grains will definitely get damp.

207
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:28,079
Return to the shop and bring the Juebei
fire-resistant cloth we stored to cover them.

208
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,000
This will help waterproof and protect the grains.

209
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,079
If the boat rocks and accidentally
knocks over oil lamps or torches,

210
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,079
it can also prevent flames
from reaching the provisions.

211
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,480
Alright, I'll go get it.

212
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,280
Go ahead.

213
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,760
Fu,

214
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,599
did I say fire-resistant cloth?

215
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,240
Yes, we still have some stockpiled. Why?

216
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,880
The night raid failed due to fire attacks.

217
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,319
If we make protective gear
from these tough fireproof fabrics...

218
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,960
Protective gear? I'll fetch them.

219
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,760
Hurry!

220
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Our warehouse holds much fire-resistant cloth
from trade with the Juebei Kingdom.

221
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,720
But these cloths are mainly sold
to taverns and kitchens in small sizes.

222
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,559
So I led the Hedong villagers
to stitch the fabrics overnight,

223
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,519
sewing them into large combat cloaks.

224
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:21,640
We also made face curtains
and chest armor for the warhorses,

225
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,359
specifically designed to counter fire attacks.

226
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,200
I increased the material usage
based on sizing comparisons.

227
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,039
When worn, they can withstand frontal flames.

228
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,119
They won't hinder soldiers
from controlling reins or riding.

229
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,680
Reorganize the cavalry without serious injuries
and prepare for a second night raid.

230
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,160
Light torches and approach the warhorses.

231
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,632
Accustom them to flames
to prevent panic when encountering firewalls.

232
00:19:53,632 --> 00:19:55,160
Yes.

233
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,359
Where is Prince Ning now?

234
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:59,559
Frontline scouts report Prince Ning
is still recuperating in camp.

235
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,400
We must race against time and reach
the Central Army's rear before dawn.

236
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,200
Understood.

237
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,319
Report! An enemy squad
was detected ten li from our main camp.

238
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,520
They are approaching rapidly.

239
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,200
Overestimating themselves.

240
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,720
Your Highness is truly farsighted.
Jiang Chang Yang indeed won't give up easily.

241
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,039
Ignorant brat! Like an egg striking a stone.

242
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,920
How's the preparation?

243
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,319
Rest assured, Your Highness.

244
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:37,359
The trenches are now refilled with fire oil.
They'll surely perish in flames.

245
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:42,720
Make it swift this time. Leave no survivors.

246
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,599
Bring me Jiang Chang Yang's head when you return.

247
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,399
Yes!

248
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
Release arrows.

249
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,520
Again!

250
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,920
Summon the cavalry!
Don't let them approach His Highness.

251
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,359
Inform the frontline troops to return
for reinforcement immediately.

252
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,159
Understood!

253
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,399
You're quite adaptable, aren't you?

254
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:55,119
Jiang Chang Yang, what does it matter
if you've knocked down my army's banner?

255
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:02,839
The Hedong Army has fewer than 500,000 soldiers.
You won't hold out much longer.

256
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,119
Prince Ning, your army's banner has fallen,
and communications have been severed.

257
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,720
Why must you persist in your futile resistance?

258
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,359
These remaining troops
guarding the rear are already in disarray.

259
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,279
Do you really expect them to win and rescue you?

260
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,079
Fine, let's keep dragging this out then.

261
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:28,200
Until the Hedong Army is wiped out.
What do I have to fear?

262
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,519
I am His Majesty's elder brother.
What can you possibly do to me?

263
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:39,559
Moreover, you're the rebel here.

264
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:46,359
It's true you're His Majesty's brother,
but who's the real traitor remains unclear.

265
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,399
By His Majesty's decree,
all soldiers heed the command!

266
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,720
Prince Ning Li Xian has slandered the Hedong Army.

267
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,839
He persecuted loyal officials
and conspired to rebel.

268
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,720
His treacherous heart deserves execution.

269
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,319
Military Governor Yu Zheng of Hedong
is ordered to apprehend the rebel.

270
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,200
Those who resist shall be deemed accomplices
and executed immediately.

271
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,800
Prince Ning is the true traitor to the nation!

272
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,039
The fundamental nature
of this battle has now shifted.

273
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,400
No.

274
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,639
It's all over.

275
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,119
No!

276
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,240
Central Army troops, listen!

277
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,039
You've never been
a righteous force quelling rebellion.

278
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,079
His Majesty's decree has arrived.

279
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,640
Continued resistance will fully brand you
as treasonous scoundrels

280
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,639
to be executed without pardon.

281
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,759
Let's go.

282
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,640
Come back!

283
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,720
Don't fall for his lies. Return!

284
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,039
Prince Ning, you've always looked down
on merchants and women.

285
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,879
But do you know who delivered this decree?

286
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,680
General Yu and his son are loyal to the throne.
They'll never submit to Prince Ning.

287
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,839
War between them is inevitable.

288
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,359
I must give the Hedong Army
a legitimate justification.

289
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,599
It'll prove at the frontline
that Yu Zheng fights to protect the sovereign.

290
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,240
But they must win this battle.

291
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,800
Only through victory does this become
His Majesty's true edict.

292
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,919
If we lose, it becomes worthless scrap.

293
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,599
The camellias are blooming splendidly.

294
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:53,159
The azaleas here are also quite beautiful.

295
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,760
The wind's picking up.
Be careful not to catch a cold.

296
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,119
Since all's quiet in the capital,
you should return to Hexi soon.

297
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,159
Take care, Noble Consort.

298
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,480
Do you think waving this so-called decree
will shake my army's morale?

299
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,079
The authenticity of this decree
remains unverified.

300
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,960
Soldiers! A general in the field
may disregard imperial orders.

301
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,159
Here, you obey me!

302
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:14,160
Jiang Chang Yang, I ask you this.

303
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,880
With less than 500,000 troops,
how can you possibly defeat me?

304
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,599
Even if you capture me now,

305
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,279
the Hexi Army and Jiannan Army
won't stand idly by.

306
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:32,079
To prove they're not rebels,
they'll fight to the death to save me.

307
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,119
Boy, remember this.

308
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,599
The victor of this war
writes the narrative of justice.

309
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,759
Look. Reinforcements are coming!

310
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,639
My troops have arrived. What did I tell you?

311
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,599
Your Highness!

312
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,399
Li Xian!

313
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,400
It seems justice favors the Hedong Army.

314
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,680
Prince Ning, haven't you always
wanted my list of allies?

315
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,599
Today, I formally introduce you
to a crucial ally of mine.

316
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:42,520
Xiao Wen Yan, you traitorous rat!

317
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,440
Soldiers! You are the fiercest
warriors of the Central Plains!

318
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,519
You should share glory and shame
with your commander!

319
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,519
Take up arms! Follow me to retake the capital!

320
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:06,240
When we succeed,
your descendants will bask in eternal glory!

321
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,160
Prince Ning, are you finally
dropping the act and openly rebelling?

322
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:20,319
So what? Fight! Let the battle commence!

323
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,759
Your Highness, our troops are demoralized,
and we've lost allies.

324
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:35,160
We can no longer fight.

325
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,920
I misjudged you all along.

326
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,839
Despicable! Repaying kindness with betrayal!

327
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:49,319
You lost not just a leg,
but your backbone and courage!

328
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,000
I merely adapt to prevailing circumstances.

329
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,160
My earlier loyalty followed the greater trend.

330
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,559
Now, my rebellion aligns with the new trend.

331
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,319
My principles remain unchanged.

332
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,279
It's you who no longer
represents the tide of history.

333
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,079
You...

334
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,119
I, Liu Chang, Assistant Minister of War,
voluntarily surrender.

335
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:26,559
I acknowledge my grave crimes deserve death.

336
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,279
At great risk, I captured the rebel leader.

337
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,920
Prince Ning conspired
to eliminate loyal officials.

338
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,920
I hold evidence of all his crimes.

339
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,200
I'll fully cooperate
with General Yu Zheng's investigation.

340
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,399
Let's purge corrupt officials
and restore imperial order.

341
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:10,839
Hedong Military Governor Yu Zheng is ennobled
as Prince Jun for quelling rebellion.

342
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:13,440
You'll remain in the capital
to oversee investigations

343
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,319
and eradicate Prince Ning's faction completely.

344
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:19,440
I accept this decree.
Thank you for Your Majesty's mercy.

345
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,240
Liu Chang, Vice Minister of War.

346
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,440
I am here.

347
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,639
A rebel accomplice deserves death.

348
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:45,200
Yet, your battlefield confession
and capturing enemies are merits.

349
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,640
Given your sincere repentance
and merit-earning surrender,

350
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,410
I'll show leniency.

351
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,000
You'll be stripped of position
with your property confiscated.

352
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,640
But your death sentence is commuted.

353
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,040
I kneel in gratitude, Your Majesty.

354
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,879
Your Majesty, I have one final request.

355
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,800
Go on.

356
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,639
Your Majesty, I beseech you
to grant County Princess amnesty.

357
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,720
Although she is the daughter of Prince Ning,
she was never involved in the rebellion.

358
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,960
The Li imperial lineage is precious.
The County Princess shares your royal blood.

359
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,599
I implore Your Majesty's mercy to spare her life.

360
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,680
We are but powerless commoners
with neither status nor heirs.

361
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,480
We pose no threat to stir any waves.

362
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,839
May Your Majesty show compassion
befitting the Heavenly Family's benevolence.

363
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:57,000
 Master, General Yu, 

364
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,359
 Brother Zhang Qiu, She Yan,
and all fallen comrades, 

365
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:10,920
 now that calamities have ended and reforms begun, 

366
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,839
 may you all rest in peace. 

367
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,799
As for your dearest friends,

368
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,909
I shall dedicate myself to protecting them.

369
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:27,399
Please rest assured.

370
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,119
May Heaven bless
the Great Tang with enduring peace.

371
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,680
Are you truly determined
to abandon the identity of He Wei Fang?

372
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,119
These extraordinary experiences
can't be explained logically to outsiders.

373
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,039
Moreover, the treacherous
Floral Envoy has already perished.

374
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,519
Why shouldn't I remain
as this carefree shopkeeper Xiao Hua?

375
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,320
Whether I remain Jiang Chang Yang matters not.
I merely lament losing my Jiang Mansion.

376
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,199
Exactly! Those flower-cultivating soils
I painstakingly nurtured...

377
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,079
Why don't we sneak in and steal that soil back?

378
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,559
I'm homeless now,
and you're still obsessing over soil?

379
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,800
A corrupt official should've anticipated this day.

380
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,320
But the Fragrance Garden
has ample space and many rooms.

381
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,879
Pick any chamber you like.
I won't disdain a live-in husband.

382
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,840
Though you left Chang'an, your remaining staff
proved remarkably capable.

383
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,039
Within just over a year,
they managed to reclaim the Fragrance Garden.

384
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:05,599
With such expanded business,
numerous visitors will come calling.

385
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,239
I must teach you some trickery arts.

386
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,719
Should we encounter old acquaintances,
escaping won't be so awkward.

387
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:15,639
Keep your petty thieving tricks to yourself.

388
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,559
My silver tongue suffices for protection.

389
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:21,000
And if that silver tongue gets occupied?

390
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,639
What do you propose?

391
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,199
Taking liberties in broad daylight, aren't you?

392
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,280
Mercy, my lady!

393
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,439
Having left Chang'an so long, I've yearned
for the palace-brewed Mulberry Wine.

394
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,600
Exhilarating!

395
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,199
Fortunately, Li Xian coveted that allies' list.

396
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,920
Had he truly sought your death...

397
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,280
Without mortal peril,
how could we find hope in desperation?

398
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,079
I should thank his precise bladework,
taking half my life yet sparing a breath.

399
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,959
Having cheated death once,
how can you remain so reckless?

400
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,559
To sacrifice for the nation's crisis,
I meet death as homecoming.

401
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:35,600
Master's teachings stay with me.

402
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,000
Even had I perished fulfilling duty that day...

403
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,640
I'd have no regrets.
You needn't blame yourself, Your Majesty.

404
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,400
Sui Zhi, you know that.

405
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,079
I never saw you as a subject, but as a brother.

406
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:03,879
So no matter how you died, I will...

407
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,440
Don't think I don't know what you're scheming.

408
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,200
You want to get me drunk
so I'll grant your request.

409
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,079
Now that power is returned to the sovereign,
peace reigns over land and sea.

410
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,840
Our wrongfully deceased colleagues and the people
of Mengzhou can finally rest in peace.

411
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,800
Now, we'll witness Mr. Third's
grand ambitions unfold.

412
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,079
My childhood wishes are all fulfilled.
One shouldn't be too greedy in life.

413
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,519
You've always been loyal and righteous.

414
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:57,600
Why not clear your name and restore your status?

415
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,760
Mu Dan and I have complicated identities.

416
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,599
If we publicly return from the dead,
there'd be too much to explain.

417
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,320
It's too much.

418
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,440
Besides, I don't care
about high positions or eternal fame.

419
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,039
If you don't care about family reputation,
what about Mu Dan?

420
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:19,968
She naturally shares my view.

421
00:38:19,968 --> 00:38:21,880
The empire is vast,

422
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,639
and officials across prefectures
can't monitor everything.

423
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:29,360
While Mu Dan trades across the lands,
I'll be your watchful eyes.

424
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,720
We'll ensure no corrupt officials or bandits
remain wherever we pass.

425
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,960
You clearly just want to travel
and enjoy life with Mu Dan,

426
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,359
leaving me lonely and desolate.

427
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:08,080
Mr. Third, dare you repeat
those words before Consort Shu?

428
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,519
Mr. Third.

429
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,160
Sui Zhi.

430
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,176
 

431
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,439
Your shop is reopening soon. Why the long face?

432
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,839
I still don't know
how to tell everyone about leaving.

433
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,719
Rather than face tearful farewells,
how about we slip away quietly?

434
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,480
We'll sneak away on your flower boat...

435
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,079
That won't do!

436
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:14,760
After finally returning safely,
leaving like that would hurt everyone.

437
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,000
How are the preparations coming along?

438
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,600
Don't worry. Yun Niang's got it.
Everything will be ready soon.

439
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:37,039
Mr. Lv, come here.

440
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:45,280
Mr. Lv. Over here, Mr. Lv.

441
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,280
Our previous plan isn't perfect.

442
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,879
What do you think they're doing?

443
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:18,044
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

444
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:26,458
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

445
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:34,650
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

446
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:43,002
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫ 

447
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:51,199
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

448
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:59,386
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

449
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:07,802
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

450
00:42:07,802 --> 00:42:15,802
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

451
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:43,954
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫ 

452
00:42:43,954 --> 00:42:51,405
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

453
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:59,391
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫ 

454
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:07,700
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫ 

455

 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

 ♫ Let the years go by,

457

 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

458
00:43:32,646 --> 00:43:40,646
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
