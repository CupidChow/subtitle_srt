1
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,999
 

2
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,360
Your Majesty.

3
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,240
The treasonous rebels are dead.

4
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,640
The loyal and brave Prince Ning has protected me,
and he is a model for all officials.

5
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,839
The court has suffered a great difficulty.

6
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:40,679
My heart feels as if it's on fire,
and the grief is unbearable.

7
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:47,360
All remnants of the situation
are to be managed by Prince Ning.

8
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,719
All officials are to obey
his orders without error.

9
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,120
He is already a part of the traitor faction.

10
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,800
If you take another step forward,
you will be guilty of treason. Think carefully.

11
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:12,319
 

12
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,119
Hurry.

13
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,360
Over here.

14
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,480
 
Why has Wuyong Hall been sealed?

15
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,639
- Yes.
- What happened to Lady He?

16
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:33,520
 

17
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,040
You're awake.

18
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,439
I already have a husband.
Mr. Liu, please behave yourself.

19
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,280
Jiang Chang Yang is already dead.

20
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,879
The concubines of the traitor faction
should be made official servants.

21
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,960
He Wei Fang, only I can help you.

22
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,520
How you live in the future depends on my mood.

23
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:20,480
Listen closely, from today onwards,
you will eat and sleep on this bed.

24
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,280
I will come to see you every day.

25
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:33,400
The only ones who can stay together
for a long time are you and I.

26
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,040
You're trapped here,
yet you're still so fierce in temperament.

27
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,720
Don't hurt yourself.

28
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,160
Give it back to me! Give it back!

29
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,960
Mr. Liu.

30
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,920
What is the matter?

31
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,840
His Highness requests your presence.

32
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,439
Our future is long.

33
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,560
Those who bring troops into the city
without orders will be sentenced to death.

34
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,879
Enter the city.

35
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,319
The imperial decree is here,
and you shall obey the orders.

36
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,520
The imperial decree is here. Officers and soldiers
of the Hedong Army shall obey the orders.

37
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,759
The Floral Envoy Jiang Chang Yang colluded
with the Shangfu Local Military Captain

38
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,039
Pei Zhong in plotting treason
and rebellion at the Promotion Feast,

39
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:13,679
killing the new imperial scholars
and important officials.

40
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,840
Hedong Military Governor Yu Chang killed traitors
and loyally died for the country.

41
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:25,679
Moved by this, I appoint his son Yu Zheng
to succeed as Commander and grant him a banner.

42
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,159
He is entrusted with military autonomy
for execution. My edict is on the right.

43
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,120
Upon receipt of this order, execute it.

44
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
How did it come to this?

45
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,519
The incident happened suddenly.
His Majesty, like yourself, could not believe it.

46
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,120
New scholar Zhang Qian has survived
and has already given testimony.

47
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,079
If you have any doubts, feel free to ask him.

48
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,719
I accept the decree.

49
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,399
General Yu, the fire scene is in disarray.

50
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:34,079
They only retrieved General Yu's sword and some
bone fragments. I am sorry for your loss.

51
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,880
Thank you.

52
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:11,679
An army cannot go a day without a general.
You are now the backbone of the Hedong Army.

53
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,840
As for your promotion...

54
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,600
With the passing of my father,
I am in no mood for political affairs.

55
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,679
Now I just want to return
to Hedong and mourn my father.

56
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,519
It is indeed right to be a son first,
then a minister of the court.

57
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,759
Well, then. General, you should
reorganize the troops and rest.

58
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,640
At dawn tomorrow, His Majesty
will send people to escort you back to Hedong.

59
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,840
In just a few days, Mr. Liu helped His Highness
turn danger into a great victory.

60
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,559
I truly admire that.

61
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,600
You made a wise choice. Otherwise, you wouldn't
be sitting here drinking tea with me now.

62
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,320
Yes, I agreed to your proposal

63
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,240
because we were both burdened by family status
and were unrecognized for our talents.

64
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,320
My defection on the battlefield
was not out of fear for my life.

65
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,839
But because I realized that only by following
His Highness could I fulfill my ambitions.

66
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,879
His Majesty already has trusted
and esteemed people around him.

67
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,799
He won't place any heavy trust in you.

68
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,000
You took the Imperial Exam for nine years
and finally succeeded.

69
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,120
If you had to start as a low-ranking official,
how many more nine years do you have?

70
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,079
You know me well. I will not disappoint you
or Prince Ning's esteem and promotion.

71
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,519
I refined my advice for governing the country
after hearing your guidance.

72
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,400
Please present it to Prince Ning on my behalf.

73
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,559
Why?

74
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:31,559
Once disloyal, never used again.

75
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:39,559
You really are like me, but what I hate most
in my life is who I am.

76
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,799
Issue the order to strengthen vigil
throughout the new residence.

77
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,559
Never give the fleeing remnants
an opportunity to exploit.

78
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,359
Yes.

79
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,679
Your Highness, you have vanquished the enemies.
This victory deserves celebration.

80
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,000
Why hide and lay low now?

81
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,839
Victory? Look at what these people have done.

82
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:44,129
For over a decade, they have endured hardships.

83
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:46,720
For politics, land, finance, and military,

84
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,480
they have placed their people in key positions.

85
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,559
If not for the information in advance
and urgent deployment today,

86
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,799
I would have died there in the Fragrance Garden.

87
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,039
Only with evenly matched opponents
does one gain improvement.

88
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,000
Your Highness, you saw the subtle signs
and made resolute decisions.

89
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,280
Even with their meticulous planning,
they still ended up in a deadlock.

90
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,160
Now it's time for Your Highness to make a move.

91
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,799
We've seized power in the capital.

92
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,000
However, several military governors
remain stubborn and need to be pacified.

93
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,080
What happened today
will soon spread throughout the nation.

94
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,840
This matter should not be handled by force
but by leveraging power.

95
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,640
Yes.

96
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,519
Yu Zheng, he...

97
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,600
He is disheartened and only wishes to mourn.

98
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,640
His stance is unclear.

99
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,679
Alone, he is not to be feared.

100
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,360
However, the Yu family
still has veteran generals as support.

101
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,400
The Hedong Army is brave and skilled in battle,
loyal to the emperor, and must be guarded against.

102
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:12,840
Remember, what I need is a mandate from Heaven,
legitimate and justified.

103
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,760
I understand.

104
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,279
A spy has already been placed in the escort fleet
of the Hedong Army.

105
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:25,479
If the sharp blade can't be used by Your Highness,
it would be better to break it.

106
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:34,400
Once the mission is accomplished,
you will become the only beacon in Chang'an,

107
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,359
Illuminating the world
and bringing eternal prosperity.

108
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,080
It's not a festival,
so why are there so many imperial guards?

109
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,880
I don't know.

110
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,799
Chun.

111
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,559
Father.

112
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,839
Hurry up. Those at the back, hurry up.

113
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,759
Everything was fine when we left.
How could this happen?

114
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,839
When we hurried there, we saw Mr. Jiang
and She Yan being carried out of Fragrance Garden.

115
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,000
The corpses on the ground were unrecognizable.

116
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,519
We couldn't find Mu Dan and Chuan Yu either.

117
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:32,880
No way. Chuan Yu is so skilled
in martial arts. He wouldn't die.

118
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,599
Mu Dan also said she would wait for us to return.
She wouldn't break her promise.

119
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,920
Yes.

120
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Maybe they've hidden somewhere. I'll go find them.

121
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,880
- Fu.
- Come back.

122
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,160
We've searched everywhere. The Fragrance Garden
and Jiang Mansion are sealed off.

123
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,000
They are all guarded by imperial soldiers.
Going there would risk your life.

124
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,559
I don't care. I'll find them
even if it means dying.

125
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,119
- No, you can't go.
- Let me go.

126
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,919
You can't go.

127
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,160
Mu Dan sent everyone off to save their lives.

128
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,920
Going there is suicide. Is that fair for Mu Dan?

129
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,200
- But...
- When you left the city to deliver goods,

130
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,759
Lady He gave this box to me for safekeeping.

131
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,720
She said to hand it over to you at the right time.

132
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,200
I didn't understand at the time
and asked if something had happened.

133
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,800
She did not say much, only mentioned
that on that day, I would understand.

134
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:30,323
 

135
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,319
Fu, Chun, when you see this letter,

136
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,559
 I fear I might have encountered misfortune. 

137
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,039
 I have transferred the deeds
of Huamanzhu, Qingshuzhai, 

138
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,319
 as well as Wuyong Hall in Sheng County, 

139
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:15,279
 to your names so they won't be
implicated and seized. 

140
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,399
 These three establishments are both
my entrustment and my apology. 

141
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:27,759
 I hope you and Mr. Lv will keep using
the former workers and help them. 

142
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,680
 Stars scatter and still shine.
A roc can soar alone. 

143
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:38,240
 I have turned into a star, wishing you well. 

144
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,119
It seems that Lady He
had already planned a future path for everyone.

145
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,800
I hope everyone stands strong and self-reliant,
not failing her wishes and entrustment.

146
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,440
She said "might",
so as long as her body isn't found,

147
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,720
no one can claim that Mu Dan is dead, right?

148
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,599
Yes, Mu Dan is clever.

149
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:05,359
She'll surely figure out a way to escape alive.

150
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,159
Let's manage the shops well,
awaiting the day Mu Dan returns safely.

151
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,520
Trapped in a cage yourself,
you want to lock everyone by your side.

152
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,800
It's truly sad.

153
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,919
How did you get hurt like this?

154
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,919
Break the guard's arms and legs.

155
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,559
Yes.

156
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
Liu Chang.

157
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,760
If you don't take care of yourself,
I need to have my subordinates be more mindful.

158
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,520
If you feel sorry for them, behave a bit.

159
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,879
Eat.

160
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,520
My Mu Dan, even as a prisoner,
still looks at me like this.

161
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:36,079
Over time, one day,
I'll make you willingly come to me.

162
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,280
Don't hurt yourself anymore.
I'll come see you again tomorrow.

163
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,720
Mu Dan. Mu Dan.

164
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,520
Mu Dan.

165
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,039
You are the owner of Huamanzhu and Wuyong Hall.

166
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,200
Understanding everything
and enlightening the world is your dream.

167
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,440
You won't be stuck here forever.

168
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,760
You have truly become the bright moon now.

169
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:59,359
We gaze from afar, and I can no longer reach you.

170
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,639
Mu Dan. Mu Dan.

171
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:42,319
No matter where the moon is,
its light is everywhere.

172
00:26:52,064 --> 00:26:55,804
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫ 

173
00:26:55,804 --> 00:26:59,964
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫ 

174
00:26:59,964 --> 00:27:03,932
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫ 

175
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:08,828
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫ 

176
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:13,856
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫ 

177
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:18,142
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫ 

178
00:27:18,142 --> 00:27:22,048
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫ 

179
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:27,628
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫ 

180
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:35,810
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫ 

181
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:44,089
 ♫ Love is boundless ♫ 

182
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,680
You wanted to blend scents to relieve boredom,
and I had someone buy everything on the list.

183
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:11,200
Still don't want to talk to me, huh?

184
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:30,720
This aroma is rich and sweet,
and it calms the mind.

185
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,639
Does it have a name?

186
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:46,119
The aroma...

187
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,799
You really are an unrelenting ghost.

188
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:43,760
Likewise. Are you here to take my life?

189
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,280
I advise you not to act rashly.

190
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,200
You saw your beloved die in front of you.

191
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,000
The rest of your life
will be spent in ceaseless hell.

192
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,040
He Wei Fang, you finally understand my pain.

193
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,920
Losing my love forever breaks my heart.

194
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,559
But I won't give up on myself.

195
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,400
My life isn't only about love,

196
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,119
and the meaning of my life
is not based on any person.

197
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,919
County Princess, why imprison
yourself in eternal pain?

198
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,079
The Liu Chang who once loved you deeply
is already dead.

199
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:43,480
You should be concerned about yourself now.

200
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:49,839
Rather than exchanging one life for another,
why not leave here alive?

201
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:57,240
This courtyard is unwatched at the moment.

202
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,919
Why help me?

203
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:12,000
The city of Chang'an reeks of blood,
and I don't like it.

204
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Moreover, I have experienced
too much false affection in my life.

205
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,240
Even my father, who loves me, sees me as a pawn.

206
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:30,200
I can only be the County Princess, alive or dead.

207
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,559
There's no escaping this cage.

208
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:43,280
Only Zi Shu has given me
a heart that is utterly true and pure.

209
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:51,480
In this life, I am destined to be with him
never stopping until death.

210
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,599
Go.

211
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:24,119
 ♫ The Luo River cleanses the moonlight ♫ 

212
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:28,599
Li You Zhen, I have never believed in destiny.

213
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:33,880
So I will always fight with everything I have.

214
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:40,280
You can also do it. It's never too late to start.

215
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:47,759
Since you let me go today, I hope that one day,
you can also let go of yourself.

216
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,200
 ♫ Why follow the arbitrary guesses
of the common eye ♫ 

217
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,696
 ♫ Smile at the winds and rains stirring the dust ♫ 

218
00:32:57,696 --> 00:33:01,647
 ♫ Flowers should bloom proudly ♫

 ♫ Reflecting the color of the sky ♫ 

220
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,559
Jiang Chang Yang has put up an act for so long.

221
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,800
His treasonous faction won't be
limited to those few at the Promotion Feast.

222
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,480
Your Majesty, if you give me a few names,

223
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,240
these people on the list can live,
merely exiled three thousand miles.

224
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:33,039
Sui Zhi wasn't only
trying to protect me with his life,

225
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,599
but also all those in the court
who forsake their lives for the country.

226
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:43,000
You can't kill all of the loyal ministers,
nor can you force me to abdicate.

227
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:51,280
Oh, Your Majesty, I merely wish
to relieve you of some worries.

228
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:58,800
Ning, you endured till now just because you
haven't subdued all the military governors.

229
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,359
Let me guess...

230
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,720
Shuo Fang has always been on good terms
with you and is close to Hedong.

231
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,960
Surely, it has already submitted.

232
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,639
You allowed Xiao Xue Xi to leave the capital.

233
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,760
Have you made a deal with Hexi?

234
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:21,639
You're laying out falsehoods,
trying to know my leverage.

235
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:35,920
In fact, the best move I have is Your Majesty.

236
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,719
As long as I have you in my hands,

237
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,840
who is the loyalist army
and who is the treacherous minister,

238
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,439
depends on the edicts issued from Chang'an.

239
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:56,704
So, Your Majesty,
think carefully before making a move.

240
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:12,600
Where is she?

241
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,760
Did you kill her?

242
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:28,800
Take good care of this wound.
Don't let it scar later.

243
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,720
I'm asking you, did you kill her?

244
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,719
You said that if I killed her,
you would hate me for a lifetime.

245
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:43,359
I wouldn't do something so foolish.

246
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,159
I just let her go. She's not coming back.

247
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,240
You should let go, too.

248
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,599
I promised to treat you well. Haven't I done so?

249
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,440
Li You Zhen, why must you break the peace?

250
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,319
Why can't you act as if He Wei Fang
is not in this world?

251
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,439
Only when she leaves can you and I be free.

252
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,119
Father is only a step away
from proclaiming himself emperor.

253
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:35,680
What you should do now is assist him well
to achieve your lofty aspirations.

254
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,439
If someone won't stay,
don't cling to them anymore.

255
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:58,280
Let's live our own lives well, okay?

256
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:07,120
You forced me to stay,
so how do you know that I can't keep her?

257
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,360
Who goes there? Stop!

258
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,359
Search thoroughly.

259
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,280
It's midnight.

260
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,319
Open the door.

261
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,960
Open up. Open the door.

262
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,000
Hurry up and open the door.

263
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Open the door.

264
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,119
- Have you seen this person?
- Search.

265
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,519
You, go that way.

266
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,719
Here, have you seen this woman?

267
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,719
Stop.

268
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,519
What's going on?

269
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,800
Check over there. Go.

270
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,400
Stop. Who's there?

271
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,200
Stop.

272
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,120
Search thoroughly now.

273
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,199
Anything?

274
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,239
No.

275
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,719
No.

276
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,920
No.

277
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,400
I saw her run in here with my own eyes.
Search thoroughly again.

278
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,999
Boss, there's a piece of torn cloth here.

279
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,879
She must have climbed out from here. Chase her.

280
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:37,519
Huanyun Tower has been sealed
for a long time and has long been unguarded.

281
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:42,839
My Mu Dan is truly smart,
letting me search for so long.

282
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,560
It's a pity that even if you are smart,
you still can't escape from my grasp.

283
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:56,999
Be good, and don't make trouble anymore.
Come back with me.

284
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:08,080
How do you know I'm hiding here
and not setting a trap for you?

285
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,360
If the County Princess hadn't stopped me,
I would have taken your life long ago.

286
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,290
Since you don't cherish it,

287
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:23,160
killing you here as a burial accompaniment
for Sui Zhi makes no difference.

288
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,559
How can you, alone, kill me?

289
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:36,400
Sui Zhi's hidden guards are all over the city,
and I have already joined them.

290
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,360
Right now, several crossbows are aimed here
from the buildings outside the window.

291
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,399
As soon as I drop this wine as a signal,
countless arrows will fly through the window.
