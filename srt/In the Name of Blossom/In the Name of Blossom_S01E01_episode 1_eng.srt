1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,010


2
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,150
   

3
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,940
   

4
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:45,784
   
   

5
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,079
 If you don't agree to the marriage, you won't get the zixi pills. 

6
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,740
 As long as mother can recover, I'm willing to do anything. 

7
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,800
Bow before the mirror.

8
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Husband and wife are united, forever blessed and prosperous.

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,040
Forced to accept you, a merchant's daughter, is my life's greatest humiliation!

10
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,040
Today, you need to go to Fuyun Temple to pray.

11
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,920
If you are not sincere, the prayers will be ineffective./i&gt;

12
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,600
 Young Madam, remember to kneel for 10 hours. Do not rise until the hour of You arrives. 

13
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,659
 How bold! How dare you try to deceive me in the Grand Celestial Master Hall. 

14
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,919
 Greetings, Floral Envoy. 

15
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,679
Greetings, everyone.

16
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,784
 Do not try to get the tribute medicine again. 

17
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:43,360
We must not let Madam He discover that what we gave back then was a fake.

18
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,760
 If I had discovered earlier that the zixi pills were fake, 

19
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,219
 Mother… Mother might have been saved. 

20
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,499
Miss, go to the shop, I'll hold them off here!

21
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:55,439
- Move! 
 - Miss!

22
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,140
- Someone has fallen into the water! 
 - Save her!

23
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,840
Yu Lu.

24
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,460
Let's go home.

25
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,160
Let's go home.

26
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,320
 I never had my heart set on Liu Chang. 

27
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,080
 If you wish to do this, you must act swiftly and decisively. 

28
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,790
 Please bear witness for me 

29
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,420
and approve my divorce.

30
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,519
Parting ways brings relief to both sides.

31
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,439
It's also quite a good story.

32
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:35,540
The matter is settled. Court is adjourned.

33
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,280
 Your Highness, I have never been your enemy. This is a win-win solution. 

34
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,539
 I'm just a woman who wants to hold her fate in her own hands. 

35
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:51,160
 But she was too greedy, insisting on taking her dowry with her. 

36
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,059
 And stirred up a lawsuit, ruining the reputation of my Liu family. 

37
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:57,400
 We can't let her live. 

38
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,560
 Mu Dan's escape at night is indeed disgraceful. 

39
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,539
 I will definitely establish myself in Chang'an. 

40
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,059
 I will reclaim Fragrance Garden on my own. 
  

41
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:15,299
Stop! He Wei Fang!

42
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,039
- Floral Envoy? 
 - Don't you want your household register anymore?

43
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,659
The authorities are indeed run by you.

44
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:28,400
Envoy Jiang, this ability, this speed. I really admire you.

45
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,384
Jiang Xiao Hua, are you satisfied?

46
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:33,859
   

47
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:37,110
Yes, yes.

48
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,979
They're all genuine peonies. Every single plant blooms splendidly.

49
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,900
- Those wishing to order, register here. Orders delivered in three days. 
- I'll buy one.

50
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,712
Okay. Custom-made, tailored fragrances. 
    

51
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:52,679
You can make your own fragrance.

52
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:53,979
Take your hand basket.

53
00:04:53,979 --> 00:05:00,940
 We weren't born on the same day, but seek to get rich on the same day. 

54
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,679
My house isn't next to the Jiang Residence's backyard.

55
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,840
My house is the Jiang Residence's backyard?

56
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,199
I invested money for you to do business, yet haven't earned any profit.

57
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,940
And you changed homes first?

58
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,676
Floral Haven, grand opening!

59
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:30,160
   

60
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,556
 Tranquil Health Clinic incorporates medicine into products to enhance beauty. 

61
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:37,040
Whatever you need, we have it all.

62
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,260
Jiang Chang Yang, when you're with the children, you really don't seem like a corrupt official.

63
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,720
Then tell me, what kind of man do you fancy?

64
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,679
I hope this person can understand me better than I understand myself.

65
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,759
Even if I say nothing, he knows all my likes, dislikes, decisions, and dreams.

66
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,319
 No matter what situation I fall into, he can face it with me. 

67
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,439
In the countless nights in our lives, only the bright moon remains by our side.

68
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,400
Today, I lend it to you.

69
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,920
 No matter where you are, 

70
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,219
 as long as you see it, you'll no longer be alone. 

71
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,119
You should wipe the honey off your lips first.

72
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:44,500
- Jingzhao Prefecture disregards the law! 
 - Six.

73
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,439
Murdering for money!

74
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,319
When did Floral Haven become yours, where's Mu Dan?

75
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,580
Mu Dan treated you so well, why did you betray her?!

76
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,920
I didn't!

77
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:03,319
Despite breaking the sworn oath, I must sever my ties with you.

78
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,759
From now on, you and I are no longer related.

79
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,110
Sheng Yi, if you aren't doing well,

80
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,210
come back.

81
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,940
 May all those you meet be loyal friends. 

82
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,460
 Never someone like me again. 

83
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,659
Sheng Yi!

84
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,460
- Sheng Yi! 
 - Sheng Yi!

85
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,460
Sheng Yi!

86
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,580
 Mother, Yu Lu, do you see this? 

87
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,380
- Make way! 
 - Make way!

88
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,559
I've heard Floral Haven's cosmetic items are highly praised.

89
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,220
 Princess Ji An invites you to bring these items 

90
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,200
 and go to Xingqing Palace immediately for the nobles to try. 

91
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:06,319
 She's just a slave, yet you use every means to defend her, 

92
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,480
ignoring our past friendship?

93
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,580
What the Princess wants is Zi Shu's affection.

94
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,720
If I marry He Wei Fang, it'll cut off Zi Shu's thoughts of her.

95
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,500
It helps your daughter solve a problem.

96
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,070
The Deputy Transport Officer position's vacant, His Majesty asked me to recommend talents.

97
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,239
I thought to ask Your Highness to help me pick some.

98
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:32,199
If this happy event is gone, I'm afraid the reward will be gone too.

99
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:38,719
You Zhen was harmed by your former love, fearing she may never bear children again.

100
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,459
Your Highness wants me to marry into your family?

101
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:56,079
 If you don't despise my cripple body, I'm willing to marry into Prince Ning Residence. 

102
00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:00,699
You and I will be together forever.

103
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:05,679
 I felt close to Mu Dan once I saw her at the Liu Residence in Luoyang. 

104
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,100
 Over time, I developed affection for her. 

105
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,040
 Grilling wine in the pavilion, drinking joyfully every night. 

106
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,408
 This affection was not born overnight, but developed over time. 

107
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,900
 Throughout the four seasons, the garden heralds a new year. 
   

108
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,939
 Fragrance Garden opens today! 

109
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,260
Da Fu, yours.

110
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,079
So much!

111
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:43,179
- She's got os much. 
 - Madam Sun, yours.

112
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:45,159
- Thank you.
 - Where's mine?

113
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,860
This is Madam Tang's.

114
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,419
- A'Man's.
 - Thank you.

115
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,720
You all have yours.

116
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,819
So heavy.

117
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:53,439
How much did you get?

118
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,239
More than you.

119
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,859
Everyone, since Fragrance Garden opened, our business has been prosperous.

120
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,319
Thank you for your hard work!

121
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:05,419
Today, just enjoy the food and wine.

122
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,220
 Cheers and thank you! 

123
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,519
One more, please.

124
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,100
Sister, drinking is harmful to your health.

125
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,280
You've been busy all day long. Better have this pot of calming tea I made.

126
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,319
Your sister loves to drink.

127
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:28,120
Today is joyful. A few cups won't hurt.

128
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,820
Come on. Eat up. It smells so good.

129
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,939
Try it.

130
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:36,259
These are the pastries you made, right? I'll give it a try.

131
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:39,000
Look, the shopkeeper has prepared so much food for us.

132
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,770
Your skills have indeed improved.

133
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,436
Young Master Liu, make some more for everyone to try.

134
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:48,520
- All right. 
 - Go on.

135
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,880
You are getting better at coaxing kids. Master Wu taught you a lot.

136
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,860
I wasn't coaxing him.

137
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,320
His skills have gotten better and better.

138
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,540
I want to invite a pastry cook from Shangao Pastry Shop to give us some advice,

139
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,760
so we can make a set of flower-themed pastries to sell at Fragrance Garden.

140
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:14,719
Then, I have to try them to see if they're as you say.

141
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:18,160
Save some for others. You eat later.

142
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,180
It'll take some time to make...

143
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,410
Husband, have a piece.

144
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:38,299
Indeed, it's good.

145
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,740
Everyone, enjoy. Drink up.

146
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,639
Come with me.

147
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,439
I'll try some too.

148
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,640
I have things to discuss with everyone later.

149
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,140
I might have to stay overnight.

150
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,180
Why don't you leave first?

151
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,860
Everyone is watching. I can't leave before you.

152
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,520
With you here, they feel constrained.

153
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,719
Just go. I'll explain for you.

154
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,679
Then, I'll leave first.

155
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,959
Madam, don't drink too much,

156
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:27,179
it's bad for your health, and I'll worry.

157
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,679
Got it, just go.

158
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,240
- I'm leaving. 
 - Go on.

159
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,040
I'm really leaving.

160
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,879
- Are you still eating? 
 - So tasty.

161
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,479
I had some. Give it to them.

162
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:45,419
Everyone, let's make another toast!

163
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:47,159
 All right, another toast! 

164
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,340
- Here. 
 - Another toast.

165
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,719
- Drink up and enjoy! 
 - All right, enjoy.

166
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:58,140
You kept us behind. Is there something you need us to do?

167
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:02,900
Jin Niang, this is yours.

168
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,880
Here, Gui'ze.

169
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:12,479
A'Tao, this is yours.

170
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:17,800
   

171
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:24,199
In these months, I've seen all of you dedicating yourselves to Fragrance Garden.

172
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:29,620
A few days ago, I went to the authorities and arranged your release from servitude.

173
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,640
You've been so kind to us. How can we repay your kindness?

174
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,000
What are you doing? Get up, get up.

175
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,579
We're all one family. Don't talk about repayment.

176
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,640
These are your indentures.

177
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,040
The past was bitter, but the future will be better.

178
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,819
From now on, you're no longer servants, but free people.

179
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,120
Madam, we found the missing white jade pearl hairpin in her room.

180
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,819
Now that we caught her red-handed, how do you plan to deal with her?

181
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,640
I moved to Fragrance Garden long ago. That house has always been empty.

182
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,099
What hairpin? I've never seen it before.

183
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,359
If you didn't steal it, did Mu Dan steal it and hide it with you?

184
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,880
Nonsense.

185
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,920
Anyway, if it wasn't you, it was her, or you two conspired it.

186
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:59,000
Go call Master Jiang. Let him see what kind of person he keeps by his side.

187
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,800
Yes.

188
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,120
I was told to marry Young Master Jiang by His Highness.

189
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,640
Now that I caught you stealing, I should deal with it for His Highness.

190
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,199
You framed me. Young Master Jiang won't believe you.

191
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,439
You, a thief, how dare you to slander me!

192
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:21,180
Slap her mouth a hundred times as punishment.

193
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,980
 - Yes.  
 - I didn't do it.

194
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,439
Let go of me! Let go!

195
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,940
Don't touch me. Let me go.

196
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,280
I act with integrity. Come at me directly!

197
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,439
If you dare to frame Mu Dan rashly, it won't just be me bleeding in this room!

198
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:50,859
 Young Master, you must take a good look. 

199
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,920
You…

200
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,070
Wait...

201
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,559
Young Master Jiang, you're finally here. Mu Dan's people stole my jewelry.

202
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:07,640
I was merely asking a few questions and she even attacked me.

203
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,559
It hurts, I'm so scared.

204
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,100
I didn't! You're just making things up!

205
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,040
- Da Fu, Da Fu! 
 - It was you...

206
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:33,280
That's it. Young Master Jiang, you don't believe Lian Zhou, do you?

207
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,180
Lian Zhou…

208
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,520
Of course not.

209
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,779
It's my fault you're caught in such a situation, I'm…

210
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:43,759
It's nothing, just a wound.

211
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,240
Sit down first.

212
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,440
I'm fine, as long as you believe in Mu Dan.

213
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,340
- If you don't believe me… 
 - Sit down.

214
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,239
Can you take care of yourself first?

215
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,280
Your body was inherited from your parents.

216
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,140
If your mother knew about this, she would be heartbroken.

217
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,820
Right. I need to stay here until I'm better.

218
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,719
Be nicer.

219
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,359
Chuan Yu, you're so good to Da Fu, more attentive than to your master.

220
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,240
I've hurt my back, but you didn't care at all.

221
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,440
Naturally, the one who caused your back injury should care.

222
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,800
- Da Fu, Da Fu! 
 - Mu Dan.

223
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,520
- Da Fu, let me see where you're hurt. 
 - Here.

224
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Has the physician been here? Will it leave a scar?

225
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,180
It's all right, I don't care about it at all.

226
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,119
Master Jiang had it checked and gave me imperial medicine. Don't worry.

227
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,300
With such an injury, how can you still smile?

228
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,480
Just a little.

229
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,060
Dou Jin told you everything before you arrived, right?

230
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,800
Don't worry, Chuan Yu applied medicine for me.

231
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,100
Go check on Young Master Jiang's back injury.

232
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:05,119
Your back was hurt by Lian Zhou?

233
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,559
No, it has nothing to do with today.

234
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,900
Chuan Yu, please take good care of Da Fu for me.

235
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,440
Husband, come with me.

236
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,159
I have something to tell you.

237
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,760
Well, Lian Zhou is here because of me.

238
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,079
I'm sorry for that. So, I'm willing to cooperate with you in this act.

239
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,720
But this has nothing to do with Da Fu.

240
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,480
Since Lian Zhou treated Da Fu this way, slandering her and punishing her.

241
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,480
I must seek justice for Da Fu.

242
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,930
- If you want to stop me… 
 - Why would I?

243
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,059
Tell me whatever you need me to do.

244
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,600
No need for that.

245
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,770
Thank you.

246
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,440
You injured your back when you carried me back that night?

247
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:38,159
You remember that night?

248
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,359
I was drunk, not dead. Of course, I remember.

249
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,259
I just drank a bit too much, and only remember a little.

250
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,639
A little is enough. Then, you'll pay the cost of treating the back injury.

251
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,079
Did they really fight?

252
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,839
The door was closed, and there was no sound.

253
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:08,160
But I saw He Wei Fang return to her courtyard with a stern face.

254
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,859
Once she left, Young Master sent someone to inform us

255
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:13,960
that he'll rest in your room tonight.

256
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,159
I knew it. Men are never single-minded.

257
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,240
It seems Jiang Residence will be exclusively for you now.

258
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,100
Add more petals to the water, then light all the incense in the room.

259
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,800
Yes.

260
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,480
Quack physician, can't even cure a few rashes!

261
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,800
Madam, these rashes developed strangely.

262
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,380
I heard that He Wei Fang understands some pharmacology. Maybe she's behind this.

263
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,979
Madam, when Young Master comes, you must ask him to stand up for you.

264
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,259
What time is it?

265
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,119
The hour of Xu*. 
  (*7:00 p.m - 9:00 p.m.) 

266
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:07,319
If Young Master Jiang sees me like this now, how can I win his favor?

267
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,240
Go tell him, I was very happy to hear he was coming,

268
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,319
but I caught a chill while bathing,

269
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,240
and I'm afraid of infecting him, so please don't visit.

270
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Once I recover, I'll go apologize to him.

271
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,940
Yes.

272
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,119
Madam, do you really want to do this?

273
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,879
I've consulted several physicians, they all said they can't cure it.

274
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:45,559
What else can I do but plead with her?

275
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,399
What a humiliation.

276
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:49,760
Haven't I endured enough humiliation already?

277
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,319
What's the harm in enduring it once more?

278
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,440
As long as I can recover my face,

279
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,710
there will be plenty of time to deal with her.

280
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,559
 Sister Mu Dan, could you please meet me? 

281
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,319
 Sister Mu Dan? 

282
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,340
Madam Lian Zhou, what's the matter?

283
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:27,399
After bathing with flowers last night, I was covered in itchy rashes.

284
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:31,960
I know you understand pharmacology. Could you please help me out?

285
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,719
Unfortunately, I heard that Da Fu stole your jewelry, and it's currently under investigation.

286
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:41,200
Without any leads, I don’t have time to deal with it.

287
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,560
 I... I've made a mistake. 

288
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,200
 Miss Zhu Fu didn't steal anything. 

289
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,319
In that case, you falsely accused Da Fu.

290
00:22:54,319 --> 00:23:00,319
How will you compensate for the injury to Da Fu's neck and the wrongs suffered?

291
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,040
 I'll explain to the servants and restore Miss Zhu Fu's innocence. 

292
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,680
That's what you should do. How is that compensation?

293
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,140
Slander deserves a hundred slaps. This is what you said, right?

294
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,900
Then, please count them, Mu Dan, Miss Zhu Fu.

295
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,480
What trick did you use to make her admit her mistake?

296
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,240
Xiao Chun previously extracted a lot of flower juice for the beauty pills.

297
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,680
She discovered that mixing several types of flower juices can cause rashes.

298
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,479
Though there's no danger to life,

299
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:57,680
it can damage one's appearance and cause unbearable itching.

300
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,319
So, I took some and put it in her bathtub.

301
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,599
You framed her for theft, now you deserve what you did.

302
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,680
You need to write a statement of apology and put it in the hall to apologize to Zhu Fu.

303
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:29,680
Okay, I'll write it later. Sister, can you give me the antidote recipe?

304
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:33,119
I don't know your past,

305
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,500
but I can tell you didn't want to marry into this family.

306
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,079
You must have your grievances and helplessness,

307
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,559
so want to secure something at the Jiang Residence to rely on.

308
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,880
It's reasonable and I can understand it.

309
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm focused solely on business and don't want to fight for anything with you.

310
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
If you no longer harm my close friends and family,

311
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,800
we can still live in peace as we did before.

312
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,120
Focused solely on business?

313
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,250
Don't you care about Young Master Jiang's affections?

314
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,280
Sui Zhi and I are mutually in love, so I don't need to fight for anything.

315
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:20,960
Instead of wasting time here, you should treat yourself better.

316
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,560
You!

317
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,939
Don't get upset over a man who doesn't care about you.

318
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:36,280
The madder you get, the harder it'll be for the rashes to subside.

319
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,140
Temper justice with mercy. You're truly something.

320
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:49,300
The world is harsh for us women, why employ tricks to harm each other?

321
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,270
You're the adopted daughter of Prince Ning.

322
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:57,639
Besides your beauty, you must have other remarkable qualities.

323
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:03,528
Is there nothing else you want to do besides pleasing your husband?

324
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:14,680
I have many exceptionally talented women here. They've long escaped the inner chambers.

325
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:22,519
Now, they're all enjoying their lives embroidering, gardening, crafting, and dressing up.

326
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:28,420
If you're interested in gardening, you can come visit my garden.

327
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:35,280
You want me to grow flowers and do business with you?

328
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,680
Anything wrong with that?

329
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,079
You're so strange, married to Floral Envoy,

330
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,780
yet still working hard to earn small amounts of money.

331
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:52,060
I truly don't understand why Young Master Jiang's so devoted to you.

332
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:57,559
What's wrong with earning money? Who would refuse money?

333
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:01,960
Besides, he likes me for having such abilities.

334
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,140
Don't be arrogant.

335
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:09,060
Apply it three times a day, and you'll be cured in seven days.

336
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,399
Think about what I've told you today.

337
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:17,559
If you figure it out, you can come to me anytime.

338
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:46,860
 I truly don't understand why Young Master Jiang's so devoted to you. 

339
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:53,260
 We acted so well that Lian Zhou would say that. 

340
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,520
 Dusk. 

341
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:05,580
   

342
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,680
Oh, no.

343
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,940
Brother Jiang, I toast to you.

344
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,680
They all say the newly appointed Deputy Transport Officer is strict and fair.

345
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,559
Brother Qi, you should drink less.

346
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:36,000
If you come to work with the smell of alcohol tomorrow, I'm afraid you'll get scolded.

347
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:39,399
I didn't have much work before.

348
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:44,439
Since Liu Chang came, he's been strict and fair, showing no mercy at all.

349
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:48,440
We're so busy that we can't even take a break.

350
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,319
Liu Chang is just Prince Ning's live in son-in-law,

351
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,959
and a pedantic scholar from a humble background.

352
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,839
What can he achieve?

353
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,919
He really has high ambitions.

354
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,359
Repairing docks and consolidating fleets.

355
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:09,280
I think he won't stop until he shows Prince Ning some achievements.

356
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,319
Brother Zi Shu is working so hard, is he aiming for promotion or…

357
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,119
Who doesn't want a promotion? But benefits must still be secured.

358
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:25,960
Otherwise, Liu Chang's meager salary cannot support the noble Princess.

359
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,919
Despite complaining, you still diligently follow Zi Shu's lead.

360
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:36,000
Brother Qi, the jade pendant you're wearing today is probably worth a year's salary.

361
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:40,409
It's better to share the joy than enjoy alone.

362
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:42,839
With such a lucrative opportunity,

363
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,599
Brother Qi, why don't you come to my residence tomorrow and tell me?

364
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,780
My pleasure!

365
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,499
I think the jade on Young Master's waist looks even better.

366
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:07,240
A precious jade matches a beauty well.

367
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,960
Thank you, Young Master.

368
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,659
Wait, Young Master Jiang. You promised to give me a bracelet.

369
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:16,159
You mustn't be biased.

370
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:31,810
It's late, just drinking isn't fun.

371
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,410
How about blowing out a few candles?

372
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:43,200
What's the hurry on such a long night? We haven't even finished enjoying the wine.

373
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:49,860
Even if it's just a social, he doesn't have to hold women like this.

374
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:57,879
With what Lian Zhou thinks, she surely hasn't seen Jiang Chang Yang this way.

375
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,580
I knew it. I almost got confused by Lian Zhou.

376
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,879
Jiang Sui Zhi, it's so late. Why haven't you gone home?

377
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:24,340
If you want to drink, I can accompany you.

378
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,240
You're busy with business, yet you surprisingly had time to pick me up today.

379
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,739
Then, of course, I should drink with you.

380
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,919
Brother Qi, pay attention to the business we discussed.

381
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,480
My beloved is picking me up, so I'm leaving.

382
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,539
Brother Sui Zhi, you…

383
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:50,720
Recently, Floral Haven released new sachets. Try it.

384
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,760
The rouge scent from Huanyun Tower is too strong.

385
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,600
With these, you can avoid interrogation from wives and concubines at home.

386
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,220
Right?

387
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,600
Farewell.

388
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,240
What's going on?

389
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,080
You said you'd rescue me at first quarter of Xu Hour, but you arrived at the third.

390
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,440
If you were any later, the candles in the room would've been blown out.

391
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:30,809
I got frightened by Lian Zhou.

392
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:34,840
We acted too well. Lian Zhou truly thinks you've fallen for me.

393
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,319
She even... told me a bunch of strange words.

394
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,440
She should really see your flirtatious behavior today.

395
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,739
Just take what she said as a joke. You didn't take it seriously, did you?

396
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:58,920
Of course, I didn't.

397
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,319
Lian Zhou only sees how good you treat me.

398
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:06,340
She doesn't know that it's because we have a life-and-death friendship.

399
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,559
But, understandably, outsiders wouldn't understand

400
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,499
why a high-ranking official treat a small merchant so well?

401
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,240
Over the years,

402
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:28,800
I've seen a lot of intrigues in officialdom and the pretenses between people.

403
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,680
Someone as honest and open-minded as you is rare.

404
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,280
Of course, I would treat you sincerely.

405
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,019
Are you drunk? Why are you suddenly praising me?

406
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,620
Making me feel quite embarrassed.

407
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,559
You're this type of person, so you deserves others' kindness.

408
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,419
Moreover, you also treat me well.

409
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,750
You said before,

410
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:05,690
it's hard to find a soulmate. There's no need to always express gratitude.

411
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,920
It makes us seem distant.

412
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,979
You treat me sincerely, I'll never let you down as a soulmate.

413
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:18,319
From now on, in my heart, besides Da Fu and Xiao Chun,

414
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:21,560
you're my most important person.

415
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,639
If you need help, just tell me.

416
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:33,240
Jiang Xiao Hua, we're soulmates, and I only rank third in your heart?

417
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,959
Naturally, besties are more important.

418
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:54,390
Here.

419
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,219
- Take the prescription to get the medicine. 
 - Thank you.

420
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:07,760
Have all the gifts from clients been returned?

421
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,080
Madam Luo, who came before, embroidered this handkerchief to show her gratitude.

422
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,080
This isn't any precious item, and with your name,

423
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,459
so I decided to keep it.

424
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,160
Her eye condition just improved. She shouldn't do such taxing things. 
    

425
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,639
When she comes next, I'll give her a good talking to.

426
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,039
Please call the next person.

427
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,639
Yes.

428
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:46,539
Father.

429
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,839
Young Master Liu, remember.

430
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:55,319
Spring is not yet full, and crops are already growing. That's Qin.

431
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,459
I taught your sister like this, too.

432
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,270
   

433
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,900
Right.

434
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,910
Young Master Liu, you're holding the brush wrong again.

435
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:20,280
Look, hold the brush like this,

436
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,519
only then will the strokes you write be proper.

437
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,519
See? Here, try again.

438
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,760
Yes.

439
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,200
Combine these two. Move this back.

440
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,719
Okay, try it now.

441
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:37,360
Find the feeling.

442
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,390
Not bad. Right.

443
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,960
Go further down.

444
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,500
Mu Dan.

445
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:51,860
Why are you here at this hour?

446
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,760
- Continue. 
 - You helped Consort Shu recuperate for a while, and she's improved a lot.

447
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,080
Before returning to the palace, she asked me to give you this painting.

448
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,599
To thank you for your companionship during this time.

449
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:06,870
She paid me for those medicinal herbs and supplies.

450
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,670
Why is Consort Shu so polite?

451
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:20,720
You often ride with Consort Shu. Your polo skills must have improved a lot.

452
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,519
Of course, do you dare compete with me someday?

453
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:28,160
How bold, do you dare bet on it?

454
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,080
Isn't the interest you've collected from me enough? Want to swindle me for more?

455
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,759
Don't even think about it.

456
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:36,280
Consort Shu has given you her well-bred horse.

457
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,540
With a fine horse, are you still afraid to lose?

458
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,919
Consort Shu has never looked down on me because of my rank.

459
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:47,139
She treats me well.

460
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:52,120
Now that she has returned, it's not as comfortable or free.

461
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,760
Could you persuade His Majesty to visit her more often?

462
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,359
At least let her see her child more often.

463
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,879
Don't worry, Consort Shu has been away from the palace for a while.

464
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:05,740
His Majesty also misses her greatly and will surely treat her well.

465
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,890
Sister, I've written another character, please check if it's correct.

466
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,530
   

467
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:17,280
I never taught you this character, how did you learn it?

468
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,039
I've been observing Fragrant Garden's plaque every day,

469
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,399
so I learned to write it.

470
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:28,560
Young Master Liu is smart. I'll teach you another character then.

471
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
The Garden in Fragrance Garden.

472
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,740
Here.

473
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:44,919
I'll write the outer part.

474
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:50,239
Give it a try.

475
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:54,560
Young Master Liu is clever,

476
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,680
but Mu Dan is busy with business and can't teach you every day.

477
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,860
How about I find you a private tutor?

478
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:07,640
I don't want any tutor, having Sister teach me is enough.

479
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,219
I only like to cook, and I'm not cut out for studying or being an official.

480
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,760
Becoming an official isn't the only path to success.

481
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,839
If you like cooking, I can hire a restaurant chef for you.

482
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,640
Learn from him for a few years, and then you can open your own restaurant.

483
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,680
I…

484
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,479
I heard that Prosperity House's Chef Xue plans to take on an apprentice this year.

485
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:34,680
Really? That would be great.

486
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,479
Do you know him? Could you introduce him?

487
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:40,280
I can take Young Master Liu to visit him.

488
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,180
No problem.

489
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,439
Sister, I've heard Floral Envoy enjoys painting the beauties of Huanyun Tower.

490
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:52,080
Can you have Floral Envoy paint one of us?

491
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,340
Asking me to paint. Shouldn't you come ask me?

492
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:05,160
I'm not worthy of speaking to you,

493
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,519
so I can only ask Sister.

494
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,120
Young Master Liu, you have to respect yourself.

495
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,460
No matter what you want, you mustn't belittle yourself.

496
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,270
Do you understand?

497
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Understood.

498
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,980
I'm available today and in a good mood, so I'll paint one.

499
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:39,410
This painting is titled "Young Master Liu Admiring the Love of Mu Dan and Chang Yang."

500
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,319
Where's Young Master Liu?

501
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,840
This is a painting technique. He's not in the painting,

502
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,220
but viewing them from across.

503
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,879
This painting is nice hanging here.

504
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:55,080
All guests will know our deep affection in the future.

505
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,800
Mu Dan, something happened to Xiao Chun.

506
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:10,020


507
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:18,990
 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining 

508
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:26,264
♫  On the endless road to Chang'an, 
 the zither and lute's melody echoes from afar  ♫

509
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:34,578
♫  Plum and willow trees greet the Spring, 
 as splendor returns this year  ♫

510
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:42,770
♫  Copper battlements shine as songs, dances, and glasses fill the palace air  ♫

511
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:51,022
♫  Idle clouds and drifting duckweed, with a thousand flowers blooming  ♫

512
00:41:51,022 --> 00:41:59,219
♫  Time flows gracefully, with moments gathering in the fading mist  ♫

513
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:07,506
♫  Let the years pass, carried by the wind toward long-held desires  ♫

514
00:42:07,506 --> 00:42:15,922
♫  If the heart remains as still as water, youth becomes eternal  ♫

515
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:24,022
♫  Still cherishing the moon of my hometown, yearning to meet again  ♫

516
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:51,974
♫  The distant night sky, scattered with stars, reflects the gentle moon  ♫

517
00:42:51,974 --> 00:42:59,425
♫  The peony's exquisite beauty fills the fragrant garden  ♫

518
00:42:59,425 --> 00:43:07,511
♫  With my heart as a lantern, I fear not the journey through distant mountain paths  ♫

519
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:15,820
♫  The jade flute's music fills a fleeting life with meaning  ♫

520
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:24,082
♫  Time flows gracefully, with moments gathering in the fading mist  ♫

521
00:43:24,082 --> 00:43:32,338
♫  Let the years pass, carried by the wind toward long-held desires  ♫

522
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:40,766
♫  If the heart remains as still as water, youth becomes eternal  ♫

523
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:48,866
♫  Still cherishing the moon of my hometown, yearning to meet again  ♫
