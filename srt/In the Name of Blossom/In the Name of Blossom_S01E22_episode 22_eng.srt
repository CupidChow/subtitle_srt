1
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:40,000
 

2
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,439
Fresh lamb for sale! Its aroma wafts for miles.

3
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,239
Take a look. You can try it.

4
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,239
It's dark and cloudy. It might start snowing soon.

5
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,359
Let's buy the dates for Fu and hurry back.

6
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,799
Come, have a taste. Take a look.

7
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,880
Fresh fruits and vegetables.

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,160
My lady.

9
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,960
I'll wait here. Be quick.

10
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,439
Yes, ma'am.

11
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,360
Be careful.

12
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,000
Who sent you all here?

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,520
You purposely sent my guard away.
What are you trying to do?

14
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
How did you know?

15
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,439
A thief after money wouldn't ignore my purse

16
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,120
and steal my token of love.

17
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,080
Since you sensed trouble,
why did you send your guard away anyway?

18
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,719
I'm your target.

19
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:59,080
If one plan fails, there's always another.

20
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,960
You're truly clever, Miss. It's a pity.

21
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,840
If you don't want bloodshed, come quietly with us.

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,640
Move. To the left.

23
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:33,879
Brave men, is your employer surnamed Liu or...?

24
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:41,040
A mere merchant dared to threaten an official.
You should've seen this coming.

25
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,599
So it's Magistrate Du.

26
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:50,480
Speak. Where are the stolen goods hidden?

27
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,639
I would love to tell you,
but you can't verify the truth if I tell you now.

28
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,240
Why not let me take you there myself?

29
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,599
Don't play tricks. Just talk.

30
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,719
Lie, and you'll get a new hole in you.

31
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,160
But if I talk now, I'll die faster.

32
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,279
Brave men, how much is Magistrate Du paying you?

33
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,720
I can double it.

34
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,439
Our profession has rules, Ms. Feng.
Save your breath.

35
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,600
Confess cleanly, and you'll suffer less.

36
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,399
But aren't you here for money?

37
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:38,439
Just take my money
and tell Magistrate Du I'm dead.

38
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,480
I'll never show up again. How about that?

39
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,160
Boss, the client won't check
the body. We can just...

40
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Rules can't be broken.

41
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,119
Chase her!

42
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Open the door.

43
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Over there.

44
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,520
Open the door.

45
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,199
Open the door.

46
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,360
Open the door.

47
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,720
Open the door.

48
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,960
After reuniting, the first thing Xiao Hua does
is try to murder her husband?

49
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,600
How ruthless!

50
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:06,360
Your skills have improved so much.
Did you learn from Chuan Yu?

51
00:08:10,944 --> 00:08:14,519
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫ 

52
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,000
Jiang Chang Yang, you're alive.

53
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,004
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫ 

54
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,600
I'm not dreaming.

55
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,519
No, I didn't die.

56
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,022
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫ 

57
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:40,928
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫

 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫

 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

Let's go home.

63
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:26,723
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫ 

64
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,643

 ♫ Flowers bloom and fall ultimately to oneself ♫ 

67
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,799
You were stabbed through the heart.
What happened afterward?

68
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,959
How did you survive?

69
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:34,400
Prince Ning deliberately missed
by half an inch that day.

70
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,679
Prince Ning intentionally spared your life.

71
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,840
He wanted to know how many hidden agents
and secrets His Majesty and I had

72
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,000
over these years.

73
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,340
I was unconscious for a long time.

74
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,080
After waking, Prince Ning treated me well

75
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,120
and promised to release me if I cooperated.

76
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,039
I knew I needed a full recovery
to prepare for the future,

77
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,520
so I pretended to negotiate with him.

78
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,600
 I told him I had hidden guards
who could travel a hundred miles daily 

79
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,479
 and their hideouts were known only to me. 

80
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,240
 You didn't lie. Carrier pigeons can indeed
fly a hundred miles daily. 

81
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,120
 Red-footed carrier pigeons were my summons. 

82
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,559
 Carrier pigeons. 

83
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:37,040
 Wherever my hidden guards were in the city,
they'd see this signal by looking up. 

84
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:45,280
 Mr. Third would also know
I'm alive upon seeing it. 

85
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,120
 How could Prince Ning tolerate
being tricked like this? 

86
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,759
 Did they torture you? 

87
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,559
 Ci. 

88
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,199
 They threw a few punches. I'm tough, no harm done. 

89
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,000
Soon after, Mr. Third found an excuse
to summon Prince Ning to the palace.

90
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,320
Yun Niang's team rescued me during the night
when his mansion was leaderless.

91
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,080
After regrouping my forces,
I immediately set out for Hedong.

92
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,639
I learned you weren't with the Xiao family
but went to see Auntie,

93
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,839
so I rushed here to meet you.

94
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,120
Were your injuries severe?

95
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,040
No.

96
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,799
Your chest was pierced through. You almost died.

97
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,799
Then you endured torture.

98
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:08,256
If not severe, you'd have rushed here
immediately after escaping.

99
00:13:09,216 --> 00:13:13,679
A fast horse to Hedong would take over ten days.

100
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,079
Yet you've only just arrived now.

101
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,479
Nothing escapes Xiao Hua's notice.

102
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,760
Let me see your wound.

103
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,519
It's been a long time.
Isn't it improper to undress upon meeting?

104
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,479
Do as I say. Let me see it so I can be at ease.

105
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,920
It's all in the past. The pain has long subsided.

106
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,039
Back then, I kept thinking of you.

107
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:49,240
Holding onto the thought
that we'd reunite someday made it bearable.

108
00:14:50,480 --> 00:15:00,039
But you witnessed me die.
It must have been unbearable for you.

109
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,880
What's past no longer matters.
What matters most is our future.

110
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:21,280
From now on, we'll never be apart.

111
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:31,439
Jiang Chang Yang, rest assured.
I will protect you no matter what.

112
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,159
As your husband, I'm now penniless
yet still leading a group of hidden guards.

113
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:47,400
I'll have to rely on your support from now on.

Prince Ning sent covert searchers.

135
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,359
To prevent him from finding out I'm in Hedong,

136
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,599
I've divided my men into multiple groups,
each containing a decoy impersonating me.

137
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:38,160
They're heading to territories governed
by military governors who allied with Prince Ning.

138
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,279
You aim to divert Prince Ning's attention
and sow distrust among his allies.

139
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,799
That's one purpose.

140
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:48,639
Over the years, I've uncovered numerous
dark secrets of various military governors.

141
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,640
All are Prince Ning's associates.
Yours isn't among them.

142
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,520
My father and I fear no investigations.

143
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,720
This evidence can trigger internal conflicts
in Shuo Fang and Fan Yang.

144
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,319
Once they turn against each other,
they'll have no capacity to aid Prince Ning.

145
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,000
No wonder my father constantly praises you.

146
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,440
You sure are cunning and resourceful.

147
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,000
General, you should read
beyond military strategies occasionally.

148
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,079
General, Ms. Feng requests an audience.

149
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,760
- Please, let her in.
- Yes.

150
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,879
General Yu.

151
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,928
The goods have been inventoried and stored.

152
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:30,200
As Winter approaches,

153
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,799
inform me promptly
if you require additional supplies.

154
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,440
I can arrange one more shipment
before the river freezes.

155
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,000
On the day Sui Zhi fled,

156
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,559
he sent someone to inventory
Prince Ning's weaponry workshop.

157
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,160
I've compiled a list cross-referencing
Prince Ning's military forces.

158
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,440
It contains some rare items.
I'll have to trouble you with this, my lady.

159
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,280
Rest assured, General.
I'll find every item for you.

160
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,240
Mr. Jiang, dinner is ready.

161
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,040
It's been days since we reunited.
Why are you still looking at me like that?

162
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:38,920
When I sparred with She Yan before,
we always tied.

163
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,656
But in the final match,
he sacrificed his life for you,

164
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:45,024
yet I failed to protect Madam.

165
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:50,919
Please punish me, Mr. Jiang.

166
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,720
Rise. All lives hold equal value.

167
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,520
I never wanted any of you
to trade your lives to save others.

168
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,640
Get up quickly now.

169
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,160
Now you're my future brother-in-law
and Jiang Chang Yang's relative by marriage.

170
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,640
Don't speak such formal words between us anymore.

171
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,960
Come on, sit down.

172
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,920
Mu Dan is right.

173
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,720
I heard you postponed marrying Fu
during my mourning period.

174
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,800
Once this settles down, return to Chang'an
and propose your marriage to Ms. Sun immediately.

175
00:20:43,957 --> 00:20:47,064
 

176
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,200
This is cold. I'll heat
fresh food for you tonight.

177
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,720
This can be used for firewood. Let's go.

178
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,599
Don't think you can gloss this over.

179
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,800
Why would you pick such a terrible name for me?

180
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:15,760
You know, you said the same words
to me in my dreams.

181
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,800
Do I often appear in your dreams?

182
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,960
What else did I say in the dream?

183
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,880
You were just as shameless as you are now,

184
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,520
always saying things
I didn't want to hear to provoke me.

185
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,079
Where are they?

186
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:56,039
Ladies, Chuan Yu
went to deliver goods to the warehouse.

187
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,359
I haven't seen the shopkeeper.

188
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,119
I heard Madam Feng wept
when the shopkeeper returned.

189
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,920
Then the shopkeeper retreated to her room
and hasn't come out since.

190
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,720
Thank you.

191
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:13,520
Perhaps visiting Hedong
stirred up painful memories?

192
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,960
Let's go.

193
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:25,000
Whenever I dreamt of you,
you always told me to forget you.

194
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,039
I would answer "Fine."

195
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:33,399
If you want me to forget you,
then cut out my heart.

196
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Because you've already taken root in my heart.

197
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,480
Only by removing my heart
could I possibly forget you.

198
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,200
Every time I woke up,
I thought your soul had entered my dreams.

199
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,039
Otherwise, why would the dream version of you
be as stubborn as the real you?

200
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:10,208
Mu Dan, did Fu and Chun not
speak with you these past months?

201
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,680
Jiang Chang Yang, are you saying I talk too much?

202
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,559
I wouldn't dare.

203
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:24,520
When I was unconscious,
you kept me company through dreams.

204
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,800
Wait, Jiang Chang Yang. I have more questions.

205
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Why did you lie about the jade comb?

206
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,960
Auntie told me that she didn't give it to you.

207
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,879
I know everything now.

208
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Mu Dan.

209
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,359
Fu, Chun, don't be afraid.

210
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,039
This matter is a bit difficult to explain
at the moment.

211
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:03,480
In short, Jiang Chang Yang isn't dead. He's back.

212
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,520
I have a shadow. I'm a living person.

213
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,079
You're not dead! You're alive!

214
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,559
That's wonderful!

215
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,759
Does Chuan Yu know?

216
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,759
If Chuan Yu saw Mr. Jiang, he'd be overjoyed.

217
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,720
He knows. He has been thrilled
throughout the entire journey.

218
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,359
But Mr. Jiang, you look unwell.
Have you not fully recovered yet? Let me...

219
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:31,079
No need. It's just fatigue from travel.

220
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:34,400
That's right, Jiang Chang Yang,
you've been hiding your injuries from me.

221
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,759
Fu, grab him!

222
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,640
Chun, check his pulse.

223
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,000
Wait... Fu... Fu.

224
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,119
- Come on.
- I'll help too.

225
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,640
Chuan Yu, you...

226
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,599
Hold your master properly!

227
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,319
Chuan Yu, he's not dead.

228
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,359
The Dongqing Festival is approaching.

229
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,640
The military is busy
with drills and various affairs.

230
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,520
I've decided to postpone it for a year.
We'll resume after eliminating critical threats.

231
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,400
When the Dongqing Festival was first established,

232
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,759
it was to honor the Hedong Army's bravery
in defending the borders.

233
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,799
It hasn't been a year
since the Grand General's passing.

234
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,759
We should make it grander in commemoration.

235
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:20,359
My father never cared about posthumous fame.

236
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,359
He only wished for Hedong's people
to live prosperously.

237
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,879
The people don't know court dangers,
but the Grand General was widely respected.

238
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,839
If we suddenly cancel the Dongqing Festival,
it might raise suspicions.

239
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:44,440
Moreover, when sending the Hedong Army back,
Prince Ning planted spies.

240
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,960
They're still hidden in the city.

241
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,359
Any anomaly in Hedong
would make Prince Ning suspicious.

242
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:59,359
You're right. Then, let's proceed
with the Dongqing Festival as usual.

243
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,240
Please come in, everyone.

244
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,440
How have you been lately?

245
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,319
All is well, thank you.

246
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,119
Fellow townspeople, on this Dongqing day,

247
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,279
let's toast to good fortune for all. Cheers!

248
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,919
Well said!

249
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,000
Here, put this here.

250
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,800
Min, eat up.

251
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:13,152
 

252
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:24,305
 

253
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,400
Yun Niang wrote.
Our old friends in Chang'an are well.

254
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,839
Li Xing has changed,
he now knows measured responses at court

255
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,319
and is no longer confronting
Prince Ning's faction head-on.

256
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,240
Fortunately, he was knocked out that day,
or he'd have been slaughtered.

257
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:42,119
Jiang Chang Yang, don't you think the lanterns
tonight are especially numerous and bright?

258
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:50,720
On the Dongqing Festival,
people keep all lights burning through the night

259
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,880
to commemorate the Hedong soldiers
who sacrificed their lives in battle.

260
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,880
I wonder how long these peaceful days will last.

261
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,359
If a war is inevitable,
I hope the people won't be affected.

262
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,599
The Hedong Army under your support
has grown strong and well-equipped.

263
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:09,079
The people and the Hedong Army
work together as one.

264
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:14,480
With geographical advantages and unity,
we won't let Prince Ning's ambitions succeed.

265
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,759
Tomorrow's worries belong to tomorrow.

266
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:22,040
Tonight, let's savor this wonderful moment. Come.

267
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:31,234
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

268
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:39,648
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

269
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:47,319
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

270
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:50,119
Don't be afraid. Come on.

271
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,559
Would you like a sugar figure?

272
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,519
- Sugar figure?
- Do you want one?

273
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,599
We'll take one.

274
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:58,119
Please make figures of both of us.

275
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,576
It's fine.

276
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:20,480
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

277
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,760
This mask is so heavy.

278
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:27,919
Look! It's done.

279
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Here you go.

280
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,280
Thank you.

281
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,079
Thank you.

282
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,520
Take care.

283
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Here.

284
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,559
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

285
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,359
No one's here. We can take off the mask.

286
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:53,957
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫ 

287
00:30:53,957 --> 00:31:02,266
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫ 

288
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:10,528
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

289
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:18,784
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

290
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:27,212
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

291
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:35,212
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

292
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,960
Close doors and windows.
Guard against fire and theft.

293
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:54,039
Close doors and windows.
Guard against fire and theft.

294
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:59,159
I wish we could keep walking like this forever.
But there's a curfew.

295
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:07,159
With this, the curfew can't stop us.

296
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:15,480
But you're returning to Jizhou tomorrow.
Won't staying up all night be tiring?

297
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,480
It's a rare occasion. Besides, I can rest
in the carriage during the long journey.

298
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:37,240
Walking under the moonlit night,
admiring lanterns, what joy!

299
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:03,440
Jiang Chang Yang went to Hedong anyway.

300
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,200
He also incited the rebellions
in Shuo Fang and Fan Yang.

301
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,440
It seems he and Yu Zheng
are determined to fight me to the death.

302
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:26,760
The military strength of Hedong is formidable now.
Your Highness must decide soon.

303
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,799
Although Fan Yang and Shuo Fang

304
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:39,359
are close to Hedong,
their troops aren't as abundant.

305
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,639
It's time to deploy the Xiao family card.

306
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,519
If only Hexi sends troops,
our chances of victory are slim.

307
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,839
Though Jiannan is remote,
its Military Governor pledges loyalty to you.

308
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,879
Why not give him a chance to prove his worth?

309
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,319
Good. Send word that we'll wait no longer.

310
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,520
It's time to make the final move.

311
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,280
Yes.

312
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,160
Urgent military report
from six hundred miles away in Hedong.

313
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,760
The Hedong Army has rebelled.
Their crimes are unforgivable.

314
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,008
Your Majesty, please make a swift decision.

315
00:34:27,008 --> 00:34:30,272
 

316
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,880
Your Majesty, I request
to lead troops personally into battle.

317
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,399
I will not return to court
until these bandits are eradicated.

318
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,479
I will accompany Prince Ning to the battlefield.
Please grant us your permission, Your Majesty.

319
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,720
Ning leads by example,
setting a standard for all ministers.

320
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:07,639
I shall await your triumphant return
here in Chang'an.

321
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:12,439
I will not fail your trust, Your Majesty.

322
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,039
These over 4,000 shields are fire-resistant.

323
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:25,280
They can withstand Prince Ning's
fifty barrels of black fire oil.

324
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,400
General, this bow is made of mulberry wood.

325
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,519
Its bowstring comes
from silkworms fed on mulberry leaves.

326
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,119
Each string uses over 20 silk threads as its core.

327
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:43,480
Is there anything you cannot acquire?

328
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,159
The Hedong Army is fortunate
to have your assistance.

329
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,400
You flatter me, General.

330
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,760
The rainy spring this year requires caution.
These bows are susceptible to mold.

331
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,519
Please store them near charcoal fires for drying.

332
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,319
I see.

333
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,839
Prince Ning has mobilized his troops.

334
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,079
Be vigilant on the battlefield.

335
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,320
Rest assured. I'll protect myself.

336
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,879
Close combat is chaotic.
Do not overexert yourself despite your skills.

337
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:30,600
Wait for my return. We'll marry immediately after.

338
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,199
If we do not return victorious,
take Auntie by boat to Xinluo immediately.

339
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:46,000
Ugh! Don't speak such ill-omened words!

340
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,840
This armor from Mu Dan is quite tough.

341
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,360
Auntie, don't hurt your hands.

342
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,240
Still making jokes.
If you dare to die again, just you wait!

343
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,879
I understand.

344
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,360
You once coveted everything except your own life.

345
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,760
Now that you have me, you should cling to life.

346
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,200
Mu Dan knows me best.

347
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,080
I'm off.

348
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,960
Military Governor of Hedong Yu Zheng.

349
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,199
Military Governor of Hedong Yu Zheng.

350
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:13,719
Raising troops in rebellion
is a betrayal of your duty as a subject.

351
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:17,559
Raising troops in rebellion
is a betrayal of your duty as a subject.

352
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:21,920
By the imperial court's decree...

353
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,440
By the imperial court's decree...

354
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,639
I lead the Central Army,
Hexi Army, and Jiannan Army

355
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,960
to suppress the rebels.

356
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,360
To suppress the rebels.

357
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,360
Surrender now!

358
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,640
Surrender now!

359
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,039
What hypocrisy!

360
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,000
What hypocrisy!

361
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,559
The Hedong Army
has guarded the frontier for years.

362
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:55,119
The Hedong Army
has guarded the frontier for years.

363
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,079
We serve the country with loyalty.

364
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:59,199
We serve the country with loyalty.

365
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,719
We have never harbored rebellious intentions.

366
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,960
We have never harbored rebellious intentions.

367
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,079
Today, we would rather die for our country.

368
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,760
Today, we would rather die for our country.

369
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,639
Than bow to treacherous officials.

370
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,399
Than bow to treacherous officials.

371
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,720
Fine!

372
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,240
Attack!

373
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,839
Release arrows.

374
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:11,519
Defensive formation!

375
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:47,542
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

376
00:41:48,596 --> 00:41:55,956
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

377
00:41:55,956 --> 00:42:04,148
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

378
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:12,500
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫ 

379
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:20,697
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

380
00:42:20,697 --> 00:42:28,884
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

381
00:42:28,884 --> 00:42:37,300
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

382
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:45,300
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

383
00:43:05,268 --> 00:43:13,452
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫ 

384
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:20,903
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

385
00:43:20,903 --> 00:43:28,889
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫ 

386
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:37,198
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫ 

387
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:45,460
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

388
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:53,716
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

389
00:43:53,716 --> 00:44:02,144
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

390
00:44:02,144 --> 00:44:10,144
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
