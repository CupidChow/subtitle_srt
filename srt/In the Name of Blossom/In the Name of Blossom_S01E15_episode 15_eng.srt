1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,050


2
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,978
     

3
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:39,900
   

4
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:59,070
   

5
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:10,390
   

6
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,999
Shopkeeper.

7
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:30,860
   

8
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,399
In the past, I was capricious.

9
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:36,719
Thank you for being so benevolent and loyal,
never abandoning this place.

10
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,939
I am grateful and will surely
not let everyone down again.

11
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:49,160
The contracts for Huamanzhu and Qingshuzhai, as well as the pawnshop receipts are all here untouched.

12
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,279
I have discussed it with Chun and Fu.

13
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:54,539
Mu Dan, you are still our shopkeeper.

14
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,819
After returning from this journey, I am renewed.

15
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,640
I will definitely lead this business
to greater success with everyone.

16
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,419
- Great.
- Yeah!

17
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:14,160
Like everyone here, I have endured hardships
and received kindness from others.

18
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,559
That's why I have the opportunity to stand here.

19
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:18,900
Now, our days are getting better and better.

20
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,160
I do not wish to be a useless person.

21
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,779
I want to be worthy
of these characters His Majesty granted.

22
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:31,040
Whether it's an unknown woman,
a craftsman, or a merchant,

23
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,719
as long as they can help the weak,
stabilize society, and serve the nation,

24
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,020
they will not have wasted their prime years
and should be a national beauty.

25
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,040
Everyone here is like family to me.

26
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,059
I want to tell everyone
that my aspirations have changed.

27
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:47,920
I hope you all can support me and join me.

28
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,480
But how can people as insignificant as we
with little possessions serve the country?

29
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,740
The flowers we grow can be used as medicine,
and the money we earn can help the poor.

30
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,379
Accumulating small acts of kindness
is how we can serve the country.

31
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:07,099
Mu Dan, you are the shopkeeper, and you need not
consult with us on whatever you do.

32
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,700
But Mu Dan treats us as her own and informs us.

33
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,339
Of course, we're willing to follow the shopkeeper.

34
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:16,299
In the future, the shop and Fragrance Garden
will operate as usual.

35
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:20,020
The money used for charitable deeds
will all be deducted from my personal account.

36
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,099
Your monthly pay will not be reduced at all.

37
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:26,379
Once the new business is established, when I need your help,

38
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:29,140
I will also distribute payment according to labor.

39
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,659
I believe Mu Dan will not let everyone down.

40
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,700
But shopkeeper, you have endured
so many hardships along this journey.

41
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,079
Will all your hard-earned money
be used to help others?

42
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:44,700
I am concerned for you.
It's impractical to suffer for a good reputation.

43
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,739
I am not a sage.
What I do is not solely for others.

44
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,520
Madam, your family once had fertile land,
which was later seized by officials.

45
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,539
You had no choice but to take your son
to work for wealthy merchants and officials.

46
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:05,260
When your eldest son accidentally
broke the magistrate's porcelain,

47
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,480
the owner demanded compensation,
but he couldn't pay.

48
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,140
Then the magistrate falsely accused him of theft.

49
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,900
The separation of you and your son to this day
is all due to corrupt officials in power.

50
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:20,319
Everyone, only when society improves,

51
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,319
can our lives get better and better.

52
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:29,920
Only then can everyone have the leisure to enjoy
the useless beauty of peonies in Fragrance Garden.

53
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,260
I see it now. I am with you, Shopkeeper.

54
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:40,779
When the world gets better in the future,
my son will definitely come back.

55
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,580
I am also with you, Shopkeeper.

56
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,439
- I'm with you, too.
- I'm in, too.

57
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,299
Thank you, everyone.

58
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,179
Any update on the new shop?

59
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:58,319
We've already chosen a place in the West Market.

60
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,820
Are you sure about this? Chang'an is not
short of medical clinics or pharmacies.

61
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,999
How will your shop compete with them?

62
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:12,099
Nowadays, it is quite expensive
for common people to use medicine.

63
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:15,099
People can afford to see a doctor,
but they can't afford to buy medicine.

64
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,539
So, I have studied
ancient prescriptions with Chun.

65
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:21,079
We have found some medicinal herbs
with the same efficacy, which cost less,

66
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,140
and have drafted new prescriptions.

67
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,360
Meanwhile, we will also provide
free medical consultations every ten days.

68
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,600
As for the medicinal herbs,
they will be sold at cost price.

69
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,679
Families in difficulty can also buy on credit.

70
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:37,779
The planting and transportation,
storage and sale of medicinal herbs

71
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,940
are different from the flowers you deal with.

72
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,119
The expenses in Sheng County are not small either.
Is your capital sufficient?

73
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,720
Do you want to invest money to help me?

74
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,720
This benefits the people and serves the country,
so I certainly should contribute my share.

75
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,040
Since it is doing good deeds,
how can I use other people's money?

76
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,299
Rest assured.

77
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:01,360
Now my shop has considerable income,
enough to support it.

78
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,299
Besides, doing business is what I am good at.

79
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,140
You should save your strength for the court.

80
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,260
With Mr. Third, money will surely be needed.

81
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,960
Alright.

82
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:28,419
In Sheng County, collecting the herbs
from the mountains is not a long-term solution.

83
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:30,659
Do you have other plans?

84
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,119
Upon leaving Sheng County,
I took a few clever villagers with me.

85
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,239
I taught them how to grow medicinal materials.

86
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:39,040
Besides that, sesame and rapeseed,

87
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,239
which can be used as both medicine and food
should also be grown.

88
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:45,720
The people of Chang'an love eating Hu cakes.

89
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,419
Sprinkling sesame on top adds flavor,
and we certainly won't lack buyers.

90
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,460
You want the Hu cake yourself, don't you?
Pretending to act for the public good.

91
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,659
As if you don't like it yourself.

92
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:02,480
Coming from someone who always put
several pieces of cake in the mutton soup.

93
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,339
As for the young and strong men,

94
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:08,280
besides farming and cultivating medicinal herbs,
they can also escort goods.

95
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,060
I also found several properties
that were lying idle

96
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,940
and converted them into workshops for women.

97
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:19,410
Chun, Ms. Sun, A Man, and I will
personally teach everyone the skills.

98
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,580
See, you have to scrape it
to look something like this.

99
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:29,759
Turn it like this, right.
Put a little force, put a little force.

100
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,040
You're pulling it too tight here.
It can be a bit looser on this side.

101
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,579
In Sheng County, do you plan to open a clinic?

102
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,559
Of course, I will.

103
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:42,459
It is inherently difficult
for poor people to see a doctor.

104
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:44,819
If there are no doctors in this county,

105
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:47,779
one would have to come to Chang'an for treatment.

106
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,120
Even if the body can endure the long journey,

107
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,220
food and accommodation
would then be a significant expense.

108
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,340
However, those with excellent medical skills
mostly do not wish to go to remote places.

109
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,020
Who can sit in the medical hall of Sheng County?

110
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,560
I plan to find two apprentice doctors, like Chun,
who have a passion for medicine, to be there.

111
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,359
This way, they can train themselves,
improve their medical skills,

112
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:14,620
and alleviate the difficulties
of the common people.

113
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,980
Of course, these measures can only
be used for common minor illnesses.

114
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,920
When it comes to complicated diseases,

115
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,059
I have already instructed my caravan
to prepare fast horses,

116
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:25,559
so Chun can go and treat everyone.

117
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,040
You have thought this through.

118
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,559
The medical hall in Sheng County provides
free consultations, only charging for medicine.

119
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,140
If a patient has no money,

120
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,659
their family or they themselves after recovery
can offer labor in exchange.

121
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:45,779
How do you determine if someone is truly poor
or just wants to take advantage?

122
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,299
I have asked Magistrate Yu to draft
a list of impoverished households in this county.

123
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:53,000
Whether it is true or false,
one glance will reveal it.

124
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,400
Since consultations are free, didn't you
think about waiving the medicine fees too?

125
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,620
A peck of rice brings gratitude,
but a dou of rice brings hatred.

126
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,000
A foolishly benevolent person
will only foster others' greed.

127
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,120
Furthermore, the enterprise of aiding the nation
needs to be sustainable.

128
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,800
If losses are incurred everywhere,
it is hard to sustain.

129
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,779
Moreover, if I do not take a single cent,
it would disrupt the industry's norms.

130
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,959
In the end, it would only
bring unnecessary trouble.

131
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,860
You are so clear-headed and astute.
I have indeed overthought.

132
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,959
It's a pity Mr. Third is not here. If he were,
he would certainly be very pleased.

133
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,439
He might eat two more big bowls of rice.

134
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:39,699
Rest assured.

135
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,979
I will do my utmost within my capabilities.

136
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:45,679
As for the court,
it depends on you and His Majesty.

137
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:51,359
I hope you can eradicate treacherous ministers
and eliminate harsh policies soon.

138
00:10:54,364 --> 00:11:01,438
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

139
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:09,952
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

140
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:17,960
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

141
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,579
Please come inside, sir.

142
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,860
The prescription has already been prepared.

143
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,340
As long as the medicine is taken on time,
the child will surely get better.

144
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,160
- Thank you, Doctor. 
 - Please, quickly rise.

145
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,120
Shopkeeper, the Village Chief
of Sheng County is waiting outside.

146
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,840
Okay, take a look first.

147
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,719
Thank you, Doctor.

148
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:38,260
Be careful. Next.

149
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,860
Walk slowly.

150
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,020
Mu Dan.

151
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,179
- Zhao Zhao.
- Shopkeeper.

152
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:48,500
Village Chief.

153
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,059
Come on.

154
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,520
Zhao Zhao.

155
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,779
Mu Dan.

156
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,240
The sachets Mother made sold for a lot of money.

157
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,280
Mother said that we are going to the city today
and I could buy two packs of Malt Candy.

158
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,100
Of course you can,
I will give you a few more packs

159
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,079
so you can bring them back to the village
and share with your little friends?

160
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,860
Thank you, Mu Dan.

161
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,660
Thank you for your trouble.

162
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,220
Mu Dan, what is your shop called?

163
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,520
Look, Zhao Zhao, my shop is called Wuyong Hall.

164
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,980
What does Wuyong Hall mean?

165
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,920
It means to understand all things
and transform the world.

166
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,359
To comprehend the way of the mean.

167
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,040
What is the mean and why should one understand it?

168
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,719
During the private school's lessons, Zhao Zhao,
you must listen carefully.

169
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:41,699
When the rape flowers in the village bloom,
your teacher will speak about this topic.

170
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:47,599
By then, you will understand the meaning
of the characters Wuyong.

171
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,939
 
General Xiao, please.

172
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,870
 

173
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:14,000
   

174
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,860
Father.

175
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,740
I shall not disturb the General
and his daughter's conversation. Excuse me.

176
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,020
If I did not come personally,

177
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,539
you would still be enjoying yourself
and not thinking of returning to Hexi.

178
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:47,860
Not at all.

179
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,560
I miss you both a lot

180
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,920
and I really want to go home. But that marriage proposal…

181
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,459
I have already spoken to Prince Ning
and the marriage is canceled.

182
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:08,040
In the future, Xue Xi,
you can marry whoever you want to.

183
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,160
But Prince Ning will not let me go easily.

184
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,539
Father, did you promise him something?

185
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:19,980
You don't need to worry about court affairs.

186
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,760
I will protect you and take care of this family.

187
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,319
I won. Bring the Secluded Orchid in Jieshi Mode.

188
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:41,739
I thought you would give something else,
but how come it's peonies again?

189
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:45,020
Don't be a sore loser and tease me.

190
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,779
She's leaving and you won't even
give her a music score. So stingy.

191
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,500
Xue Xi, my farewell gift is a flower,
yet not a flower.

192
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
What does that mean?

193
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,020
The day I first saw you, it was as if a fairy
descended from heaven to save me from danger.

194
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,079
I will never forget that.

195
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:30,779
Your gift is truly thoughtful. I really like it.

196
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,620
I'm glad you like it.

197
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,100
In that case, I didn't really lose.

198
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,500
When you find your true love, on your wedding day,

199
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,520
the Secluded Orchid in Jieshi Mode
will be yours as a wedding gift.

200
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,299
I'm lucky to have you in my life.

201
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:53,459
Thank you for the companionship
and rescue these days.

202
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,740
We'll see each other around.

203
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,779
See you around.

204
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:13,799
Confucius said:

205
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:19,880
A gentleman seeks not to be full in food
nor at ease in dwelling.

206
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:26,959
Be diligent in actions and cautious in speech,
then you have the Dao to correct your errors.

207
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,660
This can be said to be truly fond of learning.

208
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,630
Lady He.

209
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,200
- Open your mouth and let me see.
- Lady He.

210
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,020
Go back to work.

211
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,279
Alright.

212
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,740
How do you feel after taking a lap?

213
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,599
The population is thriving and flourishing.

214
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:01,640
It hardly seems like the Sheng County
I visited last time.

215
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,499
Haven't you always wanted
to lend your strength to Wuyong Hall?

216
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:09,620
Currently, there is a difficult task at hand.

217
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,000
After much thought,
it seems you are the most suitable.

218
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,420
- What is it? 
 - Testing medicine, do you dare?

219
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,300
I trust the medicine you
and Chun made. Bring it over.

220
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,359
That's really wonderful.

221
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,240
Get up.

222
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,580
Alright, take off your clothes.

223
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,820
What do you mean?

224
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,780
Testing medicine for wounds naturally
requires applying it to the wounds.

225
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,680
You have so many old wounds, so naturally,
you can test which medicine works better.

226
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,820
Give me the medicine, and I'll take it back.
I'll tell you the results in a few days.

227
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,900
The rule of Wuyong Hall is that either I or Chun
must be present when testing medicine.

228
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,520
In case of any accident,
it can be dealt with promptly.

229
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,000
When you were injured and unconscious,
what have I not seen?

230
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,860
What, is Mr. Jiang feeling shy?

231
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,760
As the Floral Envoy, I've seen so much.
How could I be shy of this?

232
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,659
That's great. Those who practice medicine
do not distinguish between genders.

233
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:26,520
I entrust you to help with this favor.

234
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,619
Alright.

235
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:47,300
This medicine can smooth scars,
and even old ones can be significantly reduced.

236
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,800
Alright.

237
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,990
Jiang Chang Yang,

238
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,540
I can take good care of myself.

239
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,800
You need not take risks for me in the future.

240
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:32,639
Why are you blushing?

241
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,520
The medicine applied to my chest is slightly warm.

242
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:47,720
This medicine contains turmeric. It's harmless.

243
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:56,019
When you gave me a jade comb back then,
it was because you were afraid I'd be tired.

244
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:01,900
You wanted me to comb my hair and relax.
But aren't you also tired?

245
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:06,680
The Floral Envoy must wear a mask
all the time outside.

246
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:10,699
Once at home, you can take it off.

247
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:20,679
Jiang Chang Yang, around me, you need no disguise.

248
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,540
I am not in disguise.

249
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,040
Being with you, I am always at ease.

250
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:43,839
The night you were injured and unconscious,
you dreamt of a woman, do you remember?

251
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,760
Did I? Did I say any nonsense?

252
00:20:54,939 --> 00:21:01,240
You didn't say much. You just held her tightly
and didn't let her leave.

253
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:13,159
I almost forgot that I still have matters
to discuss with Mr. Third later.

254
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:17,404
I'm going back to Chang'an first.

255
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:21,334
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫ 

256
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:25,060
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫ 

257
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,259
Today I'm happy, so I'll drink a little more.

258
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:31,016
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫ 

259
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:32,668
It's empty.

260
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,319
There is more here.

261
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,300
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫ 

262
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,459
The first to marry is a dog.

263
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,920
Mu Dan,

264
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,940
upon parting, I also have a gift for you.

265
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:01,550
On the Lantern Festival,

266
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:07,800
Sui Zhi intended to confess his feelings under the full moon.

267
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,939
But unexpectedly, that person
was hurt because of him.

268
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:18,359
It made him full of remorse, unable to speak.

269
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,179
I want to restore the palace at Mount Li,
but the Ministry of Revenue claims poverty.

270
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:47,440
It turns out the money has all gone
into Zheng Shou De's mansion.

271
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,400
They've uncovered 500,000 strings of coins,

272
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,930
and who knows how much is yet to be found.

273
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:04,259
This treasury shouldn't bear the surname Li,
and it should be named Zheng.

274
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,979
Your Majesty, calm your anger.

275
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:17,580
Your Majesty, I'm well aware of all tax matters
for I've worked long in the Ministry of Revenue.

276
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:23,720
After a layered extortion from the local governor
to the clerics and ministers at Chang'an,

277
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,140
only three of ten of the taxed money
enters the treasury.

278
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Although I have obtained the real ledger,

279
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,200
I searched everywhere in Zheng's residence,
yet the 500,000 strings are still missing.

280
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,300
Your Majesty, the Ministry of Revenue's corruption
is a deep-rooted sickness.

281
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,860
I hope you will investigate all the officials
in the Ministry of Revenue.

282
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,540
Zheng Shou De hasn't been minister for long,
yet he dares to keep false ledgers.

283
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,659
It is hard to say he has no support behind him.

284
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:54,699
I heard that he was recommended by Prince Ning,
and their private relations were deep.

285
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:59,076
You said it yourself that Zheng Shou De
hasn't been back to Chang'an for long,

286
00:23:59,076 --> 00:24:02,300
so his occasional encounters
with Prince Ning are normal.

287
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,060
How can the Censor accuse Prince Ning
without evidence?

288
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:22,659
Your Majesty, I have widely gathered talents
without regard to familial relations.

289
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:26,860
I acted solely for the well-being
of the country and its people.

290
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,659
Who would have thought Zheng Shou De
would betray me and deceive Your Majesty.

291
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:37,580
I am heartbroken and cannot shirk
the responsibility of negligence.

292
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,079
I ask Your Majesty to administer punishment.

293
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:47,340
Ning, I have never doubted your loyalty.

294
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,900
Your Majesty, you cherish the brotherly bond.

295
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,720
But as the ruler of all,

296
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,600
your mercy and leniency harm the entire state.

297
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,620
Your Majesty.

298
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,320
Your Majesty.

299
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,179
Minister Lu's actions are somewhat reckless.

300
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:12,739
Factionalism and favoritism must be investigated,

301
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:15,219
but now, the most critical thing
is to find those 500,000 strings.

302
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:19,580
After all, the natural disasters nationwide
have already become an urgent crisis.

303
00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:22,599
The country comes first.

304
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,040
If Your Majesty trusts me,

305
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,459
within three days, I will uncover
the embezzled money and solve this case.

306
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:31,716
If not, for the 500,000 strings,

307
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:36,720
I will sell things in my house to pay it back.

308
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,120
   

309
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,820
Your Highness, it's my fault
that I arrived late due to my hangover.

310
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,240
Otherwise, I would have
scolded them on your behalf.

311
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:08,699
I have heard about what happened.
500,000 strings of coins is not a small amount.

312
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:11,659
Returning them to the national treasury
would indeed be a pity.

313
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:17,399
In my opinion, it's better to sacrifice a few
minor officials and let them gather the money.

314
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,499
At the birthday banquet
where Zheng Shou De lost the ledger,

315
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:29,699
I heard that you were also very drunk
and left the banquet early.

316
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:34,960
You know that I have always been
fond of drinking and lack restraint.

317
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,419
Lu Chu used to be cautious and timid.

318
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,019
How did Zheng Shou De's arrival
suddenly change his demeanor?

319
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,820
He took up the position of Transport Officer
and still wasn't satisfied.

320
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:50,900
Now he even dares to challenge His Highness.
Who gave him the courage?

321
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,739
Sui Zhi only loves to play with cats and dogs.
If he starts to change…

322
00:26:56,739 --> 00:27:01,299
I worried for His Highness and rushed here to offer my advice with good intentions.

323
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:05,300
Zi Shu, you're now without a position
and cannot serve Prince Ning in any matters,

324
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,219
so you want to begin sowing discord?

325
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:12,659
Or are you still pining for my Mu Dan?

326
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,640
Sui Zhi,

327
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,730
for other things, it's no problem.

328
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:22,880
But I remember
your tolerance for alcohol is quite high.

329
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,599
That night, you got drunk so quickly, didn't you?

330
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:38,040
You rat.

331
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,120
 

332
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,600
Mu Dan.

333
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:10,140
Recently, Chun and I have developed a new formula.

334
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,240
It can enhance yang energy,
dispel wind evil, and also aid sleep.

335
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,660
It's selling very well this month.
Do you want to try it?

336
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:19,200
Is that so?

337
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,760
Are you complaining that I indulge in drinking
day and night, which weakens my strength?

338
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,900
Do you want to boost my yang energy?

339
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,800
Exactly, if your body is healthy,

340
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,680
I also benefit from it. Follow me, Mr. Jiang.

341
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:50,079
Jiang Chang Yang, what's the matter
with this red mark on your collar?

342
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,340
It's just some rouge accidentally rubbed on.
Why make a fuss?

343
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,159
Let me see. Don't try to deceive me.

344
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,912
You clearly said you were drinking
with Tang Si Lang last night.

345
00:28:58,912 --> 00:29:01,259
Where did the rouge come from, huh?

346
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:04,100
The beautiful lady he brought got drunk
and accidentally bumped into me.

347
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,919
Why are you avoiding? When you married me,
you promised me the world.

348
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,979
But now you use the money I earned for you
to have fun with other beautiful ladies,

349
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:14,380
leaving me alone to guard the empty boudoir,
Jiang Chang Yang.

350
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,780
Why are you so angry? I'm sorry, okay?

351
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,659
Today, I'll only accompany you.

352
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,340
Sweetheart, don't be angry.

353
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,140
Not this one.

354
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,900
Mr. Jiang, the spy is gone.

355
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:42,079
Climbing so high, that's impressive indeed.

356
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:51,900
As expected of the Floral Envoy, you picked
the most expensive one to smash casually.

357
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,879
Your business is thriving,
yet you still fear a couple of broken vases.

358
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,719
How does our contract
divide the profits? Let me see it.

359
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:16,300
Spies are coming to my place. What happened?

360
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:19,900
We have exposed the corruption
in the Ministry of Revenue.

361
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,880
After several disturbances, Prince Ning
is becoming increasingly suspicious of me.

362
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:32,872
The contract was made in duplicate.
I had already burned my copy before I came.

363
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:38,399
You are afraid that Prince Ning will take action
against you, and it will involve me.

364
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,100
I didn't spend the slightest effort
on your shop or your garden.

365
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,419
I've collected interest for so long
that I've already recouped my principal.

366
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:53,019
Now you still have the Wuyong Hall to manage.
There are many places that need money.

367
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,480
Without me as a debt collector,
won't you be able to expand your ambitions more?

368
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:04,100
That's fine. My business won't stop anyway.

369
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:10,319
If you really run into any mishap later,
I'll still have money to arrange things for you.

370
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:17,860
For the shop where you invested the principal,
I'm saving all the interest for you.

371
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,879
Our relationship is not maintained
by just a piece of paper.

372
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:33,310
- I know you are loyal, but really,... 
- I'm doing this not only for you.

373
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,039
I hope Mr. Third can win.

374
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,420
Okay.

375
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:02,179
Jiang Chang Yang, be careful of everything.

376
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,659
Listening to what you said just now,
I feel very reassured.

377
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,879
If something unexpected really happens,
at least, you will take care of me for life.

378
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:20,900
At worst, my beloved concubine will handle
my burial. Thank you.

379
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:47,019
The list from the Assistant Minister
has somewhat confused me.

380
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:51,680
Your Majesty, these are all officials
who have bribed Zheng Shou De.

381
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,699
If they are said to be accomplices,
there is evidence to verify it.

382
00:32:55,699 --> 00:33:02,819
Disposing of these minor officials won't hinder
your control over the court.

383
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,700
Minister, you rarely interact with me.

384
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:17,240
How should I repay your advice today?

385
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,739
Unfortunately, Zheng Shou De has fallen.

386
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:26,839
Your majesty surely cannot allow
that ungrateful Lu Chu to take the position.

387
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,380
Your Highness, I have long admired you.

388
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:36,580
Now is the time for me to earn merits
and demonstrate my loyalty to you and the court.

389
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,359
Your Highness, I beg for your grace.

390
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:55,259
Zhang Qiu, you're so eager for merit
that you've been somewhat inconsiderate.

391
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:59,499
For the sake of some money,
you want to cost His Highness many loyal subjects.

392
00:33:59,499 --> 00:34:02,960
Doesn't this make outsiders chill to see?

393
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:11,479
I really don't know
how to come up with 500,000 strings of coins.

394
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:18,020
Mr. Liu, you have a meticulous mind.
Do you have any brilliant ideas?

395
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:21,472
I do have one.

396
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:28,859
I just don't know if you dare to do it.

397
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,820
For His Highness,
I am willing to go through fire and water.

398
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,630
Have you really made up your mind, Mr. Jiang?

399
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,039
Zhang Qiu Feng has already left
Prince Ning's Mansion.

400
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:52,740
We have no other choice.
It's up to you and Yun Niang.

401
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,240
Yes.

402
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,459
Tomorrow, the busier the Mu Dan shop, the better.
Make sure she doesn't get involved.

403
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:04,010
Yes.

404
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:07,099
Madam, please come inside.

405
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:08,220
Take care.

406
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,499
Give me the medicine
and hand the prescription to the old lady.

407
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:11,900
- Madam.
- Why are all the follow-up patients coming today?

408
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,740
Madam, you are fine.

409
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,999
After finishing these few doses of medicine,
you'll get better. Here you go.

410
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:19,760
- Take care.
- Thank you, Lady He.

411
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,680
Madam, are you alright?

412
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,819
Next, please.

413
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,199
Lian Zhou?

414
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:38,660
Pei Zhong appears gentle and refined, but in fact,
he is of a violent disposition.

415
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:41,740
Inside the boudoir,

416
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,200
he likes to use a whip.

417
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:49,780
Your body is layered
with old wounds over new ones.

418
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,399
If the wounds fester and become infected,
it might endanger your life.

419
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:57,260
Can you stay away for a while
to recuperate for a month?

420
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,550
I'm just a gift.

421
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:07,220
How can I say no?

422
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:18,200
Mu Dan, I made the wrong choice.

423
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:24,579
I should have listened to you
and left Chang'an back then.

424
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:34,800
Lian Zhou, as long as you are willing,
it's not too late.

425
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,459
I can help you escape from the Pei residence.

426
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:41,359
Mu Dan.

427
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,059
Amaranth mixed with daffodil juice

428
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:47,820
can cause a red rash and skin ulceration.

429
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:53,499
Then I'll have Chun treat you,
saying you have smallpox.

430
00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:57,019
Given Pei Zhong's nature,
he won't care about your life or death.

431
00:36:57,019 --> 00:37:01,380
But to prevent the disease from spreading,
he will definitely expel you from the house.

432
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,180
Then you will be free.

433
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,340
I will never forget your grace of rebirth.

434
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,579
Lian Zhou, get up quickly.

435
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:13,900
Slow down, be careful.

436
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:24,900
Starting over is certainly difficult,
but remember.

437
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,059
No matter what happens, you must cherish yourself.

438
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:32,160
No one is worth your subservience.

439
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:38,099
In childhood, I had my parents' protection.

440
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,419
When they were gone,

441
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:46,660
I then sought protection
from one man after another.

442
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,550
I seem to have forgotten

443
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,050
the taste of freedom.

444
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:58,520
I… can I really do it?

445
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:05,680
Of course you can. You are wise, agile,
and experienced in dealing with the world.

446
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,280
You are skilled in embroidery
and have quite a study of women's dresses.

447
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,220
In the future, you can open
your own dressmaking shop.

448
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,399
Business will surely flourish.

449
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,539
Do you know that Wuyong Hall
has opened in Sheng County?

450
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:25,660
The farm women there are illiterate
but can support themselves with their skills,

451
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,500
let alone you. Even without a man, you can still live well.

452
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,340
Chun is right.

453
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,700
Lian Zhou, I will have someone prepare
the poisonous flower juice immediately.

454
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,439
It will be delivered
to the Pei residence in three days.

455
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:43,139
Alright.

456
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:54,579
Mu Dan, if you have the chance,
leave Jiang Chang Yang as soon as possible.

457
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:59,139
Prince Ning plans to deal with him.
Don't get involved.

458
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:01,890
What does Prince Ning
plan to do to Jiang Chang Yang?

459
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,720
Pei Zhong says Prince Ning intends to pin
the corruption charges on Jiang Chang Yang

460
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,740
and use his property to offset
the Ministry of Revenue's deficit.

461
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,620
I'm afraid they might even take his life

462
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,160
to quell the people's anger.

463
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:32,780
Mr. Zhang Qiu.

464
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,919
This is business.

465
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,520
- A calamity to the nation and its people. 
 - Such a large gold ingot!

466
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,860
- Arrest him.
- A corrupt official. So greedy.

467
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,679
This is all the people's money.

468
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:56,800
- Keep searching. 
 - Yes.

469
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,950
   

470
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,740
Search.

471
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,860
Move aside.

472
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,900
- Make way, make way.
- Sir, sir, you can't enter here.

473
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,359
- Move aside, move aside.
- Search it!

474
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:13,760
Sir, sir.

475
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,460
Move aside.

476
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:20,839
- He embezzled it all. 
 - Big corrupt official.

477
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:22,660
- So much.
- He's too greedy.

478
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,079
How much do you think this is?

479
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,920
This is really too much.

480
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,160
Excuse me. Let me through. Excuse me.

481
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,400
- Stop.
- Stop.

482
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,259
This corrupt official is wicked.

483
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:38,919
Big corrupt official.

484
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,380
He's out. He's out. The darned official is out.

485
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,220
Serves him right.

486
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,860
Darned Jiang, such a wicked official.
How much of the people's money have you plundered?

487
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,199
- Hit him, hit him.
- Hit him.

488
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:07,479
Hit him.

489
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:10,700
What are you doing here?
I didn't want you to see this scene.

490
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,180
Jiang Chang Yang, I'm telling you.

491
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,380
Since I signed the first contract with you,

492
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,499
I have been in the same pit with you.

493
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:20,260
No matter what happens, I will face it with you.

494
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:31,010


495
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,730
 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining 

496
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:46,904
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

497
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:55,318
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

498
00:41:55,318 --> 00:42:03,410
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

499
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:11,662
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫ 

500
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:19,959
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

501
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:28,246
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

502
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:36,562
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

503
00:42:36,562 --> 00:42:44,762
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

504
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:12,714
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫ 

505
00:43:12,714 --> 00:43:20,165
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

506
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:28,251
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫ 

507
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:36,460
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫ 

508
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:44,722
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

509
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:52,978
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

510
00:43:52,978 --> 00:44:01,406
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

511
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:09,406
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
