1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,050


2
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:37,010
   

3
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,419
   

4
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:42,840
- I knew Miss He was framed by villains. 
 - Yes.

5
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,300
Miss He is a good person. I said she wasn't that kind of person.

6
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,900
Xiao Chun, Mu Dan.

7
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,959
 Blinded by greed. 

8
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,680
How did you get so injured?

9
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,500
We're fine. Aren't we out safely? Don't cry.

10
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,739
This is the wound medicine Young Master got from Physician Fu. He instructed you to apply it.

11
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:09,580
I've made some replenishing soup. You and Xiao Chun should get some rest.

12
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,580
Thank you, Young Master Liu. We'll drink it in a bit.

13
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,799
Go on.

14
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,840
Chun'er.

15
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,100
Father.

16
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,440
I wronged you.

17
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,790
When you were in trouble, I trusted others more than you.

18
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,339
I apologize to you.

19
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:58,580
Through this, I've realized your medical skills are indeed excellent.

20
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,099
Shopkeeper He truly cares for you. You've really grown up.

21
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,659
Your judgment of people is better than mine.

22
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,420
I didn't do well.

23
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,099
I don't like needlework, but I pretended to be a refined lady.

24
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,099
I never let you see the real me.

25
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,919
Today, we should celebrate the clearing of false charges. Let's not talk about this.

26
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,740
I don't know what to gift you,

27
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,300
but I remember you said...

28
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,810
you liked this.

29
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:50,759
In the future, if you want to practice medicine, go ahead.

30
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,779
As long as you're safe.

31
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,120
Father.

32
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,459
The wind.

33
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,559
The wind.

34
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,739
It's Young Madam who's been released, not you.

35
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:27,859
Why are you rushing to bathe and change clothes?

36
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:32,060
They say after prison, one should bathe and burn incense to ward off evil spirits.

37
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,580
In Mu Dan's room, all the incense has been lit, and it's filled with fragrance.

38
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,840
I naturally have to cleanse myself before seeing her for good fortune.

39
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,860
Young Master Jiang.

40
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,300
What are you doing here?

41
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,400
You didn't pluck these flowers from Mu Dan's garden, did you?

42
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,940
Rest assured, Young Master Jiang. I bought all these.

43
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,219
How would I dare provoke Sister even a little nowadays?

44
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:12,260
That's good.

45
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,219
In everything, we must respect order. You use this bath first. I'll be going.

46
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,419
I belong entirely to you. What need is there to distinguish between you and me?

47
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,620
Since I married in, you've never spent the night in my room.

48
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,299
How long has it been since we last saw each other?

49
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:35,339
Today, heaven favored me to run into you.

50
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,700
Let me... serve you well.

51
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,219
Lian Zhou, let me tell you the truth.

52
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:51,339
Ever since Mu Dan came along, I haven't been interested in other women.

53
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,500
I know I wronged you during this time.

54
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,899
You can head to the warehouse later and take whatever you like,

55
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,420
all right?

56
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:08,999
Truly His Highness's adopted daughter, so understanding. I'm leaving.

57
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,539
Why did you bring a brazier up? Aren't you afraid of the fire?

58
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,140
Chuan Yu brought it over.

59
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,439
They say it can ward off evil and dispel filth, and also dry hair.

60
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,940
No need, I'll do it myself.

61
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,739
Your mouth is the only tough part of your whole body.

62
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,380
Does this feel better?

63
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,579
You’re usually in charge of several shops and handle it all.

64
00:07:53,579 --> 00:08:00,339
Only at home, in the quiet of the night, can you have a moment to relax.

65
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,070
Enough.

66
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,480
We were just acting, how did it become so real now?

67
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,900
If the Matchmaker God sees this, he might misunderstand.

68
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,620
If he cuts all your future marriage threads, don't blame me.

69
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,820
I'm not interested in love. I don't need the Matchmaker God.

70
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:36,319
If he really tangles me with someone random, I'll personally sever that red thread.

71
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,179
Don't pull. It has become a dead knot.

72
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,459
Cut it.

73
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,310
Good girl.

74
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,930
Mu Dan, open your mouth.

75
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:59,839
Mu Dan.

76
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,100
Useless, no matter how much you resemble it, you weren't raised by He Wei Fang.

77
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,419
You've done so much. How can feelings not waver?

78
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:18,539
But she's now the Floral Envoy's. Why torment yourself like this?

79
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,100
The Floral Envoy...

80
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,380
That's right.

81
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,200
Only by toppling Jiang Chang Yang

82
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,150
and leaving He Wei Fang with no support, will she believe that

83
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:40,419
only I can help her fulfill her long-cherished wish in the world.

84
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:44,819
I don't mean that. County Princess has deep feelings for you. You can't…

85
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:46,419
Young Master.

86
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:53,059
- Young Master. 
 - Has something happened?

87
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,380
A stranger has appeared at the dock three times.

88
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,659
I've sent someone to follow him, but we haven't found his whereabouts yet.

89
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,819
Keep a close watch on him and find out who's behind him.

90
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:05,059
Don't let him mess up our business.

91
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,759
Yes, Sir.

92
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,819
Young Madam, your arm injury hasn't healed yet. Let me.

93
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:15,599
No, absolutely not. I can do it. You go ahead.

94
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,939
Where is Zhao Cai going with the flowers?

95
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:28,479
Young Madam, it's to be sent to Madam Lian Zhou's room.

96
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,140
Lian Zhou is now interested in flowers and plants?

97
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,079
Madam Mu Dan, what brings you here?

98
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,939
I'm here to bring insect repellent to Lian Zhou.

99
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,419
Greetings, Young Madam.

100
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:12,360
You can't transplant it like this, here.

101
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,220
When peonies are in full bloom, they can't be transplanted.

102
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,059
Zhao Cai, you never raised flowers before, right?

103
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,419
If you forcibly dig it up like this,

104
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:26,220
even if the flower survives this spring, it won't bloom next year.

105
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,679
Sister, did you come over today for something?

106
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:33,579
I see you're growing Dense Misty Purple.

107
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:36,819
I thought this flower is delicate and easily attracts insects,

108
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:40,220
so I brought you a bottle of insect repellent.

109
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,999
Thank you.

110
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:54,819
Since you're so fond of plants now, why trouble the young lads in the residence?

111
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:59,000
Zhao Cai doesn't understand how to tend to plants. Why not come to me?

112
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,620
I intended to raise them for fun. I didn't know there were so many intricacies involved.

113
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,220
In the future, I'll stick to painting and the zither. I won't trouble you.

114
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,140
Please continue the conversation. I'll excuse myself.

115
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,740
Go ahead.

116
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:35,100
Being confined in the inner mansion likely wastes one's youthful years.

117
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,299
Have you understood what I told you before?

118
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:44,419
Do you want to go out and try a different life?

119
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,240
The life you speak of isn't something everyone is lucky enough to experience.

120
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:59,380
I just saw the packed bag on the table. Are you going out?

121
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,980
I want to stay a few days at Kaiyuan Temple to chant and pray for blessings.

122
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,240
Kaiyuan Temple is a place of austere meditation. Why the sudden desire to go there?

123
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,939
I want to for a blessing regarding my relationship with Young Master.

124
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:21,539
You're generous, you won't stop me from going, right?

125
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,000
Of course, I won't.

126
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,299
 That planting soil was shoveled away after Cai Wei's loud reminder. 

127
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:41,500
 What was Lian Zhou discussing with Zhao Cai that required one to guard the door? 

128
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,659
 Zhao Cai is a servant of the Jiang Residence. Can Lian Zhou recruit him so easily? 

129
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,560
 Zhao Cai. 

130
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:02,880
 Young Master, spare my life. 

131
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,220
 You aren't usually one to torment your servants. What's the matter today? 

132
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,520
 Do you have a grudge against this lad? 

133
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,280
 You guess. 

134
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,510
 Jiang Chang Yang puts on a show in the residence 

135
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,779
 not just to spread the notoriety of being a playboy. 

136
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,819
 It's likely he's being watched from close by. 

137
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,720
 Jiang Chang Yang isn't in Chang'an these days. 

138
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,460
 If Zhao Cai is really Prince Ning's man, with Lian Zhou suddenly leaving the mansion, 

139
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,579
 are they going to act against Jiang Chang Yang? 

140
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:54,700
I wanted to go to Kaiyuan Temple to offer incense to my mother. We can go together.

141
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:04,599
Mu Dan and I are best friends. I'm accompanying her.

142
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:38,079
Madam, the lights in Madam He's room have already been extinguished.

143
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:13,890
Privately using items reserved for royals is a capital offense.

144
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,970
Are you sure you want to buy?

145
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:39,419
Madam, your embroidery skills are truly impressive.

146
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,340
Though this Lotus Dress is old, it hasn't lost its beauty.

147
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,559
The lotus flowers on it almost look real.

148
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:53,699
The embroidery shop my father opened back in the day was the largest in Jiangnan.

149
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:58,340
I've embroidered countless dresses with my own hands.

150
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:06,459
But now, this is the only piece I can find or purchase.

151
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,979
I've had a wish since I was little.

152
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:23,520
One day, I hope to wear such beautiful clothes.

153
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,750
Even if just in the dark of night,

154
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,590
I'll wear them just for myself to see.

155
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,400
But my parents warned me that

156
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,739
merchants aren't worthy of wearing noble attire.

157
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:45,910
My father was persecuted by a corrupt official later on,

158
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,359
and overnight, my family was ruined.

159
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:56,710
I've never worn such luxurious dresses.

160
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,860
Madam, it truly hasn't been easy for you to get where you are today.

161
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:05,290
Merchants are lowly.

162
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:08,979
No matter how big their business becomes,

163
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:13,219
a single word from an official can turn everything to dust.

164
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,810
Only by clinging to royal relatives and nobles

165
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,830
can one find a place in the affluent circles,

166
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:26,410
adorned in jewels and fine clothes,

167
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,700
with everlasting peace.

168
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:47,079
So, Lian Zhou also came from a merchant background.

169
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,820
Both of you have gone through many trials, yet have become completely different people.

170
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,359
We were raised under the care of our family.

171
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,019
But what about her? Her family was ruined.

172
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:05,979
We might not understand the hardships she has experienced along the way.

173
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,540
Presumably, when Lian Zhou was little and desperate, no one gave her a choice

174
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,440
so she could use her embroidery skills to make a living for herself.

175
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,780
A noble person gave her a beautiful cage,

176
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,860
keeping her well-fed and clothed, without worries.

177
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:27,079
Naturally, she thought that only by aligning with the powerful could she be safe.

178
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,799
In this light, it seems that those who are hateful indeed are pitiful too.

179
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:39,699
Buying old dresses that nobles don't want to wear before is still a crime.

180
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:45,659
Presumably, over the years, Lian Zhou has been living cautiously out of fear.

181
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:54,359
Just like Sheng Yi, starting over isn't easy.

182
00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:02,580
Once she has stayed longer and becomes more familiar with us, she might slowly change.

183
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,659
I hope so.

184
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:10,459
Let's pretend we didn't see today's events, no one else can know.

185
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:12,059
Understood.

186
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,680
General.

187
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,520
Sui Zhi, there's no need for formalities.

188
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,580
This courtesy is on behalf of His Majesty, who asked me to come.

189
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,880
A salute for your loyalty and courage, appreciation for guarding Hedong all these years.

190
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,130
I am fearful.

191
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:54,700
Let His Majesty rest assured.

192
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,060
Even if Fan Yang is on good terms with Prince Ning,

193
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:03,340
crossing the Yellow River still requires our Hedong Army's approval.

194
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,079
With you here, His Majesty can be at ease.

195
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,599
Over these years, is His Majesty well?

196
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,900
As long as the country is secure, His Majesty will be fine.

197
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,420
General, please rise.

198
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:25,340
Once the time is right, His Majesty will send a message to Hedong.

199
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:31,200
Please bring the imperial decree and assist His Majesty in setting a solid foundation.

200
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,520
How is the plan? Please elaborate.

201
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:46,280
After the other day, did Madam He have any suspicions?

202
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:51,979
It's been handled, she hasn't asked about it again.

203
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:56,300
The Minister of Revenue passed away, and the position is vacant.

204
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:02,380
You need to influence him to get His Highness's man into the position.

205
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,240
Jiang Chang Yang values Lady He highly and won't give me a chance.

206
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,900
How can I influence him?

207
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,559
If Madam He were dead, you wouldn't have to worry about lacking an opportunity.

208
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:23,979
What? Do you really consider her family now?

209
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,659
Prince Ning's Mansion doesn't keep useless people nor allow betrayal.

210
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:34,320
My status is all thanks to His Highness.

211
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,380
I would never dare forget the favor.

212
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:49,900
Jiang Chang Yang cares about Madam He. If she dies, he'll investigate.

213
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,060
If it leads to you, will you be able to protect yourself?

214
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:59,680
If it leads to me, how should I explain it to His Highness?

215
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,559
As long as He Wei Fang loses favor, she'll no longer obstruct us.

216
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,419
If you could compete against her, you wouldn't be struggling today.

217
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,580
Before I didn't understand what Jiang Chang Yang liked about her.

218
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,820
Now I see clearly.

219
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,140
Madam He is eloquent and can easily make him happy with her words.

220
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:35,100
When used in business, this same eloquence can earn a fortune for him.

221
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:40,939
You want to make her mute, taking away her means of living?

222
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:47,459
When he returns, he'll only learn she caught an illness and lost her voice.

223
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:52,000
When he's sad, I'll go to comfort him.

224
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:57,780
I surely won't disappoint His Highness's great expectations.

225
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:04,820
I've internalized what you've said.

226
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,610
I want... to learn business with you.

227
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,620
Is that what you truly think?

228
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:18,019
On the trip to Kaiyuan Temple, I drew a divination.

229
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:21,620
It said that I have no destiny with Young Master Jiang.

230
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,100
Now I'm resigned,

231
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,680
and I ask for your protection in the future. Help me make more money.

232
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,480
So that I won't be helpless in my old age.

233
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,610
Please rise, quickly.

234
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,499
If you can truly let go of the past,

235
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:49,319
you need not live in fear anymore, and life will only improve.

236
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:59,359
Now that you've come to the Fragrance Garden, everyone and I are your family.

237
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,540
This pair of cups is my apprenticeship gift to you.

238
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,960
Please graciously guide me.

239
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,219
Alright, today, I wanted to try a new wine.

240
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:22,340
You're quite knowledgeable.  Let's taste it together.

241
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,040
Sure.

242
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,620
Fine wine with a good cup. Why not give this a try?

243
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:37,760
This peony cup is truly exquisite.

244
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,000
Come on.

245
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,680
Lian Zhou!

246
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,739
Why have you come?

247
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:52,420
I came to ask Mu Dan to teach me business.

248
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,140
Come on.

249
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:02,780
The flowers on this cup are beautiful. When did Fragrance Garden purchase them?

250
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,179
It was a gift for Mu Dan. You should try them with the new wine, too.

251
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:13,699
Come on,today, everyone should have a taste.

252
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:17,380
This is the new wine Jin Niang brewed, see how it tastes.

253
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:21,159
Come on, Lian Zhou.

254
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,240
The taste is good.

255
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,936
How is it?

256
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:37,980
   

257
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,179
Everyone, take your leave.

258
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:47,879
Yes.

259
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:56,219
Madam, Fragrance Garden has opened the doors, and the lights are burning.

260
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:58,039
Lu Geng Chun has already rushed over.

261
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:02,559
It seems that the poison in Lady He has acted up. Madam, rest assured.

262
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,380
Sister Mu Dan.

263
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,340
She was fine yesterday. What happened today?

264
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,580
Last night, Mu Dan's throat suddenly felt sharp pain and she had difficulty breathing.

265
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,499
After midnight, she couldn't even speak.

266
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:43,179
Physician Xiao Chun, what illness does she have?

267
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,199
I've used needles and tried medicine, but all to no avail.

268
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:48,780
I can't determine what the acute illness is.

269
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,900
When Young Master Jiang returns, he'll surely ask Physician Fu to diagnose Mu Dan.

270
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,839
She'll certainly get better.

271
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:02,280
For this throat pain, she should drink more cooling beverages.

272
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,980
Mu Dan.

273
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,419
I was just so worried about Mu Dan that I lost my grip.

274
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:29,580
Quickly throw all these away. Don't let Mu Dan see them and get upset.

275
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,280
Yes.

276
00:30:08,699 --> 00:30:12,240
All that should be destroyed has been. You may go.

277
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:22,320
   

278
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,120
Fifth watch.

279
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:31,700
Fifth watch.

280
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,300
Young Master, Sister is sick.

281
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,179
She's at Fragrance Garden. Do you want to go see her?

282
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:13,299
Is that so?

283
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:17,780
Sister Lian Zhou.

284
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:32,300
Why didn't you tell me you returned to the residence?

285
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:38,019
How is your health? Don't force yourself if you're feeling unwell.

286
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:43,540
Health? My health has always been good. I've never been ill.

287
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:50,720
You rushed over so hurriedly. Do you want to have a cup of tea with me?

288
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:04,790
Do you want to ask why I'm standing in front of you unharmed

289
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:13,300
and why this shattered peony cup is intact here?

290
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:23,259
 Lian Zhou! Why have you come? 

291
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:25,839
 I came to ask Mu Dan to teach me business. 

292
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:41,659
Ever since I caught you conspiring with Zhao Cai, I've never let go of my doubts.

293
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,659
I always had someone follow you.

294
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:50,680
Unexpectedly, I found out you were making poison to kill me.

295
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,499
Applying it inside the cup's wall, a very delicate method.

296
00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:00,459
Unfortunately, before this,

297
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:04,399
I had already bought a pair of identical peony cups.

298
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,580
The one you smashed is non-toxic, while the truly poisonous one

299
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,960
is this in my hand.

300
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,100
I did no such thing!

301
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,979
Young Master, it was Madam who coaxed me, saying she would teach me business.

302
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:26,540
That's why I bought the cups and gave them to her, hoping to get closer to her.

303
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,079
These cups aren't rare. You can buy them in any porcelain shop.

304
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,440
How can that serve as evidence?

305
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,060
As for Zhao Cai, I merely asked him to help me move flowers a few times.

306
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,860
Poisoning? I didn't do it!

307
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,760
Is that so?

308
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,800
Take a look at what this is.

309
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:50,060
This is the confession of Mister Zhang and Zhao Cai.

310
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,979
They've already confessed and signed it in the government office.

311
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:57,159
 The medicine cured the illness. My master is very satisfied. 

312
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,399
 This is the remaining money. In the future… 

313
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,140
 Behave! 

314
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,460
 Don't move. 

315
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:32,139
 This poison and contract were found in the geomancer's home. 

316
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,700
 Previously, you were only swindling. 

317
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,660
 You dare take on making poison to kill people now? 

318
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,380
 Spare my life, Madam, Magistrate. 

319
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,939
 I know my crime. I've committed a crime! 

320
00:34:43,939 --> 00:34:47,260
 And you, you've been at the Jiang Residence for years. 

321
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,059
 No one discovered you knew martial arts. You hid it well. 

322
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:54,579
 What? Do you intend to secretly kill Young Master? 

323
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:58,619
 Attempted poisoning of a wife failed. Perhaps it isn't a capital crime. 

324
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:01,699
 But may I ask, Magistrate, if a servant kills the master 

325
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:04,719
 and harms an official, how would it be judged? 

326
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,579
 A servant who murders the master shall be beheaded. 

327
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:10,340
 Although I know martial arts, I had no intention of harming Master. 

328
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,260
 It was... It's Lian Zhou who sent me. She wants to kill you. 

329
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,380
 I don't want to do such a heinous thing, but Lian Zhou forced me. 

330
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,280
 Madam, spare my life! 

331
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:26,939
 Sir, Lian Zhou was a gift from His Highness to Young Maser Jiang. 

332
00:35:26,939 --> 00:35:31,059
 If entrusted to you for disposal, I'm afraid it would cause you difficulties. 

333
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:33,000
 These are internal matters to the Jiang Residence. 

334
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,220
 I'll inform Young Master myself when he returns. 

335
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,419
 We won't trouble you then. 

336
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:42,109
 Thank you for not holding grudges and showing me compassion. 

337
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:46,740
 You're truly understanding. The Floral Envoy is truly blessed. 

338
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,440
 You flatter me. 

339
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,419
 As for these two people, their means are vicious and the evidence is conclusive. 

340
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,780
 I hope you'll handle it according to the law. 

341
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,139
Lian Zhou, I've treated you so well.

342
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:10,280
Why do you treat me like this? You've truly disheartened me.

343
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,200
Darling, you must stand up for me.

344
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:26,720
Today, you can poison Mu Dan because of my affection for someone else.

345
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,790
What if you blame me someday,

346
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,900
then what will happen?

347
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,860
Darling, you mustn't! Lian Zhou was a gift from His Highness.

348
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:46,180
For His Highness's sake, you must not harm her.

349
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:56,760
All of you, leave.

350
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:15,979
I examined the poison Zhao Cai bought. The dosage is enough to take a life.

351
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:20,539
However, the amount in the cup was carefully calculated.

352
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:24,419
It would only cause muteness, not death.

353
00:37:24,419 --> 00:37:28,399
So, you didn't intend to kill me.

354
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,539
Darling, ultimately, these are matters of the inner courtyard.

355
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:40,820
I have a few words to say to Lian Zhou. Please allow me to handle it myself.

356
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,519
All right, as you wish.

357
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:03,839
Get up.

358
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:13,640
Since you entered the residence, you haven't received any sympathy from him.

359
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,480
You feel you've wasted your youth in vain. So you hate me.

360
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,399
I don't blame you.

361
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:25,419
I don't blame you because your conscience is still intact.

362
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:30,839
But you ultimately did something wrong. I can't allow you to stay in the Jiang Residence.

363
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:33,439
I understand.

364
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:40,039
No matter how you handle this, I have no complaints.

365
00:38:41,939 --> 00:38:45,059
What I said to you before was all sincere.

366
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:49,619
I never intended to compete with you, let alone harm you.

367
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:55,820
The carefree days I mentioned before, perhaps you didn't have a choice before.

368
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,859
But today, I want to give you a choice.

369
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,839
What do you mean?

370
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:08,639
Tomorrow, you can be sent back to Prince Ning Residence.

371
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,699
You might be given to some other noble man.

372
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:15,899
Though you would lack nothing materially, most likely,

373
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:21,700
you'll still be drawn into endless inner courtyard struggles.

374
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:27,019
Or... Lian Zhou dies today.

375
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,780
From now on, you will change your name and leave for a distant place.

376
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,979
I'll help you get somewhere surrounded by mountains and rivers.

377
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:44,160
There, you can make a living with your skills and no longer be dependent on anyone.

378
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:53,579
Perhaps there, you'll meet a man who truly cares for you

379
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:57,359
and live the rest of your life safely and happily.

380
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:05,139
Love between a man and a woman can't be forced, and I don't want to hinder you.

381
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:09,999
Since Mu Dan is letting you choose, choose freely.

382
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:35,340
I'll never forget your kindness.

383
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,699
But His Highness's favor towards me is heavy.

384
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:44,350
It's my incompetence that I can't win over his heart. I blame no one.

385
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:47,160
Young Master Jiang.

386
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,340
Please send me back to Prince Ning's Residence.

387
00:41:05,728 --> 00:41:08,419
   

388
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:12,059
Mu Dan has been handed our servant to the authorities.

389
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:17,380
Lian Zhou is your adopted daughter. I can't make the decision on my own.

390
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,839
Thinking it over, it's best to return her to you.

391
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:40,030


392
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:48,180
 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining 

393
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:55,362
♫  On the endless road to Chang'an, 
 the zither and lute's melody echoes from afar  ♫

394
00:41:56,416 --> 00:42:03,776
♫  Plum and willow trees greet the Spring, 
 as splendor returns this year  ♫

395
00:42:03,776 --> 00:42:11,868
♫  Copper battlements shine as songs, dances, and glasses fill the palace air  ♫

396
00:42:11,868 --> 00:42:20,120
♫  Idle clouds and drifting duckweed, with a thousand flowers blooming  ♫

397
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:28,517
♫  Time flows gracefully, with moments gathering in the fading mist  ♫

398
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:36,604
♫  Let the years pass, carried by the wind toward long-held desires  ♫

399
00:42:36,604 --> 00:42:45,020
♫  If the heart remains as still as water, youth becomes eternal  ♫

400
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:53,120
♫  Still cherishing the moon of my hometown, yearning to meet again  ♫

401
00:43:12,988 --> 00:43:21,172
♫  The distant night sky, scattered with stars, reflects the gentle moon  ♫

402
00:43:21,172 --> 00:43:28,623
♫  The peony's exquisite beauty fills the fragrant garden  ♫

403
00:43:28,623 --> 00:43:36,709
♫  With my heart as a lantern, I fear not the journey through distant mountain paths  ♫

404
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:44,918
♫  The jade flute's music fills a fleeting life with meaning  ♫

405
00:43:44,918 --> 00:43:53,280
♫  Time flows gracefully, with moments gathering in the fading mist  ♫

406
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:01,536
♫  Let the years pass, carried by the wind toward long-held desires  ♫

407
00:44:01,536 --> 00:44:09,864
♫  If the heart remains as still as water, youth becomes eternal  ♫

408
00:44:09,864 --> 00:44:17,864
♫  Still cherishing the moon of my hometown, yearning to meet again  ♫
