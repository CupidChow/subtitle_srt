00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:37,140
   

3
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,870
   

4
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,759
You saved my entire family.

5
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,439
I originally thought you did it for justice, and I was grateful.

6
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,759
I didn't expect that you had known my daughter for some time.

7
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,339
You even encouraged her to practice medicine and open a clinic.

8
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:58,899
If it weren't for a customer of the flower guild informing me, I'd still be in the dark.

9
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:01,440
Chun'er's reputation was almost ruined by you.

10
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,200
We didn't do wrong. Xiao Chun sincerely likes healing and helping others.

11
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:13,519
Guild Master, Xiao Chun has a talent for medicine.

12
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:16,560
Even Master Physician Fu from the Imperial Medical Bureau has praised her.

13
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,659
If you forcibly keep her at home and force her to marry and have children,

14
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:23,760
I'm afraid she'll suffer for a lifetime.

15
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,679
Marrying is the right path for a woman!

16
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,219
I wholeheartedly want the best for her and to find her a good family!

17
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,580
But you two? Indulge her mischief!

18
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,800
Pushing her into a pit of fire!

19
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,539
You may leave. Stay away from Chun'er!

20
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,979
- See the guests out! 
 - Yes.

21
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:46,300
The clinic and practicing medicine were my own ideas, not influenced by others.

22
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,819
Master, she smashed the betrothal gifts the Hu family sent, and we couldn't stop her.

23
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:58,240
You were gentle and obedient before. How did you turn into this?

24
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,140
This is my true nature.

25
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,099
Previously, I was afraid of upsetting you, so I pretended to be gentle and decent.

26
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:10,259
Father, I don't want a blind marriage. I want to keep practicing medicine.

27
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,200
A woman practicing medicine is looked down upon. It's a disgrace to feminine virtue.

28
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,119
Respectable families will look down on you. Do you intend never to marry?

29
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,719
As for a so-called good husband,

30
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,679
if he looks down on me because I'm a female physician, he isn't worth marrying.

31
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,160
You can't distinguish right from wrong, uttering wild words.

32
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,600
Just look at you,

33
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,800
if your mother saw this, she wouldn't rest in peace even in the afterlife!

34
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,740
May I ask, Father, was my mother not virtuous enough?

35
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,760
Where was her happiness?

36
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,839
Because you said appearing in public was a disgrace to family values,

37
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:44,559
- she was confined and died in melancholy! 
 - Are you blaming me?

38
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:49,539
Do you know what she truly loved? Do you know what her ideals and ambitions were?

39
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:54,539
You buried my mother's life. Are you going to bury mine too?

40
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,399
You love flowers, so you can make a career out of it.

41
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:06,659
Why can't Xiao Chun do what she loves just because she's a woman?

42
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,879
Isn't that too tyrannical?!

43
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:14,480
Xiao Chun's skillful hands and open heart make everyone in Huamanzhu respect her.

44
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,879
The patients she has cured respect and love her even more.

45
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,679
We were wrong to hide our actions from you.

46
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:25,179
But there's nothing wrong with Xiao Chun practicing medicine.

47
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:27,500
Shopkeeper He, you deviate from convention.

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,680
You became a concubine for an official. I can't let my daughter take that path!

49
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,760
Father.

50
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:42,279
Chun'er, you've grown up now.

51
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,280
Now that you have friends and confidence, do you no longer need this family?

52
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,319
Let me ask you one last time, do you want to stay and be my daughter

53
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:58,240
or step out of this door to pursue your so-called path of medicine?!

54
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:03,099
I really can't have both?

55
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,400
No.

56
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,419
From now on, the Lu family doesn't have an unfilial daughter like you!

57
00:05:56,679 --> 00:06:02,820
My father once said that dandelions scattered by the wind are unlucky in a home.

58
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,439
Because I liked them, we planted them anyway.

59
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,979
But he didn't know that I regarded this as medicine.

60
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:19,539
It was for the roots once the flowers fell, to treat his throat pain and lung abscess.

61
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,079
But now, the words have come true, and we are indeed scattered.

62
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,979
It's because he cares so much that he would be this stubborn.

63
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:38,520
Xiao Chun, for the next few days, stay at Fragrance Garden.

64
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,280
Give your father some time, so he can think it over.

65
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,460
Yes, we'll come back after Guild Master's anger subsides.

66
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,199
He can't bear to not acknowledge you.

67
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:15,620
   

68
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,119
Young Master Liu has never seen 100 boats set sail together.

69
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,720
I want to take him to broaden his horizons. You don't mind, do you?

70
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Of course not.

71
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:39,859
You don't ride horses, do you? Would you like to share a horse with Chuan Yu?

72
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:43,099
You can enjoy the bright spring scenery of Chang'an along the way.

73
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:49,759
I've always treated you with respect. Where did I offend you?

74
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,470
What's wrong?

75
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,040
The Floral Envoy won't let me on this carriage, sending me off to ride a horse.

76
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,679
Perhaps he thinks I'm too sickly and fear I'll spread illness.

77
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:03,600
But how could I possibly ride such a tall horse? What if I accidentally fall?

78
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,979
Are you so intolerant of me?

79
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,940
Arguing or joking is fine, but falsely accusing me of endangering you isn't right, is it?

80
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:23,480
If you want to share the carriage with me, just say so. Why lie and slander others?

81
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,840
This isn't the behavior of a true and virtuous gentleman.

82
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,679
I know I was wrong.

83
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:35,380
Since you know you're wrong, shouldn't you apologize to your brother-in-law?

84
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,319
I'm sorry, I won't do this again in the future.

85
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:47,219
It's okay.

86
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,480
I won't go to the dock today. Sister...

87
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,400
Sister, you and Brother-in-law should set off now. Don't miss the time.

88
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,660
All right. Since we've promised you, how can we break our word?

89
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,419
I'll go with Chuan Yu and get the horse.

90
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,319
Get on the carriage.

91
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:08,599
Your sister has always been like this.

92
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:12,120
She still explains the principles, and also fears you may actually get hurt.

93
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,919
Just ride with us in the same carriage.

94
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:28,020
No need to thank me. Being a brother-in-law, it's the right thing to do.

95
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,799
 Candided haws. 
   

96
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,500
 Fragrant sachets! 

97
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,740
This river is wide, and the dock is extraordinary.

98
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,839
 Pitch-pot for prizes! 

99
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,340
Young Master Liu, look.

100
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,100
There's a pitch-pot for prizes stall over there. Let's go and play together.

101
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,740
 Pitch-pot for prizes! 

102
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,060
My arm strength is insufficient. I'm sure I'll miss the target, so forget it.

103
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,359
I understand.

104
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:04,539
I'm a humble servant while you're Young Madam's younger brother.

105
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:07,679
You definitely wouldn't want to play with people like us.

106
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,080
- That's not the case, Iâ€¦ 
 - Then you're willing! Let's go.

107
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,280
Young Master Liu, go play. Give that to me.

108
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,160
Let's go! Come on.

109
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Have fun.

110
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:30,980
I just said you're not scheming and magnanimous.

111
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,319
Why are you teasing Young Master Liu now?

112
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:38,740
I just gave Chuan Yu a glance. Chuan Yu used his methods against him.

113
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,040
Your bias is strong, you're blaming me now.

114
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,400
Young Master Liu is sensitive in nature and somewhat biased in his actions.

115
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,000
I actually know all his little tricks.

116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,679
But I believe that with careful instruction, this can be changed.

117
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,479
We're all family, naturally, we should be more tolerant.

118
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:00,600
Why are you arguing with a child?

119
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:04,559
Okay, okay, it's your good brother.

120
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,220
In the future, I'll be more patient and teach carefully, okay?

121
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:14,359
Previously, the sailors represented them in discussions.

122
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:18,320
Now the letter says it's the bowman who wants to see me.

123
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,839
I don't know who the other party is.

124
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,520
I don't know if he'll be satisfied with the gifts I brought.

125
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:29,459
Make way, make way.

126
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,360
Make way.

127
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,260
- Hey, watch your step. 
 - Make way.

128
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,340
Make way.

129
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,420
What are you looking at?

130
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,240
The prosperous scene.

131
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,719
 The finest spring tea! 

132
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,619
 Here it is, please enjoy. 

133
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,780
Miss He.

134
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,399
I'll head in then.

135
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,620
Please come inside.

136
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,880
   

137
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,559
You're here.

138
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,640
What does this mean? My husband is still waiting by the shore.

139
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,699
If he sees that I haven't returned for a long time, he'll definitely cause a scene.

140
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,800
I know your temperament.

141
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,479
If I make any move, you'll jump into the river to leave.

142
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,760
When does it need to come to him?

143
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,959
Since we're here, why not have a cup of tea?

144
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,440
Let's discuss business before leaving.

145
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,880
 What exactly does Prince Ning want to smuggle? 

146
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,500
 Normal merchant ships can't hold it, so he needs to privately build such a big ship. 

147
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:13,359
It snows in the winter, and the docks freeze over.

148
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:16,800
The boatman told me the rules of the ships.

149
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,720
When the snow melts and sailing resumes,

150
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,940
the first block of river ice is kept to brew tea.

151
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,939
To bless the new year with calm seas and smooth journeys.

152
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,400
I didn't originally believe it. But since I thought I'd see you today,

153
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,419
I decided to seek some good fortune.

154
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,220
You invited me here today, what exactly for?

155
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:57,819
It's been a long time since I last saw you. Let's reminisce first, then talk business.

156
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,040
After my grand wedding, I made up my mind

157
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,599
to handle my duties well and achieve political accomplishments.

158
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:09,800
Then greet you with a new version of myself.

159
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,439
These days I've been dredging silt, expanding the river channels,

160
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:14,268
forming a fleet, and expanding navigation.

161
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:17,000
I've won public praise.

162
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:20,280
It's because I thought of you,

163
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,160
that I designated this pier for both official and civilian use.

164
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,640
A market is open for crew purchases.

165
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,439
Merchants became wealthy, and the people found convenience.

166
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:33,380
Today's prosperity is also due to your contribution.

167
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,719
Congratulations on achieving your past vision, but this has nothing to do with me.

168
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:45,520
It wasn't easy for you, so I hope you'll cherish it.

169
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,020
Let's talk about matters related to you then.

170
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:04,819
If you transport goods here, you can be exempt from taxes and enjoy priority departure rights.

171
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,859
Thank you for the kind offer, but I can't accept a reward without merit.

172
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:13,300
I hope you'll treat me the same as other merchants.

173
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,119
You're indeed the same old He Wei Fang.

174
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:22,000
But I'm no longer the Liu Chang I used to be.

175
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:28,459
Now I have nothing but patience for my goals and the people I seek.

176
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,760
I'll break next year's river ice with you and brew tea together.

177
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,159
We can't be a couple, but I hope for a long-lasting companionship.

178
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:47,439
Abducting a married woman, neglecting husbandly virtues.

179
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:51,520
If Prince Ning heard your words, what would he think?

180
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,719
Liu Chang, I originally thought you would've realized something.

181
00:16:56,719 --> 00:17:02,920
I didn't expect that you've not only made no progress, but still indulge in delusion.

182
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,839
You and I have long been unrelated.

183
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,340
If you act willfully, it'll only harm others and yourself.

184
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,760
I've said my piece. If there's nothing else, please dock.

185
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,980
Mu Dan.

186
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,070
We have a long future ahead of us.

187
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,580
- Dock. 
 - Yes, Sir.

188
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,639
Young Master Jiang, you seem quite free today.

189
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,319
Accompanying us and waiting here for me.

190
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,359
There's truly no other purpose?

191
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:49,019
Liu Chang was meeting with you. As your husband, shouldn't I watch closely?

192
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,399
Since you knew it was him, why didn't you tell me in advance?

193
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:59,079
I only knew he had built this pier.

194
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:04,079
Who would have thought he would disguise as a bowman and secretly meet someone else's wife?

195
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,379
Don't talk nonsense.

196
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:09,910
I didn't have a secret meeting with him. My relationship with him is innocent.

197
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,400
I was here to discuss business.

198
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,219
You didn't even present the gifts. Seems the discussion didn't go well.

199
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,280
Just now I happened upon this item in the market.

200
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,559
I heard the mother-of-pearl bracelet can reflect light.

201
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,359
By day, it shows wealth, and by night, it lights up with beautiful people.

202
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,580
In the future, it'll be more convenient for you to tend flowers and plants at night.

203
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,119
This is nice.

204
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:53,879
Isn't this like an affordable and portable night pearl for commoners?

205
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:55,800
This is a good business opportunity.

206
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,019
In your mind, there's nothing but business?

207
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:01,559
Just now on the boat, you two...

208
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,119
I saw that this fruit wasn't ripe. Fortunately I didn't eat it.

209
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,599
Enjoy the sourness.

210
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,899
He Wei Fang, even His Majesty never asked me to taste poison, youâ€¦

211
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,580
Young Master, the merchants appreciate your kindness and have sent you another batch of tea cakes.

212
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,079
Young Master strolled around the newly opened market at the pier after work.

213
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,680
Then, he returned to the Taoguang Courtyard.

214
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,559
For dinner, he had two pieces of Hu cakes and a bowl of soup.

215
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,060
He also ate cherries after the meal.

216
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,720
Cherries? He never liked eating this fruit.

217
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,000
But the young servant said not only did he eat it, he ate a lot.

218
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,200
Maybe this year's cherries are big and sweet, so he wanted something fresh.

219
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,199
I understand Zi Shu. He's stubborn,

220
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:17,459
it's very difficult to change what he likes or dislikes.

221
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,259
How could he suddenly change his taste?

222
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:26,579
After Zi Shu falls asleep, secretly call over the people who were with him one by one.

223
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:29,530
- I want to interrogate them. 
 - Yes.

224
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,490
   

225
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,200
The Princess has made herself very clear. What are your plans?

226
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,919
Your Highness, Floral Haven has always conducted business properly without any errors.

227
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,240
Now, Miss He is on good terms with Consort Shu, and the Floral Envoy's beloved wife.

228
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,839
I'm incompetent and really don't know how to handle this.

229
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:08,200
Is it incompetence or unwillingness to handle it?

230
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
I dare not.

231
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,839
Your Highness, I heard He Wei Fang incited the Guild Master's daughter to leave home.

232
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,440
She even exposed herself in her clinic to diagnose illnesses for people.

233
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,720
He Wei Fang treated the Lu family like this, yet the Guild Master endures it.

234
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,159
I'm afraid it's truly incompetence.

235
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,760
How can the position of guild master be held by someone incompetent?

236
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,039
When this flower withers, if Floral Haven is still around,

237
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,780
there's no need for the Lu family to exist.

238
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,300
Your Highness, please allow me to report!

239
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,000
Stop the carriage!

240
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,759
Who is so presumptuous and dares to run into the Princess' carriage!

241
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,780
I'm from the flower guild and am willing to share Your Highness's worries.

242
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:45,099
Go and make arrangements properly. Act cautiously,

243
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,960
don't say what you shouldn't.

244
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,359
I understand.

245
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,580
Once this matter is handled well, the guild will change.

246
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,760
My daughter, you've been so wronged.

247
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,399
Everyone!

248
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:15,419
After taking the Tranquil Health Clinic Yunbin Pill, Madam Wu died.

249
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,599
Ruthless merchants manufacture fake medicine, harming lives!

250
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:22,340
Today, we must give justice to the victim!

251
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:26,319
Hundreds of Yunbin Pills have been sold without any incidents.

252
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,760
I took Madam Wu's pulse.

253
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,960
Her constitution suits Yunbin Pill. There would definitely be no problem.

254
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,580
There must be other reasons.

255
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,180
As a woman, what do you know about medical principles?

256
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,200
You've just being tricked by He Wei Fang to do business.

257
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,659
- Don't make mistake after mistake! 
 - No.

258
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:44,259
The real harmful scoundrel is He Wei Fang! Come out, He Wei Fang!

259
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:47,599
- Come out!
 - Harmful scoundrel!

260
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,459
The harmful scoundrel is He Wei Fang!

261
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:53,960
There's nothing wrong with the clinic's pills! I have evidence!

262
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:04,300
Everyone, I know the sale of medicine involves the health of the people, so we must be cautious.

263
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:10,119
A part of every batch of medicine from the clinic is stored in the storeroom.

264
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,760
- That's right.
 - This is the sample on the day Madam Wu bought it.

265
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,240
The storeroom records the dates of deposit and withdrawal on a slip.

266
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,900
There is a seal on this brocade box, which can prove that I've never touched it.

267
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,919
I will hand over this box sealed intact to the authorities for inspection.

268
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,960
To prove that there's absolutely no problem with our clinic's pills.

269
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Madam Wu's death has nothing to do with Tranquil Health Clinic.

270
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,779
She's willing to let authorities inspect it. She must have a clear conscience.

271
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:39,280
- There definitely shouldn't be a problem. 
 - Exactly.

272
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,760
- Exactly. 
 - Better to investigate thoroughly.

273
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,720
Miss He, what's the point of proving the pills are harmless?

274
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,199
If the medical skill is poor and misdiagnosis occurs, even good medicine

275
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:51,960
can still cause death.

276
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,580
The coroner's report is here,

277
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,280
proving Madam Wu's stomach was extremely weak and died from food consumption.

278
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,200
But her diet was no different from usual, except for the recently bought Yunbin Pill.

279
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,399
This medicine is the culprit!

280
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:13,940
Do you believe the arguments of a deceitful merchant, or the words on paper?

281
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,559
Give me back my daughter's life.

282
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,559
Madam. Calm down.

283
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,019
- This is the Yunbin Pill.
 - Xiao Chun!

284
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,839
The harmful, life-taking medicine cannot be kept.

285
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,000
Stop hitting her!

286
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,824
Tranquil Health Clinic can't stay!

287
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,220
- Give it back to me.
 - Take them away!

288
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,319
- What are you doing?
 - Stop!

289
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,799
- What are you doing? 
 - Move!

290
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:35,279
- This has nothing to do with the clinic! 
 - You've got the wrong person. It wasn't us!

291
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,740
Give me back my daughter.

292
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,530
   

293
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,219
Don't cry, Xiao Chun. I'm all right.

294
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:21,340
Don't worry about me.

295
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,720
I dragged you into this today. I'm sorry.

296
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,699
If you hadn't helped me open the clinic, Cao Yu Ying wouldn't have found this excuse.

297
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:39,980
I just don't know who the person behind him is.

298
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,450
They even bribed the County Magistrate.

299
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,160
We'll know sooner or later.

300
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:55,699
What's most important is how we prove our innocence.

301
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,839
If I could closely examine Madam Wu, I could find why she died.

302
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:07,680
Unfortunately, we're trapped here,

303
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,970
I can't do anything.

304
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:16,120
I don't know if my father has heard about this.

305
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,620
Would he be worried?

306
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,750
When people are in distress,

307
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:28,159
the first person they think of is the one they care about the most.

308
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,960
You were angry with him before, but now he's still the one you worry about most.

309
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,229
Don't cry anymore.

310
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:41,480
After we get out,

311
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,480
you should go home and have a good talk with him. Okay?

312
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,119
Don't cry.

313
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:55,319
Half an incense stick time, finish speaking, and then leave.

314
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,319
Thank you, Sir.

315
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,100
Father...

316
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,200
Hurry, go on.

317
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,000
Chun'er.

318
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,359
Father.

319
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,720
How did you get injured like this?

320
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:18,600
It was Mu Dan protecting me,

321
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,680
- otherwise, it would've been worse.
 - If you had listened and stayed home to get married,

322
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,279
you wouldn't have to suffer like this.

323
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,850
Shopkeeper He, you protected my daughter in times of trouble.

324
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,200
I'm immensely grateful.

325
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,419
But you women doing business ultimately caused trouble.

326
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,520
Do you also think that my poor medical skills caused someone's death?

327
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,300
That's not important. Rescuing you two is what matters most.

328
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,440
This is important. It's the most important thing to me.

329
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,800
Today's disaster wasn't because of my practice. We were deliberately framed.

330
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,559
I researched the prescription for months. Hundreds have taken it without adverse effects.

331
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,319
Patients whom I've never met were willing to trust my medical skills.

332
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:12,839
Why is it worthless in your eyes? Why won't you trust me?

333
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:15,660
- You're my father. 
 - Xiao Chun.

334
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,520
Guild Master, it's really not Xiao Chun's fault.

335
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,739
It started because of me. I implicated her.

336
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:37,240
I'll definitely find a way to prove Xiao Chun's innocence.

337
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,520
The key to this case now is whether there's a problem with the medicine.

338
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,639
You're already in such a condition. How can you prove her innocence?

339
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:47,240
I told you not to push her into the fire pit.

340
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,580
A woman practicing medicine will constantly encounter problems.

341
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,910
Since you're convinced that my medical practice caused a disaster, dishonoring the Lu family,

342
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,639
in the future, you don't have a daughter anymore.

343
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:03,960
Guild Master, please go back.

344
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,119
It's come to this point, and you're still so stubborn.

345
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,880
Do you really want to die in prison?!

346
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,840
Guild Master, can you really bear to let Xiao Chun bear a murder charge?

347
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,780
Will you let it end like this, unclear and unresolved?

348
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,300
Calmly think it over.

349
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,440
If we really caused her death, why won't the County Magistrate hold a public trial?

350
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,019
Why would he rather violate the law to use private punishment against us?

351
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:35,520
Why force us to confess and sign?

352
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,839
Only by clarifying all these issues

353
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,979
can Xiao Chun truly be exonerated.

354
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,420
It really can shine at night.

355
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,730
Jiang Chang Yang didn't lie to me.

356
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:25,890
In times of trouble,

357
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:31,270
was the first person I thought of... really you?

358
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:03,480
Xiao Chun's father had to bribe all around to get in.

359
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,559
You came in so easily, you're indeed the Floral Envoy.

360
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:15,380
The case hasn't yet been clarified, yet they dare torture you.

361
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,860
Who gave the order?

362
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,180
In Chang'an, who else can pin such a crime on me without due process?

363
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:29,800
And ignore your dignity to accuse me of such a great crime?

364
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,939
Naturally, it could only be that person.

365
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,079
Where are we going?

366
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:44,960
Taking my wife away from here.

367
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,040
No, if I go with you,

368
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,219
it would truly make me a profiteer who relies on official power to take lives?

369
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,919
Someone is putting pressure on the Magistrate. He won't handle it impartially.

370
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:04,399
I must thoroughly investigate this case

371
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,979
and find irrefutable evidence to bring it to trial.

372
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,459
I want Cao Yu Ying and the County Magistrate to see.

373
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:15,960
Let the entire city's people and the person behind this see.

374
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,399
Xiao Chun and I will walk out of this cell with dignity, innocent.

375
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,500
All right.

376
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,159
However, if I do nothing when my wife is in trouble, isn't that suspicious?

377
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,119
You must already have a plan in mind.

378
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:39,959
If there's anything you need, just let me know.

379
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:46,700
Thank you for your righteous support.

380
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,440
Although I can't leave this cell now,

381
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,040
I've already planned all the matters regarding the investigation.

382
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,573
Just pass on a message for me.

383
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:00,230
   

384
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,719
How is it?

385
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,080
Envoy Jiang, Madam Wu had previously given birth.

386
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,839
It wasn't the weak stomach that led to her death.

387
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:17,299
When she should've been nourished, she consumed large amounts of toxic cold food.

388
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:20,919
This resulted in continuous bleeding and blood deficiency, leading to death.

389
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:24,196
I'm worried that the coroner had been bribed. We changed the person inspecting,

390
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:26,760
but still couldn't diagnose the illness. Why is this?

391
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,800
Most coroners are men and naturally understand common illnesses,

392
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,160
but many women are too embarrassed to seek treatment when ill.

393
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,399
They haven't seen as many female patients as we female physicians have.

394
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,520
It's common for them to overlook hidden ailments in female corpses.

395
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:45,720
No wonder Mu Dan asked me to message Consort Shu to find a female physician.

396
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,210
The Yunbin Pill is mild and harmless.

397
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,550
Madam Wu must have died from consuming something else.

398
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,660
I understand.

399
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,310
Please convey my gratitude to Consort Shu upon returning to the palace.

400
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,659
Young Master.

401
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,180
Da Fu has followed Madam's arrangements and gathered all the evidence.

402
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,839
Madam Tang learned from the flower guild's floriculturist,

403
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,919
 Madam Wu was Cao Yu Ying's concubine, usually hidden in Dingzi Alley. 

404
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:27,479
 He doesn't understand medicine, so five days ago, he found a physician, 

405
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:30,439
 said his concubine had just given birth and asked about dietary restrictions. 

406
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:36,200
 Next, he went to a pharmacy and bought some cold items for postpartum women. 

407
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Someone in Dingzi Alley saw him carrying crabs and bezoar to Madam Wu's home.

408
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,479
The next day, her death was reported.

409
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:45,720
Da Fu has obtained testimony from all parties.

410
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,999
There's a purchase receipt from the pharmacy, and food scraps from Madam Wu's kitchen.

411
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:53,720
Tomorrow in court, Madam will surely be able to clear her name.

412
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,939
Young Master, rest assured.

413
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,519
To ensure no future trouble, there's still someone I must meet with.

414
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:20,620
Why did you have the time to grace Prince Ning Residence today?

415
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,280
These days, my concubine was framed and suffered imprisonment.

416
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,739
I was so furious that I made a scene at the government office.

417
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:36,039
However, I unexpectedly found something missing from your residence, so I came to return it.

418
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,800
So, you're here to demand justice.

419
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,039
He Wei Fang caused me to fall from my horse.

420
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:56,039
I didn't kill her, that was already merciful.

421
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:02,879
Your plight invokes sympathy, but what's done cannot be undone.

422
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:06,739
Now you've married your beloved as you wished.

423
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:12,519
His Highness sought justice for you and promoted Zi Shu to Deputy Transport Officer.

424
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:16,519
Now he's flourishing like the rising sun, and His Highness has gained a valuable person.

425
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:19,979
It can be said that everyone is satisfied and got what they wanted.

426
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,660
Why do you keep holding onto my wife?

427
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:30,680
How can the justice my father sought for me

428
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,680
make up for the heart-wrenching pain I suffered?

429
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,979
I can't say whether it can be made up for or not.

430
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:45,680
But since His Highness promised me at that time, I don't regret this decision.

431
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:48,959
If you insist on regretting the move,

432
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:53,039
I don't mind being a scoundrel and making a scene in front of His Majesty.

433
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,479
The granted position can be withdrawn.

434
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,399
What exactly do you want?

435
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,640
You suffered from falling off the horse, and my concubine was seriously injured in prison.

436
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,760
In my opinion, let's call it even and put this matter behind us completely.

437
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,280
From now on, I'll continue to maintain a close relationship with His Highness.

438
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,419
However, you and Zi Shu should have less interaction with us two,

439
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:30,280
so as not to trigger distress.

440
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,200
After all, the most important thing for you two is the harmony between spouses.

441
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,399
What do you think, Princess?

442
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:56,959
Let's do as you say.

443
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:03,680
Returning the lost item was not easy.

444
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,300
A slightest negligence may result in losing it again. I hope you'll cherish it.

445
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:28,180
Your Highness, are you really going to let He Wei Fang go just like that?

446
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:44,220
Jiang Chang Yang cherishes Miss He so much, and she has no interest in Zi Shu.

447
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:49,180
It seems Zi Shu doesn't have a chance.

448
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,690
Let it be.

449
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,420
Yes.

450
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,039
What about Cao Yu Ying?

451
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:03,600
Rest assured, Your Highness. He still has a family.

452
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,120
No matter what crime he's convicted of, he'll bear it and won't speak carelessly.

453
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:13,139
I'll handle everything properly. Young Master won't find anything out.

454
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,879
Cao Yu Ying poisoned a civilian woman and framed others.

455
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,339
The evidence is conclusive. He ought to be executed!

456
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,680
The execution will take place after autumn.

457
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,099
The two from Tranquil Health Clinic are innocent and are to be released immediately.

458
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:34,600
 - Great! 
 - Great! 

459
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,720
Animal! Give me back my daughter!

460
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,730

 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining 

463
00:41:03,823 --> 00:41:11,097
â™«  On the endless road to Chang'an, 
 the zither and lute's melody echoes from afar  â™«

464
00:41:12,051 --> 00:41:19,411
â™«  Plum and willow trees greet the Spring, 
 as splendor returns this year  â™«

465
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:27,603
â™«  Copper battlements shine as songs, dances, and glasses fill the palace air  â™«

466
00:41:27,603 --> 00:41:35,855
â™«  Idle clouds and drifting duckweed, with a thousand flowers blooming  â™«

467
00:41:35,855 --> 00:41:44,152
â™«  Time flows gracefully, with moments gathering in the fading mist  â™«

468
00:41:44,152 --> 00:41:52,339
â™«  Let the years pass, carried by the wind toward long-held desires  â™«

469
00:41:52,339 --> 00:42:00,755
â™«  If the heart remains as still as water, youth becomes eternal  â™«

470
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:08,655
â™«  Still cherishing the moon of my hometown, yearning to meet again  â™«

471
00:42:28,723 --> 00:42:36,907
â™«  The distant night sky, scattered with stars, reflects the gentle moon  â™«

472
00:42:36,907 --> 00:42:44,258
â™«  The peony's exquisite beauty fills the fragrant garden  â™«

473
00:42:44,258 --> 00:42:52,344
â™«  With my heart as a lantern, I fear not the journey through distant mountain paths  â™«

474
00:42:52,344 --> 00:43:00,653
â™«  The jade flute's music fills a fleeting life with meaning  â™«

475
00:43:00,653 --> 00:43:08,915
â™«  Time flows gracefully, with moments gathering in the fading mist  â™«

476
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:17,071
â™«  Let the years pass, carried by the wind toward long-held desires  â™«

477
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:25,599
â™«  If the heart remains as still as water, youth becomes eternal  â™«

478
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:33,599
â™«  Still cherishing the moon of my hometown, yearning to meet again  â™«
