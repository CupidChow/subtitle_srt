1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,980


2
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:37,074
In the Name of Blossom

3
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:40,020
 

4
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:58,619
Why has the carriage stopped?

5
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,419
This is the official road for the government.
How dare you cause trouble?

6
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:03,239
Shut your mouth.

7
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,079
Oh no, there are mountain bandits.

8
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,179
Get them!

9
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,580
My flowers!

10
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,539
- Mu Dan.
- What's going on…

11
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:16,700
Are you the person in charge?

12
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,860
Yes, what's going on here, gentlemen?

13
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,779
Let's talk it out. Please don't hurt
my people or my flowers.

14
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:27,920
Flowers? My whole family of seven
can't even afford food.

15
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,740
And yet you are protecting a few lousy flowers.

16
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,159
Take them all away! Take them away!

17
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,880
- Let's go.
- Get up there!

18
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:58,339
For Minister Zheng's birthday,
even Prince Ning sent a gift.

19
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:02,800
It shows that Minister Zheng
is truly favored by His Majesty.

20
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,300
Not at all, not at all.

21
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,830
His Highness bestows a little favor on me,

22
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,870
and I am sincerely flattered.

23
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:20,540
In the future, I must strive more for the court
and alleviate the worries of His Majesty.

24
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:25,140
Minister Zheng, your moral character is admirable.

25
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,740
I also hope that you can guide and support me.

26
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,399
Of course, of course.

27
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:38,140
Why hasn't Mr. Jiang returned yet?

28
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,900
Could it be that he drank too much and got lost?

29
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,700
I saw him drink several cups. He's quite drunk.

30
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,379
Perhaps he's sobering up in the arms of a beauty.

31
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,240
Oh, you…

32
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,640
Come on, let's drink.

33
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,590
- To the Minister, to the Minister!
- Okay.

34
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,399
 She Yan discovered that the gift list and ledger
are hidden in a secret compartment in the study. 

35
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:19,220
 

36
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,639
Minister Zheng.

37
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,419
Mr. Jiang.

38
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,580
Let me offer you a toast.

39
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,639
Mr. Jiang, you are drunk.

40
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,419
Am I drunk?

41
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:49,299
Where am I?

42
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:50,999
Mr. Jiang.

43
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,339
Mr. Jiang, how did you end up here?
The minister is looking for you.

44
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:05,639
Today is Minister Zheng's birthday.
How could I lose my composure like this?

45
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,960
Please apologize to the minister on my behalf.

46
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:18,800
I can't hold my liquor,
so I shall take my leave first.

47
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,879
Mr. Jiang, please be careful.

48
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,299
That was close.

49
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:40,739
Zheng is quite cautious.
He even set a trap in the study.

50
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:43,739
A trap? Mr. Jiang, are you hurt?

51
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:46,139
- I… 
 - Is it the carriage of the Floral Envoy?

52
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,879
Indeed it is.

53
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,500
What are you doing here?

54
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,219
The servant in the Jiang Mansion told me that you
went to the Minister of Revenue's birthday party.

55
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:57,299
It's so late. Why are you looking for me?

56
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:59,319
Something happened to Mu Dan.

57
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,460
Get in the carriage and tell me.

58
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,360
Mu Dan led people to deliver goods and got robbed.
This is what the store clerk brought back.

59
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,160
The bandits said we needed
to bring 200 strings as her ransom.

60
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,820
The clerk has already driven the carriage
with the money into the mountains.

61
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,539
But what if the bandits don't keep their word?

62
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,679
What if they take the money
and don't release them?

63
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,053
 

64
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,979
Your body cannot withstand rushing all night.
Get off at the inn ahead.

65
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:38,060
No, if you let me down,
I'll run to find Mu Dan myself.

66
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,060
Don't worry. I won't cause trouble
once we get there.

67
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,739
If I encounter any danger,
I'll hide and report it to Chuan Yu.

68
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:47,360
If you don't want to fall, hold tight.

69
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,239
You're hurt.

70
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,300
It's just a minor injury. It's fine.

71
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:04,140
The bandits agreed to meet
at the stele on the post road.

72
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,419
Why are we stopping here?

73
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,539
Sheng County is not far from Chang'an,
so there are no big groups of bandits around.

74
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,299
They are most likely local farmers or hunters.

75
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:17,079
The meeting place shouldn't be
far from their hiding spot.

76
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,199
This is the only inhabited village
within ten miles of the stele.

77
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,720
Who's there?

78
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,460
No, it's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.

79
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,620
Everyone, put down your swords.
Put them down quickly.

80
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,320
Put down your swords.

81
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:24,099
What are you doing here?
Didn't you receive my second letter?

82
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:27,260
Weren't you kidnapped by the bandits?
What's going on?

83
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,979
It's all a misunderstanding. They're not bandits.

84
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,219
Then why are your eyes red and why did you scream?

85
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,160
I was just making a fire over there,
and the smoke got in my eyes.

86
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,140
Rushing here all night,
what if your old illness relapses?

87
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,220
Let Chun take a good look at you later.

88
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,500
I'm fine, but Mr. Jiang, though.

89
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,479
If he isn't treated soon, he might bleed out.

90
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,480
Why are you bleeding so much? You…

91

You said before,

00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,130
that if danger were to arise,

107
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,310
you would send me away from Chang'an.

108
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,060
But no matter where a person is,

109
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,860
they can encounter misfortunes.

110
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:32,740
Therefore, if I stay by your side,

111
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,070
it seems you would feel more at ease, right?

Normally, a superficial wound should be fine
after cleaning and applying medicine.

124
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,419
But the wound infection has caused a high fever,
and there's not much medicine in the village.

125
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:59,539
I'm afraid he'll have to
make it through the night on his own.

126
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:04,439
If the fever subsides after dawn,
only then will this crisis be safely over.

127
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:13,240
There are many patients in the Village
waiting for you to care for them.

128
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,480
Finish stitching the wound,
then go ahead with your work. Leave this to me.

It seems like the Floral Envoy is
usually very meticulous about health care.

150
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:55,299
Your recovery is much faster than others.

151
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,579
I told you I'm fine.

152
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:00,059
The high fever has temporarily subsided,
but it will relapse for a few more days.

153
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,939
You must not take it lightly.

154
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:06,500
You must wait until the heat toxin from the wound
is completely gone before moving around.

155
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,400
Listen to Chun.

156
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,990
I'll take it.

157
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:16,140
I can do it myself.

158
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:21,240
Listen to Chun. If the wound tears again,
we'll still have to trouble her.

159
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,539
Chun already has many patients to care for.
She'll be overworked.

160
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,340
Patients?

161
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:37,079
Yes, don't you want to know
what happened after we were kidnapped?

162
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:42,740
I'll say it, but you mustn't be violent.

163
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,540
Go ahead, tell me.

164
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:52,100
The two people you encountered last night
were the bandits who kidnapped us.

165
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,640
The day we were kidnapped…

166
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,020
- Hurry up.
- Go, go.

167
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:06,739
They threatened to cut off my hand to force me
to write a ransom letter to the Fragrance Garden.

168
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:27,499
Fu.

169
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,780
Mu Dan.

170
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,480
Chun.

171
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,060
When Fu, Chun, and I were preparing to escape,

172
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,879
we found out that we were not in some bandit lair.

173
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:44,739
Those bandits were not real bandits.

174
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:48,839
They just didn't have any options
due to disaster and disease.

175
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:53,180
To survive, they had to turn to banditry.

176
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:59,580
When I saw those starving children in rags,

177
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,300
I couldn't bring myself to ignore it.

178
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,620
So, we decided not to escape.

179
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,019
We chose to stay and treat the people's illnesses.

180
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,900
The villagers are genuine people.

181
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,459
They were very grateful
when they learned of our decision.

182
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:22,739
I immediately sent a second letter
to the Fragrance Garden to inform our safety.

183
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:25,639
Who would have thought
that Liu Lang would be so fast?

184
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,860
The letter hadn't even arrived,
yet he brought you here first.

185
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,839
Luckily, the bandits were fake.

186
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,860
If you had really entered a bandit's den,
tried recklessly to escape,

187
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,300
and eventually got caught,
they might have really cut your hand off.

188
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,680
Real bandits seek money.

189
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,659
Making money is her expertise.

190
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:46,540
Her silver tongue surely
wouldn't let those bandits cut her…

191
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,739
Drink your porridge.

192
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,559
Anyway, Fu became friends with them after fighting
and now they're sworn siblings.

193
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:02,340
We've been here so long,
but why haven't we seen Fu?

194
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,080
Chun and I discovered that the patients' illness here

195
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,259
is very similar to the plague in Luoyang four years ago.

196
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:13,720
Peony is needed for the medicine. So I sent Fu back to the Fragrance Garden
to get the flowers.

197
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,440
She should return today.

198
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,440
You haven't said anything about yourself.
How did you get injured?

199
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:40,480
I was careless
while doing something for Mr. Third.

200
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,680
Don't you have the golden silk soft armor?

201
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,259
At a colleague's family banquet,
dancing girls are inevitable companions.

202
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,620
It would be bad if one happened to notice.

203
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,700
It seems Mr. Jiang
is rather immersed in this charade.

204
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,639
It's because my beloved left without a word,
leaving me to attend the banquet alone.

205
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:09,019
What's the matter? Has the wound torn open?

206
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:11,979
Let me see and make sure it doesn't bleed.

207
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,660
Mu Dan,

208
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,150
when did you leave last night?

209
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,360
I was feverish.

210
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,480
I didn't say anything nonsensical, did I?

211
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:39,580
After applying a few cloths,
your high fever subsided.

212
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:42,770
Before I left,

213
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,380
you were in a deep sleep and didn't say anything.

214
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,200
What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare?

215
00:20:55,979 --> 00:21:01,480
It's nothing, I just remembered
how cold the cloths were last night.

216
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,819
Just a casual question.

217
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,760
Mr. Jiang, aren't you supposed to be
resting in bed? Why are you out?

218
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:53,699
Since when do you care so much about me?

219
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:56,159
I am just following Mu Dan's instructions.

220
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,119
Did Mu Dan see the blood on the saddle?

221
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,719
No.

222
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,480
What is Mu Dan doing?

223
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,440
She went to the village entrance to meet with Fu.

224
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,040
Let's go and have a look.

225
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:23,839
You have something to say.

226
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,879
The white jade hairpin Mu Dan
gave to you was broken by me.

227
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,140
After the big fire in the Fragrance Garden,
all Mu Dan saw was you.

228
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,639
I was jealous and did something wrong.

229
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,940
I'm sorry.

230
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,860
Why are you telling me this today?

231
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,839
You got injured to save Mu Dan
and shed so much blood.

232
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,860
Yet you rode all night
without even furrowing your brow.

233
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,279
After an all-night coma, the first thing you said upon waking

234
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,879
was to have me clean the blood-stained saddle.

235
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:05,159
You didn't want Mu Dan to feel guilty.

236
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:12,399
You are truly sincere toward her,
and you have the ability to protect her well.

237
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,800
I don't want you to have any rift because of me.

238
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,440
Mu Dan didn't care for you in vain,
and you are truly thinking the best for her.

239
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,399
Rest assured, I won't tell her about this matter.

240
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:38,900
Do you not mind my feelings toward her?

241
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,019
Mu Dan treated your illness
and taught you to read.

242
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:46,699
She was extremely kind to you
and asked for nothing in return.

243
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:52,970
It's perfectly normal for you to develop feelings
of exclusivity and attachment toward her.

244
00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:00,119
But it has nothing to do with romantic affection.
It is a fondness for a family member.

245
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:05,559
Since Mu Dan has accepted you as her brother, even if you make a mistake,

246
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:09,919
she will still teach you carefully and never drive you away.

247
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,800
Don't be overly concerned anymore.
The Fragrance Garden will always be your home.

248
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,859
And Mu Dan will also always be your sister.

249
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,240
- Come, Zhao Zhao. 
 - I want one. I want one.

250
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,620
I met Fu on the way here
and learned the details of the situation.

251
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,140
Compared to money and silk, what the villagers
need more now are food and medicine.

252
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,540
So I brought all the supplies
stored in the residence.

253
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,820
Sure, Chuan Yu, when they see these,
they'll want to become sworn brothers with you.

254
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,820
Come, I'll take you to meet my sworn brother.

255
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,820
- I don't want to be siblings with your brother.
- Do you want some?

256
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,039
- Why? 
 - I…

257
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,359
- You think you're above others. You look down on them.
- No.

258
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,060
Chuan Yu. Mr. Jiang is injured.
You should go and check on him.

259
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,240
Yes.

260
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,580
I'll take you to become sworn brothers later.

261
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,140
Did you send anyone
to the clients of Dingyu Pavilion?

262
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,440
I've already asked the staff to send
the rest of the peonies and money there.

263
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,240
That's good.

264
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,979
- Do you like it? 
 - Yes.

265
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:18,059
Who are you?

266
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,879
What are you transporting?

267
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,900
County Magistrate,
we are flower merchants passing by.

268
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,680
We learned of the epidemic ravaging this place,
causing a lack of food and clothing.

269
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,580
So we brought some food and medicine to help.

270
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:40,340
Merchants prioritize profit over righteousness.

271
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,499
You have no relation to Sheng County,
so why are you being so kind?

272
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:49,259
Are you intending to kidnap children
and engage in human trafficking?

273
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:51,119
Come, tie them up for me.

274
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,340
- Yes.
- How can you accuse people randomly?

275
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,760
County Magistrate,
if I truly intended to kidnap children,

276
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,340
I would use sweets and fruits to lure them.

277
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,860
Magistrate, you can personally
inspect the goods on the cart.

278
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,060
No trafficker would bring peonies
and these items to kidnap people.

279
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,880
- Inspect the goods.
- Yes.

280
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,610
Magistrate!

281
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,480
- Magistrate Yu.
- Village Chief.

282
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,879
Village Chief.

283
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:18,140
Lady He is really here to deliver medicine to us.

284
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,760
Zhao Zhao's mother's illness is all cured.
Zhao Zhao, isn't it?

285
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,520
As a female shopkeeper, you're so wealthy.

286
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,860
Huamanzhu is very famous in Chang'an.

287
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,820
Do you know what title His Majesty gave Mu Dan?
Top flower merchant in the nation.

288
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,540
He even personally wrote the four characters
"National Beauty and Elegance".

289
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,739
It's hung in the Fragrance Garden.
I can take you to see it.

290
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:43,739
You've met His Majesty?

291
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,020
Magistrate, we mean no harm.

292
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,459
You ask me why I want to help these villagers.

293
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,459
It's not easy for a woman to engage in business.

294
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:58,259
Along my journey,
many strangers helped and saved me.

295
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:00,499
The way of heaven shows no favoritism,
and it is often with good people.

296
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:03,380
You are a scholar and a local magistrate.

297
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,760
I believe you will surely understand.

298
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,179
Of course, I can.

299
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:13,540
Just now, I was eager to protect the people.

300
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,440
There's no problem with you doing good deeds,
but you must inform me in advance.

301
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,340
Diagnosing and treating epidemics
is a matter of life and death.

302
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,959
If someone is treated poorly and a lawsuit arises, I will have to handle the aftermath.

303
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:30,060
If you truly cared about the people,
we wouldn't be standing here today.

304
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,860
What do you mean?
Are you implying that I am neglecting my duties?

305
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,419
Yes. When an official neglects their duties,
the people have the right to speak up.

306
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:37,499
- You…
- County Magistrate, my sister is young. She speaks without restraint.

307
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:39,980
- Please don't hold it against her.
- Look at her.

308
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,400
- She's not young. Take her away.
- Yes.

309
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,860
Let me show you what kind of official I am.

310
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,459
County Magistrate, please be the bigger person
and don't stoop to the level of Ms. Fu.

311
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,960
County Magistrate, although she looks like this, her mind is all muddled.

312
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,860
She actually doesn't understand
what you are saying at all.

313
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,939
- Here, I will go with you. 
 - You cannot go.

314
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:02,440
I said what I said.
If you want to punish someone, come at me.

315
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,900
- Take her away.
- Yes.

316
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,880
No! Please don't do that!

317
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,039
- Sister.
- Fu.

318
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,900
- Big sister.
- County Magistrate.

319
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,179
- Fu.
- Sister Fu.

320
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:14,799
Come back. Zhao Zhao, take others and go home.

321
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,240
Village Chief, please have someone
move these goods inside first.

322
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,160
- We will be back soon. Don't worry. 
 - Alright, alright.

323
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,979
Fu.

324
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,450
Take a look for yourself.

325
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,300
Let alone allocating money to buy medicine,

326
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,060
the grain storage in the county
is so empty that not even a rat can be found.

327
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,060
Do you think I don't want to be a good official?

328
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,540
We've never heard that Sheng County
had suffered a locust plague or floods last year.

329
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,179
Where has all the money and grain gone?

330
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,219
Harsh governance is more ferocious than a tiger.

331
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:48,759
The money and grain have likely been
completely extorted by those above.

332
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,979
I too studied arduously for this position.

333
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:55,179
I thought becoming an official
would allow me to bring fortune to the people.

334
00:28:55,179 --> 00:29:00,520
Who knew I could do less than you women?

335
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,699
I used to think
that all officials were prestigious.

336
00:29:09,699 --> 00:29:15,680
I didn't know that as small officials suppressed
by higher-ups, they are more miserable than us.

337
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,619
In today's world, it's not easy to be common people, to do business, or to be an official.

338
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:23,900
If we want everyone to receive justice and peace,

339
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,040
Magistrate Yu can't do it, and neither can we.

340
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,480
So, doesn't that mean there's no hope?

341
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:48,540
No, there must be a group of people
in this world with great aspirations,

342
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,960
who want to create a flourishing age
for all the people in the world.

00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,820
Liu Lang, Fu, go look elsewhere

357
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,720
and see if there are different soil composition.

358
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:03,679
Come quickly.

359
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,779

Good, you must squat down.

366
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,780
This won't do.

367
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,880

Here, let me help you.

370
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,699
- I got this. 
 - Come on, come on.

371
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:21,410
Who is there? Who is pretending
to be mysterious there? Show yourself.

372
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,760
Jiang Chang Yang?

373
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,200
You've been busy all day, so I wanted to clear your head.

374
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,019
Why are you coming out to scare me
instead of resting and healing in bed?

375
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:34,219
And you brought a raincoat.

376
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,979
It looks like it's going to rain.

377
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:38,540
Everyone was busy, so only I could come.

378
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,219
This is the only one found in the village.

379
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:44,999
How can this single raincoat cover both of us?

380
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:48,560
Besides, even if it rains later, you must wear this raincoat.

381
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,619
- Let's go quickly. 
 - My wound is almost healed.

382
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:54,540
If you get sick and delay in saving people,
my sin would be great.

383
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,519
Alright, if we keep talking,
it will really start raining.

384
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:01,580
I'm much stronger than you now, this way.

385
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,480
Alright, alright.

386
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,620
The stars have come out.
It seems it won't rain tonight.

387
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,019
Let's take a break.

388
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,619
Okay.

389
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:44,499
You have become much more relaxed and cheerful
compared to before leaving Chang'an.

390
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:52,499
As I pluck the peonies and save lives,

391
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:54,659
I figured it out.

392
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,979
When I first learned the truth about Mother,

393
00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:02,879
I was indeed overwhelmed with despair
and felt hopeless about the future.

394
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:09,140
But upon arriving at Sheng County,
my thoughts changed.

395
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:14,059
Good and evil, right and wrong,
are just a thought away.

396
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:19,620
Peonies that were once poison can now be medicine.

397
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,900
My mother couldn't save the plague-stricken
victims back then and died with regrets.

398
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:30,300
I will compensate for her regrets in the future.

399
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,879
I will use the money I earn from my business
to help more people.

400
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,299
What about Mr. Wu?

401
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,099
These days, there have been two voices in my mind.

402
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,219
One says that the evil
must eventually be punished.

403
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:03,319
I hope Mr. Wu will never
escape this shadow in his lifetime.

404
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:11,340
But another voice keeps saying that Mr. Wu is also a victim.

405
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:18,539
Sometimes it's really hard to choose
between forgiveness and punishment.

406
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:25,479
I can only say that it's all because of natural
disasters and the injustice of the world.

407
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:32,039
I cannot hate him, nor can I forgive him.

408
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,960
But since Mother chose to let him go back then,

409
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,800
I will not go against her will.

410
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:47,160
I think Mother wouldn't want
to see me punish myself like this.

411
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:57,240
What I can do is think
about how to walk the road ahead.

412
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:06,230
When you return to Chang'an
after curing the villagers,

413
00:36:07,184 --> 00:36:09,760
you won't shut down
the Fragrance Garden again, will you?

414
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,340
Most people look down on merchants,
thinking they value profit over righteousness.

415
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,240
I will take my father as a warning

416
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,740
and do my best to change
people's prejudice against merchants.

417
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:30,359
I want to let everyone know that doing business
can also contribute to the country.

418
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:37,720
You know, this is a very difficult road to walk.

419
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:43,040
When I saw the empty granaries of Sheng County

420
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,939
and heard the County Magistrate's helpless sigh,

421
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:48,220
I already knew.

422
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:57,740
Magistrate Yu may not be a good official,
but he won't occupy the position and do nothing.

423
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,239
His superior is one of Prince Ning's partisans,
who deceive and conceal the truth.

424
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,159
They hinder the imperial court's
tax reduction policies,

425
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:09,539
causing all counties around Chang'an
to be overwhelmed with worries.

426
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:16,900
Even if ants give their all,
they can only save a limited number of people.

427
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:23,380
Only when those in power
truly cherish the lives of the people

428
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:28,479
can we stand as people in the world
rather than as ants.

429
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:40,039
Jiang Chang Yang, the great cause you are pursuing
is also my lifelong wish, starting today.

430
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:46,740
This has nothing to do with you. I want to support
an emperor who is diligent and loves the people.

431
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:52,260
Only when the nation is clear and peaceful
can all the people live and work in harmony.

432
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,200
Only then can I let ordinary people
witness the beauty of the peony.

433
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,579
Look, this is the Sanqi grass.

434
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:16,679
To cure your severe injury and blood loss, Chun
discovered it in the forests of Sheng County.

435
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,400
Do you want the villagers
to make a living from this?

436
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,900
There are many medicinal herbs
in the mountains of Sheng County.

437
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,719
As long as they are identified one by one,
they can be picked and sold.

438
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,180
This can temporarily alleviate
the villagers' livelihood issues.

439
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:37,099
However, it is better to teach a person to fish
than to give them fish.

440
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:41,259
As for how they can make a living in the future,
I still have to think it over carefully.

441
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,499
I think you're not only reshaping
the way of business,

442
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:52,540
but also cultivating more business people
to get rich with you.

443
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,220
Sister, here you go.

444
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,639
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

445
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,960
Brother, here.

446
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,539
Thank you.

447
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:12,939
Ms. Mu Dan.

448
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:14,340
What is this, Zhao Zhao?

449
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,099
This is an idol of an immortal I made for you.

450
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,499
This was made in the likeness of Mu Dan, right?

451
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:22,099
The eyes of the idol are Mu Dan's,

452
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:27,340
the body is Chun's, and the hands are Fu's.

453
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,300
Thank you, Zhao Zhao.
Your hands are so skillful, and we love it.

454
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,459
When you leave, I will put it back in the temple.

455
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:40,499
I wish you peace and safety, and I also hope that
you will bless Mother so she won't fall ill again.

456
00:39:40,499 --> 00:39:44,860
Zhao Zhao, when Mother was ill,
did you pray to the immortal?

457
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,939
I did.

458
00:39:45,939 --> 00:39:47,960
Did your mother's illness get better?

459
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,820
No, but you came.

460
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:58,619
Zhao Zhao, the immortals are high and far away.
There are many people praying to them every day.

461
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:00,579
It's inevitable that they might not hear you.

462
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:03,999
We also have our homes,
and we can't be here forever.

463
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:07,979
So it's better to rely on oneself
than on others or immortals.

464
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:11,820
Rely on myself? But I can't do anything.

465
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,019
As long as you study hard,
you will eventually learn a skill.

466
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:19,399
Zhao Zhao, only by making yourself strong,

467
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:23,339
can you always protect yourself
and your family, do you understand?

468
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,019
Then I want to become a shop owner like you,

469
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:31,979
earning a lot of money,
and helping a lot of people.

470
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:33,479
Good girl.

471
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:57,490
 

472
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:10,950


473

song credit

474
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:27,160
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

475
00:41:28,114 --> 00:41:35,574
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

476
00:41:35,574 --> 00:41:43,666
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

477
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:52,018
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫ 

478
00:41:52,018 --> 00:42:00,215
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

479
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:08,502
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

480
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:16,818
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

481
00:42:16,818 --> 00:42:24,818
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

482
00:42:44,786 --> 00:42:52,970
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫ 

483
00:42:52,970 --> 00:43:00,421
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

484
00:43:00,421 --> 00:43:08,507
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫ 

485
00:43:08,507 --> 00:43:16,816
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫ 

486
00:43:16,816 --> 00:43:24,978
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

487
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:33,234
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

488
00:43:33,234 --> 00:43:41,662
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

489
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:49,762
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
