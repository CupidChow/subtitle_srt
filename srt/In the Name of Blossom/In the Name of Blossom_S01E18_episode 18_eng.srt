1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,030


2
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:39,860
 

3
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:45,940
So you mean to have Father cut off the oil
and grain supplies for the two cities,

4
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,419
making it impossible for them
to study and prepare for the exams?

5
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:52,020
The Minister of Agriculture is supposed
to conduct regular inspections of storage.

6
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,020
I think it's normal for them to inspect
till the Imperial Exam results are released.

7
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,820
I have already spoken to people
in charge of various pastures.

8
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,859
From today, all kinds of poultry
also need to be inspected.

9
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:10,600
Without access to the markets,
they can't even make oil on their own.

10
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,819
Truly brilliant!

11
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,420
With high certainty.

12
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,180
Mr. Liu, you are truly brilliant.

13
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,020
Without the oil lamp,

14
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,340
they can't study for long every day, will certainly be in disarray.

15
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,260
I just fear my son can't be enlightened.

16
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,499
Once it comes to the policy essay,
he couldn't write a few lines.

17
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,428
Father.

18
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:34,160
Everyone, you've assisted a lot to His Highness.

19
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,140
So he is concerned about your worries.

20
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,570
If you knew the exam question in advance,
do you still fear not achieving a high rank?

21
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,939
Zhang Qiu Feng is too reckless in his actions.

22
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:58,180
By the time I received the news,
the Jiang Mansion had already been confiscated.

23
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,939
I truly feel guilty.

24
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:04,988
Sui Zhi, do not have a grudge against me

25
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:07,899
because such an ignorant person.

26
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:12,619
Your Highness, I am timid.

27
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:16,099
People shouted to kill and beat me
because I received a bit of money.

28
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,379
The Imperial Exam concerns
the foundation of the nation.

29
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:20,900
How dare I steal exam questions?

30
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,379
Sui Zhi, this is wrong.

31
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:26,879
The aristocratic families
are the foundation of the nation.

32
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,300
My brother may not care about
the stability of the nation,

33
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,860
but we, as his ministers,
have to share his burdens.

34
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,219
You also come from
a prestigious family background.

35
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:42,439
Do we hand over the imperial court to others?

36
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:51,219
Or His Majesty has other intentions

37
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:55,880
and you don't want to share my burdens?

38
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,580
People always plan for themselves.

39
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,339
The gold and silver sent by you
will eventually run out.

40
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,460
But if I can get the position
of Floral Envoy again,

41
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,140
I could be by His Majesty's side day by day.

42
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:22,099
By that time, I can easily resolve your burdens.

43
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,960
Easy. Tomorrow, I'll request His Majesty
to reclaim you the position.

44
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:34,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

45
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,820
The Ministry of Rites drafts the question bank,

46
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,099
and the ultimate decision power
lies with His Majesty.

47
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:47,960
I will be by His Majesty's side well.
You can rest assured.

48
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:57,679
Once this matter is settled,
you and I will have no grudges.

49
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:14,260
Thanks to the lamp oils sent by Mr. Jiang,
we have managed to hold on for several days.

50
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,099
At this critical moment before the exam,
we are unable to read,

51
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,820
which inevitably disperses morale.

52
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,659
If we pay high prices to buy lamp oils now,
it would surely alert Prince Ning.

53
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,419
The aristocratic families have profound knowledge,

54
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:29,620
and have often produced talented people.

55
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,099
Why can't they tolerate people
from humble background?

56
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,060
Not following the right path,
only taking shortcuts.

57
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,700
If it continues, will become an official scourge.

58
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,900
Did you give exam questions to Prince Ning?

59
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:42,419
They tackle it from two sides.

60
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,179
We must figure out a way to break the impasse.

61
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:08,179
Thank you.

62
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:09,940
Thank you.

63
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,179
Don't be so polite.

64
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,859
All of you have studied for years
and have a wealth of knowledge.

65
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:20,520
If you are overly worried, I'm afraid it will
let ill-intentioned people take advantage of it.

66
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,900
Come on, this way.

67
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,240
After reading, rest early.

68
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,940
Where did you get these lamp oils?

69
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,299
We ran to various oil shops during the day,
but couldn't buy any.

70
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:38,539
I wonder if you could sell us some.

71
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,979
These are not for sale.

72
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:44,219
Tomorrow, more oils will be delivered

73
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:46,739
to ensure you all can take the exam smoothly.

74
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,219
Thank you.

75
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,612
You're welcome.

76
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,620
You're running the herb business.
Where do these oils come from?

77
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,140
It's not only animal fats
that can be used to make oil.

78
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,840
Have you ever seen aged Flowers Wine
with a sheen of oil floating on it?

79
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,700
Relying solely on herbs may not yield enough oil.

80
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,979
For this many people's continuous use,

81
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:16,940
you'd need at least a hundred dou more.

82
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,500
I've already led my people to test
on tens of oil refining methods,

83
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,539
and I got the most suitable materials
for oil refining.

84
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:25,720
Rest assured.

85
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,180
Keep up.

86
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,580
It's very fragrant.

87
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,580
Sesame and rapeseed seeds
can produce oil after stir-frying.

88
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,419
The crops grown in Sheng County
are not yet mature,

89
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,399
so I asked the villagers
to disguise themselves as merchants

90
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,759
to buy the sesame and rapeseed seeds
in the city in batches.

91
00:07:57,859 --> 00:07:59,704
Go over there.

92
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:04,439
Grab one with one hand.

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,140
Pull it harder.

94
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,700
One, two. Push.

95
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,460
One, two. Push.

96
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,659
One, two. Push.

97
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:18,260
One, two. Push.

98
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,624
See.

99
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,819
This is the oil you sent yesterday?

100
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:35,819
This oil is no different
from the oil refined from livestock.

101
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:38,719
It can not only light lamps,
but also be used for cooking.

102
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,020
The scent is very refreshing.

103
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,900
I have tried the methods
in the ancient texts one by one.

104
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,679
Crushing, grinding, soaking, steaming, none are as productive as this.

105
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,600
If this method is spread to places
where animal husbandry is not prevalent,

106
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,240
then it will become much easier to refine oil.

107
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,220
I am strong. Let me do it.

108
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,880
You are used to acting alone and think that anything can be handled by yourself.

109
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,160
But this oil pressing doesn't work. Even if you're a man of unusual strength,

110
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,459
even if you can lift alone a beam
that weighs a hundred jin,

111
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:42,620
you still need someone
to hold the direction for you.

112
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:49,220
Otherwise, you would never be
as effective as two people.

113
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,659
You always ponder how to give me advice.

114
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,299
Okay, you just do it.

115
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:59,140
And I promise to help you.

116
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:05,699
Alright, we've been busy all day. Time to take a break.

117
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:09,579
Such laborious work,
I'll arrange for someone to do it.

118
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,380
When did you two arrive?

119
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,450
When you two were chatting happily.

120
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:29,716
Master Xu.

121
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,419
Did you see the other workshops? How do you feel?

122
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:38,659
Thanks to your ingenious ideas.

123
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:44,240
Even if a few more students come now,
the oils are enough.

124
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,299
Regarding the lamp oils, fewer people
know it's Lady He's doing,

125
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,340
then you two can be safer.

126
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,900
Once the oils are transported into the city,
I would step forward and distribute to students.

127
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,620
You need to prepare for the Imperial Exam,
so don't delay your studies.

128
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,740
I can disguise myself as a man, and keep low-key, won't cause any issues.

129
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,659
I've taken the Provincial Exam for nine consecutive years, each time due to the aristocracy, I failed.

130
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:10,380
This time, Mr. Jiang gives me a fair chance
to compete with the aristocracy,

131
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,419
so I am confident I can rank high.

132
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:17,280
I will not disappoint Master Xu and Mr. Jiang.

133
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,179
The breadth of one's mind
depends on the accumulation of time.

134
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:25,939
Zhang Qian, you have profound knowledge.

135
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:30,140
I believe you will definitely
rank high in this exam.

136
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,900
Thank you.

137
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,220
As long as we can enter the city,
it's fine whoever goes to distribute the oils.

138
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,220
Now the city gates are guarded
by Prince Ning's men.

139
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,059
The inspection of in and out of the city
is extremely strict.

140
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:46,160
To carry all the oils in the city is not easy.

141
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,059
I have an idea.

142
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:53,740
Before, I worked in a tavern.

143
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,740
I saw that oil is much lighter than wine.

144
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,179
If we put this oil into half-filled wine jars,

145
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,299
even if the guards check it,

146
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:07,459
we can scoop out the wine
from the bottom and let him taste it.

147
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:10,979
Lady He, you are really knowledgeable and thoughtful, not inferior to men at all.

148
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:13,880
On behalf of all the students, thank you.

149
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,479
I'm flattered. The patriotism does not distinguish between men and women.

150
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:22,100
Hope you all can govern diligently
and love the people after becoming officials.

151
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,839
The future of Sheng County's people
all rely on you.

152
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:43,359
You've done well these days.

153
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,179
Jiang Chang Yang, I want to know all of your past.

154
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:54,819
Whether it's joyful or sorrowful,

155
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:57,280
I want to bear it together with you.

156
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:02,719
What do you want to know?
I will tell you everything.

157
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,060
At the fire at the Fragrance Garden,
you've revealed your mental barrier.

158
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,640
And the fire in Mengzhou, you…

159
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:20,180
Such a tragic past,

160
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,120
I may never be able to let it go in my lifetime.

161
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,500
Prince Ning killed so many people,

162
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,919
thinking a fire could extinguish my innocence,

163
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,699
but he was wrong.

164
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:39,980
Instead, because of this disaster,
I saw clearly through Mr. Third.

165
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,900
 The Crown Prince made a private visit to Mengzhou,
and his playfulness started the fire, 

166
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,699
 yet he placed the blame on the people. 

167
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,660
 - Why did it kill the princess?
- Wait, do you seek death? 

168
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,079
 - There are many people dying here.
- I just can't get over it. 

169
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,939
 Those in power and with influence,
why would they care about us? 

170
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:00,080
 Line up, line up properly. 

171
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,700
 Don't rush. There's enough for everyone. 

172
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,520
 - Come on.
- Line up properly. 

173
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,020
 - Madam, here is some more rice for you.
- Thank you. 

174
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,500
 - The porridge is ready.
- Be careful not to get burnt. 

175
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,824
 - There's enough for everyone.
- Come on. 

176
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:17,419
- Come on. Come on.
- Here.

177
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:20,140
 - Madam, be careful.
- Okay. 

178
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,799
 Those at the back. 

179
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,500
 Come here. Queue up here. 

180
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,860
 Be careful. 

181
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,699
 Where did the grains come from? 

182
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,980
 I requisitioned them from
the Eastern Palace's private warehouse. 

183
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,348
 Here, be careful. 

184
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:33,799
 - Do you know
- Thank you. 

185
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,000
 Prince Ning is spreading rumors outside,
and putting all the people's grievances… 

186
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,539
 Those in power, despite their high status,
should also bear criticism and ill fame. 

187
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:46,140
 Now, settling these victims properly
is the most important. 

188
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,140
 - Here, be careful.
- Okay. 

189
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,539
 Come, join me. Hurry. 

190
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,740
Even though Mr. Third
is leaving the palace for the first time,

191
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,740
he is familiar with the livelihood
of Mengzhou's people and officials.

192
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,239
Though he is hindered by Prince Ning, he still chose some upright ministers

193
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:18,160
to assist him and rescue many victims.

194
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,819
Therefore, you know Mr. Third
has kindness and resilience.

195
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:28,100
Only when he becomes the emperor
can the people live in peace.

196
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:34,400
Yes. Since then, I decided to engage in politics.

197
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,440
If I follow the righteous path,
why fear disgrace upon myself?

198
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:53,828
So even if people find you wronged,
you still find joy in it.

199
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:00,740
I was once alone, living towards death.

200
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,140
How fortunate to meet you,

201
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,439
someone who knows me, understands me,
and walks side by side with me.

202
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,500
We'll work hard together,

203
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,160
hoping to see a prosperous nation
and people living a peaceful life one day.

204
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,539
- Do all these jars have oils?
- Yes.

205
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:36,340
- Here, take it.
- Okay.

206
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,600
- You distribute that jar according to this method. 
 - Alright, leave it to me.

207
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,140
Alright, leave it to me.

208
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,540
Students, we have lamp oils.

209
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,879
- Come.
- I'll go get it.

210
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,639
- That's great.
- Look.

211
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,080
- Thank you.
- That's great.

212
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,220
- For you.
- Thank you.

213
00:16:57,504 --> 00:16:59,320
Thank you.

214
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,659
Upon hearing this, I should immediately act upon

215
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:07,059
Your Majesty. To reach the highest realm of governance

216
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,900
and achieve social prosperity and flourishing, it is necessary to widely seek out virtuous talents.

217
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,119
I'll reward you with jewelry.

218
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,940
Be careful.

219
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,572
 ♫ Flowers should bloom proudly Reflecting the color of the sky ♫ 

220
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,204
 ♫ Without withering ♫ 

221
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:26,019
Congratulations to you in advance.

222
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:30,000
Wishing you success in the imperial exams
and smooth official career.

223
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,739
- Take it.
- Thank you.

224
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,056
Mr. Zhu.

225
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:52,259
I invited you for a drink a few days ago.
Why didn't you come?

226
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,400
I have family matters to attend.

227
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,628
Coming.

228
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:08,860
Everyone, you all are knowledgeable
and recommended by your hometown from afar.

229
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,219
You've traveled a long way, must be exhausted.

230
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:15,979
The officials are impartial,
there will definitely be no omissions.

231
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:19,780
Wishing you all to take the exam calmly.

232
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,580
We will remember it carefully.

233
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,699
- Roll call.
- Yes.

234
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,780
Songzhou, Huang Qing Yun.

235
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,200
Bozhou, Qi Da.

236
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,780
Fellows, I'll go in first.

237
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,160
 
Jingzhao, Zhu Qiong.

238
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,659
Mengzhou, Sun Zhi.

239
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,699
I am Zhu Qiong, the son
of the Minister of Agriculture.

240
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:52,739
Mr. Zhu.

241
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:55,140
- Find me a spacious and warm room.
- Xiazhou, Luo Qian.

242
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,019
Get the charcoal fire ready.

243
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,659
Don't let me catch a cold
over the three days of exams.

244
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:01,900
Yes, here you go.

245
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,300
Weizhou, Zhang Song.

246
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,100
He's already reeking of alcohol before the exams.

247
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,219
Is he that certain that he will rank top?

248
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:13,699
Jingzhao, Ma Bing.

249
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:16,219
Everyone,

250
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:19,300
 
we've studied hard just for today.

251
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,739
Please answer the questions well.

252
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:26,440
We cannot let the nation
be in the hands of those playboys.

253
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,999
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

254
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:32,048
- Everyone, go for it. 
 - Go for it.

255
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:34,430
Liang Guan Wu.

256
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,160
Get up. Come on, get up.

257
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,220
 

258
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,259
His Highness, the exam questions
delivered by the tribute academy

259
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:03,520
are the same as what Jiang Chang Yang gave us.

260
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:08,340
Good. Great!

261
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,219
Come on, one more.

262
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:15,692
Come on.

263
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,140
Fire. There's a fire!

264
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,119
Mr. Zhu, wake up now.

265
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:05,580
There's a fire, someone!

266
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,300
- Mr. Zhu!
- There's a fire.

267
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,540
I'm on fire.

268
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,400
- Someone, save me!
- Fire!

269
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,900
Someone, save me!

270
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,880
Someone, put out the fire!

271
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,140
Put out the fire. Hurry!

272
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,459
Hurry!

273
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:27,699
Take the candidates to the side hall
of the Department of State Affairs for shelter.

274
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:31,200
Ask General Wu to bring people
to put out the fire.

275
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:35,759
Help!

276
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,540
The wind was strong tonight,
and the oil lamp caught fire.

277
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,019
The paper made earlier can only be voided.

278
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:45,140
The person in charge of the imperial examinations
asked for instructions from His Majesty.

279
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,580
The officials of the Ministry of Rites
decided to establish a new exam paper.

280
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,520
Your Highness, I'm afraid…

281
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:14,580
This year's spring breeze comes late.

282
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,520
I didn't expect it to come so strongly.

283
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:39,019
When did you learn
the art of controlling the wind?

284
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:42,499
I have a man infiltrated the examination hall.
And the oil lamps were tampered with.

285
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:45,040
Just a wisp of wind can set it ablaze.

286
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,359
If one person's exam paper is destroyed,
everyone has to retake.

287
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,100
When you stole the exam questions for Prince Ning,
you had already planned to do so, right?

288
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,580
I have to gain Prince Ning's trust
and maintain the fairness of the Imperial Exam.

289
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:05,419
The hypocrite Prince Ning
cannot get rid of you, this fake villain.

290
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,140
The wind is so strong,
and you're dressed too lightly.

291
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,900
Feeling cold?

292
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,639
I am giving you a chance to hold me.

293
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,220
You are my wife already. I can hold you whenever I want.

294
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,900
Don't catch a cold for this.

295
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,540
Jiang Chang Yang.

296
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:37,939
You know martial arts skills,
so you are bullying me?

297
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:40,860
Now you know why I didn't teach you.

298
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,000
I was afraid that one day
I won't be able to beat you.

299
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:53,459
Jiang Chang Yang, you've worked so hard
for the Imperial Exam.

300
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:56,919
Tonight, is it finally accomplished?

301
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:06,680
You've had a hard time recently.

302
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,800
As long as I'm with you,
I'm happy no matter what I do.

303
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,780
This time I succeeded.

304
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:34,000
Jiang Chang Yang, let go of me.

305
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:01,739
I don't feel good.

306
00:25:01,739 --> 00:25:04,340
Mr. Yang, you should relax now.

307
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,419
We have tried hard, so no regrets.

308
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:09,659
Yes, you are right.

309
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,960
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

310
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,219
Everyone, come rest here.

311
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:27,780
- Let's eat before we leave. Come.
- Okay.

312
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,439
- This way. Hurry!
- Okay.

313
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,340
Rest here.

314
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,060
Who are you to block my road?

315
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,879
Do you know who I am? Get out of the way.

316
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,780
You don't have to tell me.

317
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,359
Seeing such a magnificent carriage,

318
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,639
no matter who is sitting in there,
we will all make way.

319
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,620
What do you know?

320
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,780
- This carriage of mine is made of rosewood.
- Go in and have some water.

321
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,900
- There are only a few in Chang'an.
- Take a rest.

322
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,580
Your Mu Dan speaks with irony.
Respect the carriage, not the person.

323
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,119
Zhu Qiong can't even hear this? What a fool.

324
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,259
If he could perceive
the underlying meanings of others,

325
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:15,760
the Minister of Agriculture wouldn't
go to great lengths to please His Highness.

326
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,739
Mr. Jiang, I've told them to move.

327
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:24,140
You don't have to worry.

328
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,848
Mu Dan.

329
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:31,068
Sui Zhi.

330
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:40,659
This is my beloved concubine, Mu Dan,

331
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:44,019
also the top flower merchant
conferred by His Majesty.

332
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,340
How is today's hunting harvest?

333
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,380
Today, the harvest is quite plentiful.

334
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,620
In just half a day, I can already return.

335
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,448
That's good.

336
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,780
Since we have met, let's take a short break.

337
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,419
- Grill the hunted deer for Ms. He.
- Yes.

338
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:06,380
Let's go.

339
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,860
Everyone, let's try the deer.

340
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,580
All right. Thank you.

341
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,179
Mr. Tang, the concubine of Floral Envoy
is already a wealthy merchant.

342
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,380
Why does she still personally deliver the goods?

343
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,279
If Lady He isn't that involved,

344
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,020
her shop wouldn't be so prosperous, even expanded to Sheng County.

345
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:28,100
A fine beauty,

346
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,860
not staying at home,
instead, exposing herself all day,

347
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,400
is only appreciated by the Floral Envoy.

348
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,659
They are having a couple's conversation,
what are you going to do?

349
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:38,739
Let's go to grill the deer.

350
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:45,140
Today, you left before the sun rises.
How come you're only leaving the city now?

351
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,699
I got a letter from Sheng County,
saying there's a rat infestation.

352
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:51,359
I went to buy some rodenticide,
so it delayed me for some time.

353
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,699
When you arrive at Sheng County,
you must wash your hands well

354
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:58,119
- and be more careful of your food. 
 - Understood.

355
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:01,100
How about you? You've been acting.

356
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,179
Must be tired.

357
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:08,180
It's quite exhausting
in getting words from a dull-witted person.

358
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,459
That Mr. Zhu is arrogant and narrow-minded.

359
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:18,300
If he failed the Imperial Exam, might blame
Prince Ning for not arranging it properly.

360
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,419
You mentioned before.
Aristocratic families are supporting Prince Ning.

361
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:26,619
Noble individuals serving the nation are all cautious and shrewd, not easy to buy off.

362
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:30,380
But their sons and nephews
are often spoiled brats.

363
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,380
Have you ever thought about starting from here,

364
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,800
convincing them to diverge
their fathers from Prince Ning?

365
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:45,279
Isn't this idea good?

366
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:48,499
Then I won't mention it anymore. Let's go.

367
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,419
Although you are not in the court,
your insight is still so sharp.

368
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:54,780
You share the same idea as I do.

369
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,780
Are you praising me, or are you praising yourself?

370
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,380
We are all family now, it makes no difference.

371
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,299
I've only had Tu Mi wine, but haven't seen so many Tu Mi flowers.

372
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,159
It is fragrant, lustrous, and white as snow,
with branches hang down like tassels.

373
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:43,520
Jiang Chang Yang, we can be said
to have grown old together.

374
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:51,040
For the rest of our lives,
I just wish we could go slower.

375
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,939
Once the New Year's Day is over,
we've been so busy.

376
00:29:55,939 --> 00:29:58,380
It's been a long time since we went out together.

377
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:05,060
If we hadn't met here by chance,
we would have missed this spring scenery.

378
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,380
What is done today is all for the future.

379
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,019
I am already very happy to have moments together.

380
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,559
Wait.

381
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:41,340
Let me go, you've turned me dizzy.

382
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,499
Watch out, the spring pancakes!

383
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:45,380
It doesn't look like your cooking.

384
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,768
These are spring pancakes given
by the villagers. Don't waste them.

385
00:30:48,768 --> 00:30:50,552
Have a taste.

386
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,300
It tastes good.

387
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,159
But I want to eat the midnight snack made by you.

388
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,079
I've been busy and traveling.

389
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:07,699
Don't mention baking Hu cakes,
I just want to lie down and sleep.

390
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,060
That busy? Why not stay for half a day longer?

391
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,340
Why the rush?

392
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,879
I haven't seen you for days,
and I wanted to come back early to see you.

393
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:22,100
So I satisfy you with the small wish
of lying down to sleep right now.

394
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,100
Alright, stop it.

395
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,859
Did you come straight to me without going anywhere else?

396
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:32,019
You are sweaty, yet don't even wipe it off.

397
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,939
How are things going? Have you had a hard time?

398
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:38,739
As long as I return home,
knowing that you are waiting for me,

399
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:41,119
I find joy from it.

400
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,620
But you've had a hard time.

401
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,240
Do you want to bathe with me to relieve tiredness?

402
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:54,019
You go first.

403
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:56,459
I have something to give you.
I'll come to you later.

404
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:58,520
I have everything.

405
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,939
It's always until the sun sets
that we can be together for a moment.

406
00:32:01,939 --> 00:32:04,780
I don't want to part with you again.

407
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,892
Wait.

408
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:11,699
Be good. You can't eat this.

409
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:16,620
Come, I'll take you to have some dried fish.

410
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,440
You care about a cat more than me.

411
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,520
Why are you being jealous over a cat?

412
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,079
Alright, I'll come find you after I feed it.

413
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,104
Let's go.

414
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,124
Let's go.

415
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,419
You said to get something, it's this garment?

416
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:08,760
Yes, I made this for you.

417
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,800
Try it on later, and see if it fits.

418
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:30,060
Magistrate Yu said he wants
to enclose a yard to raise chickens.

419
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,300
But it's not about having too few,
it's about not being equitable.

420
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,639
He doesn't know
which family should do this business.

421
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,359
I think to let everyone nominate themselves.

422
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,179
Those who want to do this business
can come to Chang'an to study.

423
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:45,040
Everyone competes based on their skills.

424
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,879
If everyone learns well,
can learn from me, Chun and Fu,

425
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:51,780
to work together in partnership
and sign the contract.

426
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,720
What do you think?

427
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:59,240
You are of one heart. It does not mean others are.

428
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,800
You are right.

429
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,060
Some people are diligent, while some are lazy.

430
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,360
When it comes to dividing profits,
disputes are inevitable.

431
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,019
I can ask Magistrate Yu
to find someone to supervise.

432
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:17,640
The contract doesn't have to last for long,
maybe just half a year.

433
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,640
If it doesn't work, we can change people.

434
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,879
Finally, you can relax with me.

435
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,340
Can't you take a break?

436
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:29,280
Feeling jealous?

437
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,999
I want you to rest and look up
in the sky to enjoy the moonlight.

438
00:34:34,979 --> 00:34:38,979
Only rest well
could you handle things well together.

439
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,499
It's so nice to have you.

440
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:53,180
Are you talking about the one in the sky
or the one by your side?

441
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:56,600
What do you think?

442
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:06,424
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫ 

443
00:35:06,424 --> 00:35:10,460
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫ 

444
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,388
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫ 

445
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:19,800
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫ 

446
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,188
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫ 

447
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:28,472
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫ 

448
00:35:28,472 --> 00:35:32,380
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫ 

449
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,056
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫ 

450
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,740
I learned a magic from someone
that can pluck stars from the sky.

451
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,200
Really?

452
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,019
Count to three, and the stars will come.

453
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:57,856
Okay.

454
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:02,280
 ♫ Only wish to cherish day and night ♫ 

455
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,899
Done.

456
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:16,419
Did Chuan Yu make this magic?

457
00:36:16,419 --> 00:36:19,780
Wrong, it's She Yan.

458
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,200
No, no, no.

459
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,839
You're so busy today,
yet you still prepare all these for me?

460
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,499
Are you secretly doing something behind my back?

461
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:30,999
You guessed it right.

462
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:40,139
I am very ashamed.

463
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:46,760
I wasn't as brave as you before, making you work hard for me for such a long time.

464
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,439
For the days I wasted,
I want to make it up to you.

465
00:36:53,939 --> 00:36:55,280
Alright.

466
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,539
I'm magnanimous. I won't hold any grudges.

467
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,919
In the future,

468
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:14,560
we will never be separated.

469
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,560
We have watched the fireworks together twice,

470
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,640
and each time I have made you sad.

471
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,980
I must repay you once.

472
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:43,359
This way, whenever you see fireworks,

473
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,240
you will only remember the joy of tonight.

474
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:52,959
This time, it's Chuan Yu's doing, right?

475
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:57,300
You are really wise.

476
00:37:58,019 --> 00:37:59,860
Chuan Yu has worked hard all day.

477
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,700
Let him go back to rest.

478
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:08,240
Maybe Chuan Yu also wants
to enjoy the fireworks with Fu.

479
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,296
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars ♫ 

480
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:23,648
 ♫ Reflecting the lovely moon ♫ 

481
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,452
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty ♫ 

482
00:38:27,452 --> 00:38:31,636
 ♫ Fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

483
00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:37,648
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern ♫ 

484
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,412
Look.

485
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,139
♫ ♫

486
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:46,176
It's okay.

487
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,420
Look.

488
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,408
 ♫ Affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

489
00:38:56,408 --> 00:38:59,496
 ♫ Let the years go by ♫ 

490
00:38:59,496 --> 00:39:04,528
 ♫ Carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

491
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:07,808
 ♫ If the heart is like water ♫ 

492
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:12,732
 ♫ The bloom is ever-present ♫ 

493
00:39:12,732 --> 00:39:13,979
 

494
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:16,719
Liu Si Lang also made it on the list?

495
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:18,260
I shall take the exam again next year.

496
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,299
I passed. I passed!

497
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:21,919
After ten years of hard study,

498
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:24,679
I passed, I passed!

499
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,459
 

500
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:29,840
- Zhang Qian!
- Zhang Qian!

501
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,180
- Congratulations, Mr. Zhang! 
 - You are the top one, Mr. Zhang.

502
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,800
- Congratulations, Mr. Zhang!
- Thank you.

503
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,059
On that day, Zhang Qian as the top scorer,

504
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:43,419
can lead the students to denounce traitors.

505
00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:47,979
Zhang Qian is thoughtful and talented.

506
00:39:47,979 --> 00:39:51,999
Your Majesty, have you ever thought about
letting him do more tasks?

507
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:53,999
You've only met him
once at the Qujiang River banquet,

508
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:57,600
and you are eager to ask His Majesty for him?

509
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,240
Minister Zhang has been removed,
and a purge in the Ministry of War has been made.

510
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,439
Now there are a few positions vacant.

511
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:08,280
I naturally want a capable person.

512
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:10,839
The students are often inexperienced.

513
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:13,999
What they are proficient in
are all the words of sages in books.

514
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:17,919
They need years of experience in officialdom
before they can be entrusted with important tasks.

515
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:23,519
Sui Zhi is right. Let Zhang Qian
go to the prefecture for two years.

516
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,220
As long as his resolution remains unchanged,

517
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,439
I will surely leave him to you
when he is transferred back to the capital.

518
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,120
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- No need for formalities.

519
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:40,499
Minister Zhang of the Ministry of War
has always been cautious.

520
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:44,439
How did you manage to obtain
the evidence of his embezzlement?

521
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:47,999
He dotes on his fourth son,
born to him in old age.

522
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:52,160
And Zhang Si Lang friends
with the son of the Minister of Agriculture.

523
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,839
When he gets drunk, he spills everything.

524
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:58,280
Minister Zhang kept five concubines
in separate residences.

525
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,740
He hid all the accounts and illicit gains

526
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,299
in the least favored concubine's residence.

527
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:09,459
What a complex game this is!
I can't believe you had the patience to set it up.

528
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:12,220
As for the secrets of the corrupt officials,

529
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:17,039
if Sui Zhi decides to uncover them,
nothing is beyond his reach.

530
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:27,930


531

 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫
