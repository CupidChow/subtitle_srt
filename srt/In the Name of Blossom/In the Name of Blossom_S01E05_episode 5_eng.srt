2
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:37,074
   

3
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:41,020
   

4
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,759
But you are here. How can I possibly stay out of it?

5
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,399
I cannot intervene with the nobility,

6
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,209
but I can handle things outside the palace. I can help you find the peddler.

7
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:56,720
The opponent has surely fully prepared to frame me. How could they let you find a flaw?

8
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,059
I have my own way to resolve it.

9
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,259
Before I leave, stay well in the Jiang Residence and do not show yourself.

10
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,680
Be wary of Liu Chang and the County Princess.

11
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,619
It's Prince Ning and his men again.

12
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:16,619
Don't worry. I will take good care of myself.

13
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,260
But Prince Ning has been on good terms with you. Is it because of me this time?

14
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,928
This time, it's aimed at me. It has nothing to do with you.

15
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:30,020
Don't worry, these traps won't nail me down.

16
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,176
They just want to trap me here, probably to test something.

17
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,619
Just leave the flowers here. Stop moving them around.

18
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,619
They look quite nice.

19
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,819
I have nothing to hide. Let Liu Chang do whatever he wants.

20
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:53,300
I am happy to relax here for two days.

21
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:02,740
You really don't need to worry about me.

22
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:27,279
I saw him at a banquet at Jiang's residence. Where is he taking the Financial Clerk?

23
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:29,480
They are heading west.

24
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,420
Oh no, it's Wanguan Hall. They are going to check Jiang Chang Yang's private accounts.

25
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,180
Go and inform Yun Niang. I'll go and stall Liu Chang.

26
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,079
- All right. 
 - Go quickly.

27
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,339
- Madam, are you alright? 
 - Madam, I'll take you to the clinic.

28
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:51,740
Make way, make way.

29
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,640
He Wei Fang?

30
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,500
Young Master.

31
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,859
Are you hurt?

32
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:13,499
Iâ€¦ I just accidentally fell and twisted my ankle. I can't walk.

33
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,940
Could you take me to Tranquil Health Clinic?

34
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,239
Sure.

35
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:39,260
This is not the road to Tranquil Health Clinic.

36
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,620
Proud as you are, you've learned to bow your head to me for Jiang Chang Yang.

37
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:52,280
Since you already knew, why did you still let me get in the carriage?

38
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:55,744
It's rare for you to come to me.

39
00:04:55,744 --> 00:05:00,400
No matter the reason, I am willing to spend more time with you at this moment.

40
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:08,179
Then can you tell me where you're taking me now?

41
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,739
The wind and rain are getting stronger. I'm just taking you home.

42
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:21,060
I've also sent someone to pick up Zhu Fu to keep you company.

43
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,060
Listen up. No one is allowed in or out.

44
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,660
 Yes, Sir. 

45
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:55,480
   

46
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,980
- How is it? 
 - Take a look.

47
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,079
 How about we agree on a secret code? 

48
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,020
 If you encounter another incident or discover any unusual moves by Prince Ning, 

49
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,179
 and you can't find me at the moment, you can leave a message with the code, 

50
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,099
 and my people will see it. 

51
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:58,659
 You're best at sneaky matters. I'll follow your lead. 

52
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:02,739
 The different pictures on this palace lantern can represent our different enterprises. 

53
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:07,799
 If in danger, just hang it with matching picture facing the Jiang Residence. 

54
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:11,280
 The person who conveys messages in the residence will take care of it. 

55
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,460
 This side represents the Huanyun Tower. 

56
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,559
 This side represents the Wanguan Hall. 

57
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:24,199
 This is Fragrance Garden. 

58
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:28,239
 This is Floral Haven. 

59
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,179
Young Master Liu, you have searched the room and checked the accounts.

60
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:51,160
Is there anything unusual?

61
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:58,199
Young Master, that person appeared at the dock again.

62
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,779
Just like the previous times, after leaving, he came to Wanguan Hall.

63
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,779
Upon seeing there were officers here, he turned and went to another shop.

64
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,580
Was he really pawning something?

65
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,539
Yes, we obtained the item he pawned.

66
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,620
It is a gemstone smuggled from foreign lands.

67
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:36,299
Young Master, do you not believe that person is unrelated to Jiang Chang Yang?

68
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:40,579
Whether I believe it or not, Prince Ning's opinion is what matters.

69
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:45,679
We must obtain concrete evidence while Jiang Chang Yang is trapped.

70
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,679
Open the door. Open the door. 
    

71
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,679
Quick, open the door.

72
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,500
Open the door.

73
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:03,719
Quickly, open the door.

74
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:19,160
Young Master, you sent me back home, and I naturally cannot disappoint your kindness.

75
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,100
I will definitely protect my home with Jiang Chang Yang well.

76
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,159
Move aside.

77
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,079
As long as my husband is not convicted,

78
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,220
he remains the Floral Envoy and the Vice Minister of the Office of Imperial Ceremonies.

79
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,000
If you want to search here, you must ask for the imperial edict.

80
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,280
What exactly is hidden in this Jiang Residence that makes you so concerned and protective?

81
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,728
Today, I will enter this door.

82
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:51,719
Its innocence is why one as vile as you must not defile it

83
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,939
Stop. This is an imperial granted sword.

84
00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:00,299
The blade drawn is as if His Majesty is present.

85
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,500
I dare you to make a move!

86
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,380
Don't act willfully for someone unworthy.

87
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,780
Be careful not to bring disaster upon yourself, or I won't be able to save you either.

88
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,559
- He Wei Fang.
 - If you dare take another step forward,

89
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,360
I'll make sure you spill blood on the spot.

90
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,740
The poisoning case is closed.

91
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,620
   

92
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:42,059
Young Master, the imperial edict has arrived at Ministry of Justice.

93
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,179
The Vice Minister's improper appointment of personnel bears the fault of negligence.

94
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:46,840
A three-year salary reduction was issued as a warning to others.

95
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:08,919
Young Master has returned. Young Master has returned.

96
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,260
Miss Xiao is so impressive. She merely said something and saved Young Master.

97
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,100
After all, she is the daughter of a Military Governor.

98
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,240
She had the Princess plead on her behalf. What crime can't be cleared with that?

99
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,080
- Young Madam. 
 - Young Madam.

100
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,559
- Let's go back first. 
 - Oh, we're going back.

101
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,239
Yes, yes.

102
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:14,900
You didn't even greet your husband. What a heartless concubine.

103
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:22,620
Well, did you bring my peonies back?

104
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,020
No matter what I forget, I dare not forget your flowers.

105
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,340
Later, I'll have Chuan Yu bring them for you.

106
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,959
It's so good to be home.

107
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:43,039
The poisoning case ended in such a muddled way.

108
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,819
The witnesses involved either took their own lives or were silenced.

109
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:49,900
The Ministry of Justice found nothing.

110
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,260
Moreover, the intrigue and rivalry among concubines are nothing new.

111
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,720
There are plenty of such unresolvable cases.

112
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,819
Prince Ning found no evidence.

113
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,620
Seeing the Princess plead, it was difficult for him to obstruct.

114
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:08,299
This matter was greatly aided by Xue Xi. You really ought to thank her properly.

115
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:15,160
And what about you? How should I thank your great assistance?

116
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,040
Compared to Xue Xi, what I did was insignificant.

117
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,539
The famous businesswoman He in the capital is not someone who underestimates herself.

118
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:35,280
I am neither ashamed nor humble. I just feel somewhat powerless.

119
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:42,740
You once said I was a cunning fox that could overcome any difficulty.

120
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,939
But no matter how hard a fox tries, it can only handle matters on the shore.

121
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:54,839
When it comes to an injured fish in the water, even if I want to save it, I am powerless.

122
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,939
But Xue Xi is different. She has a similar background to yours.

123
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:04,620
She can look after you and support you.

124
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,059
You both live in the same lake.

125
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:22,779
Mu Dan, where they are born does not determine their preferences.

126
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:29,220
How do you know I'm not another fox that accidentally fell into the water?

127
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,559
Perhaps what I really need is for my companion to give me a hand from the shore.

128
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,699
These days, you have worried and run around for me.

129
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:49,860
You sent a message to Miss Yun, letting Liu Chang see the fake account book I wanted him to see.

130
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:56,140
To stop Liu Chang from searching the mansion, you bravely held the imperial sword to his neck,

131
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,980
forcing his men to draw their swords.

132
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,740
Every single matter was a helping hand aiding me ashore.

133
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,539
You have the eyes of a clairvoyant.

134
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:17,439
Even in prison, you knew so much.

135
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:23,032
Yes, I do. So, even if you don't say things, I know.

136
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:28,568
â™«  Should my heart have frost, would the past remain forever frozen?  â™«

137
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:34,599
You disregarded the risk of being implicated and did so much for me.

138
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,840
Thank you.

139
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,579
â™«  If love were like frost, can these countless miles of stormy weather  â™«

140
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:48,800
You said it before that there's no need for thanks between us.

141
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:58,900
Then, you're responsible for dinner today. Hurry up and start the stove.

142
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,859
I'll go bathe first. Call me when it's ready.

143
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,660
   

144
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:26,319
Liu Chang found She Yan was a thief fencing stolen goods at Wanguan Hall.

145
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,860
Prince Ning did not succeed.

146
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,779
He also let us remove the spy he planted next to Consort Shu.

147
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:35,659
In the past, when he meddled with the inner palace, I could let it slide.

148
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:40,059
But this time, he tried to poison Ling Ge.

149
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,220
If Mu Dan didn't say anything, Ling Ge would beâ€¦

150
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,299
I'm afraid establishing the Crown Prince has completely unsettled him.

151
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,719
For the safety of Ling Ge and Prince Lang, let's not mention this for now.

152
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,419
The inner palace is not like other courtyards.

153
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:06,499
Your Majesty can take this opportunity to thoroughly investigate the palace servants.

154
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:11,019
Exercise more caution in the future to prevent such dangerous incidents.

155
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:13,060
Although Prince Ning didn't find anything,

156
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,380
I'm afraid his naturally suspicious nature will only deepen his mistrust.

157
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:24,039
If Prince Ning grows fully suspicious, he wonâ€™t act so lightly.

158
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,340
Last night, I received an apology gift from Prince Ning's Residence,

159
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,060
saying his son-in-law behaved inappropriately and startled my household.

160
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:36,060
He also said he wanted to enter the palace to plead for me, but someone beat him to it.

161
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:39,419
Smooth talk and flattering words.

162
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,739
Fortunately, Xue Xi went to the Princess, so I took the opportunity to release you.

163
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:50,100
Otherwise, heâ€™d have claimed credit, and who knows how heâ€™d make you repay him.

164
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,979
The probe against me was proposed and carried out by Liu Chang.

165
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:58,340
If Prince Ning is suspicious, he won't target only me.

166
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,520
Liu Chang hasn't found any concrete evidence.

167
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,219
So, if he still insists,

168
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:05,939
Prince Ning will only suspect that he's targeting me because of Mu Dan.

169
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:11,300
Moreover, I just helped his man secure the position of Minister of Revenue.

170
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,660
This tangible advantage is more credible than a few baseless speculations by Liu Chang.

171
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,219
How is the investigation into the canal transportation going?

172
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:23,979
Before General Yu arrives, all corrupt officials in the Ministry of Revenue must be removed.

173
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:27,259
She Yan has already found Prince Ning's smuggled goods.

174
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:30,760
Now they are investigating where these items were transported to.

175
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,200
What are these mysterious items?

176
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:56,179
Consort Shu has returned to the palace. Increased vigilance makes it hard to act again.

177
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:02,879
I'm afraid the Floral Envoy will also bear a grudge against me.

178
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:09,939
Liu Zi Shu, you truly are a good son-in-law to me.

179
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:13,780
We haven't searched the Jiang Residence,

180
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,530
and it's unclear if Jiang Chang Yang has ulterior motives.

181
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,219
What do you think?

182
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,599
Your Highness.

183
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:31,459
Everyone in Pingkang House knows the Floral Envoy.

184
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:36,960
Every rake of the foremost noble families has attended the banquets at the Jiang Residence.

185
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,459
Zi Shu, have you seen the grandeur of gift receptions at the Jiang Residence?

186
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:50,919
For someone as greedy and self-indulgent, I don't believe he is plotting revenge.

187
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:54,100
My son has recently become obsessed with cockfighting.

188
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,860
He found out that Jiang Chang Yang has taken all the high-quality ones to the palace.

189
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,979
His Majesty chose several members of the imperial guard to raise chickens.

190
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:06,499
They have been doing it for quite some time.

191
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:09,380
Could all these years have been a guise?

192
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,340
It's precisely because he has been consistent for many years.

193
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,240
We should thoroughly investigate whether Jiang Chang Yang has ulterior motives.

194
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,308
If he truly had ambitions, why hasn't he married a noblewoman who could assist him?

195
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:27,780
With the help of noble families, isn't it easier to get things done?

196
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,200
Given today's circumstances, I'm afraid Xue Xi already has feelings for Jiang Chang Yang.

197
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,559
Hurry up, and make sure to claim the Xiao family.

198
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,900
Yes.

199
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:56,300
Your Highness, do you truly have no doubts? How could it be such a coincidence?

200
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,240
Jiang Chang Yang was released right before I conducted the search.

201
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:04,950
A mere merchant's concubine,

202
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,090
how can she keep an important official outside the house?

203
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,639
Do you really think that I don't know your intentions?

204
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:34,580
I have no second thoughts about Your Highness or the County Princess.

205
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,599
If there are lies, I should be like this cup.

206
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:45,939
Jiang Chang Yang is a clever person.

207
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:48,630
He can both please His Majesty

208
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,870
and lend me a hand at the right time.

209
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:57,950
But precisely because of this,

210
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,860
should he become my enemy, it will be an unfathomable abyss.

211
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,879
I allowed you to investigate thoroughly. But what did you do?

212
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:13,419
You came back empty-handed, and now I have to appease him.

213
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:18,860
I am so sorry, Your Highness. I failed your trust this time.

214
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,659
Next time, I will not act rashly.

215
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,930
You must cherish your fragile body

216
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:31,250
and use the cane I gave you well. Be more alert

217
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,079
and do your work properly. Do not get injured again.

218
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:40,380
Your becoming a cripple would distress You Zhen.

219
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,140
I understand and will not betray your trust.

220
00:22:56,219 --> 00:23:00,219
This is Dong'e County's donkey-hide gelatin awarded by the Princess. Keep it.

221
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:03,459
It's most nourishing when simmered into a soup.

222
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:05,620
Xue Xi, you are so kind.

223
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,979
You are an old acquaintance of Young Master and helped him leave the Ministry of Justice.

224
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:13,410
We should be thanking you. How come you are the one giving gifts?

225
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:20,359
Staying temporarily at the Jiang Residence was the Royal Princess's idea. I hope you don't mind.

226
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:25,799
Of course not, aside from Young Master, you also saved my life.

227
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:30,590
If my courtyard were not so small, I would have invited you to stay here with me.

228
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:34,699
Xue Xi, if you have any discomfort, just tell Jiang Chang Yang.

229
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:37,979
I also have everything a woman might need.

230
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:42,460
Mu Dan, you are indeed different from other women as rumored.

231
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,780
These are our newly developed perfumes.

232
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,820
Xue Xi, take a look. Take whichever you like.

233
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,860
We also have lip balm made from Herbaceous Peonies.

234
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,700
Give it a try.

235
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,280
It smells so good.

236
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,919
What is this?

237
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,739
This is a scar-removing ointment.

238
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,419
Does Floral Haven also sell scar-removing products?

239
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:13,659
Those are sold by Xiao Chun's Tranquil Health Clinic.

240
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:16,580
We also have medicine specifically for burns and scalds.

241
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,380
The one you are holding is specifically used for scars left by sharp objects.

242
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,739
Small scars usually disappear in about half a month with application.

243
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:32,240
That's impressive. Can it also smooth out scars that are over ten years old?

244
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,800
Over ten years? We haven't tried that.

245
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,100
For typical scars, applying medicine as soon as they form is the most effective.

246
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:48,380
Xue Xi, do you have any old scars? You can take it back and try it first.

247
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,680
If it doesn't work, I'll have Xiao Chun come over to take a look.

248
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,100
But you have reminded me.

249
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,559
We can develop another ointment for removing old scars.

250
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:10,820
Have you talked to your father about Pei Zhong?

251
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,359
Father wanted to call off the engagement, knowing who Pei Zhong really is,

252
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,000
but he's afraid of offending Prince Ning by rejecting his good intentions.

253
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,300
Prince Ning wants to befriend the Xiao family.

254
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,639
Even without Pei Zhong, there will be someone else.

255
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,359
Father often says that the court is complex and unpredictable.

256
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,780
If one can stay unaffected, that is the best.

257
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,000
If not, you should also make fewer enemies.

258
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,170
This matter is difficult to handle.

259
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,770
Father still needs some more days to think.

260
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,620
All right, now that you're staying here,

261
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,780
for the time being, it can prevent some of Pei Zhong's harassment.

262
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,180
You were close to Prince Ning before.

263
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,490
Why did he send men to check your assets when you were locked up?

264
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:16,960
Did you offend him in any way?

265
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:23,100
You should have heard that Mu Dan was once Liu Chang's wife.

266
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,699
Ever since I took her in, Liu Chang has been targeting me everywhere,

267
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:29,979
trying to drive a wedge between Prince Ning and me.

268
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,679
Sui Zhi, do you remember

269
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,939
when you took me to catch rabbits in the mountains when we were seven years old?

270
00:26:40,939 --> 00:26:45,529
Then, you fell from halfway up the mountain and got a deep cut on your lower back.

271
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:47,779
You bled so much.

272
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,100
We didn't catch any rabbits, and you ended up with a very ugly scar.

273
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,939
I cried for a long time because of that.

274
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:58,659
Of course, I remember.

275
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:02,599
At that time, Mother was applying ointment to me while comforting you.

276
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,060
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

277
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,739
She saidâ€¦

278
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:14,419
this scar is hidden under clothes, and no one but family can see it.

279
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:16,800
Only then did I stop crying.

280
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:23,599
But Mu Dan doesn't know that you have such a scar.

281
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:28,159
Do you have a fake marriage?

282
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,300
You're insightful and perceptive. You figured it out so quickly.

283
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,680
Why did you do it?

284
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:50,100
At that time, Mu Dan was in danger. To save her life, I had no choice but to do this.

285
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,380
And by having a beloved wife, I can also avoid some unwanted marriages.

286
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,520
Killing two birds with one stone.

287
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,879
I see.

288
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:09,960
Please keep this a secret for us, Xue Xi.

289
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,319
Don't worry. No one else will know.

290
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:27,960
 During the Dragon Boat Festival, Floral Haven sets up the Zuixiang Pavilion in Fragrance Garden 

291
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:31,680
 with rare and exotic goods. Only fifty pieces are available daily. 
   

292
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,799
 Once sold out, it's over. 

293
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,580
Please line up properly. Ladies, how many of you are there?

294
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,480
Give me one.

295
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,768
   

296
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:47,896
   

297
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:50,428
   

298
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,799
   

299
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,660
   

300
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,930
   

301
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,879
 Before the garden closes, Floral Haven will put the remaining goods into a mystery lucky bag, 

302
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:09,699
 which has more value than its price and can't be missed. 

303
00:29:09,699 --> 00:29:11,808
   

304
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,567
   

305
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,663
 Huamanzhu will record your spendings. 

306
00:29:20,663 --> 00:29:26,414
â™«  A blooming flower with proud spirit reflects the color of the sky  â™«

307
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:29,659
â™«  And never withering  â™«

308
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:31,219
Dear customers,

309
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:36,219
the top 10 spenders can have priority in choosing the premium flowers during winter.

310
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:37,939
Please enjoy your shopping here.

311
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:39,699
 Sure. 

312
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:44,019
The winter flowers are just plum blossoms, ink orchids, daffodils, and pomegranate blooms.

313
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:48,179
What's new? What's the difference between choosing sooner or later?

314
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,920
Young Master Tang, you might not know,

315
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,360
at the beginning of the Fragrance Garden renewal, we specifically set aside a row of houses

316
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,060
and built a greenhouse for cultivating rare peonies.

317
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:01,559
We studied for a long time to cultivate peonies that can bloom in winter.

318
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,380
There are such rare items in Floral Haven.

319
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,499
Young Madam, please help me check if my spending is in the top ten.

320
00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:08,060
- Sure. 
 - Mu Dan.

321
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,219
Today, we picked a lot. We're going to pay the bill.

322
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:11,719
All right.

323
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,140
These noble ladies need cosmetic items every day, so their spendings are high.

324
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,440
You gentlemen should also strive to keep up.

325
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:24,459
Here, I still need ten of these.

326
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:26,940
- 10 of these. 
 - And that one too.

327
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,659
How is the incense powder? Do you like the fragrance?

328
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:31,860
I do.

329
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,160
Please feel free to try more.

330
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,259
- All right. 
 - Look how beautiful these small flowers are.

331
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:39,059
- Madam, come again next time. 
 - Sure.

332
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,399
Shopkeeper, three boxes of bath beans and incense powder for a total of 200 wen.

333
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:54,739
Liu Chang is coming. Run.

334
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:13,699
May I ask if He Wei Fang is here?

335
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:16,979
No. Young Master Liu, please go home.

336
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,420
It doesn't matter if she's not here. I'm here to buy something.

337
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,740
Qiu Shi.

338
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,760
Your Highness, embroider tomorrow. Be careful not to hurt your eyes.

339
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,660
Your Highness.

340
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:49,979
Young Master carried several boxes of women's items to the Taoguang Courtyard today.

341
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,159
Floral Haven.

342
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,499
It's He Wei Fang again.

343
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,240
You know exactly how many cold looks your mother has given me, both openly and secretly.

344
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,119
Now, even a lowly concubine dares to embarrass me.

345
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:41,380
Miss Man is a noble concubine from the Lu family of Fan Yang.

346
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,340
Now she is pregnant, and you should give way to her, you know?

347
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,300
Why can't you give way to me? Today is my birthday.

348
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,580
If you don't stay with me overnight, everyone in the residence will laugh at me.

349
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,179
You haven't gotten pregnant yet, so why should I care about your face?

350
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:59,960
You can't leave. You can't. You just can't.

351
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,140
Foolish woman.

352
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,179
Ping Zhi, how are you? Are you well?

353
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:21,179
I'll call someone for you.

354
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,179
I'll divorce you, venomous woman.

355
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:43,279
The weather is dry and prone to fires.

356
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:51,680
Once the fire burns everything, nothing will be left.

357
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,459
- Madam Tang. 
 - Is it delicious? Come, Xiao Chun.

358
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:08,040
- Thank you, Da Fu. 
 - And yours too.

359
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,028
- Thanks. Another bonus. 
 - That's so nice.

360
00:35:10,028 --> 00:35:15,700
Everyone, during the Dragon Boat Festival, our prosperity was thanks to all of you here.

361
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,700
Tonight, let's drink to our hearts' content and rest well for a few days.

362
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,579
Here's to everyone.

363
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,700
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

364
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,400
Come on.

365
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,619
Shopkeeper, Young Master Jiang has sent something.

366
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,120
Come on, bring it over quickly.

367
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,740
- Put it here, put it here.
- It's from Young Master Jiang.

368
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,560
There are so many.

369
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,939
Young Madam, Young Master understands the hardships you've endured.

370
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:45,240
He especially went to Prosperity House and carefully selected these fine wines and foods

371
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,619
for everyone in the Fragrance Garden to enjoy together.

372
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:49,459
Young Madam, there are still several boxes outside.

373
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:52,939
I'll distribute them to each courtyard and take my leave for now.

374
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:55,239
Thank you.

375
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,660
 Thank you, Young Master. 

376
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,880
Many thanks, Young Master.

377
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,280
- So nice. 
 - Alright now.

378
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,639
The Floral Envoy is being generous for once. Everyone, come and try it.

379
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,820
- Quickly. 
 - Bring that chicken over to me.

380
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,039
- I can't even snatch from them. 
 - Just wait to eat.

381
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:12,340
Why are you acting so distant today?

382
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,099
Having such a considerate husband is rare, so why don't you return home early?

383
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:17,419
How could I?

384
00:36:17,419 --> 00:36:22,139
I promised to drink with you today, so how can I go back on my word?

385
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,820
You have been staying here these days.

386
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,340
Young Master must miss you greatly. Quickly, go home.

387
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,200
This one night won't make a difference. I'll check the peonies in the greenhouse.

388
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,579
Father has already checked them, and he said the new peonies you cultivated are thriving well.

389
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:38,019
One night won't make a difference.

390
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:40,700
Xiao Chun. Xiao Chun, come on.

391
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,180
Why is there so much food?

392
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,280
It's all from Young Master Jiang.

393
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,180
- Liu Lang, go and eat quickly. 
 - All right.

394
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,939
Liu Lang, Liu Lang, come on.

395
00:36:49,939 --> 00:36:53,579
Mu Dan, even if you're not going, you should at least send your regards.

396
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,740
I have a sparring match with Chuan Yu, and I'll return to Jiang Residence shortly.

397
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,280
If you have something to tell him, I'll pass it on.

398
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,459
Come on, let's drink together.

399
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:03,740
- Madam Tang, let's drink. 
 - Come on. Cheers.

400
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,139
- Come on. 
 - Alright.

401
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,459
Come on. Dig in.

402
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:12,300
Here, have some dishes.

403
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,399
"Thinking of you is like the daylily, seeing it dispels worries."

404
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:29,839
How did the busy shopkeeper He think of me, and even brought supper over?

405
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:40,180
This is to thank you for treating everyone at Fragrance Garden to the food of Prosperity House.

406
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,300
This is Mu Dan expressing gratitude for her husband's care.

407
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,419
She also recited a line of poetry.

408
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:49,730
Thinking of you is like this grass something,

409
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,020
something about dispelling worries.

410
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,560
If you want to send flowers, just say so. Why lie?

411
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,380
When did I invite her people to Prosperity House?

412
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,240
Wait, didn't you send food with a servant?

413
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,479
There was a total of ten boxes for everyone at the Fragrance Garden.

414
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,660
I didn't do anything.

415
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:19,160
Have you seen the servant who delivered the gifts?

416
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,939
Did you check the contents of the boxes? Are they all food and drinks?

417
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:29,300
Mu Dan and I only checked two boxes, and the rest were distributed to other rooms.

418
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,540
What? It's not from you?

419
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,460
Oh no.

420
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,980
Let's go.

421
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:22,380
   

422
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,840
She secretly sent people to spy on me.

423
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,740
Even though she knows I haven't seen Mu Dan,

424
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,000
she still wants to kill someone.

425
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,099
Truly malicious.

426
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:40,039
You were so worried you rushed to rescue them without changing your official attire.

427
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:42,419
Why don't you go in now?

428
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:48,700
A heaven-sent opportunity for me to be a hero and save the damsel.

429
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,460
I should wait for the fire to burn a bit more intensely.

430
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:01,039
Quickly, put out the fire, quickly.

431
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,939
 Somebody, please. 

432
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:07,439
 Somebody, please. 

433
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,000
Stop there.

434
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,259
You're not allowed to go.

435
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:37,300
I've had enough of these days.

436
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,740
Only when she's dead will you turn back and look at me.

437
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,059
Didn't you bring these days upon yourself?

438
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:50,219
If you hadn't started this fire, I wouldn't have come here.

439
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,450
You are my husband.

440
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,120
If I won't let you in, you are not allowed to step into this Fragrance Garden.

441
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,139
It's not up to you.

442
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,780
You've come just in time.

443
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:07,139
Watch with me as she burns into charcoal and turns to ashes in this great fire.

444
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:11,359
This way, you'll give up, and you'll be with me forever.

445
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:29,979
Quickly, Shopkeeper, get out.

446
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:32,380
Shopkeeper, go out first.

447
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:38,839
- Madam Tang, hurry. 
 - Quickly, you go out first.

448
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:40,939
Get out first.
