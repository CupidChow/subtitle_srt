1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040


2
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:37,180
In the Name of Blossom

3
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,040
 

4
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:02,940
Mr. Lu, rebuilding the country is our wish.

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,640
But your wife and children are innocent
and shouldn't have died tragically for this cause.

6
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,320
I feel sorry to you

7
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,480
and even more so, to them.

8
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,539
I cannot openly pay tribute to you.

9
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:28,760
Only with this wine, can I comfort your ambition.

10
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,779
Mr. Jiang, His Majesty's secret letter
has been sent to Hedong.

11
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:56,480
The people at Huanyun Tower have moved
to the southern outskirts as you instructed.

12
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,300
Tell Yun Niang that those in the secret guard
who have wives, children, or parents,

13
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:08,460
should be sent away and properly settled
before the Spring Exam.

14
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,080
Yes.

15
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,819
Mr. Jiang, you're different from Minister Lu.

16
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:40,619
We've prepared for the great plan for a long time,
and there will be no mistakes.

17
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,080
Is Mu Dan in the residence?

18
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,219
Mr. Jiang, you've come around?

19
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,080
Yes, I have.

20
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,600
Part ways and find happiness separately?

21
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:05,700
 

22
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,099
Mr. Jiang is determined that
it is inappropriate to further delay you, Ms. He.

23
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,260
Before you move out of the Jiang Mansion,
Mr. Jiang will not return.

24
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,659
His great endeavor
is about to be set in motion, isn't it?

25
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:27,520
For fear of an almost certain death,
he is forcing me to leave.

26
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,500
Mr. Jiang wishes for prosperity in your business
and joy in the rest of your life.

27
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
I shall leave now.

28
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,900
This damp red clay is only found
in the southern outskirts of the city.

29
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,330
Stop.

30
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,100
Continue.

31
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:31,819
Speed up.

32
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:39,739
Mr. Jiang, we caught a suspicious beggar
in the mountains.

33
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:41,539
Not sure if he is a spy for Prince Ning.

34
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,939
- Bring him up. 
 - Yes.

35
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,440
Come on.

36
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,160
Ms. He.

37
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,819
There are hidden sentries
at all the checkpoints here.

38
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,099
If they mistook you for Prince Ning's spy
and shot you on the spot,

39
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,539
 
wouldn't you have died unjustly?

40
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,520
From now on, don't do
such dangerous things anymore.

41
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:33,560
Fortunately, I came today.

42
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,490
Otherwise, I would never have known that the people in your courtyard are not secret guards

43
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,280
but death warriors.

44
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,560
They all disregard life and death,

45
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,059
- I… 
 - I did not come to pester you.

46
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,199
I actually came to seek an answer.

47
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:08,260
But after seeing all this,
I already got the answer.

48
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:16,450
Jiang Chang Yang, I haven't experienced your past,

49
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,380
nor have I stood in your position

50
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,920
or understood the heavy responsibility you bear.

51
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,460
But since I am fond of you, even if I don't agree with your decision,

52
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,060
I will respect your choice.

53
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:42,100
Don't worry, I will sign and seal
the Concubine Release Document.

54
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,679
Just have Chuan Yu come to pick it up.

55
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,560
Thank you.

56
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:10,710
Also, if your endeavor with His Majesty needs me,

57
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,000
feel free to tell me at any time.

58
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,419
Rest assured. I'm not doing this
for romantic affairs.

59
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:25,240
Only because I am the owner of Wuyong Hall.

60
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:31,439
Okay.

61
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,220
I'm off.

62
00:09:57,148 --> 00:10:01,188
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫ 

63
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:05,148
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫ 

64
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:09,116
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫ 

65
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:14,212
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫ 

66
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:19,298
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫ 

67
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,259
When you first received this hairpin,
it was broken.

68
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,390
Perhaps at that time

69
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,820
the end was already decided.

70
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:41,287
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫ 

71

 ♫ Let the years migrate ♫ 

82
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:59,832
 ♫ Flowers bloom and fall ultimately to oneself ♫

84
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
Mu Dan.

85
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,780
Is the cargo list for
the Flower Boat Tour ready? Let me see it.

86
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,579
- Mu Dan. 
 - The Flower Boat Tour is near.

87
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:44,020
This is important for Huamanzhu and Wuyong Hall.
No mistakes can be made.

88
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,240
I need to take a good look.

89
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,020
After the tour,

90
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,579
the flower boat of Wuyong Hall and Huamanzhu
will head south, offering help along the way.

91
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:04,740
Ms. He will also go with the boat
to open a branch shop in the South.

92
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,260
This has been something she wanted to do.

93
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,120
She'll stop at each place along the water route, and when she returns,

94
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,480
the affairs of the court should have reached a conclusion.

95
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:22,380
But I heard from a staff member that Ms. He
has taken all her belongings with her.

96
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,919
There is no set date for her return. She may stay
in the south to oversee the branch shop.

97
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,100
She might also travel for leisure
after setting up the shop.

98
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,660
Mr. Jiang, this farewell
may mean you will not meet again.

99
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:39,779
Mountains are high and waters are long.

100
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,539
Mr. Jiang, if you regret it in the future,
you might not even be able to find her.

101
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:48,319
If anything happens to her in Chang'an,
I would more than just regret it.

102
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,559
I am reluctant, but I cannot afford to gamble.

103
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,330
If she can roam freely out there,

104
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,490
that would be great.

105
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:13,420
Well, I'll go get the Concubine Release Document.

106
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:23,140
When the tour ends, I'll go see her off.

107
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,140
Then, I'll personally ask her for it.

108
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,220
Come and take a look.

109
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,860
Lv's Flower Shop thanks everyone
for your support throughout the year.

110
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,340
May the flowers be
even more beautiful than last year.

111
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,779
Great!

112
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:50,019
Please support us more and take a look.

113
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,179
Good!

114
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,290
- Great. 
 - Great.

115
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:29,190
   

116
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,799
- Great.
- Great.

117
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,419
Great.

118
00:15:54,419 --> 00:16:00,220
Huamanzhu stands in Chang'an
thanks to the support and care of our clients.

119
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,759
The newly established Wuyong Hall uses flowers as medicine and offers medical consultations.

120
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,260
We hope the fragrance spreads far and wide.

121
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:13,020
Today, we prepared sea pomegranate wine with goji
that dispels cold and promotes blood circulation.

122
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,559
Everyone is welcome to taste it
and celebrate today together.

123
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,500
Amazing.

124
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,740
Help yourselves.

125
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,950
Nice.

- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

- Take care.
- Take care now.

00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,759
Various kinds of flower seeds.
The more you buy, the more gifts you get.

00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,719
Petal sachets, available while stocks last.

00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:33,060
Petal sachets.

144
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,780
Mu Dan, Jiang Chang Yang hasn't sent anyone
to pick up the Concubine Release Document yet.

145
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,880
How about I take a pot of wine to hurry him up?

146
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,819
No problem, after I leave,
you can pass it on to him for me.

147
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:47,519
- Alright. 
 - Lady He, one set of herbal plaster.

148
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,780
Alright, today our herbal plaster
and rheumatic plaster are ten wen cheaper.

149
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,340
I remember, sir,
that you used this prescription before.

150
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,759
Why not stock up on a few more today?

151
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,699
Alright, I'll take five more sets of each.

152
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:01,699
Alright, Liu Lang, go get the goods.

153
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:03,299
Alright.

154
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,459
Thank you.

155
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:08,459
Here's your wine.

156
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,580
Firework signal?

157
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,370
You mean that when we encounter danger next time,

158
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,420
you will come after seeing this?

159
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:21,150
Don't be upset.

160
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,140
At worst, we'll start over.

161
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,870
I'll be with you.

162
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:33,480
Then I will take it seriously.

163
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:00,780
The moon in the water,

164
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,580
No matter how carefully you try to hold it

165
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,739
it will slip away bit by bit.

166
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,200
You've had too much to drink.

167
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:04,520
It's getting late and cold.
Let's go back to the cabin.

168
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,200
I've signed the Concubine Release Document.

169
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,900
I wish you peace, success,
and great achievements in the future.

170
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,440
Tomorrow, I will leave Chang'an.

171
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,739
Going south to do business is a good thing.

172
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:47,839
Understanding all things and traveling
the world. How free-spirited.

173
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:53,019
This is your dream.

174
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:55,539
You were once my dream, too.

175
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:05,459
So tonight, I've come to see you off.

176
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:16,540
Alright, since it's a farewell,
why not have a drink before leaving?

177
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,720
I've prepared the wine.

178
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,040
This is the wine your mother prepared
for your wedding.

179
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,720
Our marriage is fake, so why waste it?

180
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,839
After this wine, you will achieve great feats,
and I will travel the world.

181
00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:01,119
We will part ways peacefully.

182
00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:00,240
I am aware of what happened with Minister Lu.

183
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:09,480
I will not let the same thing happen to you.

184
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,419
Everyone says he and Madam Lu are deeply in love.

185
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:18,340
But if Madam Lu had known
about this disaster in advance,

186
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,979
would she still choose to marry
Minister Lu and have children with him?

187
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:29,219
No one can make a conclusion on this matter.
Only Madam Lu knows the answer in her heart.

188
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,140
Similarly, you have never asked me either.

189
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,179
I can't be that selfish.

190
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,140
But you cannot make choices for me even more.

191
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:49,380
Back then at Pei Zhong's villa,

192
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,860
if I had really died, would you have regretted it

193
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:59,000
that you didn't tell me your feelings earlier
and let me die with regrets?

194
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:01,750
Everyone is destined to die.

195
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:07,100
But if one cannot hear heartfelt words
from their beloved before dying,

196
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,960
that's truly a life lived in vain.

197
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,739
You know my feelings.

198
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,599
But I want to hear it from you.

199
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:23,900
Even if tonight, we separate
and never meet again in this life,

200
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,979
I will have no regrets.

201
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,259
Yes, you are in my heart.

202
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:41,399
I love you more than my own life,
so I must let you go.

203
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:44,820
I can't afford those "what ifs".

204
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,440
What if I die before you,
making you suffer for the rest of your life?

205
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,300
What if I can't protect you
and cause you to die with me?

206
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,620
Do you think I am the kind of person
who would hang myself if I lost my husband?

207
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,480
Or do you think I am too fragile
to protect myself?

208
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,659
Listen.

209
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:09,819
Since I dared to choose you,
I can bear the possibility of losing you one day.

210
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:18,459
Wuyong Hall and Qingshuzhai will go South,
opening branches everywhere.

211
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:21,419
In terms of devotion to serve the country,
I am not inferior to you.

212
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:27,020
I can be your confidence.
We can clearly achieve both.

213
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:32,860
Why do you forsake the happiness we can have
for the sake of unknown fears?

214
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:52,200
I've heard your true words tonight.

215
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:56,159
You can go now.

216
00:28:01,568 --> 00:28:04,162
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫ 

217
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:08,096
 ♫ Traversing dangers is not in vain ♫ 

218
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:10,820
 ♫ There are thousands of thoughts ♫ 

219
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,480
Sea pomegranate wine? You've been here all night.

220
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,860
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫ 

221
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,200
And I will be here from now on.

222
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,620
 ♫ Flowers bloom and wither I only wish that you Remain unscathed ♫ 

223
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:36,516
 ♫ Looking back I see high mountains And long waters ♫ 

224
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:48,179
Ms. He finally dispelled Mr. Jiang's doubts.

225
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:53,139
What are you talking about? Clearly,
Mr. Jiang is reluctant to let go of Mu Dan.

226
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,739
I'll go in place of Mu Dan for the business trip.

227
00:28:57,739 --> 00:29:00,499
I've packed my luggage and will travel
with Ms. Sun and the others.

228
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:02,739
It's perfect for me to go out for some experience.

229
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,900
While I'm gone, you must take good care of Mu Dan.

230
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,739
Don't let her be bullied by Mr. Jiang.

231
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:13,380
Don't worry. All right, let's eat quickly.
Everyone worked hard today.

232
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,179
- Come on, let's dig in.
- This is delicious.

233
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,099
- Liu Lang, eat more meat. 
 - Thank you.

234
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,620
Jiang Chang Yang.

235
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,280
Jiang Chang Yang.

236
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,150
Mu Dan. Mu Dan,

237
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,580
I made jiaozi for you all.
Come and try them.

238
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,780
Fu,

239
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,900
where is he?

240
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,820
- He…
- If he dares to leave you, I'll smash his house.

241
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,420
Take this.

242
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,679
Girls!

243
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,919
Where is Jiang Chang Yang?

244
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,919
He's in the backyard.

245
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,739
I've wanted to punch him
for a long time, just watch.

246
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:47,540
Today, I'm going to pinch his ankle.
I'm going to squeeze his nape.

247
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,780
I'll give him a good beating first.

248
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:55,179
Did Jiang Chang Yang get ready
with everything for ending it?

249
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:56,979
How dare he?

250
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:07,580
What are you doing?

251
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,800
What are you doing?

252
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:16,330
We gambled that the first to marry is a dog.

253
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,520
Now, I concede.

254
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,480
Please accept these gambling winnings, my lady.

255
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,800
So much money.

256
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,179
Weren't they already married?
Why give her the money today?

257
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:45,780
If you came back for the money,
didn't you say so beforehand?

258
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:50,080
You were sleeping so soundly.
How could I bear to wake you up?

259
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,580
I just thought that if you woke up and saw so much money,

260
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,760
you would be happier.

261
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,699
Don't talk nonsense. Everyone is here.

262
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,780
Let's go back first.

263
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,580
Let's go.

264
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,039
Come on. Stop looking and hurry up.

265
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:23,380
Wasn't it all confiscated before?
Where did so much money come from?

266
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,919
What corrupt official
doesn't have multiple hiding places?

267
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:31,100
Did you only come back for the money?

268
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,440
I got up early and even made a trip to the palace.

269
00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:37,380
I have arranged it with Mr. Third.

270
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,359
Once we purge Prince Ning's faction, he'll give me
a position that allows for inspections everywhere.

271
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,640
Wherever your shop opens, I'll follow.

272
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:51,319
In the future, you won't be able to shake me off
even if you wanted to. Don't regret it.

273
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,879
I won't regret it for this wager I won.

274
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,039
You aggressively brought people
to storm the Jiang Mansion.

275
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:07,380
Do you think I regretted it after sobering up?

276
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,480
I didn't.

277
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:17,140
Tell me, were you trying to scare me on purpose?

278
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,280
How could I? Moving so much money
made my hands sore.

279
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,240
Jiang Chang Yang, what are you doing?

280
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,440
It's broad daylight. Put me down.

281
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,359
Put me down, I'll walk myself. What are you doing?

282
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:44,639
What are you doing?

283
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,259
If you get angry someday and take it out on this,

284
00:33:57,259 --> 00:33:59,219
there's still half left.

285
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:04,040
This way, you won't regret and feel sad
to find the token destroyed after you calm down.

286
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,199
I wasn't taking it out on it.

287
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:16,480
I just saw that you couldn't let go of me
but were too afraid to be with me.

288
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,220
So I helped you cut off the thoughts.

289
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,939
This way, you won't feel sad every night,
holding this hairpin.

290
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:28,519
Yes, yes, Lady He is the most decisive.
How could I escape from your clutches?

291
00:34:30,499 --> 00:34:34,579
From now on, you can't escape anymore.
Don't push me away.

292
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:36,720
And don't leave me.

293
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:56,080
I wasn't acting impulsively from drunkenness.
I will cherish my life more for you.

294
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,779
It looks good.

295
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,450
Do you like it?

296
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:47,999
It's quite unique.

297
00:36:29,336 --> 00:36:36,410
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

298
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:44,710
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

299
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:50,919
Who says encounter is easy?
This joy is truly precious.

300
00:36:51,979 --> 00:36:57,299
I, Jiang Chang Yang, swear to the heavens,
will become husband and wife with He Wei Fang.

301
00:36:57,939 --> 00:37:03,039
For all my life, I will never fail you.

302
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,619
Among all the fish in the sea,
I have my eyes on a particular one.

303
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:14,939
Time flows like a river.

304
00:37:14,939 --> 00:37:22,740
I, He Wei Fang, in hardship or in happiness,

305
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,039
will have no regrets for today's choice.

306
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:34,260
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

307
00:37:35,484 --> 00:37:43,167
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫ 

308
00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:46,939
Wait, Jiang Chang Yang.

309
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,779
In the past, our marriage was fake,
and there was no real wedding night.

310
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:01,560
Today, I specifically sought out this pair
of dragon and phoenix candles from Mr. Third.

311
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:07,514
Before the candles burn out,
none of us is allowed to leave this room.

312
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:15,776
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

313
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:22,496
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

314
00:38:22,496 --> 00:38:24,520
 

315
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,700
This is it, Yangu Inn.

316
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,579
We're finally here.

317
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:32,210
You're here.

318
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:35,740
I am Zhang Qian, the county sage from Yangzhou.

319
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,920
This is Ma Di from Xuanzhou
and Luo Ning from Taiyuan.

320
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,960
More than ten county sages from Luoyang
have already stayed at the lodge.

321
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,660
Are you Zhang Qian?
I was fortunate to have read your poems.

322
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,419
Truly, your literary talent is outstanding.

323
00:38:46,419 --> 00:38:49,139
Let me show you around. Come this way.

324
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:51,619
Please.

325
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:54,820
Mr. Liu, when will His Highness return?

326
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,459
We must see His Highness today to be at ease.

327
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:01,639
Have you read the strategic proposals
written by common scholars from various places?

328
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,340
If His Highness doesn't take this seriously,

329
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:09,959
I'm afraid the young men from noble families
will find it hard to have a bright future.

330
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,459
Everyone, everyone, please be patient.

331
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:19,680
His Highness is not at the residence
precisely because he's seeking solutions for you.

332
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,740
When will there be an update?

333
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,260
There are only a few days left
until the Spring Exam.

334
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,120
Everyone, you can't solely rely on His Highness.

335
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,220
After all, this concerns
the future of your own sons.

336
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:38,760
Mr. Zhu, as the Minister of Agriculture,
dealing with a few poor scholars should be easy.

337
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:45,280
I am in charge of warehouses,
not their examination papers.

338
00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:53,780
The Spring Exam is approaching,
and it's the perfect time to study and prepare.

339
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,519
It's just a pity that the days are short and the nights are long.

340
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:02,860
As soon as dusk falls, the lights must be lit.

341
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,519
Mr. Liu, do you mean

342
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:12,459
to have Father cut off the lamp oil and edible oil
from the markets, so they can't study and prepare?

343
00:40:12,459 --> 00:40:16,019
The Minister of Agriculture is supposed
to regularly inspect warehouses.

344
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:21,040
It wouldn't be excessive to inspect
until the civil service exam results are posted.

345
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,860
I have already spoken to people
in charge of various pastures.

346
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,900
From today, all kinds of poultry
also need to be inspected.

347
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:34,860
Without access to the markets,
they can't even make oil on their own.

348
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:46,990


349
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:56,089
 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining 

350
00:40:56,089 --> 00:41:03,163
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

351
00:41:04,317 --> 00:41:11,677
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

352
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:19,769
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

353
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:28,121
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫ 

354
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:36,318
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

355
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:44,605
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

356
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:53,021
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

357
00:41:53,021 --> 00:42:01,021
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

358
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:29,073
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫ 

359
00:42:29,073 --> 00:42:36,524
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

360
00:42:36,524 --> 00:42:44,610
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫ 

361
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:52,819
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫ 

362
00:42:52,819 --> 00:43:01,081
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

363
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:09,337
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

364
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:17,765
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

365
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:25,765
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
