1
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:40,000
 

2
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,759
Mr. Lv, come here.

3
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Mr. Lv. Over here, Mr. Lv.

4
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,679
Our previous plan isn't perfect.

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,399
What do you think they're doing?

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,599
Fu, what are you sneaking around
and talking about?

7
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,760
We...

8
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,520
Behind! Behind you.

9
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,720
Look over there.

10
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,759
So Guild Head Lv has set his sights
on Li Xing as his son-in-law!

11
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,799
Exactly!

12
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,199
Wait, Chun's whole focus is on healing people.

13
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,039
I've never seen her show interest in romance.

14
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,000
Ma'am, weren't you the same before?

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,319
Then, Mr. Jiang won you over
through grand gestures and devotion...

16
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,800
Mu Dan, we've prepared a surprise for Chun.

17
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,880
We'll need your help to trick her into attending.

18
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,280
Alright.

19
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,520
Don't tell anyone!

20
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,919
But... everyone just heard it.

21
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,120
Just keep quiet about it!

22
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:24,759
A mandate from Heaven, legitimate and justified.

23
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,680
A mandate from heaven!

24
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,799
I've brought you to this ruin. Why hesitate now?

25
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,039
You're facing death. Do you have any regrets?

26
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:31,799
My whole life... has been filled with regret.

27
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,640
That's why I became like this.

28
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,720
I don't want to live the way I did before.

29
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:53,800
Whether alive or dead, you'll be free.
But what about me?

30
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,720
If you hate me, just kill me.

31
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,639
Why did you betray my father?

32
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,640
If you've rebelled against him,
why plead with His Majesty to spare my life?

33
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:15,320
I don't hate you. We're the same.

34
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,280
I hate your father.

35
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,280
He broke my leg and destroyed my integrity.

36
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:45,320
He ruined my path to becoming an honest official.

37
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,760
With such a father,
could I ever find happiness in marriage?

38
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,759
Even if his crimes are unforgivable,
he's still my father.

39
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:26,839
I can't hate him.
I'm not worthy to be his daughter.

40
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,608
I can't personally kill my enemy,

41
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,080
nor can I bring myself to stop loving you.

42
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:55,639
Liu Chang, I've destroyed your life.

43
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:05,720
And my life ended in your hands.

44
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,839
From now on, we're even.

45
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,959
You Zhen.

46
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,039
You Zhen!

47
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,760
All past debts between us are cleared.

48
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,640
From today onward, commoner Liu Chang

49
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:58,199
shall live with my wife You Zhen
in simple contentment

50
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,919
and peacefully spend our remaining years.

51
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:23,296
 

52
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:35,616
 

53
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,176
 

54
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
If you need a consultation, please come inside.

55
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,480
Yes, everyone, please come in.

56
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,320
Please come in. Watch your step.

57
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Does it look nice?

58
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,320
- It's the same color as your dress.
- I like this one.

59
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,159
- Alright, let's take both.
- Okay.

60
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,879
Don't you want to buy one for fun?

61
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,159
- Thank you, Lady Zhu Fu.
- Here you go, Shopkeeper.

62
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,919
My salary is limited,
so I'll skip the children's toys.

63
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,720
Try it.

64
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,399
I want that one.

65
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,399
Hand it over. Here you go.

66
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,240
I knew you'd be the best, Fu.

67
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,360
- Mr. Jiang.
- I had my eye on this earlier.

68
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,912
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

69
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:18,519
Really? This one has a big nose.

70
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,080
 
One, two, three...

71
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,879
Again.

72
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,840
No, you're cheating!

73
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,359
Come on, let's check out the front.

74
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,440
Why is your face so silly?

75
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,960
Fu was so adorable.

76
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,200
How should I know?

77
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,600
 
Take care, ladies and gentlemen.

78
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,760
- Thank you.
- Do come again!

79
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,279
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

80
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,159
Haven't you bought enough after all this shopping?

81
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,200
When can we go drink at Riverside Tavern?

82
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,450
No rush.

83
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,960
Though we should drink and boat
during this Shangsi Festival,

84
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,799
as gentlemen, we should appreciate
the ladies' daily efforts.

85
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,639
They'll settle down once they're satisfied.

86
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,624
Your thoughtfulness will surely
win fair ladies' hearts, Mr. Li.

87
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:07,840
Thank you.

88
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,600
Assistant Minister, it's your day off.
Shouldn't you be floating cups with scholars?

89
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,241
Wouldn't you feel out of place among us couples?

90
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:15,320
This looks nice.

91
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,000
Chuan Yu, let me hold that for you.

92
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,679
- My cousin...
- Thank you.

93
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:21,039
wants to pick good jade for his beloved.

94
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,799
He specifically asked me and Fu to advise him.

95
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,799
I can help choose jade! Let me assist!

96
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,440
Quiet! My cousin isn't a corrupt official.

97
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,119
Can he even afford the jade you pick?

98
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,200
Try this.

99
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,120
Not bad. Try this one.

100
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,840
The city walls stand guard over the three Qins,
while mists veil the five crossings.

101
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,480
Though we part as fellow wanderers in officialdom,

102
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,919
true friends span seas and horizons.

103
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,600
Don't shed tears at crossroads where we part.

104
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,679
- So good.
- A fine poem.

105
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,519
Another poem, please!

106
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,359
When I earn enough from selling calligraphy,
we'll retreat to Mount Zigai outside the city.

107
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:14,720
We'll build a wooden cabin
and grow a garden of melons and fruits.

108
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,279
We'll leave all affairs of Chang'an behind us

109
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,720
and live quietly together
until our hair turns white.

110
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,519
Zi Shu... Perhaps we truly can start anew.

111

 ♫ I'll follow my heart's desire ♫ 

112

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:04,160
I will pass the Spring Exam.
I will succeed in the Spring Exam!

This sacred Buddhist ground forbids self-harm.

149
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,480
My sins weigh too heavy. I don't deserve to live.

150
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,119
Your compassion shouldn't be
wasted on redeeming a sinner like me.

151
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,240
As someone burdened with karma,

152
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,040
how can you seek relief in death
without repaying your debts?

00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:27,488
 ♫ The heart is boundless ♫ 

164
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:34,931
 ♫ Only wish to cherish day and night ♫ 

165
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:43,657
 ♫ The flowers bloom and fall, searching with you ♫ 

166
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:04,159
No one is confessing to me.
All this was prepared for you by Mr. Jiang.

167
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:09,640
 ♫ Floating dust veils the returning shadow ♫ 

168
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,839
Your birthday falls in springtime.

169
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,640
But Spring is brief,
and we're always plagued by troubles.

170
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,960
After all this time, we can
finally celebrate your birthday properly.

171
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:31,680
Now that I think of it,
our first meeting was also in Spring.

172
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,664
 ♫ Settle mountains and seas upon return ♫ 

173
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,880
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫ 

174
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:54,010
 ♫ Love is boundless ♫ 

175
00:19:57,021 --> 00:20:01,051
 ♫ Let the years migrate ♫ 

176
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:07,400
 ♫ Flowers bloom and fall ultimately to oneself ♫ 

177
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,440
Jiang Chang Yang! How dare you
pluck such expensive peonies?

178
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,720
Do you have so much money
you don't know where to spend it?

179
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,079
These aren't real flowers.
They're Guild Head Lv's thoughtful gesture.

180
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,520
Rice-paper flowers
modeled after your favorite peonies.

181
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,960
Enough. Everyone, come out now.

182
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,799
Even if Chang Yang had three heads and six arms,
he couldn't have done this so thoroughly in days.

183
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,440
Come out quickly.

184
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,679
- Let's go.
- Okay.

185
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,279
You all... really went all out.

186
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:58,160
And you, Xing. You don't
even blink when lying now.

187
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,600
Not everything was a lie.

188
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,240
Who did you give
that auspicious cloud jade pendant to?

189
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,559
Well done, Xing! You've won a beauty's heart.

190
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,839
I just haven't found
the right time to tell everyone.

191
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,280
Come. Let's check on the longevity noodles.

192
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,240
Okay.

193
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,000
Serve slowly. I still have unfinished business.

194
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Come, Yun Niang. Come, come. Stand in the middle.

195
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:52,480
It's precisely because of your planning
that I could have a free ride.

196
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,720
- This...
- Fu.

197
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,640
- It's you.
- It's me.

198
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,359
Come back here! I'll... I'll beat you to death!

199
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,399
- Stop!
- Give it to me. I...

200
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,799
- It's me! It's me.
- Chun.

201
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,079
- What about that lady?
- She's skilled. Let's wait at the shop. Hurry!

202
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,400
- This way.
- My medicine.

203
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,879
Quickly! Forget the medicine. Let's go!

204
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,719
Who else is there?

205
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,799
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

206
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,919
- This is me.
- Liu Lang.

207
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,160
Man, Tao, this is us.

208
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,399
It's us.

209
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:58,528
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

210
00:22:58,528 --> 00:23:06,944
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

211
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:14,944
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

212
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,840
Chuan Yu, it's you and me.

213
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,600
Chuan Yu's blushing!

214
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:50,459
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

215
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:58,459
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫ 

216
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:08,160
You've stayed with me through these years,
and we've turned hardship into prosperity.

217
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,519
Thank you all for preparing
such a thoughtful birthday celebration for me.

218
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:18,719
I am supremely fortunate
to have met you all in this lifetime.

219
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,640
Enough about that.

220
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:38,559
Simply put, thank you for your constant support.

221
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,880
Wait. Weren't we supposed
to surprise Mu Dan today?

222
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,480
Who leaked the secret?

223
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,480
Crying like this...
Do you hate Mu Dan's painting skills?

224
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,200
She stayed up nights working
until her hands nearly fell off!

225
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,279
Mr. Jiang, you organized this celebration.
Why did you spoil your own surprise?

226
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,080
What magic did Mu Dan use
to make you confess everything?

227
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:16,359
 Out with it! What're you hiding from me? 

228
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,480
 Nothing! What could I possibly hide? 

229
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,759
 Jiang Sui Zhi, you think I don't know my cousin? 

230
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:28,119
 Or Chun? Or You? 

231
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,839
It's complicated... It's so complicated.

232
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,240
Come, everyone! Eat the noodles!

233
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,599
Come here now. No more tears.

234
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,759
It's a joyous day! Come and eat noodles!

235
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,641
Here, take this bowl. Eat up!

236
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:49,240
It smells so good.

237
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,880
Mu Dan, what do you think of my new wine?
Is it worthy of the Zuijin Tower's name?

238
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,040
It's average.

239
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,600
Just kidding!

240
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,880
With Jin Niang's wine and Liu Lang's cooking,

241
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,599
the Zuijin Tower will surely prosper!

242
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,480
- Save some for me!
- Mu Dan, I've grown up.

243
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,880
I can run my own shop. You can rest assured.

244
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,480
The world's kinder now.
My unfilial son has also returned.

245
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,599
He's been helping with most chores in our garden.

246
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,640
Shopkeeper, leave with peace of mind.

247
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,680
With me overseeing things,
not a single flower here will wither!

248
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,200
I see.

249
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,680
Sheng County's embroidery shop is so successful
that we're hiring women from neighboring counties!

250
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,640
Magistrate Yu is full of ambition now.

251
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,000
He vows to show you
new granaries upon your return!

252
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,559
Let him handle it confidently.

253
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,359
I do look forward to that.

254
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,000
I've found a woman
as skilled with musical instruments as I am.

255
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,559
She'll work at Fragrance Garden in my place.
You can trust her, Shopkeeper.

256
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:50,800
Alright, Tao. Then come with me
to see the vast skies and seas.

257
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,359
Weren't you all just fine a moment ago?
What's going on now?

258
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,559
They say "Don't worry", but they actually mean
that they will miss you a lot.

259
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:13,119
Exactly. We finally reunited after so long.
Why must you leave again?

260
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:19,599
Madam, flowers bloom and wither in their time.
People naturally gather and part as well.

261
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,920
Don't worry. Fu has already told me.

262
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,359
This time she won't come with me
and will stay to spend more time with you.

263
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,359
Congratulations.

264
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,960
Yes, Mother. I'm staying.

265
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,319
I know you've been deeply worried
when Mu Dan and I weren't here.

266
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,119
Chun told me your health
has declined significantly.

267
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:43,240
You must never do heavy labor again in the future.

268
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,960
Moreover, with Chuan...

269
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,519
Chuan Yu and I here,

270
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,999
we'll handle all the work at home and the shop.

271
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:54,960
You should just enjoy your retirement.

272
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,920
Alright. When will you and Chuan Yu give me
a grandchild? That'll cure all my ailments.

273
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,039
Mother! Chuan Yu...

274
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,240
Mu Dan, maybe I should still go with you.

275
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,960
I wouldn't dare.

276
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,240
Mr. Jiang, when I'm no longer
by your side in the future,

277
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,160
you must be extra careful during fights.

278
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,201
Brat, my martial arts are better than yours.

279
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:21,759
You first came to me as an orphan,

280
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,400
and you've endured dangers without stability.

281
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,800
Now that you finally have
your own family, live your life well.

282
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,960
Mr. Jiang, you will travel the land
and be His Majesty's eyes.

283
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,599
I will remain in the capital as your eyes.

284
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:43,160
Official duties matter,
but personal affairs can coexist.

285
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,480
Though you work under me,
you're still Zhen Qing Yun.

286
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:53,519
The reopened Wuyong Hall
in Chang'an still needs me.

287
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:59,000
Besides, my father is aging.
I want to spend time with him.

288
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,119
With you in the capital and Sheng County,
I can focus on the southern business ventures.

289
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,200
Chun, Wuyong Hall is in your hands now.

290
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,640
Sui Zhi, go with peace.

291
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,519
I'll serve diligently in the capital
to fulfill our late Master's aspirations.

292
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,440
I won't betray the peaceful era
you fought bloodily to achieve.

293
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,400
Mu Dan, you showed me that there is
more than one way to serve the nation.

294
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,200
Mother used to despise merchants.

295
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,359
But now, seeing your achievements,
she's moved with shame.

296
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:36,359
To your past deeds,
and to your future journeys' safety!

297
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,800
Thank you, Xing.

298
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,720
Enough! We're just traveling south for business.
Why act like this is farewell forever?

299
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,240
Fragrance Garden remains in Chang'an.
My family is in Chang'an.

300
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,920
Sui Zhi and I will visit whenever possible.

301
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,279
Rest assured, everyone.
I'll take good care of Mu Dan.

302
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:09,399
If she loses even an ounce by our next meeting,
punish me as you wish.

303
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,000
They say fine weather, beautiful views, delightful
moods, and joyful events rarely converge.

304
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,960
Yet today, my beloved family and friends
share them all together.

305
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,839
Let's cherish this moment and sing with wine!

306
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,400
Come on, let's drink.

307
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,080
- Come on.
- Come on, have a drink.

308
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Liu Lang, I'm watching you.
You haven't finished your drink.

309
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,800
I'll finish this. Let's have another round.

310
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,439
The evening breeze here is the most pleasant.

311
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,319
We'll depart tomorrow.

312
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:56,760
You bid farewell to Consort Shu in the palace.
Has our new household registration been approved?

313
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:10,240
 

314
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,159
Jiang Da Shan, are you satisfied?

315
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,279
With Consort Shu's backing,
I can no longer rely on Mr. Third.

316
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,679
Enough. Karma repays in kind. I accept it.

317
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,399
What's this?

318
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,608
 

319
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:56,480
Countless memories happened in this place.
I can't bear to simply abandon it.

320
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,759
Previously, you were tricked
by that house broker into renting this yard.

321
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:06,799
Now, Mr. Third helped me rearrange the layout
of the Jiang Mansion and separated this area.

322
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,199
This will be our home from now on.

323
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:18,201
I was already moved on my birthday,
yet you still prepared another surprise.

324
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:20,880
Though the egret lantern was my idea,

325
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,440
everyone helped with it,
and you noticed it in advance anyway.

326
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,359
So I improvised this land deed
as your birthday gift.

327
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:35,280
I suppose a shrewd merchant like you
won't refuse such a valuable deed.

328
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,880
Thank you, Jiang Chang Yang.

329
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,719
Such an expensive gift
only earns me one kiss from my lady?

330
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,799
I don't even know what gift
to prepare for your birthday.

331
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,504
By then we might be somewhere unknown,
and there may be no one to help me.

332
00:32:57,504 --> 00:33:00,119
Corrupt officials are harder to handle
than shady merchants.

333
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:03,840
My lady, you'll need to think carefully about it.

334
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,119
 
The garden opens.

335
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,119
The peonies have bloomed today. Welcome.

336
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:54,400
By joining the flower guild, you'll now
share both glory and hardship with us.

337
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,680
Should you encounter any difficulties,
don't hesitate to ask.

338
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,119
Chang'an Flower Guild treats all equally,
regardless of gender.

339
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,240
That's why we have this opportunity
to open our own shop.

340
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,640
- Thank you, Guild Head.
- Thank you, Guild Head.

341
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:14,079
The new rules weren't from me, but from Lady He,
His Majesty's appointed top flower merchant.

342
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,079
I've heard of Lady He.

343
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,639
Pity she was implicated by her husband.
Now her whereabouts are unknown.

344
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,280
A good person like Lady He
will surely overcome misfortune.

345
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,760
Indeed. There's no need for you two
to worry about her.

346
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,441
- Lady He...
- Thank you.

347
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:37,840
is currently selling medicine and flowers
among the people, improving lives through trade.

348
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,639
- Thank you, Shopkeeper.
- We appreciate your efforts.

349
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,400
Well done.

350
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,280
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

351
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,360
Lian Niang.

352
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,199
This is for you.

353
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:01,679
 

354
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,519
From now on, you're free.

355
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:09,280
No more living in fear
or sinking with that gambler.

356
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,840
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

357
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,559
What are you doing? Get up quickly.

358
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:17,400
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

359
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,240
Look, everyone, this is my inn.

360
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,119
 

361
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,719
Ahead, there are flower shops,
clinics, and herbal stores.

362
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,679
Lian Niang, you grew up
in a fishing village. Can you swim?

363
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,920
Yes.

364
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,480
Are you accustomed to boats?

365
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,000
Yes, I am.

366
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,639
Perfect, I have merchant ships.
You can find work there.

367
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:50,360
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

368
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,559
There are many ways to earn money in this world.

369
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:59,960
I believe you can support yourselves
and improve your lives.

370
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,559
Okay.

371
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,599
Shopkeeper, you're so capable.
Doesn't your husband feel overshadowed?

372
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,800
Does he treat you well?

373
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,800
When it comes to living together,
why compete over who's better?

374
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,520
My husband treats me very well.
You'll see him soon.

375
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,960
The flower shop is just ahead.

376
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,039
This pearl powder could be ground finer.

377
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:29,559
Sir, do you like it?

378
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,840
Excellent, excellent.

379
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,519
- What about me?
- Not bad either.

380
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:35,960
Shopkeeper, is this your husband?

381
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,840
Look at this one.
It matches your complexion perfectly.

382
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,279
Jiang Da Shan.

383
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,039
My lady...

384
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,480
Come with me.

385
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,119
I'm just helping you sell incense powder.
Don't misunderstand me.

386
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,760
I don't need a clerk like you to sell them.

387
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,840
But you need a handsome clerk
with silver-tongued charm like me.

388
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,880
Take a good look! Buy more, buy more!

389
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,799
Choose more, buy more!

390
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:15,519
Your acting skills are getting better.

391
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:21,159
Those officials' wives would never guess
that I'm an undercover inspector.

392
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:25,960
You seemed to be
enjoying yourself outside earlier.

393
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:33,840
That was just acting. I only enjoy being with you.

394
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,920
Go away, go away. Come here.

395
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:41,840
I need to discuss serious matters with you.

396
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,320
After months of business in Yangzhou,
I've observed carefully

397
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,679
that the tax collection
aligns with His Majesty's new policies.

398
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,679
What useful information have you gathered?

399
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:59,039
Prefect Ge took his wife on an outing on the 15th
last month and stayed away for half a month.

400
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,440
On the 10th this month,
he's taking his wife hunting again.

401
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,559
This is the season
for dredging rivers and spring farming,

402
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:12,719
yet a prefect neglects duties to travel around.

403
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,719
Though His Majesty's reforms reduced corruption,

404
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:21,839
we can't tolerate
incompetent officials failing their duties.

405
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,239
If you've completed your undercover
investigation, you can take action.

406
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:33,839
Alright, I need to go out.
Don't wait up for me for dinner.

407
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,559
You haven't eaten with me for days.
What are you off to do today?

408
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:42,239
Master Doctor Fu is retiring to his hometown.

409
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,320
Many officials are eyeing him,
hoping to have him retire at their estates.

410
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,559
Such excellent medical skills only serving a few
would be a waste, wouldn't it?

411
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,920
So of course, such a talented person
should come to our Wuyong Hall.

412
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,039
My lady, your plans are truly impressive.

413
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:02,800
With Master Doctor Fu at this Wuyong Hall,

414
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,599
all Wuyong Halls across the land
will have his excellent prescriptions.

415
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:11,960
If Master Doctor Fu can leave
a prosperous place like Chang'an,

416
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,400
it shows he's not pursuing fame or fortune.

417
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,239
I believe he'll surely join me
in helping more people.

418
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,912
Alright. I just need to meet him before others do.

419
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:31,960
Once the contract is signed, it will vanquish
those officials' selfish intentions.

420
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,440
Let's go.

421
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,039
Ling Ge, these are Ejiao cakes
with peach blossoms I specially ordered for you.

422
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:54,639
You can consume some daily to nourish your health.

423
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:57,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

424
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,480
Your Majesty?

425
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,719
Bring it up.

426
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,480
Mu Dan thinks of you and sends unique gifts
from every place she visits.

427
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,320
But that heartless Sui Zhi

428
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,519
 
only sends memorials about official evaluations.

429
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,320
He completely ruins my mood.

430
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,639
This thin memorial must have cost
Sui Zhi considerable efforts.

431
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:42,440
If you miss him, why not summon him
to the capital for the New Year?

432
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:47,559
Here, try some.

433
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:51,039
Chun, your letter.

434
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,480
- Thank you.
- Tired?

435
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,679
Chuan Yu, look.

436
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,360
Fu, this is pear blossom wine from Mu Dan.

437
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,199
You're pregnant. You can't drink alcohol.

438
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,560
- Just one sip.
- No drinking.

439
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,320
Wuyong Hall secured Master Doctor Fu.
I'm packing to find Mu Dan now.

440
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,480
Excellent.

441
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,280
Here, this wine tastes good.

442
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,400
Mu Dan sent paintings.

443
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,880
It's Madam and Mr. Jiang.

444
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,000
So beautiful.

445
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,632
- Ice crystal peony.
- How lovely.

446
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:20,758
 ♫ Do not let the mortal world lock it ♫ 

447
00:41:20,758 --> 00:41:23,926
 ♫ Why follow the arbitrary guesses
of the common eye ♫ 

448
00:41:23,926 --> 00:41:30,422
 ♫ Smile at the winds and rains stirring the dust ♫ 

449
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:35,679
As an undercover inspector, you spend days mostly
investigating mediocre and corrupt officials.

450
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,159
What a waste of talent.

451
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:43,320
Only under clean governance
can great talents like me be wasted like this.

452
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,760
I do also hope Wuyong Hall's business declines.

453
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,440
Fewer patients mean less suffering in the world.

454
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,480
What about your business?

455
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,880
I sell medicine to the sick,
and flowers to the healthy.

456
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,480
If all people

457
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,159
could avoid illness and poverty
with grain at home, flowers in the courtyard,

458
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:10,119
and a loved one in their hearts,
that would be the best of days.

459
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,920
Alright, I'll head to Wuyong Hall later
to check on the newly arrived herbs.

460
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,039
You can go back first.

461
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:18,920
My official duties are done for today.
I'll accompany you.

462
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,000
This is also my selfish desire.

463
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,679
Jiang Da Shan, you're truly such a clingy person.

464
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,559
You pushed down the wall. You made the choice.

465
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,760
Now, you can't back out anymore.

466
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,401
- Let's see if you can catch me!
- I'm coming!

467
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:38,400
Jiang Da Shan, you're too slow!

468
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,960
Wait for me, my lady!

469
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,560
Hurry up!

470
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:56,096
 

471
00:42:56,096 --> 00:43:00,450
 

472
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:17,724
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

473
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:26,138
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

474
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:34,330
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

475
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:42,682
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫ 

476
00:43:42,682 --> 00:43:50,879
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

477
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:59,066
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

478
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:07,482
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

479
00:44:07,482 --> 00:44:15,482
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

480
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:43,634
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫ 

481
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:51,085
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

482
00:44:51,085 --> 00:44:59,071
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫ 

483
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:07,380
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫ 

484
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:15,642
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

485
00:45:15,642 --> 00:45:23,898
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

486
00:45:23,898 --> 00:45:32,326
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

487
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:40,326
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
