00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,039
   

3
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,950
   

4
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,079
When can we finally see the peonies?

5
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,399
Don't be in a rush.

6
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:03,699
The painting on the screen was done by a court painter.

7
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:09,760
Before viewing the flowers, you can admire the customs of our Tang Dynasty.

8
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,239
There is much charm indeed.

9
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,920
So vivid and lifelike!

10
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,180
The artistry is indeed exquisite.

11
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,619
Such secrecy and mystique.

12
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:36,620
Could it be the snow peonies were never developed at all?

13
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,779
There's reason in what you say.

14
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,619
Envoy, you may not be aware.

15
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:47,539
Our Tang Dynasty, rich in talent and beauty, always values elegance and charm.

16
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:50,700
Brewing wine while waiting for a full moon, or tea in the spring breeze.

17
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,140
We're willing to wait to appreciate flowers.

18
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,379
If Nanzhao doesn't have such customs, it's truly a pity.

19
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,900
We've waited eight days. Is that not enough?

20
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,200
The scheduled time has arrived, yet there's no flowers.

21
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:12,239
Your Majesty, you're not teasing us, are you?

22
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:17,150
I believe Vice Minister Jiang won't break his word.

23
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,330
Please be patient, everyone.

24
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,920
The time has come!

25
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,420
Look, the flowers have bloomed!

26
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:19,519
- Father, look! 
 - Good. Nice.

27
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,839
These peonies can indeed bloom in the snow!

28
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,260
This is indeed a prosperous scene in the Tang Dynasty!

29
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,079
Indeed, His Majesty kept his word.

30
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,979
This lady has excellent skills!

31
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,840
I'm seeing peonies for the first time, and in winter.

32
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,580
Look at that pink one.

33
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,160
Not bad, not bad at all.

34
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,760
Wonderful!

35
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,720
Look, birds are flying.

36
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,519
Hundreds of flowers bloom, hundreds of birds come to pay homage.

37
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,079
Blessings for the Tang Dynasty, with peace and prosperity for the nation.

38
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,500
Blessings for the Tang Dynasty, with peace and prosperity for the nation.

39
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,639
Everyone, please rise.

40
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:25,419
Thank you, Your Majesty.

41
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,460
Since the peonies had bloomed, why make us wait?

42
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,580
Is it deliberate to show the majesty of the great nation?

43
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,539
That's right.

44
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,140
- Yes.
 - It's suspicious indeed.

45
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,299
Why make us wait so long?

46
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:47,260
Winter blooming requires accumulating sufficient heat and light.

47
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,539
At noon the heat is at its peak for blooming.

48
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,319
The long Dongyu Road isn't built with one brick.

49
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,800
The prosperity of Heluo is not due to a single spring.

50
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,040
Tang Dynasty's present prosperity

51
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,739
wasn't achieved in a day, nor in one region.

52
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:10,620
It's the result of each country working together in harmony.

53
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,539
I thought that women of the great nation were like birds in a cage.

54
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,779
Once married, they must follow their husbands and have no freedom.

55
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:21,620
But your performance is truly admirable.

56
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,210
I remember you're called... He Wei Fang?

57
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,520
What does this name mean?

58
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,700
My mother loved peonies very much and hoped I could live like a peony.

59
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,199
Its moral excellence is fragrant, and beauty is dazzling.

60
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,099
People praise the peony's elegance and nobility, surpassing other flowers.

61
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:48,380
Your mother must cherish you very much to give you this name.

62
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,460
What my mother wanted for me wasn't unmatched wealth and nobility.

63
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,339
Princess, do you know that the peony grows among mountain cliffs?

64
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:01,060
It still blooms resiliently after enduring wind, frost, rain, and snow.

65
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,659
I think my mother gave me this name,

66
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,539
hoping I'd have the peony's strong and resilient spirit.

67
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:11,940
No matter what difficulties, I can be self-reliant,

68
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,299
and never give up.

69
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,180
So that's the reason.

70
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,620
Wei Fang, Mu Dan, I'll remember you.

71
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,859
Today's blossoming flowers against the snow is like a fairyland.

72
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:31,900
I'm very pleased! Bring the pen.

73
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,700
Yes.

74
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,339
He Wei Fang, a merchant well-known in Chang'an.

75
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:59,339
She relieved worries for me and added color to the nation.

76
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,539
I praise her wisdom and grant her honors.

77
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,999
Today, she is appointed a leader of flower merchants.

78
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,360
Bestow the phrase "National Beauty and Elegance."

79
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,680
   

80
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,688
Thank you, Your Majesty, for the grace.

81
00:08:22,688 --> 00:08:25,656
♫  Nor shallow, presumptive gazes question you  ♫

82
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:32,152
♫  Laugh as storms overturn the dust  ♫

83
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:38,003
♫  A blooming flower with proud spirit reflects the color of the sky  ♫

84
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:39,904
♫  And never withering  ♫

85
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:46,832
♫  Don’t let time tarnish the beauty of the fragrance  ♫

86
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,779
Tonight, Prince Ning arranged a family banquet and invited envoys.

87
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:13,760
It might be an attempt to win hearts for future plans.

88
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,359
He…

89
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:37,980
Strange. What happened between you two?

90
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,860
There are no outsiders here, so, there's no need to pretend.

91
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,419
She received rewards today. I'll let her enjoy it alone.

92
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,699
Why should I disturb her?

93
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,240
What happened between you and Sui Zhi?

94
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,240
Nothing.

95
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,860
Although, Consort Shu,

96
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,059
you're accompanying His Majesty daily, why are you still depressed?

97
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:15,059
Princess Ashina Dan also accompanies His Majesty.

98
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:20,679
His Majesty treats her intimately, seems this marriage alliance will happen.

99
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,679
If you're distressed by this, have you told His Majesty?

100
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,380
Concubines are no different from subjects.

101
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,520
They should bow and obey, for the stability of the country.

102
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,539
But I feel if His Majesty were willing, he would've issued the decree already.

103
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,179
You're not saying anything,

104
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,319
but what if His Majesty feels the same?

105
00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:00,939
Being by the emperor's side, how can one dare hope for mutual understanding?

106
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,000
Mu Dan, sometimes I really envy you.

107
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:22,059
Rather than guessing and secretly being understanding, why not speak frankly.

108
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:25,020
The more you conceal, the deeper you hide.

109
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,500
You hide your sadness, and also your true heart.

110
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,759
As for His Majesty's true feelings, if you don't speak or try,

111
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,079
how can you see them clearly?

112
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:41,260
Come on, Sui Zhi.

113
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,719
People speak honestly after drinking. Take my advice.

114
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:47,380
At the right time, pretend to be drunk or asleep.

115
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,400
Perhaps you might be able to see His Majesty's true heart clearly.

116
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,100
Your Majesty, it's late, and the palace gates are already locked.

117
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,819
As for the Floral Envoy and his lady…

118
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:06,860
They worked hard for many days. Let them stay in the palace tonight.

119
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,560
Yes.

120
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:25,319
Ashina Dan is bright and lively, just like you used to be.

121
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:35,439
If you hadn't entered the palace, would you be like her?

122
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:47,439
Juebei wants a marriage alliance.

123
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,550
Ling Ge?

124
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,020
Are you not asleep?

125
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,579
I can't hold my liquor, I'll excuse myself.

126
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:14,599
The north wind is cold. Why return this late at night?

127
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,959
Stay and talk with me.

128
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,720
Yes.

129
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,719
What do you think about the marriage alliance?

130
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,440
It would strengthen foreign unity and ensures the nation's stability.

131
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,840
This isn't the court.

132
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,710
I'm asking Huangfu Ling Ge.

133
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,839
I have been a wife for many years, and there's only Consort Shu in the palace.

134
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:25,849
You're blaming me, right?

135
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:29,340
You resent me because I accepted my brother's marriage proposal

136
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,120
and trapped you in the palace without freedom.

137
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,840
All these years,

138
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,939
you either moved to another palace or took refuge by feigning illness,

139
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:52,980
keeping to yourself.

140
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,140
All because you resent me, right?

141
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,620
If you want to resent me, you can.

142
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,640
I don't blame you.

143
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,900
I only hope you think about Prince Lang.

144
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,659
Don't torment yourself anymore and hurt your health.

145
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,459
I have unresolved postpartum thoughts, and it's just my nature.

146
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,419
I don't dare resent Your Majesty.

147
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:38,399
I've seen your former temperament, haven't I?

148
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,280
You were more open-minded and cheerful than Ashina Dan.

149
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,450
Only when you came by my side

150
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,620
did you become this way.

151
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,779
You're overthinking it, Your Majesty. I've never resented you.

152
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:02,980
Balancing court affairs, accepting more consorts, and extending the lineage.

153
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,919
These are your responsibilities, and I have the merit of declining luxury.

154
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:11,680
If Your Majesty is fond of the Juebei Princess,

155
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,480
I will organize your wedding banquet well.

156
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:27,110
Alright, I'll issue an edict immediately.

157
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,150
Consort Shu, prepare the ink.

158
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,680
Youthful past seems

159
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,010
like a lifetime ago.

160
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:08,090
Back then,

161
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:14,200
you gifted the bow and arrows you made yourself to my brother

162
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,110
and gave me

163
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,960
this brush made from the leftover materials.

164
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,650
I knew very well that I wasn't in your heart,

165
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,060
yet I still cherish it so much.

166
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,170
Little did I know

167
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,070
that this reluctance

168
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:49,170
would hurt others

169
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,590
and myself.

170
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:04,100
Why not make a clean break today?

171
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:11,000
They're both made of golden namu. How can you tell which was leftover?

172
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,750
This brush

173
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,910
was your true gift?

174
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:42,179
You're the ruler of the world, marrying me was only to uphold a promise.

175
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,960
Why bother with my true feelings?

176
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:51,639
The ink is ready. Your Majesty, please draft the decree.

177
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,900
Enough of this ruler and subject talk. Stop using these as excuses.

178
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:05,040
If you only respect me as the ruler, then concealing your true feelings is deceit.

179
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:11,880
This brush...

180
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,800
was given to Third Young Master by Ling Ge.

181
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,420
The person before you now

182
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,010
is still Third Young Master.

183
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,840
Ling Ge,

184
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,110
I just want one sincere truth from you.

185
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,219
My feelings for you are impossible to let go of.

186
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,040
But you don't know, so what to do?

187
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:03,780
Back then, I was glad the marriage agreement changed.

188
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:11,639
But how dare I hope for the emperor's affection?

189
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,520
We were too timid to share our feelings, and wasted so much time.

190
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,340
Ling Ge,

191
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,410
in the years to come,

192
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,790
please pledge our hearts to each other

193
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,480
and don't miss out again.

194
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:26,440
Still up?

195
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,019
I can't sleep. How about you? Why aren't you asleep either?

196
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:41,900
His Majesty feared we might be cold, so the charcoal is burning too hot.

197
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,000
How can one sleep?

198
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,219
If it's so hot, why are you covered so tightly?

199
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:02,419
If you can't sleep, why don't we sit up and chat?

200
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:04,119
Sure.

201
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:15,440
Let's first talk about…

202
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,079
when did you decide to become the despised Floral Envoy?

203
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:28,559
Old tales of the past are better left untold.

204
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:35,620
Alright, then let's talk about the future.

205
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,060
Do you have any plans for the future? Perhaps I can—

206
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,259
You have already helped a lot.

207
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,639
The matters ahead aren't yours to bear, nor should you.

208
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,079
When we reach the critical moment, I'll send you away from Chang'an.

209
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:08,000
It's not that I can't bear it, you don't believe I can journey with you.

210
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,630
Right?

211
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:23,900
The fake marriage back then was to save your life.

212
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,240
If I cause you trouble, it would reverse what we did.

213
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,900
You have your own life to live.

214
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,699
You must care for friends, family, and the business.

215
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,659
You shouldn't get involved in the court's strife.

216
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:40,140
How do you know what kind of life I want?

217
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,380
The weather is cold and snowy. I want to go see the flowers.

218
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,040
The palace is strictly guarded, no wandering is allowed.

219
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:15,130
The peonies from the imperial garden have been moved

220
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,760
to the greenhouse next door.

221
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:23,200
Let's sneak over there.

222
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,820
Turning the seasons to hasten the blooms,

223
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,459
only achieved fleeting moments of elegance.

224
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:56,399
It seems all things still can't be forced.

225
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:04,399
Sadness is inferior to cherishing. I'm with you.

226
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:10,359
The more we enjoy the flowers bloom, the more joy we gain.

227
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,639
I'm not drunk.

228
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,780
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫ 

229
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,740
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫ 

230
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,708
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫ 

231
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:40,204
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫ 

232
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,768
You've worked hard lately.

233
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,580
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫ 

234
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,680
Have a good sleep.

235
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:56,540
I'll only sleep for two hours. Wake me up later.

236
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,820
I still want to see the flowers.

237
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,480
Okay.

238
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,578
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫ 

239
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:10,180
Also,

240
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,530
♫ ♫

241
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,240
the Imperial writing bestowed by His Majesty

242
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,780
needs to be sent to the Fragrance Garden on an auspicious day.

243
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:25,959
Okay.

244
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,000
Jiang Chang Yang.

245
00:28:33,952 --> 00:28:38,834
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫ 

246
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,280
I like you.

247
00:28:49,856 --> 00:28:53,796
 ♫ Let the years migrate ♫ 

248
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:57,900
 ♫ Flowers bloom and fall ultimately to oneself ♫ 

249
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:04,000
Though the future is fraught with danger, and I might lose my life,

250
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,310
I fear nothing

251
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,060
and regret nothing.

252
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,200
It seems to be Xue Xi.

253
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,979
Xue Xi.

254
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,679
Mu Dan?

255
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:21,979
Xue Xi, you're back. When did you return?

256
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:25,499
I have been back for two days and was at the Royal Princess's manor.

257
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:28,100
She likes tranquility, so she didn't attend the palace banquet.

258
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,259
Are you in the palace to see His Majesty?

259
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,300
The Royal Princess said she missed you and asked me to invite you to visit.

260
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:39,939
Take your time. I have some matters to attend to at Fragrance Garden.

261
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:43,419
I'll take the Floral Envoy's carriage and leave first.

262
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:45,300
All right.

263
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,059
- We'll talk later. 
 - Okay.

264
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:01,820
After taking her home, pick me up at the Royal Princess's manor.

265
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,159
- Yes.
 - Go on.

266
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:20,119
I've been gone for so long, you still haven't expressed told Mu Dan how you feel?

267
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,540
I'll tell her my feelings during the Lantern Festival.

268
00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:32,419
This is the you I know.

269
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,040
What's your plan? Let me help you.

270
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,870
   

271
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,219
- Mu Dan. 
 - Da Fu. What's going on?

272
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:59,400
Yes.

273
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,920
- What's wrong? 
 - Shopkeeper He, you're back.

274
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,580
- Shopkeeper He.
 - Shopkeeper He.

275
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,620
Is that the His Majesty calligraphy in your hand?

276
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:11,800
The Flower Guild received such a historic honor. We're basking in your glory.

277
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,659
- Indeed.
 - Scholars, farmers, artisans, and then merchants.

278
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:17,680
Others have always looked down on us merchants.

279
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,580
Thanks to Shopkeeper He,

280
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,600
we flower merchants have finally had a chance to shine.

281
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,259
This isn't solely my achievement.

282
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:29,699
The floriculturists in the palace and everyone at Fragrance Garden also contributed.

283
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:32,259
You're all too kind.

284
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,780
Da Fu, return to your tasks. Please keep this safe.

285
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:39,359
Shopkeeper He.

286
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,259
Guild Master Lu?

287
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,019
Guild Master Lu, what brings you here?

288
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:52,900
All Chang'an knows that your snow peony showed the elegance of the Tang Dynasty.

289
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,300
Whether it's the skill of cultivating flowers or responsibility of a merchant,

290
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:02,060
I recognize I'm beneath you, so it's time for me to yield.

291
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,620
Guild Master, I have no such intention.

292
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,499
Besides, you've managed the Flower Guild for years, and I can't replace you.

293
00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:12,780
The Flower Guild's decades of prosperity relies on employing capable people.

294
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:18,380
Shopkeeper He, as leader of flower merchants, you'll take us to greater heights.

295
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,960
I've already discussed it with everyone. Please don't decline.

296
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,620
This documents the rules of the Flower Guild.

297
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,739
Every guild head has signed this document.

298
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:40,219
The future of the Flower Guild is entrusted to you.

299
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,659
Does the guild master have the authority to amend the guild rules?

300
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:48,960
As the leader, of course, you may.

301
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:54,439
Alright, then I'll accept this offer.

302
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,920
From today on,

303
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,300
there will be no gender distinction but equality in our membership.

304
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,599
Appointments will be based on capability.

305
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:24,780
Guild Master, it's hard for women to open stores. Should we reduce fees for them?

306
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:30,340
I'm not amending this rule not to give women special privileges, but fairness.

307
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,800
Everyone works hard with their own hands. Why treat genders differently?

308
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,399
If treated specially, it'll only make the world look down on women more.

309
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:44,780
Guild Master, what do you think of this new amendment?

310
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,600
Very good.

311
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,700
Previously, we were arrogant and biased. Now we're rectifying that.

312
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,280
I must commend this.

313
00:34:56,859 --> 00:35:01,240
Shopkeeper He, since you agreed to be the guild master, what's this?

314
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,780
I did, but I didn't say how long I would do it.

315
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,820
I've been the Guild Master for 15 minutes and reformed this outdated rule. That's it.

316
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,360
My ambitions don't lie here.

317
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,519
Guild Master Lu, you're kind and upright.

318
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:19,099
You're familiar with the guild members and fond of the flower guild.

319
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:25,119
It's more appropriate that you be the guild master.

320
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,340
But…

321
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,060
Guild Master, please don't be modest. Accept it.

322
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,300
Alright, let's put this behind us and not bring it up again.

323
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:38,260
Now that you've come to Fragrance Garden, why not try our new dishes?

324
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,500
Alright.

325
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,740
Captain Pei. 
    

326
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,300
Miss Xiao and our Young Master entered the palace.

327
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,979
Captain Pei, come again some other day.

328
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:59,139
It's the Lantern Festival, why is Sui Zhi not home with his wife but out with Xue Xi?

329
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:02,499
The Royal Princess asked him to accompany Miss Xiao to the palace for the festival.

330
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:05,999
He couldn't refuse.

331
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:10,139
With Sui Zhi out with others, the Young Madam doesn't mind?

332
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:14,939
Our Young Madam is open minded and went out early to have fun.

333
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,959
No need to worry, Captain.

334
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,280
In that case, I'll come visit another day.

335
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,240
   

336
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,660
Madam, come and look at the hairpin.

337
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,280
Come on. Here.

338
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,499
I like it.

339
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:39,619
Look how beautiful it is.

340
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:41,340
Try it on.

341
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,419
Come on, put it on.

342
00:36:42,419 --> 00:36:44,340
No, no, I don't want it.

343
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,280
Children of the martial world don't want such clunky things.

344
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,139
This one looks so nice.

345
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:53,700
You're getting older, you should dress up more.

346
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:59,159
This year, if you find a suitable husband, I'll be at ease.

347
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,860
You look nice when dressed up too, Mother.

348
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,280
Why don't you look for a suitable husband? I don't mind.

349
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,019
Don't talk nonsense. How could you say such things?

350
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,220
Someone might hear.

351
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:17,160
What's wrong? Are you worried about Young Master and Miss Xiao in the palace?

352
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,340
During the Lantern Festival, the whole nation celebrates,

353
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,290
and families should be together.

354
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,619
I also thought of my family.

355
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,660
If you miss your relatives, why not go back to Luoyang and visit them?

356
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,640
Alright, sure.

357
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,519
You don't know, after Mu Dan regained her status, she sent a letter back home.

358
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:38,449
But her father replied, advising her

359
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:41,459
that since she turned into a slave, she shouldn't do business anymore.

360
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:45,400
Marrying an officer and seeking wealth and stability were most important.

361
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,459
If Mu Dan goes back, who knows if she might be forced to marry?

362
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:53,019
That wouldn't happen. My father does care for me.

363
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:59,579
But he's like Xiao Chun's father, thinks marriage is the destination for a woman.

364
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:03,599
Since we can't persuade each other, we might as well go our own way.

365
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,900
Sending a letter during festivals to report safety is enough.

366
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,700
Besides, now I have you all as family, I'm already content.

367
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,019
- Thank you, and take care.
 - Alright, thank you.

368
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:16,939
Madam, let's go to the Qujiang River to see the lanterns.

369
00:38:16,939 --> 00:38:18,820
To see the lanterns? Sure.

370
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,720
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

371
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,219
Shopkeeper He.

372
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,800
Make it tight.

373
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,579
You're just confessing your feelings.

374
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:49,780
Even when we were robbing and killing, I've never seen you this nervous.

375
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,340
In a bit, go find Da Fu. Don't spoil it.

376
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,960
If Mu Dan is willing to return immediately, that would be best.

377
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,180
If she's having fun and doesn't want to return, there's no need to force her.

378
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,479
- No matter how late, I'm willing to wait for her. 
 - Yes.

379
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:04,860
My coming and going might take an hour.

380
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,860
Young Master, use this opportunity to test the mechanism again.

381
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,059
Don't make mistakes when she arrives.

382
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:11,459
You're so long-winded. Hurry up.

383
00:39:11,459 --> 00:39:12,959
Yes.

384
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:53,479
Jiang Chang Yang.

385
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:00,932
I heard them say you have something to show me.

386
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:04,892
♫  Melting and flowing with you  ♫

387
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:11,705
♫  If love were like frost, can these countless miles of stormy weather  ♫

388
00:40:11,705 --> 00:40:18,808
♫  See clear skies again?  ♫

389
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,700
♫  Clouds hidden by the night  ♫

390
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:33,419
In the past, I only dared to entrust my true heart to the bright moon.

391
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:38,260
I caused you to misunderstand, to be sad, and to shed tears in dreams.

392
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:45,100
From now on, you don't have to gaze at the moon.

393
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:50,980
I'm willing to run to you with the bright moon.

394
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:57,416
♫  Yet you are the light, piercing through my heart  ♫

395
00:40:57,416 --> 00:41:01,119
Let's admire flowers and the moon until we grow old.

396
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,120
Even if the moon waxes and wanes, we'll never be apart.

397
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,910
Mu Dan,

398
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,080
are you willing

399
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,280
to spend the rest of your life with me?

400
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:43,280
Be careful. Young Master!

401
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:57,950
