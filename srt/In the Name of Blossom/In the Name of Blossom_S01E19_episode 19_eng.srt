1
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,039
 

2
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:43,159
Minister Zhang kept five concubines
in separate residences.

3
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,319
He hid all the accounts and illicit gains

4
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,480
in the least favored concubine's residence.

5
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,920
What a complex game this is!
I can't believe you had the patience to set it up.

6
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,640
As for the secrets of the corrupt officials,

7
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,519
if Sui Zhi decides to uncover them,
nothing is beyond our reach.

8
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,679
It's just some bizarre tricks
and underhanded arts.

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,360
The evidence of Prince Ning's crimes is ready,
but his associates are being continuously removed.

10
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,800
No matter how seamless we did it,
Prince Ning is bound to become suspicious.

11
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,080
Prince Ning is gradually losing power,
and his followers can also see that.

12
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,919
Their morale is already unstable,
let alone the failure in the imperial examination.

13
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,360
The noble families are not so easily persuaded.

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,480
He can no longer manage everything simultaneously.

15
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,240
Prince Ning can no longer
afford to alienate the aristocracy.

16
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,159
Even if he wants to investigate us,
he must first placate his allies.

17
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,279
Once he makes a move,
our favorable conditions will arrive.

18
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,880
 
General Yu reports that in seven days,

19
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,920
the Hedong Army can be at the city's gates.

20
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,719
The Promotion Feast is set by the officials
to express gratitude for His Majesty's grace.

21
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,039
Since you're hosting, it's reasonable
to hold it in the Fragrance Garden.

22
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,560
When the time comes for the grand plan,
conflict may be inevitable.

23
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,719
Prince Ning doesn't have the Ministry of War,
but Pei Zhong has the Local Guards under control.

24
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,599
General Yu has come from afar
precisely to intimidate Pei Zhong's troops, no?

25
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,080
The Fragrance Garden is our own place,
and you are familiar with its layout.

26
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,399
If anything happens,
you will find it easier to act.

27
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:02,000
The people in the Fragrance Garden
must be properly arranged in advance.

28
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,800
I will have Madam Tang and the others
leave three days before the feast. Don't worry.

29
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,919
It's not easy to deceive Chun and Fu.

30
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,199
I will arrange an order for them

31
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,719
and let them leave the city
to deliver goods, to be sure.

32
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,280
Mu Dan.

33
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:32,840
Jiang Chang Yang, when you settle accounts
with Prince Ning, I must be at your side.

34
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,490
I never intended to persuade you to leave.

35
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,240
Didn't we agree

36
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,999
to never be apart?

37
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,920
Mother, you finally received
this lamp from your son-in-law.

38
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,079
My mom has known your name for a long time.

39
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,920
The lamp burned so brightly,
so she must be very pleased with you.

40
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,439
Of course, where else could you find
such a smart and charming husband like me?

41
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,239
Arrogant much?

42
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
Please forgive us, Great Monk.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,360
It's fine. You accidentally
knocked down this batch.

44
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,679
It must be fate.
Would you like to interpret the stick?

45
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,960
Sure.

46
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:29,711
 

47
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:32,896
 

48
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,079
The excellent fortune is for you. Take it.

49
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,559
As husband and wife,
we should share the same fortune.

50
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,759
Let's interpret this one.

51
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,040
Should we tie one
and bind our marriage even tighter?

52
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,280
Bind it for several lifetimes.

53
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,240
When I lit the lamp, I had already made a wish.

54
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,639
We are destined to be together for all lifetimes,
so why waste this unnecessary money?

55
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,439
There is no one more stingy than you.
You don't even want to spend this kind of money.

56
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,400
As you wish.

57
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,639
Look, Lady He has done so many good deeds,
but how can her judgment of people be so poor?

58
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,680
- She doesn't let go of such a shameless man.
- That might not be the case.

59
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,319
She is a merchant good at making money.

60
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,720
I fear the other party is unwilling to let her go.

61
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,519
That makes sense.

62
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,040
You two are mistaken.
It's not that he doesn't want to let me go.

63
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,839
I'm the one insisting on staying with him.

64
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,639
But...

65
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,600
My wife is so clever and sensible in every way,

66
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,000
except she can't let go of her love for beauty.

67
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,240
She treats me this way
because she covets my appearance.

68
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,759
Yes, my husband is good in many ways,

69
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,319
and his handsome appearance
is the least worth mentioning.

70
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,559
I hope you two will also find
such an ideal husband in the future.

71
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,040
Come on. Drink away, now.

72
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,160
I don't believe you can win every time.

73
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,560
- I don't believe it, come on.
- Come on, one more time.

74
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,839
Everyone, get ready. Three, two, one, start.

75
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,480
Here. Look. Here. Now, guess.

76
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,120
- I want to play, too.
- All right, in a moment.

77
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,040
This fist.

78
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,480
How can you guess correctly every time?
I really am amazed.

79
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,879
- Impressive, impressive.
- All right, pour me some wine.

80
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,679
Pour me some wine.

81
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,439
Ouch, it hurts.

82
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,759
Well, Chuan Yu, you actually cheated.

83
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,159
Why did you do that?

84
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,159
Stop meddling and go eat your cookie.

85
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,200
You two are like a pair of brothers.

86
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,360
If it comes to a fight, who would win?

87
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,479
- That would definitely be me.
- Me.

88
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:46,200
 
Bet on him. Bet on him.

89
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,679
- She Yan.
- She Yan.

90
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,480
Bet on She Yan. We all bet on She Yan.

91
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,559
You guys...

92
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,679
The fruits are here.

93
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,320
- Come on. Come on.
- Here.

94
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,360
Please.

95
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,720
Alright, here we go.

96
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,040
- Hurry. Hurry.
- Come on.

97
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,559
It's happening.

98
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,880
Go. Hit him.

99
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,759
She Yan. She Yan.

100
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,839
- I placed the wrong bet.
- Come on, She Yan.

101
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,279
- She Yan.
- Chuan Yu.

102
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,519
- Go.
- Hold on, Chuan Yu.

103
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,519
- Push him hard.
- Get him.

104
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,640
Be careful of his sneak attack.

105
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,679
Nice.

106
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,039
Well done, She Yan!

107
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,839
Come on.

108
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,519
I want to say something before you go
out of the city tomorrow to deliver goods.

109
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,480
Fu, remember, you must control yourself.

110
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
Don't talk about resorting to fists
at the drop of a hat, you know?

111
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,879
Okay.

112
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,000
And also, Chun, you must control your mouth.

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,500
In short, when you are out,
always be careful and protect yourself.

114
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,759
Don't worry, Mu Dan.
We will look after each other.

115
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,159
Right, it's not the first time we're going out.
Why are you acting like it's a farewell?

116
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,799
All right, we'll be back in a couple of days.

117
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,960
Yes, I'm just worried about you.

118
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,240
Then I'll make some delicious food
and wait for your return.

119
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Now, go.

120
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,480
- Let's go.
- See you.

121
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,400
Be careful.

122
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,280
Don't worry, we'll see each other soon.

123
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:04,359
For many years, I only had Chuan Yu
and She Yan as companions.

124
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,960
After meeting you,
not only did my family grow larger,

125
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,199
but I also gained many friends and relatives.

126
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,879
When I was trapped in the Liu Mansion,

127
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:23,319
I never thought that today,
I could be so happy and content.

128
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,120
You've done so much for me and given me so much.

129
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,000
I cannot lose.

130
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,359
The hollow box.

131
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,120
This is our tied-together hair.

132
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,959
If it's a love token, how could it miss this?

133
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,519
You kept that copper coin.

134
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,960
You were the first one to discuss business
with the Floral Envoy with just a copper coin.

135
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,959
At that time, I knew that you'd succeed
in whatever you intend to do.

136
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,679
Could it be that you liked me since then?

137
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,279
How can I know when I started to like you?

138
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,640
But that night, even though you were injured,
your eyes were still determined and strong.

139
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,640
I knew from then on
that I'd remember them for a lifetime.

140
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:50,044
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫ 

141
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:54,204
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫ 

142
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:58,172
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫ 

143
00:14:58,172 --> 00:15:03,068
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫ 

144
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:08,096
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫ 

145
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:12,382
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫ 

146
00:15:12,382 --> 00:15:16,288
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫ 

147
00:15:16,288 --> 00:15:21,868
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫ 

148
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
This is mine.

149
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,240
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫ 

150
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,839
In one's life, what remains deep down
are just some moments.

151
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,479
My every moment with you is stored here.

152
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,520
No matter what happens tomorrow,
I will have no more regrets.

153
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:59,040
 ♫ If the rainbow light is kind ♫ 

154
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:06,120
Mu Dan, are you afraid?

155
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,800
No, I just still have many regrets.

156
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,200
I have not yet traveled
all over this vast land with you.

157
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,280
I have not yet tasted all the delicacies with you.

158
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,600
Jiang Chang Yang, no matter what happens tomorrow,

159
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,839
you must take care of yourself.

160
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,280
Remember that I am waiting for you.

161
00:18:51,008 --> 00:18:54,144
 

162
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,359
Cao Zhi was repeatedly suspected and persecuted,
which is how he wrote the Nine Sorrows Rhapsody.

163
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,279
Zi Jian's rhapsodies are rich in words
and have a unique style.

164
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:10,599
It's common to speak honestly and get dismissed,
but I believe I've never failed my emperor.

165
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,799
People's opinions and actions vary,
and they are evaluated differently.

166
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,079
Those who compete in foolishness for personal gain
fear our dedication to public service.

167
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,079
Those who conspired in factions envied my virtue
and drove me across the Yangtze River.

168
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,480
The ones with great forces can do as they please,
and I feel sorry for my miserable life.

169
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,640
My worries never end,
and constant sorrows surround me.

170
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,640
I haven't been back in the capital for years,
and I am so far away from my emperor.

171
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,799
Riding the wandering dragon,
flaunting the emerald and splendid banners.

172
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,559
I follow the correct path of my father,
and how could I take deviant paths?

173
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:53,319
I know offending the emperor calls for blame,
but I am ashamed to flatter for favor.

174
00:19:53,319 --> 00:20:00,960
You are mere new scholars, yet at the banquet,
you recite this melancholy, ominous rhapsody.

175
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,559
It's truly wanton and unrestrained.

176
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,359
This is just a rhapsody by an ancient person.

177
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,359
How could this be?

178
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,159
How could this be?

179
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,879
Are you so afraid, Captain Pei?

180
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,760
Master.

181
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,960
Master Xu.

182
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
Master.

183
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,319
Master, you are still alive.

184
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,960
Do you remember which poem of Cao Zhi's
I favored the most?

185
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,319
Throwing my body at the end of a sharp blade,
how can life be preserved?

186
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,839
I couldn't think about my parents,
let alone my children and wife.

187
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,240
Now that I have enlisted,
I cannot consider personal matters.

188
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,440
I'll sacrifice myself for national peril
and regard death as going home.

189
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,240
Good.

190
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,399
Your Majesty.

191
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,440
Your Highness, it has been
a long time since we last met.

192
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,559
County Princess, for the past two days,
Taoguang Courtyard has prepared women's garments.

193
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,520
Tonight, wine and bathing items
were also prepared.

194
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,960
For He?

195
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,760
Yes.

196
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,759
Zi Shu is crazy.

197
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,799
Jiang Chang Yang will not let her go,
and He herself would not agree to it.

198
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,640
Jiang Chang Yang is still the Floral Envoy,
but his influence is not as great as before.

199
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,319
If He wants to climb up the ladder...
County Princess, do not be deceived by her words.

200
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,440
Prepare the carriage.

201
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,240
Yes.

202
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,839
I've long waited for General Yu,
but an old friend has arrived.

203
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,359
I must toast your resurrection with this wine.

204
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:44,680
Master Xu, unfortunately, I just poured this wine.

205
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,200
Master, what exactly is going on here?

206
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,839
Prince Ning sent someone to assassinate me,
so I had no choice but to die.

207
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:02,599
Fortunately, Sui Zhi saved me,
and that's why I am able to stand here today.

208
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:09,280
Sui Zhi, so it's true.
You've been acting all along.

209
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,039
We have meticulously prepared this grand drama
for you for many years, Your Highness.

210
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,639
Please, graciously accept it.

211
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,960
Your Majesty.

212
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,000
Your Majesty, Prince Ning
is in control of the Ministry of Revenue,

213
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,319
smuggling, embezzling the national treasury,
and undermining the foundation of the state.

214
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:38,680
 
Here's the evidence for your review, Your Majesty.

215
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,480
Your Majesty.

216
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,519
Prince Ning forms factions for personal gain,

217
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,440
colludes with clans to buy
and sell official positions,

218
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
withholds taxes, and seizes citizens' lands,

219
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,240
causing countless people to be homeless
and the populace to live in misery.

220
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:02,599
Your Majesty, Prince Ning illicitly
establishes a weaponry workshop,

221
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,640
raises assassins, and harms loyal ministers.

222
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,456
He exterminated the entire family of Minister Lu.

223
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:09,256
 

224
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,440
For his selfish greed,
Prince Ning disregards millions of subjects,

225
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,920
seeks power for himself, slaughters colleagues,
and acts in defiance of laws and traditions.

226
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,960
He spies on the private matters of Your Majesty,

227
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,440
controls the government,
and brings calamity to the nation.

228
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,040
The great fire in Mengzhou that year
was an attempt to assassinate you.

229
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,359
Every single action defies the heavens
and violates natural order.

230
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:36,000
He is guilty of heinous and unforgivable crimes.

231
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,039
Such an unkind and unjust person,
the epitome of great treachery and evil,

232
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,599
should be stripped of power,
removed from position, imprisoned, and executed,

233
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,760
in order to give an explanation
to all the people of the nation.

234
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,519
I suppose, Your Majesty,
you are the one behind this feast of spite.

235
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:11,839
Now that things have come to this point,
shouldn't you say something?

236
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,759
With your malicious crimes, you deserve to die.

237
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,200
Ning, do you acknowledge your crimes?

238
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,359
Your Majesty, you must have waited patiently
for so many years for this day, have you not?

239
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,240
But these people

240
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:40,440
are either lacking in foundation
or still immature.

241
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,119
Do you truly believe

242
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:46,839
that they can, by merely raising their arms,
convict me of crimes?

243
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:57,440
Everyone, heed my command:
capture the traitor, and eliminate the villain.

244
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,279
Don't run! You also
formed factions for personal gain.

245
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,079
Sit down, you.

246
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,240
Prince Ning, do you confess your sins?

247
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:23,000
What difference does it make
whether I confess or not?

248
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,839
Yu Zheng, son of General Yu, and the Hedong Army
are stationed outside Chang'an city.

249
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,919
He is ready to provide support at any time.

250
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,160
And as for General Yu Chang,
he should now have reached Prince Ning's Mansion.

251
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,359
By the imperial decree,
he is to search the premises.

252
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,250
You only have an incense stick's worth of time.

253
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,160
If you kneel and confess now,

254
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,559
His Majesty may spare the lives of your kinsmen,
punishing only the direct offender.

255
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,720
But if you refuse to repent,

256
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,000
by the time the incense burns out, the Hedong Army
should arrive here with the confiscated evidence.

257
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,760
Then, your followers will be executed on the spot,
for their crimes are unforgivable.

258
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:35,960
Time doesn't wait for anyone,
and you're the one who needs to repent.

259
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,399
Men from Prince Ning's Mansion.

260
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,599
- Chuan Yu, get Mu Dan out of here!
- Mr. Jiang.

261
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,520
Make sure she's safe. Go!

262
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,359
Protect Master Xu. Protect Master Xu.

263
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,720
Be careful.

264
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,200
Master, let's go. I will take you away, let's go.

265
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,960
For those who recognize the times
and are willing to submit,

266
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,720
I will not pursue past grievances.

267
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,000
Those who persist in their errors
and resist to the end,

268
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,359
will be killed without question.

269
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,160
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

270
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,879
I am one of Prince Ning's men.
I sincerely submit to Prince Ning.

271
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,000
Rat.

272
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,200
Zhang Qian, take the Master and leave.

273
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,079
Sui Zhi, be careful.

274
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,359
Master.

275
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,079
Mr. Jiang.

276
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,920
Jiang Chang Yang, you have already lost.

277
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
 

278
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,559
The fire at the examination hall completely
burned away His Highness' trust in you.

279
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:29,159
In order to ascertain the day of your revolt,
we found Zhang Qian.

280
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:34,919
If someone can rise to power in one step,
no one will bypass the shortcut.

281
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:43,680
Do those so-called loyalists around His Majesty
have no weaknesses?

282
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:50,559
The more they value loyalty and justice,
the harder it is to give up their loved ones.

283
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,000
You lost because you weren't ruthless enough.

284
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:11,879
Prince Ning devised this plan in just a few days.

285
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,319
I'm afraid the estrangement with the aristocracy
was also a deliberate act for us to see.

286
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,079
You have acted for so long.

287
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:28,359
Being fooled by His Highness in the end
can be considered a reciprocal courtesy.

288
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,568
There are no close relatives in my residence.

289
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:51,040
All that's left are the household servants
and enough gunpowder.

290
00:33:54,519 --> 00:34:00,960
Judging by the blaze, Yu Chang
and his elite soldiers won't make it to Hedong.

291
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:10,800
Your Majesty, Sui Zhi, listen.

292
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,720
Do you hear their cries and screams
in the raging fire?

293
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,840
Who sent you? Where are you taking me?

294
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,000
Make it clear.

295
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,599
My lord does not want you to perish here.

296
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,079
Is your lord Liu Chang? Is it Liu Chang?

297
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,920
My lady, stop struggling and come with us.

298
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,119
This is a misunderstanding.
If it's Liu Chang, it's fine.

299
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,800
I don't want to die here either. I will go myself.

300
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,120
Let go, let go of me. I will walk myself.

301
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,399
You should have said it earlier.

302
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:31,039
Your Majesty is unkind,
yet I must consider the bond between brothers.

303
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,680
I'll use utmost benevolence
to conquer utmost malevolence.

304
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,480
As for Jiang Chang Yang, he has been mingling
with vile elements, forming wicked factions,

305
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,519
deceiving the emperor, plotting rebellion,
and slaughtering colleagues.

306
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,039
Your Majesty, how do you think
he should be punished?

307
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,800
I owe the royal family a life,
and I should have returned it a long time ago.

308
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,360
Sui Zhi.

309
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:19,360
Mr. Third, do you remember
the promise you made to me?

310
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:26,440
 Precisely because we are like brothers,
you should put righteousness above loyalty. 

311
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,720
 If such danger arises again,
Your Majesty must let go of me. 

312
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,800
Jiang Chang Yang, Jiang Chang Yang.

313
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,959
Jiang Chang Yang, Jiang...

314
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,640
Jiang Chang Yang.

315
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:38,359
I will accompany you and watch
Jiang Chang Yang die right here.

316
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:14,560
Sui Zhi, I can't do it. I can't.

317
00:39:12,928 --> 00:39:15,414
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫ 

318
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:19,392
 ♫ How much of the past does it hold ♫ 

319
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:21,804
 ♫ Falling into your eyes ♫ 

320
00:39:21,804 --> 00:39:26,195
 ♫ Melting and flowing with you ♫ 

321
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:27,974
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫ 

322
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:32,588
 ♫ These billowing waves for ten thousand miles ♫ 

323
00:39:32,588 --> 00:39:33,920
 ♫ Can they eventually ♫ 

324
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,682
 ♫ Touch the clear skies ♫ 

325
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:47,328
 ♫ The clouds are hidden in the dark sky ♫ 

326
00:39:47,328 --> 00:39:51,039
 ♫ How can they drift ♫ 

327
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,444
 ♫ To their anchor ♫ 

328
00:39:55,296 --> 00:40:01,344
 ♫ The moonlight is dim on my shoulder ♫ 

329
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:06,688
 ♫ Longing seeps out of the silk dye ♫ 

330
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:09,197
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫ 

331
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:12,995
 ♫ A lifetime of solitude is nothing ♫ 

332
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:15,547
 ♫ Yet you are the light ♫ 

333
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:19,264
 ♫ Piercing through my heart ♫ 

334
00:40:19,264 --> 00:40:21,624
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫ 

335
00:40:21,624 --> 00:40:26,240
 ♫ A candle flickers ♫ 

336
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,616
 ♫ Never speaks ♫ 

337
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:29,888
 ♫ But for you ♫ 

338
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:34,016
 ♫ I go forward ♫ 

339
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:44,400
The Floral Envoy is quite resilient. Verify it.

340
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,200
Yes.

341
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,280
He has stopped breathing.

342
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:59,039
Mr. Jiang. Mr. Jiang.

343
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:02,976
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫ 

344
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,784
 ♫ Traversing dangers is not in vain ♫ 

345
00:41:06,784 --> 00:41:09,157
 ♫ There are thousands of thoughts ♫ 

346
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:13,120
 ♫ My stubborn faith ♫ 

347
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,360
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫ 

348
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,939
 ♫ Amidst miles of distress, it's never forgotten ♫ 

349
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:21,451
 ♫ Flowers bloom and wither ♫ 

350
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:23,239
 ♫ I only wish that you ♫ 

351
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:25,856
 ♫ Remain unscathed ♫ 

352
00:41:25,856 --> 00:41:28,756
 ♫ I've had a hidden life,
like duckweed stricken by the rain ♫ 

353
00:41:28,756 --> 00:41:32,896
 ♫ I still remember the battle music of Lanling ♫ 

354
00:41:32,896 --> 00:41:39,220
 ♫ I can still hear the war drums today ♫ 

355
00:41:57,524 --> 00:42:04,598
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫ 

356
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:13,012
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫ 

357
00:42:13,012 --> 00:42:21,204
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫ 

358
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:29,556
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫ 

359
00:42:29,556 --> 00:42:37,753
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

360
00:42:37,753 --> 00:42:45,940
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

361
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:54,356
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

362
00:42:54,356 --> 00:43:02,356
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫ 

363
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:30,508
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫ 

364
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:37,959
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫ 

365
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:45,945
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫ 

366
00:43:45,945 --> 00:43:54,254
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫ 

367
00:43:54,254 --> 00:44:02,516
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫ 

368
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:10,772
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫ 

369
00:44:10,772 --> 00:44:19,200
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫ 

370
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:27,200
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
