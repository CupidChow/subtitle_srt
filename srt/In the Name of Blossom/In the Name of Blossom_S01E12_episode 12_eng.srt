00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,980
   

3
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,970
   

4
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:53,180
Young Master.

5
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,180
- Did the fish bite the hook? 
 - Yes.

6
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,059
Vice Minister Lu boarded Liu Chang's boat with guards.

7
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,680
Tie it tightly.

8
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,260
Everyone on the boat, listen.

9
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,979
Stand in a line immediately and wait to be inspected!

10
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,260
Prince Ning is suspected of smuggling,

11
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,339
and you gave his son-in-law
the position of Deputy Transport Officer.

12
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:32,700
They ate the fatty meat sent to their mouths

13
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,980
without knowing that the meat contained bones,
which would get stuck in their throats.

14
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,936
After tonight, Prince Ning's source of wealth
will be completely cut off.

15
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,592
It's not just a source of wealth.

16
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:44,499
Did She Yan not tell you
what goods they were transporting?

17
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:45,900
Don't you know him?

18
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,400
He's tight-lipped.
He doesn't even talk in his sleep.

19
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,140
Prince Ning's ambition is boundless.

20
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,980
To grasp military power,
he needs standardized weapons of war.

21
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,659
What do you think he used
to make private weapons before?

22
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:02,020
Does Liu Chang even dare to transport
copper and iron mines?

23
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,860
With Prince Ning backing him up,
what wouldn't he dare to do?

24
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,140
Mr. Jiang, this fish meat is
too fishy. I can't eat it.

25
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,479
Take it to feed the stray cats.

26
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,539
The Floral Envoy wanted to catch
the first fish of the Spring

27
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:26,779
and caught a chill accidentally,
so he'll have to take leave tomorrow.

28
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:31,339
I can't see the Emperor's fury in person
or witness Liu Chang be imprisoned.

29
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,439
Mr. Jiang, you have planned this for long.

30
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,020
Now that the tasks are complete,
you should take a break.

31
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,680
And it prevents Prince Ning's rage
from burning innocent people.

32
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,939
Assistant Minister Lu,
what is the purpose of such a grand setup?

33
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,719
Mr. Liu, I have received a report

34
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,020
saying that someone violated the regulations,
smuggling prohibited goods at night.

35
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,819
So I came to verify. I wonder why you are on this boat.

36
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,900
Assistant Minister, you're joking.

37
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,779
I am in charge of canal transport matters.

38
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:14,499
This boat's shipment has already been approved.
How come there's talk of violations?

39
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,580
Mr. Lu, your trip is likely to end in vain.

40
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,539
So it was Mr. Liu's special approval.

41
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:24,060
So it seems the person who reported it
is fabricating rumors and framing others.

42
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,419
That's right.

43
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,020
Well, since I've boarded the ship,

44
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,140
whether there are prohibited goods on board
will be clear upon inspection.

45
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,940
If it turns out to be a false alarm,

46
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,060
I will properly apologize to Mr. Liu.

47
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,539
- Search.
- Yes!

48
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,276
Wait.

49
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,380
Assistant Minister Lu, you should think carefully.

50
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,079
Prince Ning's Mansion is behind me.

51
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,079
Are you offending Prince Ning today
and setting yourself against him?

52
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,419
Mr. Liu, do not make it difficult
for me. It is my duty.

53
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:10,140
If this boat is indeed clean,

54
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,380
I will go to Prince Ning's Mansion tomorrow
to admit my guilt and ask for punishment.

55
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,720
- Search now.
- Yes!

56
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:32,520
It's past the fourth watch of the night,
why did Lu suddenly board the ship?

57
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,700
Your Highness, this shipment arranged by Mr. Liu
was extremely secretive.

58
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,020
I truly don't know when it was exposed.

59
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,659
People have already boarded the ship,
yet you say it was extremely secretive.

60
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:46,940
If they discover the things on the ship,

61
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,460
His Majesty will surely detect
our privately established weaponry workshop.

62
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,140
Rest assured, Your Majesty.
Mr. Liu is thorough and considerate.

63
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,859
Although our cargo ship was intercepted,

64
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:01,419
our grand plan might not have been exposed.

65
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,199
Liu Chang, how do you explain this?

66
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,639
I acknowledge my guilt, Your Majesty.

67
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,060
Is that all you have to say?

68
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,959
Tell me, what is the story
behind these copper and iron statues?

69
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,480
Your Majesty, my father
has always believed in spirits and deities.

70
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,419
In recent years, he has become even more obsessed.

71
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:09,728
After he was dismissed
from his position, he fell ill,

72
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,500
praying to gods and worshiping Buddhas everywhere.

73
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,779
That is why he heeded the master's guidance

74
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:17,779
and believed that inviting 99 deities
to watch over the house could cure him.

75
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,860
As a filial gesture, I privately cast these statues of deities

76
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,279
and planned to present them
to my father as a birthday gift.

77
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,500
So, should I praise you as a great filial son?

78
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:37,580
Nearly a hundred statues were transported
into the warehouse with much fanfare.

79
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,140
The people along the way saw everything.

80
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,580
Now, rumors are spreading
vigorously in the streets.

81
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,380
Where is my face, my dignity?

82
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,420
As a transport officer, you have abused your power
and broken the law knowingly.

83
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,079
Who would dare to trust officials, or trust me?

84
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,539
Your Majesty, you're absolutely right.

85
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,539
For all I know, since Minister Zheng took office,
he has colluded with Liu Chang,

86
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:02,099
secretly transporting tributes
and selling a large number of foreign items.

87
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,739
Meanwhile, they have accepted bribes
and sheltered unscrupulous merchants.

88
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:08,419
As a result, the common people
have suffered greatly.

89
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:12,539
Minister Zheng even dares to be
corrupt and accept bribes?

90
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,419
A thorough investigation must be conducted.

91
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,179
Your Majesty, I am being wronged.

92
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,099
Your Majesty, I have known Shou De for many years
and understand his character well.

93
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,020
He could not possibly use his position
for personal benefit or bend the law.

94
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,220
There must be some misunderstanding here.

95
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

96
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,140
If Prince Ning vouches for Minister Zheng,
of course, I believe him.

97
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:56,080
But, how do you think this matter
should be addressed, Ning?

98
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:15,340
Liu Chang wields significant power,

99
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,519
yet he does not appreciate the Emperor's favor
and uses power for personal gain.

100
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,799
He should be severely punished.

101
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,020
Please, Your Majesty, remove him
from his position as the Transport Officer.

102
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,620
Ning, this is your son-in-law.

103
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,620
When it comes to national affairs,
I dare not consider personal feelings.

104
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,860
On the contrary, Liu Chang has betrayed
the trust of both me and the County Princess.

105
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,320
He should be severely punished.

106
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,260
What a display of righteousness
by sacrificing one's kin!

107
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:51,819
Prince Ning is truly the pillar of the nation.

108
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,820
Liu Chang,

109
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,100
do you have anything else to say?

110
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,400
I humbly admit my guilt.

111
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:20,140
Alright, let's do as Prince Ning says.

112
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,860
Furthermore, to reassure the citizens,

113
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,779
the canal transport
must also be properly rectified.

114
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,579
Assistant Minister Lu
has made a meritorious arrest.

115
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:32,059
The position of Transport Officer
will be entrusted to you in the future.

116
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:33,819
Manage it well on my behalf.

117
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:38,439
Be sure to eradicate smuggling and corruption.

118
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,539
I accept the decree.

119
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,340
Come on.

120
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,060
Do you think it's unfair?

121
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,728
I dare not.

122
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,459
Minister Zheng holds a critical position
and cannot afford any slip-ups.

123
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:03,740
I can only apologize to you.

124
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,980
I understand.

125
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,620
But you did a good job this time.

126
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,340
Although the bronze and iron statues
were investigated,

127
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:18,620
many officials are also aware
of your father's devotion to deities.

128
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,699
So, the excuse of fulfilling filial duties
is somewhat acceptable.

129
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:27,140
If Assistant Minister Lu
truly discovered the raw ores

130
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,539
that would indeed be a big problem.

131
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,100
This matter has become known to everyone.

132
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,600
His Majesty feels embarrassed
and thus demands a thorough investigation.

133
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,059
But it's just for show.

134
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:50,179
Once he finds new amusements in the future,
he will naturally forget about this.

135
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:55,519
Then, I will have ample opportunity
to let you return to the court.

136
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

137
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,980
Lately, you should act with discretion.

138
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,819
The weaponry workshop is temporarily dissolved.
Everyone should stay low.

139
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,272
Yes.

140
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,630
By the way,

141
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:23,860
since you are dismissed and at home, it is just right to spend more time
with the County Princess.

142
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,699
It's also a good thing.

143
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:30,640
I understand.

144
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:52,860
Alright, just stop here.

145
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,939
Lift the items properly.

146
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:06,579
Mr. He, I purchased many precious medicines
from your shop in the past.

147
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:10,779
Now the He family has fallen,
I don't want to be extreme.

148
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:15,200
However, if you still can't settle the account
by the fifth of next month,

149
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,600
these two boxes won't suffice to solve the matter.

150
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,860
Yes, yes.

151
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,759
Thank you, Mr. Ding, for your understanding.

152
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,179
Your eldest daughter is thriving in Chang'an.

153
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:30,939
How come she doesn't
properly honor you as her father?

154
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:34,080
If I hadn't seen the desolation of your home
with my own eyes today,

155
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,539
I would have thought
you were pretending to be poor.

156
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:40,632
Alright, I'm leaving.

157
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,900
Take care, Mr. Ding.

158
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:51,399
This Mr. Ding is truly insatiable.

159
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,480
Those were two boxes of top-quality
paintings and calligraphy given to him for free.

160
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,140
But he didn't even agree to extend the deadline.

161
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,899
With such a huge deficit, how can we
pay it back by the fifth of next month?

162
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,839
Man Er, what's wrong?

163
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,912
What's wrong, Man Er?

164
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,799
Are you hurt?

165
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,020
Man Er, why did you drop the plate?

166
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,579
The sweet crisps were not tasty.

167
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,220
If it's not tasty, then don't eat it.
I'll make you a new one.

168
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,900
Everything made is not tasty.
I want to eat the snacks from Bifangzhai.

169
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,579
Okay, okay. I'll send someone
to buy it for you later, okay?

170
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:34,380
Why? Everyone in the house
is tightening their belts now.

171
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,980
Look at you. Do you still think
you're a wealthy child?

172
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,740
Why are you yelling at him?

173
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,439
He's still just a child. He doesn't understand anything.

174
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:43,939
Just a child?

175
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:45,699
When Mu Dan was his age,

176
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:49,120
she not only knew literature
but could also help me with the accounts.

177
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,080
She never caused me any worry.

178
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,459
What is your intention in saying this now?

179
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,480
No matter how talented He Wei Fang is,
did she ever think of you kindly?

180
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,100
Since she went to Chang'an, except for sending a few letters home,

181
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,539
has she ever thought of visiting us?

182
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:07,020
She is now the top flower merchant.

183
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,600
The Fragrance Garden uses so much money daily.

184
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,019
Has she thought about coming back to support us?

185
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,620
The Fragrance Garden
was left to her by her mother.

186
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,860
Back then, when we sold the garden for business,

187
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,179
we'd let her down.

188
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,100
Mu Dan must have suffered a lot in Chang'an.

189
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,939
And now, she's become
the top flower merchant on her own.

190
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:43,260
What face do I have to ask her for help?

191
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:45,740
Face, face.

192
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,939
You father and daughter only know about face.

193
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:51,819
Can that face be turned into gold ingots or money?

194
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,980
Can't you see what a state
our family has fallen into?

195
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,480
If you ask me, if He Wei Fang
had even a bit of filial piety left,

196
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,759
she should quickly come back with thousands of
bolts of silk and apologize to us.

197
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,419
You, you're unbelievable.

198
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,799
Mom, why is Dad so angry?

199
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,860
It has nothing to do with you.

200
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,459
Your dad is angry at your sister
for being disloyal and unfilial.

201
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,980
What use is being angry?

202
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,860
She is one of the He family members.

203
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,340
Her mistakes should be punished
with a disciplinary cane.

204
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,260
What kind of He family member is she?

205
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,260
You're right.

206
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,279
Man Er, you're right.

207
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,779
As long as this sister of yours
still bears the He surname,

208
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:52,579
she can never sever ties with us.

209
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,159
Come on, I'll take you
to buy some snacks. Let's go.

210
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:12,910
Take care, please.

211
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,540
 

212
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,159
Lady, please.

213
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,419
Where are we?

214
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,359
This is our future gold nugget.

215
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,032
Auntie.

216
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,979
How has father been lately?

217
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,028
He is doing well.

218
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:47,300
Seeing you so prosperous in Chang'an,
I am also very relieved.

219
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,900
Your father often thinks of you in Luoyang.

220
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,799
He asked me to bring these Hu cake for you to eat.

221
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,459
Why didn't he come personally?

222
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,219
Mu Dan, there's something you don't know.

223
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:08,599
The He family has been losing more each year.

224
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:12,499
Now there is nothing left in the house.

225
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:16,499
Your father is busy running everywhere
to repay debts.

226
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:19,200
How can he make time to come?

227
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,820
How did it come to this?

228
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,419
Father was one of the top merchants
back in the day.

229
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:30,979
How did he fall to such a state?

230
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,459
As you know,

231
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:39,620
when you married Liu Chang,
the He family spent so much to support you?

232
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,459
Later when you ran away from the Liu family,
everyone thought you were dead.

233
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:49,179
The Liu family not only stopped supporting us,
but also made things difficult everywhere.

234
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:51,900
How could we fight against officials?

235
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,300
Others are also opportunistic.

236
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,300
So how can we continue with the business?

237
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:05,499
Mu Dan, your carefree life now

238
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:09,480
has come at the cost of the He family's safety.

239
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,759
I understand.

240
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,740
I'll pack up and make a trip to Luoyang. I'll discuss solutions with Father.

241
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,939
No, no, no.

242
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:24,359
You know how your father's like.

243
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:27,780
He couldn't bring himself to come,
so he sent me to find you.

244
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,659
Even if you go back, he won't see you.

245
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:37,440
But if I don't go back,
how can I help Father manage the business?

246
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,459
You have a point.

247
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:44,179
I know both you and your father

248
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:47,380
keep each other in your hearts.

249
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,259
Your father talks about you every day in Luoyang,

250
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,419
saying he feels guilty toward you.

251
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:57,019
He also said that when you were Man Er's age,

252
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:00,300
you already knew how to help him count
and manage accounts.

253
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,639
You were very filial.

254
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,580
Now that Father is in trouble,

255
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:16,359
even if he won't see me,
I won't stand by and do nothing.

256
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,340
How about this? I will have someone
prepare some jade and silk first.

257
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,939
You can take it back to relieve the urgent need.

258
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:26,659
In the next few days,
I will contact the medicine merchants in Chang'an

259
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:31,099
and find a way to make connections to get Father's business up and running again.

260
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:36,119
Okay, I'm pleased to see you so filial.

261
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:39,079
However, these methods you mentioned

262
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:43,680
can't fundamentally solve
the He's family's predicament.

263
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,499
Auntie, what do you mean by this?

264
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,039
I have been with your father all these years.

265
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:55,659
I have a little knowledge about business matters.

266
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:59,039
There's no need to hide it from me.

267
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,939
Everyone in Chang'an knows

268
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:05,780
that the Fragrance Garden
is your fundamental source of wealth.

269
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,259
Father didn't send you.

270
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,279
Mu Dan, why do you say so?

271
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,979
Of course, your father sent me.

272
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:17,860
I know Father.

273
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,219
He loved Mother deeply.

274
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:22,780
What Mother cherished most
in her life was the Fragrance Garden.

275
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,860
Father knows this very well,

276
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,540
so how could he ask me for it?

277
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:32,419
Auntie, you went to great lengths coming to Chang'an without telling Father.

278
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:37,259
But unfortunately,
you won't get a single penny from me,

279
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:40,179
and you won't be able
to take the Fragrance Garden from me.

280
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:42,839
Someone, see the guests out.

281
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,380
Please.

282
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,119
Mu Dan, you misunderstood me.

283
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,100
Mu Dan, the He family truly needs your help now.

284
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,979
Look at Man Er. Look at your brother.

285
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,499
He is still so young.

286
00:21:55,499 --> 00:22:01,400
Can you bear to see him suffer hunger and cold,
living rough with us?

287
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,400
An unreasonable and vulgar woman,
unfilial and disloyal.

288
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,540
- I don't acknowledge you as my sister. 
 - Don't say that.

289
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,739
Father was right about something.

290
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:19,019
When I was eight, I followed him
running shops and doing business.

291
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:21,759
I could work the abacus
faster than the bookkeeper.

292
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,860
If your son could achieve that,

293
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,620
you surely wouldn't live a life of hunger.

294
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,300
After all, he is loyal, filial, and reasonable.

295
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:35,620
Man Er is your father's only heir,

296
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,699
and will inherit the He family's business.

297
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:42,259
How could you belittle him like this?

298
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:44,820
When he becomes the head of the He family,

299
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,499
when we return to Luoyang, you will kneel to him.

300
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,620
This is a joke.
I have long established my household.

301
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,720
Whether he is the head of the household
has nothing to do with me.

302
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,259
You stand in the presence
of the famous Huamanzhu's owner.

303
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:02,580
And you want her to kneel?

304
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,140
Look at the words hanging on that wall.

305
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,900
 
Those were written personally by His Majesty.

306
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,100
I advise you to speak more politely.

307
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,640
You are a mere lowly maid.

308
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,699
- Who are you calling a lowly maid? No lowly maids here.
- What?

309
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:17,219
If you don't leave now,
you'll be responsible for the consequences.

310
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,739
He Wei Fang, was your conscience eaten by dogs?

311
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:24,739
If it weren't for you running away
from home back then

312
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:26,939
and taking a pot of our He family's rare peony,

313
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:29,340
you wouldn't have had
the capital to start your fortune.

314
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,620
Now that you are prosperous,

315
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,240
you want to turn your back on your family?

316
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,920
Let me tell you.

317
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,419
Your overflowing wealth now
should have a share for the He family.

318
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,059
I started from scratch in Chang'an, facing many ups and downs.

319
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,540
I have never asked for anything from you.

320
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,300
And now you want to take a share.

321
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,000
Let me tell you, that Qiongtai Yulu
was developed by my mother,

322
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,380
and the Fragrance Garden
was the dowry she left for me.

323
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,580
If Father is in trouble,
I will discuss it with him myself.

324
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,780
But none of this has anything to do with you.

325
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,419
Someone, see the guests out.

326
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,188
I'm not leaving.

327
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:14,060
Don't touch me. Don't you dare touch me.

328
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,799
- I'm not leaving.
- Don't touch my mom!

329
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:18,480
He Wei Fang, your mother did not die of illness.

330
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,120
Wait a moment.

331
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,372
What did you say?

332
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,900
Your mother did not fall ill back then,
she was poisoned.

333
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,336
Let's go.

334
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,956
Keep talking.

335
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,540
The poisoner was her enemy,
and this poison was incurable.

336
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,240
Only the Zixi pill might have saved her.

337
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,319
That's why back then your father
risked his life to find that tribute medicine.

338
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:13,659
Do you think I'll believe you
just because of a few sentences?

339
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:16,380
Mother was kind to people during her life,

340
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,300
apart from growing flowers,
she was not involved in worldly matters.

341
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,900
Why would she have any enemies?

342
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,140
That's because you don't know the truth.

343
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,759
Not only did she have an enemy,
but that person hated her deeply.

344
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,219
It seems she was aware of her heavy sins,

345
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:33,300
so she didn't tell you about it.

346
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,100
Think carefully.

347
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,359
What kind of disease would suddenly flare up?

348
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,100
And within a few short months, she passed away.

349
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,019
You have been in contact
with medicinal materials since childhood.

350
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:50,720
Have you ever seen such a strange illness?

351
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,900
How can you prove what you say is true?

352
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,259
I know who this person is.

353
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,620
Give me five thousand bolts of silk.

354
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,939
I will tell you this person's name.

355
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:08,319
Whether it's true or false,
you'll know once you investigate.

356
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,784
Fine, I'll do it.

357
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:17,332
 

358
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,240
This Wu Hong is from Luoyang.

359
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,000
He once worked as a servant
in a noble's household in Chang'an.

360
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,480
A few years ago, he went back
to his hometown to visit relatives,

361
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,960
which was during the time
Mrs. He was ill. It checks out.

362
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:34,219
Before returning to Luoyang
to visit relatives, he lived in Chang'an.

363
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:37,060
There should be no enmity
between him and my mother.

364
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,440
Why would he harm her?

365
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:41,900
I wasn't able to find out.

366
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,419
However, this person is very strange.

367
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:45,939
After returning to Chang'an,
he disappeared for a while.

368
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,340
He even changed his name
and lived a reclusive life.

369
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,900
If he has nothing to hide, why would he do that?

370
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,499
Where is he now, and what is he doing?

371
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:56,820
He runs a clinic for orphans
and the sick outside the city.

372
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,659
There's nothing unusual on ordinary days.

373
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,699
The surrounding neighbors praise him highly.

374
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:04,419
They say he is kind and approachable,
and very good with children.

375
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:06,580
Do you have his portrait?

376
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:30,976
Mu Dan.

377
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:35,100
Ms. He, you're here.

378
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,440
It's cold outside.
Come in and warm yourself by the fire.

379
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,860
No need. I have something to ask you.

380
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,000
Could you please come out for a moment?

381
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,739
Kang, continue to read the legend with them.

382
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:52,368
Alright.

383
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,300
Is your real name Wu Hong?

384
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,404
Yes.

385
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:31,640
Do you know the owner
of the He's Pharmacy in Luoyang?

386
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,780
I do.

387
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:46,039
You poisoned and killed my mother, right?

388
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,240
- I did. 
 - Why?

389
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,350
That year,

390
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,180
it wasn't just your mother who died.

391
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:10,939
That year, I learned that my home
had suffered from a flood.

392
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:16,179
So I hurried back to Luoyang
and experienced the major post-disaster epidemic.

393
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:20,639
I watched with open eyes

394
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,672
my parents, wife, and children

395
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,804
die in front of me.

396
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:36,179
Have you ever experienced
the despair of losing all your loved ones?

397
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,140
But what does this have to do with my mother?

398
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,839
It was poor people like us
who died from the flood.

399
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,140
It was also poor people like us
who died from the plague.

400
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,259
Those officials and wealthy businessmen
all hid in their houses to avoid the plague.

401
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,340
Even if they get sick,
they have money to buy medicine.

402
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,340
But what about us?

403
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,580
People like us can only wait for death.

404
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,160
How can I not hate them?

405
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:11,179
Do you know, the one who died in my arms last

406
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,119
was my child who hadn't even become 15.

407
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,900
She passed away with her eyes wide open,
unable to die at peace.

408
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:27,599
At that time, I was filled with hatred.

409
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:33,380
I just wanted to find someone
to accompany my family to the grave.

410
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:38,860
But how could I easily enter
those noble and wealthy households?

411
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:44,240
I roamed everywhere
and finally found an opportunity.

412
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,860
I entered a house.

413
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:57,079
 Your mother recognized that I was not
the usual farmer who delivered vegetables. 

414
00:30:58,212 --> 00:31:00,224
 So I told her 

415
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:04,820
 my family members had all died,
and I had no money for their burial. 

416
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,259
 That's why I found this job. 

417
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,620
 She then gave me two strings of coins. 

418
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:15,659
 I didn't need her charity. 

419
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:19,159
 I also didn't need her to pretend
to be a good person to me. 

420
00:31:20,699 --> 00:31:24,419
 I just want her to accompany my family in burial. 

421
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,119
Your whole family died.

422
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:47,939
And you made my mother accompany them.

423
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,100
My mother has never harmed anyone.

424
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,559
But your family is harmonious,
while mine is broken and dead.

425
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,880
How is that fair?

426
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,699
If you want to blame anyone,
you can blame your mother for her bad luck.

427
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:03,780
My mother pitied your misfortune,
which gave you the chance to harm her.

428
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:09,159
You couldn't distinguish between right and wrong,
yet you still have no sense of guilt.

429
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:16,720
Since you have found me, it is also my fate.

430
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,179
To kill or to flay, it's up to you.

431
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:26,480
Mu Dan.

432
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,120
Sui Zhi.

433
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,000
Your mother is gone.
What's the use of killing Mr. Wu?

434
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,484
You knew.

435
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,659
Why didn't you tell me?

436
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,079
Why didn't you?

437
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,060
When will the cycle of vengeance end?

438
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,699
Even if you kill him,
your mother will not come back.

439
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:05,659
Jiang Chang Yang, we both have lost our mothers.

440
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:09,900
I thought you understood me.

441
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,828
Move aside.

442
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,060
Get out of my way.

443
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,656
Sui Zhi.

444
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,900
Are you crazy? Are you crazy, Jiang Chang Yang?

445
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,720
Let the past be the past.

446
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,060
Mr. Wu is also a pitiable person.

447
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:41,360
Mu Dan,

448
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,480
let it go.

449
00:33:47,499 --> 00:33:49,680
Pitiable person?

450
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:54,540
Is my mother not a pitiable person?

451
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:02,079
When my mother was seriously ill, she told me
to treat the servants in the courtyard kindly.

452
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:04,419
Especially Mr. Wu.

453
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:08,579
All these years, Mr. Wu has lived a frugal life.

454
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,879
He devoted himself to taking care of the children.
He has been atoning for his sins.

455
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:17,200
Atonement? Can atonement
bring my mother back to life?

456
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,579
Can atonement change the fact
that he is a murderer?

457
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,340
My mother was benevolent all her life.

458
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,359
She personally made so many medicinal packets

459
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,399
and distributed them to those
who couldn't afford medical treatment.

460
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:37,240
Now the murderer of my mother is right here.

461
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,740
And you want me to let go.

462
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,039
I can't let go. I just can't.

463
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:06,539
These years, Mr. Wu watched me grow up.

464
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:10,019
He was with me when I bade farewell to my mother.

465
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:14,480
Now he is like family to me.

466
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,300
I won't let you hurt him.

467
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:27,670
- Ms. He. 
 - Mr. Wu,

468
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:31,019
no need to say anything.

469
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:41,879
Jiang Chang Yang, now I finally realize

470
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,660
that you are unreasonable and cannot distinguish
loyalty from treachery.

471
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,600
I misjudged you before.

472
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:32,544
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫ 

473
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:36,604
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫ 

474
00:36:36,604 --> 00:36:40,568
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫ 

475
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:46,552
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫ 

476
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:50,396
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫ 

477
00:36:50,396 --> 00:36:54,620
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫ 

478
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,524
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫ 

479
00:36:58,524 --> 00:37:02,944
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫ 

480
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:12,456
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫ 

481
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:20,160
 ♫ The heart is boundless ♫ 

482
00:37:23,552 --> 00:37:27,456
 ♫ Only wish to cherish day and night ♫ 

483
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:34,784
 ♫ The flowers bloom and fall, searching with you ♫ 

484
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:44,456
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫ 

485
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:52,136
 ♫ The heart is boundless ♫ 

486
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:59,588
 ♫ Let the years migrate ♫ 

487
00:37:59,588 --> 00:38:08,212
 ♫ Flowers bloom and fall ultimately to oneself ♫ 

488
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:36,399
Mr. Jiang, Ms. He has already
moved out of the Jiang Mansion.

489
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:23,099
Two guests, please come in.

490
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,139
Mom, the pharmacy is surely
short-handed right now.

491
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:51,139
I want to go and help out.

492
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,459
After the flood,
there are many sick people in the city.

493
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:59,419
Your father told us not to go out these days.

494
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,499
But with so many patients now,
they surely need someone to take care of them.

495
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:08,139
And yet here I am, resting easy at home.

496
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,760
I feel very uneasy.

497
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:17,539
Now, there are many patients
and few medicinal supplies.

498
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:20,820
If you catch the disease,
you'll take up an extra dose of medicine.

499
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,220
And then other patients will be short one dose.

500
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,260
Moreover, these medicinal packets we're making

501
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,760
can also contribute to the sick people.

502
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,380
Mom, you are right.

503
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,820
However, Mom, is this epidemic really that severe?

504
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,419
Under normal circumstances, it's enough
to use ordinary peonies for medicine.

505
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:43,419
This time we are using ice crystal peonies.

506
00:40:43,419 --> 00:40:46,440
The flowers in the courtyard
are almost picked clean.

507
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,700
The root and bark of this flower can clear heat,
cool the blood, and alleviate various pains.

508
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,700
Combined with anemarrhena, phellodendron,
and rehmannia for medicine,

509
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,800
it can relieve lung heat.

510
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,740
It is exactly the medicine
most needed for this epidemic.

511
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,764
The ice crystal peonies we have

512
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:05,059
are the rarest and most hard
to find over vast distances.

513
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:10,099
In these times of disaster,
one of these is worth a fortune.

514
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:20,499
Mom, you distribute such valuable materials
to the victims who can't afford treatment.

515
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:22,499
Mom, you are so kind.

516
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,340
Stamping the auspicious clouds from heaven
on the medicinal packet

517
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,340
also serves to convey blessings.

518
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,700
Hopefully, those who take this medicine

519
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,579
can safely get through this ordeal
and stay healthy.

520
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,576
They will.

521
00:41:55,030 --> 00:42:05,020
