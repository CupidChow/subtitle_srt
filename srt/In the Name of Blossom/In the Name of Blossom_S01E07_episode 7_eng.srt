3
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,000
   

4
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,359
Excuse me, is that the dilapidated house beside the garden?

5
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,900
What dilapidated house? That's our residence.

6
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,676
What's the matter?

7
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,180
Are you two from the Imperial Workshop? Is Jiang Residence going to be renovated?

8
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,699
Is Jiang Residence going to be renovated?

9
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:01,440
Indeed, Miss Xiao likes pavilions and towers.

10
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,419
The Royal Princess sent us to inspect here.

11
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:06,280
She said to demolish two dilapidated houses by the garden, dig a channel for water,

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,480
and build a water pavilion for Miss Xiao to enjoy.

13
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,679
This is the Floral Envoy's residence, not Miss Xiao's home.

14
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:16,339
Why is it to be built at the Jiang Residence?

15
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,599
They're childhood sweethearts and well-matched. With the Royal Princess match-making,

16
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,920
since both of us were sent, surely something good is about to happen.

17
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,728
Excuse me.

18
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,539
Looks like our home is going to become a water channel.

19
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:39,759
Mu Dan, enough with this.

20
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,619
This is a big matter, you should ask Jiang Chang Yang.

21
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:45,180
Sister, it's okay. Let's go back and live in Fragrance Garden.

22
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,399
There are many houses and beautiful scenery everywhere.

23
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,580
- Also me and Da Fu…
- I'm fine. Don't worry.

24
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,180
I'll ask them after the birthday is over.

25
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,520
Let's finish these tasks first. Come on.

26
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:01,639
People have paid. Hurry up.

27
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,300
Sister, you're so impressive.

28
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,092
Let's go.

29
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,480
Wait a moment.

30
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:55,900
   

31
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,290
   

32
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:08,668
Sui Zhi.

33
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,550
   

34
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:40,384
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫ 

35
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:44,344
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫ 

36
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:48,312
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫ 

37
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:53,408
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫ 

38
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,380
Xue Xi, you're drunk.

39
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,348
I'm not drunk.

40
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:10,040
I've been holding some words back for years.

41
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,199
Are you willing to listen?

42
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:20,488
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫ 

43
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:26,736
 ♫ The heart is boundless ♫ 

44
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,900
The poem you taught me. 
    

45
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,100
I was young then and didn't understand the meaning.

46
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,619
- But now… 
 - I was also young then.

47
00:08:42,592 --> 00:08:44,760
This isn't what I meant.

48
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,579
But I've had a crush on you since childhood.

49
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:57,312
Unfortunately, we were separated.

50
00:08:57,312 --> 00:09:02,939
I thought there was no possibility for us, so I gave up the idea.

51
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:11,240
But who knew that I would come to Chang'an and see you again?

52
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,420
For my family,

53
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:23,419
I've thought about listening to my parents and trying to be with Pei Zhong.

54
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:27,459
But the closer I got to others, the more I realized I couldn't do it.

55
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,760
The person in my heart has always been you.

56
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,040
Back then, my mother always wanted a daughter,

57
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,500
so she treated you like one.

58
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,579
I also regarded you as family.

59
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:52,880
I know you have no feelings for me.

60
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,440
But if I have to marry someone, I'd rather marry you.

61
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:04,459
Even though we haven't seen each other for many years,

62
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:09,240
the familiarity and friendship of the old days remain.

63
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,419
Being with you, I feel very at ease and comfortable.

64
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,880
I believe you feel the same.

65
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:28,059
Sui Zhi, you'll have a wife eventually.

66
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:32,579
And I'm the most suitable choice.

67
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,930
Xue Xi.

68
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,530
I'll always be your elder brother.

69
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,520
But I won't marry you.

70
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:50,340
I don't want to ruin your lifetime of happiness.

71
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,319
I toast to you with this cup.

72
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,479
Happy Birthday.

73
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,100
May you soon find someone to love mutually,

74
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,000
and that you'll never be separated.

75
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:30,130
   

76
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,699
I've said it many times.

77
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:38,380
The Royal Princess's orders have no authority over my residence.

78
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,980
There is absolutely no possibility of renovating the backyard.

79
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,419
Vice Minister Jiang, the Royal Princess insists on doing this for Miss Xiao.

80
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:51,020
With you like this, it makes it really hard for me to report back.

81
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,620
Please report back to the Royal Princess

82
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,020
and say that I stayed in the Jiang Residence earlier to catch up with an old friend.

83
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,220
Today, I'm leaving the residence to relax.

84
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,740
When I return, I'll stay with the Royal Princess to keep her company.

85
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,880
Yes, thank you very much, Miss Xiao.

86
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,660
Excuse us.

87
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,968
You're leaving?

88
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:29,380
Now that I've come to Chang'an, I want to stroll around,

89
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,539
visit famous mountains and temples, soak in the hot springs.

90
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:36,679
It's better than being trapped in this square residence.

91
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,819
I don't want to be an extra person.

92
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,230
Sui Zhi.

93
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,459
May you also discern your feelings.

94
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:48,308
Don't miss out.

95
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:24,224
   

96
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,340
- Xue Xi.
 - Mu Dan.

97
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,220
Are you going on a long journey?

98
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,819
I'm going to Mount Li to soak in the hot springs.

99
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:47,459
Sui Zhi has some important matters to handle.

100
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,779
I hope everything will be resolved by the time I return.

101
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,079
But no matter what, it won't affect our friendship.

102
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:58,324
Of course.

103
00:13:58,324 --> 00:14:00,860
Rest assured. He's one thing, and our friendship is another.

104
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,220
I would never let you be concerned or troubled.

105
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,220
Nor will I develop feelings of rivalry or jealousy.

106
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,820
What nonsense are you talking about?

107
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,340
Do you like Sui Zhi?

108
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:24,679
Xue Xi, please do not misunderstand.

109
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:27,740
Jiang Chang Yang and I are only in a cooperative relationship.

110
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,900
There's nothing more beyond that.

111
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:34,819
Floral Haven has just developed some new bath beans and incense.

112
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:37,659
You can use them while soaking in the hot springs.

113
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,179
Before leaving the city, come with me to Floral Haven to pick some.

114
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,779
- It's on the house.
- Okay.

115
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,140
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

116
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,500
When I received this broken hairpin, I should have understood her intentions.

117
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,419
But I think Young Madam treats you well.

118
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:11,559
She treats me as a confidant.

119
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:14,688
She didn't say it out loud

120
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:18,920
because she's worried we can get along like we did before.

121
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,920
Why should I unnecessarily cause her more trouble?

122
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:16,090
You're here?

123
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,670
Have a seat.

124
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:32,719
It's our last time having a late-night snack, so we should drink to our heart's content.

125
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,479
Nothing happened, so why is this the last time?

126
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,199
With Fragrance Garden under renovation, there's a lot of things to do.

127
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,520
I've been running back and forth all day and I'm really tired.

128
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,299
It's more relaxing to live there.

129
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,408
Okay.

130
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:04,319
But this room will be empty anyway.

131
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,100
If you're not busy... you can come back anytime.

132
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:14,908
I won't come back.

133
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:23,459
Thank you, Master Jiang for taking care of me during this time.

134
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,240
Our marriage was originally a stopgap measure.

135
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,659
We cannot delay our proper lives because of the pretense.

136
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,000
Since I'm moving out,

137
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,079
Jiang Chang Yang, write the divorce document.

138
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:01,072
Okay.

139
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,340
♫  Should my heart have frost, would the past remain forever frozen?  ♫

140
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:24,604
♫  Falling into your gaze, melting and flowing with you  ♫

141
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:31,344
♫  If love were like frost, can these countless miles of stormy weather  ♫

142
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:38,624
♫  See clear skies again?  ♫

143
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:46,300
♫  Clouds hidden by the night  ♫

144
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:53,040
♫  Oh, how they drift  ♫ 
♫  Searching for a place to rest  ♫

145
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:02,079
In the future, if you need any help, just let me know.

146
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:06,968
Okay.

147
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:11,992
♫  If the heart were like frost, what's a lifetime of solitude?  ♫

148
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:18,196
♫  Yet you are the light, piercing through my heart  ♫

149
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:25,072
♫  If love were like frost, there would be a candle flickering in the wind  ♫

150

152
00:19:55,979 --> 00:20:00,459
Jiang Chang Yang, I'm afraid you're going to lose.

153
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,900
   

154
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,760
Jiang Chang Yang.

155
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:47,680
From now on, I'll give this bright moon back to you.

156
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,459
The oil merchants from the Western Regions say this is Tokhara black fire oil.

157
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:07,919
This type of fire oil is dark and vigorous, mostly used on the battlefield.

158
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,780
It's never sold in Chang'an's two markets.

159
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,979
Ordinary people can't recognize it at all.

160
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:17,079
Since it's used in warfare, it must be a prohibited item.

161
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,559
Those who can obtain this item aren't ordinary people.

162
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:25,760
But we haven't offended any officials recently.

163
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,000
I remembered something.

164
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,979
Days ago, Liu Chang came to Fragrance Garden and bought several boxes of cosmetics.

165
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,680
It must have angered Li You Zhen again.

166
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,780
Her again? Is she ever going to stop?

167
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,939
How can she, a dignified County Princess, harm others all day long?

168
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:48,359
The boxes delivered that day were tied with sailors' knots.

169
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,979
I've heard a group of water bandits has been hired in Chang'an recently.

170
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,720
They'll commit any evil act for money.

171
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,620
We can start from there.

172
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,620
First, catch the arsonist.

173
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:07,179
In any case, this time, I must make Li You Zhen admit her crime and be punished.

174
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:31,620
Young Master, if you don't want to write the divorce document just say so.

175
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:35,480
She and I were once employer and employee. Now we're allies.

176
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,599
Our relationship is quite deep. So, I must be very cautious.

177
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:41,079
Otherwise, if she isn't satisfied with it, I'll have to revise it.

178
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:43,659
Wouldn't that be more trouble?

179
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:46,899
Miss He is busy restoring Fragrance Garden. Da Fu told me.

180
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,939
When the divorce document is written, just send it to Fragrance Garden.

181
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:52,064
There's no need to meet again.

182
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,608
Young Master.

183
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,520
The water bandits caught this quickly?

184
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,079
When I got there, someone else beat me to it, so I loosened my grip.

185
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,480
The water bandits are now in the backyard.

186
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:17,159
Since we captured you, we aren't so easily fooled.

187
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,580
If you don't speak up, watch out for my fists!

188
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,440
You must know the crime you've committed won't escape the death penalty.

189
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,100
That's why you think speaking up is futile.

190
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,079
But what if I tell you that there's a way out?

191
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,280
If you're willing to testify and identify the mastermind,

192
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,340
I can appeal on your behalf to reduce your sentence.

193
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:53,659
Let me, the Floral Envoy, handle the interrogation of prisoners.

194
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:57,639
Chuan Yu will ensure their honest cooperation.

195
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,559
Thank you for your kindness, Master Jiang.

196
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,639
But I'd prefer to investigate these matters myself.

197
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:09,728
You've already helped me a lot.

198
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,800
I can no longer trouble you.

199
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:16,079
- Da Fu.
 - Let's go.

200
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,140
- Let's go.
 - Move.

201
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,000
I didn't expect you to catch the water bandits before me.

202
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,359
How could the County Princess, who's always indoors, know about prohibited oil?

203
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,499
There's only one way she could've obtained it.

204
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,324
Prince Ning.

205
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,580
You're here for Prince Ning.

206
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:07,699
Prince Ning's private possession of military goods is a grave matter.

207
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:11,780
Those investigating may easily implicate themselves with the slightest mistake.

208
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,939
Hand them over to me.

209
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:18,939
I can hand them over to you.

210
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,760
But Li You Zhen was willing to ruin all of Fragrance Garden just to kill me.

211
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,760
She injured so many innocent people.

212
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,419
Now, the most severely injured floriculturist still can't get out of bed.

213
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:35,919
Everyone's hard work was destroyed overnight.

214
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,860
I must give everyone an explanation.

215
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Even if someone intimidating is behind it,

216
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,499
do you still want to get revenge?

217
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:49,419
Yes, I already have the witnesses.

218
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,484
As for the physical evidence,

219
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:55,240
I think you've already found where the remaining oil is hidden.

220
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:02,520
Do you think finding the oil will make the County Princess surrender to the law?

221
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,200
As long as Prince Ning is powerful, she'll remain unharmed.

222
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,079
She's royalty, and I'm a merchant.

223
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,480
So I've been compromising all along.

224
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,780
But this time, she not only burned my garden, but everyone's home.

225
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:30,840
Whether it's presenting evidence and filing a complaint, or setting a trap for her to yield,

226
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,319
I must make her pay for her actions.

227
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,760
Even if everything is destroyed, I'll have no regrets.

228
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,620
I knew that would be your choice.

229
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,159
So you're not here to stop me.

230
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:03,440
You want to punish Li You Zhen,

231
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:06,540
and I want to get rid of Prince Ning's fire oil.

232
00:27:07,219 --> 00:27:09,839
Actually, we share the same goal.

233
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:18,939
In that the case, let's cooperate again like we did in the millet case.

234
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,759
 Prince Ning's private warehouse is located in the city's east side. 

235
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,720
 It stores all kinds of rare treasures and secretive items. 

236
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,000
 Privately made weapons and the fire oil are also hidden here. 

237
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,839
 The private warehouse is heavily guarded. 

238
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,440
 No matter how agile you are, it's difficult to sneak in. 

239
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,000
 However, I've already planted people among the servants delivering military equipment. 

240
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,100
 Right now, they can be used. 

241
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,660
Yes, Sir.

242
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,356
Up.

243
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,376
Slow down, slow down.

244
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:18,200
Wait a minute.

245
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,419
Warehouse Head.

246
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,219
- All of this has been checked?
 - Yes.

247
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,739
This batch of weapons is even better in quality than the last batch.

248
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:38,316
Yes.

249
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,636
Not bad.

250
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:01,344
Warehouse Head, these are specially made weapons, very precious.

251
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:05,319
Be careful not to damage them.

252
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:10,540
This crossbow, though light, can penetrate copper and pierce iron.

253
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,159
Indeed, it's a good weapon.

254
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:16,200
I wonder when I'll be able to use it.

255
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,480
Let them pass!

256
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,280
Prince Ning is truly bold.

257
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,159
He put these weapons in a warehouse,

258
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,659
and isn't afraid of being discovered.

259
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,580
Who dares inspect his private warehouse?

260
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,520
Hiding in plain sight is actually the safest.

261
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:28,019
- Wait a minute.
 - What's wrong?

262
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:30,959
- I've lost my bracelet. 
 - This place is dangerous, and the room is dim.

263
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,024
If the lost item won't reveal your identity, don't look for it anymore.

264
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:36,200
- You might hurt your hand. 
 - No, it is a woman's item.

265
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,860
If it's discovered, it may raise suspicions.

266
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,100
Thank you.

267
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,980
During the guard changeover, we have the time of three incense sticks.

268
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,620
The private warehouse has over a hundred rooms, so we need to act separately.

269
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,419
That is the windward opening.

270
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,839
Fire oil is flammable, so it can't be stored there.

271
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,459
This is the only place with water tanks.

272
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,804
Let's go.

273
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:05,839
You're afraid of fire. Let me do it.

274
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,300
I'm fine now. Don't worry.

275
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,179
I thought you weren't afraid of fire anymore.

276
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,879
She burned your wife's garden,

277
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:18,240
so you burned her father's private warehouse.

278
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,120
Your two temperaments of not wanting to suffer losses

279
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,679
is truly a match made in heaven.

280
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,399
I did all this for you.

281
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,919
Prince Ning is hoarding oil and making secret weapons.

282
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,660
If I don't burn it down with fire,

283
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,720
tomorrow, the fire could burn down your Daming Palace.

284
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:39,728
They're here.

285
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,924
Your Majesty.

286
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:49,900
Your Majesty. Floral Envoy.

287
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,280
Your Majesty, there was an uproar in the court today.

288
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,240
Last night, Prince Ning's private warehouse caught fire and burned all night.

289
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,600
The fire wasn't extinguished until dawn.

290
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,660
The citizens are frightened.

291
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,619
They all gathered at the Jingzhao Prefecture to demand an explanation.

292
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:06,319
The Ministry of Revenue also sent people to inquire.

293
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:15,516
His private warehouse is tall and imposing.

294
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:18,700
As a separate household, how could it reach people's homes?

295
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,800
Your Majesty, although it hasn't harmed people,

296
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,800
there have been fires in two places within a month.

297
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,839
The people are concerned that the city's fire prevention is inadequate,

298
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,080
fearing that their own homes might catch fire one day.

299
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,099
The people are worrying unnecessarily, but why is the Ministry of Revenue involved?

300
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:40,860
They're so eager to work. Perhaps I've given them too much salary.

301
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:44,640
Jingzhao's Offical Ren handle it himself.

302
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,720
Your Majesty, this matter also involves... the Floral Envoy's wife.

303
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,439
She also went to the Jingzhao Prefecture,

304
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:57,760
saying that the last fire was in her garden.

305
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,160
Moreover, Consort Shu has also sent someone to deliver a message.

306
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,200
She said the sleep-inducing sachets ordered from Fragrance Garden were all burned.

307
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,260
She ordered Official Ren to thoroughly investigate the culprit.

308
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,399
- Ling Ge also inquired about it?
 - Yes.

309
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,059
Your Majesty, it's not a big deal that something happened in my garden,

310
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:25,680
but the consecutive burning of a minister's house, and the royal private warehouse,

311
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,399
and the destruction of Consort Shu's things,

312
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:30,220
it seems too coincidental.

313
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,280
Could it be that someone is dissatisfied with the royal family?

314
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,860
If it isn't properly investigated,

315
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:40,200
next time, we won't know where the fire will reach.

316
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:44,180
All the way to me?

317
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:49,519
- Bring them here. I'll personally investigate!
 - Yes.

318
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,359
Your Majesty, the Marshal went immediately.

319
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:00,080
But some of the goods in the storehouse were special, and the fire was slow to extinguish,

320
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,800
which caused such public outcry.

321
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,080
What goods can burn for an entire night?

322
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,359
Is this an excuse for your dereliction of duty?

323
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,439
I haven't even punished you yet, and you're already making excuses!

324
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:17,100
Your Majesty,

325
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,240
Official Ren isn't lying.

326
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,460
This fire didn't go out because it was burning black fire oil.

327
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,519
Why do you have such forbidden items in your warehouse?

328
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,959
My subordinate was on a mission,

329
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:44,160
unexpectedly discovered a foreign merchant illegally selling it and confiscated it.

330
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,019
I thought of temporarily storing it and reporting it to the Ministry of Revenue,

331
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:51,959
but unexpectedly, a fire broke out.

332
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:54,319
Is that so?

333
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:59,220
Fortunately, you discovered it in time. Otherwise, it would've caused a big disaster.

334
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,979
- Rise.
 - Thank you, Your Majesty.

335
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:12,260
Has all the black fire oil burned out now?

336
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,200
It hasn't.

337
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:20,280
I led the guards in a timely rescue and ultimately saved fifty barrels.

338
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Such dangerous items should quickly be stored in the inner treasury.

339
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,859
- Don't make my brother go through the trouble of delivering it again.
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

340
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:34,439
Are you sure that all the fire oil was in the treasury and has never flowed out?

341
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:38,839
If it falls into the wrong hands, I'm afraid…

342
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:40,979
Right, right, Imperial Brother.

343
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:46,800
I can't help but worry if there's still such a fierce thing hidden in the city.

344
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,479
How can I sleep peacefully?

345
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:54,280
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

346
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,720
My private warehouse is tightly guarded, and no outsiders can enter.

347
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,999
The imperial city, Your Majesty, and the people can all sleep peacefully.

348
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:10,219
If that's the case, why was my wife's garden drenched with this black fire oil?

349
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,160
I don't think you've seen this oil before.

350
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,820
How can you determine that Fragrance Garden was burned by this oil?

351
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:29,240
I didn't believe it before either.

352
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:32,519
But the smell of fire oil on Official Ren's body

353
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:36,159
is exactly the same as what I smelled in Fragrance Garden that day.

354
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,499
Was the burning of your garden not an accident, but a man-made disaster?

355
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:44,120
But how is it connected with my brother's fire oil?

356
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,359
What exactly is going on here?

357
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:51,160
Your Majesty, someone sent a gift to the garden in my name.

358
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,740
But there was fire oil hidden in the boxes, and burned the garden down as a result.

359
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,720
Mu Dan is heartbroken and cries to me all day long.

360
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,380
She doesn't even have the heart to run the shops anymore.

361
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:08,039
She's my beloved, and also my cash cow.

362
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,939
If this continues, won't I be losing money every day?

363
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,879
Official Ren hasn't found the arsonist yet, so I had no choice but to investigate it myself.

364
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:18,776
I caught a few arsonist water bandits.

365
00:40:18,776 --> 00:40:24,280
They confessed with their own mouths the use of black fire oil.

366
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:37,039
My private warehouse is guarded in three shifts day and night.

367
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,640
How could mere water bandits possibly sneak in and steal things?

368
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,760
Moreover, no one has reported any thefts previously.

369
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,039
It must be those water bandits spouting nonsense.

370
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:53,720
They said this fire oil was rare and hard to come by.

371
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,039
They secretly hid a jar before committing arson.

372
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,780
Let's bring them up in a moment. Compare the two oils, and it'll become clear.
