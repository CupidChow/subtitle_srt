1
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,436
Have they still not been able
to find Lord Sangheon?

2
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,814
Not yet, Your Majesty.
But they are searching everywhere.

3
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,110
Please do not worry.

4
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,489
Every soldier in Pyongan
and Hamgyong is looking for him.

5
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,740
So we will find him soon.

6
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,827
Any news from Yeoyeon?

7
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,039
Commander Jung will arrive
sometime tomorrow.

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,044
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,554
Hyun, what brings you here at this hour?

10
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,640
This had to be brought to your attention.

11
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,226
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

12
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,105
A LONG FISHING LINE PROPERLY SETS
IN THE WATER. ONCE A LONG-AWAITED RIPPLE…

13
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,566
This is the poem

14
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,820
Lord Wonsan wrote
a long time ago, is it not?

15
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,946
Why did you bring this?

16
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,784
The word he initially used
in the poem was "moonlight."

17
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,122
It read, "So I come back to shore

18
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,207
with an empty boat filled with moonlight."

19
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:14,425
This reads, "So I come back to shore
with an empty boat filled with my dream."

20
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,805
I believe my brother is plotting treason.

21
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,561
You must postpone
tomorrow's coronation immediately

22
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,897
and gather soldiers right away,
Your Majesty.

23
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,862
MY DREAM

24
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,238
Hwi. What brings
you and Hyun here at this hour?

25
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,532
Listen carefully
to what I am about to say.

26
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,493
Your coronation tomorrow
will be postponed.

27
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,538
I will set another date and let you know.

28
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,959
Until I do, I want you to leave
the palace with Hyun for the time being.

29
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,796
Pardon?
Why are you suddenly asking me to leave?

30
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,089
I do not have time.

31
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,926
Hyun will explain everything
you need to know.

32
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,763
Please take care of Gyeom, Hyun.

33
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,974
Please come with me.
I will escort you out.

34
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,185
But…

35
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,396
It will be fine.

36
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,523
Nothing will happen.

37
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,193
You should hurry.

38
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,123
FINALE

39
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,488
You must get to safety, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,157
Gyeom has probably not
gotten out of the palace yet.

41
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,534
But…

42
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,161
I am certain they will use me
to justify treason.

43
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,540
And once Gyeom ascends to the throne,
they will no longer have that.

44
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,335
So we must protect Gyeom no matter what.

45
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,674
I cannot let my grandfather
take control of the royal court again.

46
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,388
Go to Gyeom while I stall them here.

47
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,726
It is imperative that you help Hyun
get Gyeom out of here. Do you understand?

48
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,185
Yes, Your Majesty.

49
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,237
Treason?

50
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,740
I cannot leave His Majesty
and run away alone.

51
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,660
You must stay alive for His Majesty
to turn things around in the future.

52
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,995
But…

53
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,204
Please come with me.

54
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,793
DAEHYEONJEON

55
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,192
That is a woman claiming to be the King.

56
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,985
Arrest her right now!

57
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,781
They are committing treason!

58
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,283
Arrest every single one of them!

59
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,456
Hand him over to me.

60
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,627
Is this the dream you wrote about?

61
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,213
I told you not to return.

62
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,551
You brought this upon yourself.
So do not resent me.

63
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,073
Hyun!

64
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,426
Hyun…

65
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,639
-Jeong!
-No!

66
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,610
What do you think
you are doing, Lord Wonsan?

67
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,905
Grandmother.

68
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,091
It is dangerous for you to be outside.

69
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,594
This matter belongs to the men.

70
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,056
So please go back inside, Grandmother.

71
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,935
Have you no fear?

72
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,687
Not only did you
wield your sword at your brother,

73
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,982
but you are also committing
this heinous crime of treason.

74
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,735
Did you think I would gladly let you

75
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,113
ascend to the throne
if you killed Prince Jehyeon?

76
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,492
I believe you must also be in fear.

77
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,996
You had become the Queen
by committing treason a long time ago.

78
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,791
I am the eldest grandson
of the deceased King.

79
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,543
I still carry

80
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,128
his bloodline.

81
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,589
Lord Wonsan!

82
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,300
Escort my grandmother inside.

83
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,430
She is not to set foot outside
until everything has been settled.

84
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,271
Get your hands off me!
How dare you stop me!

85
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,482
Grandmother!

86
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,626
No!

87
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,137
No.

88
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,681
No…

89
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,768
This cannot be.

90
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,188
No…

91
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,400
This cannot be.

92
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,284
I will

93
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,996
never forgive you.

94
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,498
Never.

95
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,459
I do not expect you to,

96
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,169
Hyun.

97
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,901
How dare you!

98
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,765
Bok-dong!

99
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,891
Your Majesty.

100
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,538
Bring me the King's head!

101
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,747
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

102
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,546
Father.

103
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,935
I will stop them here.
Escort His Majesty to a safe place.

104
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,024
All the paths leading outside
from Gwanghwamun to Shinmumun are blocked.

105
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,195
Leaving the palace is not possible.
Please stay someplace safe for now.

106
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,404
Your Majesty…

107
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,616
Stay alive.

108
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,785
I have not forgiven you yet.

109
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,705
You must stay alive
and face your punishment.

110
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,157
I will stop them from here.
Go on without me.

111
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,825
Scribe Jung.

112
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,286
Do not worry. I will be with you soon.

113
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,045
Please get inside.

114
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,922
We must go, Your Majesty.

115
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,049
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

116
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,759
Your Majesty!

117
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,731
Hyun.

118
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,833
Gyeom.

119
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,845
How…

120
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,099
How could this…

121
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,397
Gyeom. Wake up.

122
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,151
Wake up now.

123
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,362
No.

124
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,574
You cannot leave like this.

125
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,161
This is my fault.

126
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,999
I should not have brought you
into the palace.

127
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,673
Please open your eyes.

128
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,095
Gyeom…

129
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,547
Lord Wonsan is fatally wounded.

130
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,300
What? Is he still breathing?

131
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,178
Yes, but it does not look good.

132
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,475
No one can know that he is injured.

133
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,987
You are seriously injured.

134
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,155
I will stop them. You should go.

135
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,157
There is something I must do.

136
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,405
Get rid of him.

137
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,721
Father.

138
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:22,267
Father. Please stay with me.

139
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,312
You cannot die like this.

140
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,901
There is something I must tell you.

141
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,074
I was never able to say it.

142
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,245
Do you know

143
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,999
what I liked the most about you?

144
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,256
You did not take after me.

145
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,343
Please stop talking.

146
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,680
Your wounds…

147
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,064
Do not forgive me.

148
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,905
Ji-un.

149
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,161
My Ji-un…

150
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,206
Father.

151
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,128
Father…

152
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,756
It is your turn now.

153
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,259
I killed Prince Jehyeon
like you told me to.

154
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,725
Oust that woman.

155
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:31,438
And put me on the throne.

156
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,107
The wound is too deep.

157
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,818
Given the severity, I do not think…

158
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,405
Save him.

159
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,866
He must live no matter what.

160
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,386
More soldiers are coming.

161
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:06,014
You will not be safe here now.
You must leave, Your Majesty.

162
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,728
I cannot flee by myself.

163
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,021
Your Majesty.

164
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,690
Your Majesty.

165
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,360
You must leave.

166
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,625
My father has passed away.

167
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,504
We cannot stop them any longer.

168
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,966
Please head to Changdeokgung.

169
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,592
I will try

170
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,846
to open a passage at Geonchunmun.

171
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,226
You must live.

172
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,188
You must survive…

173
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,276
no matter what.

174
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,666
I will meet my grandfather.

175
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,501
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

176
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,797
I will tell him that I wish
to hand over the throne to Lord Wonsan.

177
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,382
No, Your Majesty.

178
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:26,053
You must leave now
and wait for the right time.

179
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,763
If I do not give up,

180
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,308
my grandfather will not stop.

181
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,478
Your Majesty, what are you going to do?

182
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,604
Your Majesty.

183
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,938
I will

184
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,484
try to persuade my grandfather.

185
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,739
No. They barged in here to kill you.

186
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,657
They cannot be reasoned with.

187
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,659
Eunuch Hong is right.

188
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,037
You have known him for a long time.

189
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,957
He will never give up trying to kill you.

190
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,044
Please, Your Majesty.

191
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,379
There is nothing we can do now.

192
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,715
I cannot let everyone die

193
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,177
because of me.

194
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,763
I do not want to…

195
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,308
watch my people die

196
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,144
any longer.

197
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,733
Give us a moment alone.

198
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,029
I must talk to Scribe Jung.

199
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,886
I am sorry.

200
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,226
You cannot do this, Your Majesty.

201
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,778
Do not worry.

202
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,947
I will survive.

203
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,035
You have yet to give me what you promised.

204
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:20,167
Do you remember what you told me that day?

205
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,296
You asked me what I wanted.

206
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,425
I gave it some thought,

207
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,428
and there is one thing I want.

208
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,516
What…

209
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,061
is it?

210
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,316
A hairpin.

211
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,528
I want a hairpin.

212
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,282
Not a ribbon,

213
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,076
but a beautiful hairpin.

214
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,082
If we get to leave the palace
after putting an end to this,

215
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,294
I would like a hairpin from you.

216
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,845
I want to live.

217
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,640
So…

218
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,936
I will make sure that I do.

219
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,939
I will look for a way to get out of here.

220
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:30,445
Please order me
to keep you safe, Your Majesty.

221
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,458
I love you.

222
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,839
Ever since we met…

223
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,805
there has never been a moment
that I have not loved you.

224
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,328
I will give up the throne.

225
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,830
That is a wise decision.

226
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,498
Of course, you must.

227
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,378
I will do as you wish.

228
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,256
So let there be no more sacrifices.

229
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,694
For hiding the fact that I am a woman

230
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,281
and deceiving you and the royal family,

231
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,493
I will accept any punishment.

232
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,163
To be precise,

233
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,791
it is not entirely your fault

234
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:53,505
that you had become the King.

235
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,845
I committed the first mistake.

236
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:08,103
I did not confirm with my own eyes
whether you had died.

237
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,481
And the second mistake

238
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:16,319
was committed by my daughter
who was also your mother.

239
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,197
In a way,

240
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,452
you were a victim of all this.

241
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,498
Your fate was determined

242
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:33,962
by the people around you
regardless of your desires.

243
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,553
Once you realized what had happened,
you should have been obedient.

244
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:47,559
Thus, the last mistake was made by you.

245
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,689
And you are to blame for everything

246
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,734
that has happened today.

247
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,279
I see.

248
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,828
I am finally telling you this,

249
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:12,500
but living this life had been tough on me
and I had been scared as well.

250
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,004
Because I had to live

251
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,382
someone else's life as if it was mine.

252
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,969
It is so unfortunate.

253
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,014
Because the person who protected me

254
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,476
was you, Grandfather.

255
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,857
I resented you a lot all my life.

256
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:37,984
But…

257
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,654
I was grateful as well.

258
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,199
I also…

259
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,535
cherished you a lot, Your Majesty.

260
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,080
Had you been born a boy,

261
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,250
it would have been great.

262
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,871
This will be my last act of kindness.

263
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,415
Must I die

264
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,586
because I am a woman?

265
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,589
You were never born, to begin with,

266
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,385
so there is no reason
to be scared of dying

267
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,763
or to feel wronged.

268
00:30:56,062 --> 00:31:00,942
Will you accept one last cup of tea
from your granddaughter?

269
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,531
This will be the last time I get to sit

270
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,826
and have tea with you.

271
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,707
Come to think of it,

272
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:03,212
I am glad that I was born a girl.

273
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,426
If I had been born a boy
and become the King,

274
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,929
and you had stayed by my side

275
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,514
just like now,

276
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,809
it would have been difficult
for the both of us.

277
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,480
The worlds you and I had in mind

278
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,441
were very different.

279
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,283
Scribe Jung gave these
to me a long time ago.

280
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,370
He said they would ease my anxiety

281
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,998
and give me courage.

282
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,437
Before my grandfather comes…

283
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,859
I want you to brew tea with this

284
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,611
and bring it to me.

285
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,157
This is…

286
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,412
Your Majesty.

287
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,915
What are you thinking?

288
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,754
No.

289
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:12,967
I cannot do this.

290
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,393
Thank you for everything.

291
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,980
After my mother passed away…

292
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,903
I considered you my mother.

293
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,989
Your Majesty.

294
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,827
Why are you doing this?

295
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,124
I beg of you to change your mind.

296
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,462
I am sure you know

297
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,216
this is the only way
we can put an end to this.

298
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,052
Please help me.

299
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,931
I did not want…

300
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,601
to lie to you.

301
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,773
I hope you can understand my decision.

302
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,360
Please.

303
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,839
Court Lady Kim!

304
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,468
Put her down.

305
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:45,601
Court Lady Kim! Why would you do this?

306
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,436
Why?

307
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,771
Let go of me.

308
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,359
I am going to follow after His Majesty.

309
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:59,448
I am going to leave
this world with His Majesty!

310
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,744
What do you mean?

311
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,415
What on earth do you mean by that?

312
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,377
Court Lady Kim!

313
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,398
Please protect His Majesty.

314
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,734
Please…

315
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,863
save His Majesty.

316
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,698
I beg of you.

317
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,162
So…

318
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,878
I am glad

319
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,173
that we can die together like this.

320
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,261
The tea you just drank
has been laced with poison.

321
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,138
It is sonangcho.

322
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,600
It is the poison you used to kill…

323
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,269
my father.

324
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,776
Accompany me to the afterlife.

325
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,237
Grandfather.

326
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,867
How dare you?

327
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,455
What have you done?

328
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:33,501
You have disrespected me
even until the last moment!

329
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:39,715
I have no regrets
for I was able to punish you

330
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,510
in the end.

331
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,573
I will not forgive you.

332
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,036
I will never forgive you.

333
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,733
Your Majesty.

334
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,735
Your Majesty.

335
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,570
Please wake up.

336
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,572
Your Majesty.

337
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,492
I need help!

338
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,329
Your Majesty.

339
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,665
Your Majesty.

340
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,002
Your Majesty.

341
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,548
Your Majesty…

342
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,518
Your Majesty…

343
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:46,717
You are already such
a beautiful princess, Your Highness.

344
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:51,347
Today is your wedding ceremony.
Are you going to be late again?

345
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,725
The groom has already entered
the palace a long while ago.

346
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,268
Already?

347
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,648
Oh, right. Where is Bok-dong?

348
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,024
Your Highness!

349
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,864
His Royal Highness has sent a present.

350
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,032
My brother did?

351
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,285
Yes. He is very grateful
that you took his place

352
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,912
for his last lecture.

353
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:20,543
Please do not tell me that you still
switch places with His Royal Highness.

354
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:25,339
He said something urgent came up.

355
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,676
We should go. He must be waiting.

356
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:33,431
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness. Please do not run!

357
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,640
Your Highness!

358
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,400
Lord Jung!

359
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,201
Your Highness.

360
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,352
What took you so long?

361
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,646
I waited for a long time.

362
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:39,914
Yeon-seon.

363
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,586
Thank you for marrying me.

364
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,255
I will…

365
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,592
make you happy.

366
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,681
Yeon-seon.

367
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,711
Is this…

368
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,716
a dream?

369
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,922
Lord Jung?

370
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,718
Lord Jung.

371
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,429
Do not leave.

372
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,058
Where are you?

373
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,482
Bok-dong.

374
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,610
Court Lady Kim.

375
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,035
Where did everyone go? I am all alone.

376
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,665
Do not leave me alone.

377
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,586
Do not leave me alone…

378
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,119
Do not leave.

379
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,248
Your Majesty.

380
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,126
Do not leave.

381
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,468
I did not leave.

382
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,893
I promised you, did I not?

383
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,230
That we would be together.

384
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,241
Your Majesty.

385
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,536
Are you awake?

386
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:10,040
Can you see me?

387
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,672
Your Majesty.

388
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,675
Your Majesty.

389
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,302
How…

390
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,687
Thank you…

391
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,190
for staying alive.

392
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,569
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

393
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:48,203
Are you feeling all right?

394
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,833
I will go and bring some warm water.

395
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,228
What happened…

396
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,524
to my grandfather?

397
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,070
Lord Sangheon…

398
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,866
has passed away.

399
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,834
It is all over now, Your Majesty.

400
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,962
Everything.

401
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,048
Now…

402
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,302
you have nothing to worry about.

403
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,778
Take him outside the palace.

404
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,781
There will be no funeral.

405
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:49,908
And he shall not…

406
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,744
be buried either.

407
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,079
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

408
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,812
I have not told

409
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,941
the officials that you are awake.

410
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,572
Now that everyone knows your secret,

411
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:32,075
the moment they find out
you are awake, you will have to face…

412
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,412
your punishment.

413
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:40,083
Thus, I will tell them you are dead.

414
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:46,256
I will say you never regained
consciousness since that day.

415
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,259
Go to a place where no one knows you.

416
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,555
And pretend none of this happened.

417
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,725
This is the last act of kindness

418
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,187
I can show to you.

419
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,775
I cannot do that.

420
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:09,237
Secrets will always come out.

421
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,491
If this secret comes out someday,

422
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:16,203
there will be another bloodbath
at the palace like today.

423
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:21,291
When that happens, you,
Lord Jaeun who will ascend to the throne,

424
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,837
and everyone who helped me hide
will be in trouble.

425
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,673
So you must live in hiding.

426
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,344
Nothing will come of it
if you live a quiet life.

427
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,595
That is how

428
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,390
I have lived so far.

429
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,687
I was alive. And yet, I was not.

430
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,065
That was my life.

431
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,360
I no longer wish

432
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,447
to pretend to be someone else.

433
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,913
Too many people have lost
their lives because of me.

434
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:03,542
I know that I cannot hide this anymore.

435
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,505
If I must be punished,

436
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,092
I will accept it.

437
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,138
Your Majesty.

438
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,392
Ascending to the throne

439
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,686
while lying about her gender

440
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,147
is equivalent to making a mockery

441
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,191
of the officials and the people.

442
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,070
This is a serious offense that can weaken…

443
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,196
ROYAL ORDER

444
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,657
…the foundation of the nation.

445
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:42,831
I will accept any punishment you give me.

446
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,379
Your Majesty.

447
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,257
I apologize for intervening.

448
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:57,554
But I would like to address
the royal court and Your Majesty.

449
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,518
Based on the ideology of Neo-Confucianism
that men and women have different duties,

450
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:08,523
it is clear what she had done
is indeed a serious, unforgivable offense.

451
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:12,235
However, the preceding king did not intend

452
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,404
to become the Prince years ago

453
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,784
and was forced
to take the Crown Prince's place.

454
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,412
And upon taking the throne,

455
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,790
the preceding king attempted
to rule the nation

456
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:29,920
with the highest form of benevolence
in history for the better of the people.

457
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,881
Thus, it is unjust to punish

458
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:37,219
the preceding king
only based on doctrine and ideology.

459
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:42,057
The preceding king did not make
a mockery of the people.

460
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,478
This only took place
because a group of corrupt rebels

461
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,689
chased power instead of serving our king.

462
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,068
I ask that you punish

463
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:56,279
all of your subjects
who had turned a blind eye

464
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:59,616
on their corrupt acts

465
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,787
before you punish the preceding king.

466
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,927
Please forgive me for intervening.

467
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,014
I served as her teacher
at the royal institute

468
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,517
when she was the Crown Prince.

469
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,019
And during her reign,
as her Chief Royal Secretary,

470
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,856
I assisted her by her side.

471
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,652
So allow me to share the punishment…

472
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,412
as her teacher and subject.

473
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,003
We beg of you, Your Majesty!

474
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,755
We beg of you, Your Majesty!

475
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,175
We beg of you, Your Majesty!

476
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:02,721
-We beg of you, Your Majesty!
-We beg of you, Your Majesty!

477
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:06,266
-We beg of you, Your Majesty!
-We beg of you, Your Majesty!

478
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:10,395
-We beg of you, Your Majesty!
-We beg of you, Your Majesty!

479
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,152
This is a serious offense,

480
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,113
but she, alone, is not responsible?

481
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,368
You are right.

482
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,080
I will take that into consideration
and make a decision.

483
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:35,629
Please sentence Yi Hwi to paenghyeong.

484
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,131
What do you mean?

485
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,259
Yi Hwi never existed, to begin with.

486
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,512
Because the prince passed away
a long time ago.

487
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,307
Sentence Yi Hwi to paenghyeong

488
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,809
and remove all records of his life so far.

489
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,021
And restore the identity

490
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:58,276
of the dead court maid, Dam-i,
so she can lead a new life.

491
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,863
I beg of you, Your Highness.

492
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:06,451
Yi Hwi who lied about her gender
and ascended to the throne

493
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,119
will face…

494
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,209
paenghyeong.

495
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:21,758
-Thank you for your boundless generosity.
-Thank you for your boundless generosity.

496
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,612
And Dam-i, the twin sister

497
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,741
who had to be abandoned
just because she was born a girl,

498
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,787
will regain her identity
and live a new life.

499
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:26,322
So listen up. This story took place

500
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,659
in the mighty palace a long time ago.

501
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,120
A beautiful, fair-skinned woman

502
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:36,249
who was strong as steel took the throne.

503
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:40,211
She exposed all the corrupt officials.

504
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,964
And just like dew…

505
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,967
She disappeared like dew?

506
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,096
Then what? What happened?

507
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,348
Like dew,

508
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:56,144
the water in the cauldron was clear
and she went in to face paenghyeong.

509
00:55:56,227 --> 00:56:00,398
And this legendary woman
got to live her life anew.

510
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,276
Paenghyeong? What is that?

511
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,362
You know, you go into boiling water

512
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,240
and when you come out,
it is as if you do not exist anymore.

513
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,826
So your entire existence just disappears.

514
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,662
Boiling water?
She went into the boiling water?

515
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:18,041
Of course she did not.
That is just what they say.

516
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:40,814
Are you going to the palace now,
Commander Kang?

517
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,484
All right.

518
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,153
Drink this before you go.

519
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,740
You have to guard His Majesty all day.
You cannot go on an empty stomach.

520
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,284
Thank you.

521
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,628
Right. Take this.

522
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,423
What is this?

523
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,426
Use it when you go to the herb market.

524
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,429
How beautiful.

525
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,101
What is that? Where is mine?

526
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,316
What about mine?

527
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,323
I have a question.

528
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:36,077
Why did you want to become a commoner?

529
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,413
Just because.

530
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:43,209
I wanted to visit my father
in exile more comfortably.

531
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,087
That is all?

532
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:52,802
I did not want
my life at the palace to be erased.

533
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:58,183
After all, I made a lot
of happy memories in the palace too.

534
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:03,396
But His Majesty gave back your title.

535
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,108
And it is fortunate
that he erased your record as the Queen.

536
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:11,279
Now, you can meet a nice man
and get married.

537
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:26,503
This would look great on His Majesty.

538
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:39,349
I hope His Majesty is healthy
and doing well.

539
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,131
Your Majesty!

540
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,926
You are here again!

541
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,638
Why did you not tell us you were leaving?

542
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,641
The preceding king made sure that

543
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,477
we were to never leave
your side before she left

544
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,146
the palace.

545
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,401
She gave us an order before leaving.

546
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,861
If she finds out, we will be in trouble.

547
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,830
I hope they are both

548
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,374
doing well.

549
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,690
Gosh. Fine.

550
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:57,487
We will just have
seasoned wild vegetables today. Go.

551
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,469
My lady, you startled me.

552
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,807
It has been a while
since I held my bow. So I am a bit rusty.

553
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,059
But still…

554
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,895
You seem to be having
a hard time catching any fish.

555
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,189
So I ought to hunt
to put food on our table.

556
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:36,275
What? Who says I am having a hard time?

557
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,027
That upsets me.

558
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:41,447
I chose not to catch fish because
I did not want you to get sick of them.

559
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:45,910
Goodness. Was it yesterday?
When I tried to catch this fish,

560
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,995
it almost ate me.

561
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:56,754
My lady.

562
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,716
My lady!

563
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,013
Where are you running off to?

564
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,308
I promised
that I would never let go of you.

565
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:55,354
I was always curious
about what was beyond the ocean.

566
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:00,693
Would you like to go
and see what lies beyond?

567
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:14,832
No.

568
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,461
I am no longer curious about life there.

569
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:26,093
I am perfectly happy where I am now.

570
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:39,357
Right.

571
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:41,859
Here.

572
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,696
This is…

573
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,242
You told me that you wanted a hairpin.

574
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,204
Stay still for a moment.

575
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,723
You are beautiful, Yeon-seon.

576
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,059
Truly.

577
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,250
Everything that has happened

578
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,045
feels like a dream.

579
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:28,758
A long, scary,

580
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,510
yet beautiful dream.

581
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,556
Your dreams will no longer be scary.

582
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,809
They will only be beautiful.

583
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:43,898
Because I will always be by your side.

584
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:49,088
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
THE KING'S AFFECTION

585
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:55,761
