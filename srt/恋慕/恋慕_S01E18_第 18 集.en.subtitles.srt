1
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,441
This was all Prince Wonsan's doing!

2
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,487
All I wanted was to confirm
if His Majesty is indeed a woman.

3
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,780
A woman?

4
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,949
The truth you have discovered

5
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,827
will be buried alongside you.

6
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,035
He is not here. Let's go.

7
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,245
-Yes, Commander.
-Yes, Commander.

8
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,508
I have something to tell you,
Your Majesty.

9
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,928
I am…

10
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,806
getting married.

11
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,936
I do not want to lose you, Your Majesty.

12
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,315
And this is the only way…

13
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,528
for me not to lose you.

14
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,080
Stop right there!

15
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,252
I have yet…

16
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,922
to tell you to stop.

17
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,595
Stop!

18
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,433
That is an order.

19
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,354
Forgive me,

20
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,149
Your Majesty.

21
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,107
I will get married.

22
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,945
I will do as you say.

23
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,656
So please

24
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,409
keep His Majesty's secret.

25
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,204
You must keep it…

26
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,125
no matter what.

27
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,804
EPISODE 18

28
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,146
Oh, my. How gorgeous.

29
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,526
The madam at Commander Jung's put
a lot of thought into these gifts.

30
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,701
My lady.

31
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,833
Your Highness!

32
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,960
So-eun.

33
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,177
You did not have to bring anything.
Thank you, Your Highness.

34
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,346
Congratulations.

35
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,891
Are the preparations going well?

36
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,644
There are still many things to arrange.

37
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,230
But it still feels surreal.

38
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,823
You seem a bit exhausted.

39
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,992
Is something wrong?

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,703
No, it's nothing.

41
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,958
Is it because of that rumor?

42
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,960
The one about His Majesty and Lord Jung.

43
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,675
I heard it too.

44
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,556
But do not worry, Your Highness.
You know that it is not true.

45
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,434
The rumor will go away
once he and I get married.

46
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,145
So do not give it another thought.

47
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,199
As you instructed earlier,
I talked to the Ministry of Works about

48
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,368
the renovation of buildings and gates
at the Royal Confucian Academy.

49
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,455
We still have
some leftover rice bags from before.

50
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,374
And we have an excess of roof tiles.

51
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,376
Thus, the materials and workers…

52
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,921
I do not want to lose you, Your Majesty.

53
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,590
And this is the only way…

54
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,886
for me not to lose you.

55
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,223
So we can proceed
with the renovations, Your Majesty.

56
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:34,644
Right. Scribe Jung of Seungjeongwon…

57
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,648
Scribe Jung. Come here.

58
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,400
Come join us here.

59
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,988
Come here.

60
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,742
Scribe Jung has good news.

61
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,914
He is getting married soon.

62
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,753
So he has to prepare for the wedding

63
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,505
and will be very busy.

64
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,799
So would it be all right

65
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:08,261
if Scribe Kim brings you
the reports for the time being?

66
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,849
Yes. That will be fine.

67
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,478
Then we will
take our leave now, Your Majesty.

68
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,535
I am still trying to find
the poisonous herbs I told you about.

69
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,871
If I can find both herbs,

70
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:39,250
we can prove that the statement about
the poison in the State Tribunal's records

71
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,752
is not true.

72
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,891
Are preparations for the wedding

73
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,977
coming along well?

74
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,024
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,486
I see.

76
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,698
Thank you for your hard work.

77
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,783
You may leave.

78
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,353
So were you able to find Lord Changun?

79
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,650
I wish to speak to His Majesty
about the upcoming auspicious day.

80
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,029
Indeed. It is coming up very soon.

81
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:55,034
You have been informed
of Scribe Jung's upcoming marriage, right?

82
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,412
Marriage? Scribe Jung is getting married?

83
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,665
Have you not heard?

84
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,251
I thought you were his best friend.

85
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,004
Does His Majesty know as well?

86
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,063
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

87
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,231
I am fine.

88
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,651
Your Majesty,
I believe that is enough for the day.

89
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,654
I am worried that you may injure yourself.

90
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,409
I said I am all right.

91
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,244
Your Majesty.

92
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,331
At least let me have this. Please.

93
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,788
Marriage?

94
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,166
What is this nonsense?

95
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,254
It just happened that way.

96
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,966
A mere rumor was enough
to sway your feelings?

97
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,302
How could you make her falter

98
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,013
with feelings as shallow as yours?

99
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,271
Fine. My feelings were shallow.

100
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,608
These shallow feelings were all I had.

101
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,525
All right?

102
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,653
What?

103
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,489
We never had a chance
to be together forever anyway.

104
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,451
It worked out for the best.

105
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,204
You bastard!

106
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,004
Tell me why you are doing this.

107
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,136
You would never do something like this
without a good reason.

108
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,982
A strange rumor is going around
at the courtesan house in the Capital.

109
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,906
A man who resembles Lord Changun
has been claiming His Majesty is a twin

110
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,242
and may be a woman.

111
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,049
I was told you wanted to see me.

112
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,510
Yes.

113
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,389
I called you
because I wanted to ask you something.

114
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,279
Your Majesty, your herbal tonic is ready.

115
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,198
Come in.

116
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,911
Fortunately, the swelling
will not persist.

117
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,877
Your royal physician is here.

118
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,345
What are you doing?

119
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,223
Please forgive me. It was my fault.

120
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,976
-See if he is hurt.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

121
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,437
-Court Lady Kim.
-Let me see.

122
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,690
-I am all right. I said I am fine.
-My goodness.

123
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,777
-Goodness.
-Are you hurt?

124
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,114
No. Thankfully, the tonic was not too hot.

125
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,575
I am glad to hear that. You may leave now.

126
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,286
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,663
I feel awful about this.

128
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,388
His Majesty hurt his hand while training.

129
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,056
I was just there to examine it.

130
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,058
I see. Is he all right?

131
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,811
Yes. I also took his pulse

132
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,312
and it was good as well.

133
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,440
He will have no problem
sleeping with the Queen.

134
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,442
I see.

135
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,488
Keep an eye on him and report back
no matter how insignificant it may seem.

136
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,823
Yes, my lord.

137
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,959
Just as we expected.

138
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,062
It's busohwa.

139
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,005
Was it really necessary
to search everywhere just to find that?

140
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,925
You ought to use your brain.
Not only your body.

141
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,343
I thought you were smart.

142
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,265
Did you look into the sonangcho?

143
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,103
Today, I have an appointment
with the pharmacy owner to buy

144
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,231
-sonangcho.
-Really?

145
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,484
What did I tell you?
I told you I could find it.

146
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,779
Are you sure it is sonangcho? When? Where?

147
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,365
No. This is dangerous,
so make sure to go with Eun-seo.

148
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,325
Eun-seo? He is not here.

149
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,662
He is really busy.
He said His Majesty gave him a task.

150
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,747
He left for Pyeongan Province.

151
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,795
By the way,

152
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,965
you are about to get married.
But look at your face.

153
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,967
How did you bust your lips?

154
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,385
Take care of yourself.

155
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,345
I know it was your father's idea,

156
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,972
but at least show some interest.

157
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,062
Ji-un, I think
the Inspector General's daughter

158
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,232
has a kind heart
and she seems like a nice lady.

159
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,111
Ji-un.

160
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,740
And she also takes such good care of us.

161
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,496
I was in the area,
so I thought I would drop by.

162
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,252
I did not know that you would be here.

163
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,138
We received the wedding gifts.

164
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,266
Selecting them
must have required some effort.

165
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,437
And I heard that your mother
selected everything on her own.

166
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,482
Yes.

167
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,778
What happened to your face?

168
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,532
Oh, this.

169
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,993
It's nothing.

170
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,385
Please use this.

171
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,900
Lord Jung.

172
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,488
Is this marriage not what you desire?

173
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,825
That is not why…

174
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,418
I am sorry.

175
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:11,048
But I will try.

176
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,427
Even if it takes some time.

177
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,791
So-eun will wed Jung Ji-un,

178
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,377
Commander Jung's son.

179
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,396
Your Highness. You must get ready
for your night with His Majesty.

180
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,732
All right.

181
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,947
Your Highness.

182
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:25,164
The Chief State Councilor wanted
to see me earlier today, so I went.

183
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,375
Why would he want to see you?

184
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,255
Forgive me, Your Highness.

185
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,423
Yu-gong.

186
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,758
I told him everything.

187
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,804
That you and His Majesty
have been using two sets of blankets.

188
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,055
What?

189
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,600
But I told you not to tell anyone.

190
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,020
Lord Sangheon was frightening
when he was questioning me.

191
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,379
Starting today,
we will be sharing a blanket.

192
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,050
What do you mean?

193
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,385
There are awful rumors
going around the palace.

194
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,014
And to put an end to the rumors,

195
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,725
we must do this.

196
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,144
They are…

197
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,523
nothing more than rumors.

198
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,611
I will tell them
to bring in another set of blankets.

199
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:42,658
When a husband and a wife sleep,
there cannot be two sets of blankets.

200
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,284
My Queen.

201
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,246
I may not know everything.

202
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,665
But I believe the Queen is called

203
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,376
the mother of the state because

204
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:56,338
she is to cherish and take care of
the people who serve you as her own.

205
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,842
But without having been with child
or having given birth,

206
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,846
how could I understand what it means
to be a mother and cherish them?

207
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,894
Producing an heir to continue
the bloodline of the royal family

208
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,774
is the most important task as the Queen
and it is the reason for her existence.

209
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:21,655
Please help me fulfill my duty
as the Queen, Your Majesty.

210
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,706
Please stop.

211
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,168
I do not wish to hurt you
more than I already have, My Queen.

212
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,796
Then embrace me, please.

213
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,969
Please stop, My Queen.

214
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,346
Please.

215
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,933
Do you truly love men, Your Majesty?

216
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,812
Or does your heart lie with another woman?

217
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,441
Please answer me.

218
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,652
Is it because you do not like me?

219
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,487
Or is there another reason?

220
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,951
-It is not what you think.
-If it is not,

221
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,537
why will you not sleep with me?

222
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,206
Tell me why…

223
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,344
I would rather you select
a royal concubine.

224
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,723
If this is something I cannot fulfill,

225
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,268
please select a royal concubine

226
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,481
to produce an heir. I beg of you.

227
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,502
No.

228
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,173
It is not because I do not like you.

229
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,510
I am sorry.

230
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:12,057
I know that my actions
are difficult to understand.

231
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,768
I will soon

232
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,230
tell you everything.

233
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,650
I will tell you

234
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,153
why I had to do this.

235
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,240
I will make sure

236
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,576
to tell you everything.

237
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,912
Everything.

238
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,572
My father found out

239
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,033
about His Majesty's secret.

240
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,704
What?

241
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:22,711
I will do whatever is necessary
to protect His Majesty.

242
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,338
So please…

243
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,427
pretend you do not know anything.

244
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,514
I beg of you.

245
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,414
Someone came to the pharmacy
and asked about sonangcho.

246
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,008
Father.

247
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,718
What are you doing here?

248
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,765
Were you the one looking for sonangcho?

249
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,437
Did you also know

250
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,315
the truth about the late King's death?

251
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,402
What are you trying
to achieve with that now?

252
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,362
I will get to the bottom of his death.

253
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,864
If you wish to reveal
the truth about his death,

254
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,326
you will have to expose me too.

255
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,164
If you committed a crime,

256
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,543
you must face the consequences too.

257
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:35,051
That pharmacy is
under Lord Sangheon's supervision.

258
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,722
And he is very strict in his supervision.

259
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,975
Are you saying

260
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,353
that this is a trap?

261
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,275
Jil-geum…

262
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,776
Jil-geum is there.

263
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,575
Stop worrying about him.
It is probably too late now.

264
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:02,203
Are you telling me I should let him
suffer again because of me?

265
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,083
When I had been hurt by you

266
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,171
and had wanted to end my life,
my friends made me want to live again.

267
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,885
Without them,
I would not have been able to endure…

268
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,388
those times.

269
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,365
How much farther must we go?

270
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,450
Do you even have sonangcho?

271
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,951
We are almost there.

272
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,537
I cannot sell
such a rare herb out in the open.

273
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,208
Right. It is quite rare.

274
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,461
By the way, why are you
looking for such a deadly herb?

275
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,796
Oh, that?

276
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,757
I have my reasons. I told you not to ask.

277
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,930
What is this?

278
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,434
He is the man looking for sonangcho.

279
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,482
If you wish to remain breathing,
I suggest you tell me the truth.

280
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,110
Why are you looking for sonangcho?

281
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,778
Pardon?

282
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,281
I heard it was a rare herb.
So I just wanted to see it…

283
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,325
Please spare me.

284
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,662
Tell me who sent you.

285
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,124
It was me.

286
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,584
Ji-un!

287
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,088
I am the one who sent him.

288
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,771
Ji-un.

289
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,401
We should go, Jil-geum.

290
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,654
Get them!

291
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,680
Stop!

292
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,113
What brings you here?

293
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,366
I will take care of this.
So you can all step back.

294
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,120
Lord Sangheon ordered us to bring the man

295
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,498
looking for sonangcho at any cost.

296
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,082
I told you to step back!

297
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,960
Do you not hear me?

298
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,051
I will report this to Lord Sangheon.

299
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,012
Step back.

300
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,891
Ji-un.

301
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,208
You were not here this afternoon.
So I picked them out myself.

302
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,670
I wanted to thank you
for wanting to help at the wedding.

303
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,508
Of course, I will.
You did not have to get me anything.

304
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:48,012
I heard Lord Jung cherishes you
and your brother like his own siblings.

305
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,932
Could I consider you two my siblings too?

306
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:56,604
I really want to get along
with you and your brother like family.

307
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,149
Of course.

308
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,862
Yeong-ji!

309
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,196
Ji-un!

310
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,450
-Lord Jung!
-Get me something to stop the bleeding.

311
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,160
Oh, no. Ji-un!

312
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,964
Ji-un, please wake up.

313
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,591
Ji-un.

314
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,678
What happened? Why is he hurt like this?

315
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,806
Well…

316
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,529
It has reached Lord Sangheon's ears?

317
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,323
A good number of people

318
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,868
heard Lord Changun talking
about twins when he was drunk.

319
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,708
So you still have not found him?

320
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,088
If Lord Sangheon finds him first

321
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,548
and makes him talk, I will be in trouble.

322
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,716
Go and find my uncle.

323
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,093
Yes, my lord.

324
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,683
Were you really behind this?

325
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,601
What are you plotting?

326
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,395
I told you to go and find my uncle.

327
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,859
You must put an end to this.

328
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,611
Uncle is dead.

329
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,488
Dead?

330
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,782
Did you see who killed him?

331
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,326
How could you have done something so evil?

332
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,578
Why are you going this far?

333
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,915
Do you…

334
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,835
truly not know why?

335
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:30,675
I was always curious
as to why you were so loyal to the King.

336
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,848
Hyun, you knew all along, didn't you?

337
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,226
That His Majesty was a woman.

338
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:49,193
Your heart has been misplaced, Hyun.

339
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,114
-Find him!
-Yes, my lord!

340
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:01,497
I did not expect Lord Sangheon
to come find me this soon.

341
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,213
You cannot go like this.

342
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,425
Come with me to see His Majesty.

343
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,385
If you give up and ask for forgiveness,

344
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:19,098
I will look for a way to save you too.

345
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,101
It is too late. Step back.

346
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,984
You cannot possibly wish
to hand over the lives of our family

347
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,736
because of your love for her.

348
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,489
What are you planning to do
after you meet Lord Sangheon?

349
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,324
I will take back what is rightfully mine.

350
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,575
Jeong, please!

351
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:42,497
A woman cannot be King, Hyun.

352
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,553
Escort him.

353
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,883
Please sit, Lord Wonsan.

354
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,022
You faked Lord Changun's death

355
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,192
to dethrone His Majesty
when he was the Crown Prince?

356
00:35:55,403 --> 00:36:00,283
It seems you still have not let go
of your vain desires.

357
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,830
You have already checked
the umbilical cord.

358
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,584
Can you still say my desires are in vain?

359
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:15,006
You are the one with vain desires,
as you refuse to give up

360
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,216
despite knowing you are at a disadvantage.

361
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,971
It was quiet at the palace.

362
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,809
Then you must not be aware that
His Majesty was attacked by assassins.

363
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,730
His coat string was ripped
during the attack.

364
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,233
It is in my knowledge that
Commander Jung was at the scene as well.

365
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,527
I wonder why he hid it.

366
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,366
Are you not anxious?

367
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:47,121
A young king who is infatuated with a man
and refuses to sleep with the Queen.

368
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,541
I am sure you are aware

369
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,711
that the recipient
of His Majesty's passion is a man.

370
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:58,591
Unless you came here
to end your life tonight,

371
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,053
I do not see how you would benefit

372
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,722
from provoking me by crossing lines.

373
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,517
Do you remember?

374
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,561
Ten years ago,

375
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,106
shortly after the royal preceptor died,

376
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,152
His Majesty behaved
like a different person for a while.

377
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,156
Back then, we all thought
it was because he was in shock.

378
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,161
But what if His Majesty
had been switched back then?

379
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,215
How dare you!

380
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,468
How dare you ridicule His Majesty and me

381
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,096
with your preposterous claim?

382
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,056
Do you want me to tear your mouth apart?

383
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,142
You still have a chance.

384
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,646
I can be of use to you.

385
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,276
What do you think about
joining hands with me?

386
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,822
Lock him up right now!

387
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,121
I will leave on my own.

388
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,135
You will have no choice

389
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,138
but to come to me soon.

390
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,570
What do you mean he knows everything?

391
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,781
It was my brother

392
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,326
who sent our uncle to attack you.

393
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,497
I believe he plotted this
to find out if you are a woman.

394
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:58,919
He is most likely telling
Lord Sangheon about it right now.

395
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,464
What should we do now?

396
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,049
Goodness, Court Lady Kim.

397
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,012
Your Majesty. What should we do?

398
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,808
We must make our move first.

399
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,645
What Lord Wonsan knows
is only speculation.

400
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,233
So my grandfather will not act in haste.

401
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,420
Have you had a good night's sleep?

402
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,048
Yes.

403
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:52,723
What brings you all the way
to my quarters, Chief State Councilor?

404
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,225
Last night,

405
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:59,313
foolish thoughts consumed me
and distracted me from my sleep.

406
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,650
I have been hearing

407
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,362
that things between you
and His Majesty have not been going well.

408
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,532
They are…

409
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,661
only rumors.

410
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,873
His Majesty cherishes me a lot.

411
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,420
I am sure we will have good news soon.

412
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,964
Please do not worry.

413
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,164
Ji-un.

414
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,751
Are you all right? Can you get up?

415
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,421
What happened? What about Jil-geum?

416
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,756
You should be worried about yourself.

417
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,009
Jil-geum is fine.
No need to worry about him.

418
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,436
Lady So-eun looked after you all night.

419
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,022
She just left.

420
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,138
Your Majesty.

421
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,018
I miss you…

422
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:06,982
so much.

423
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,242
I want to always be by your side.

424
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,349
Still no news regarding the sonangcho?

425
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,060
It seems they are still looking for it.

426
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:48,816
I am sure Royal Physician Seo obtained
the herb and gave it to my grandfather.

427
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,236
We must get him to confess while we wait.

428
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,405
But what if he does not confess?

429
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,117
You will only be raising more
of Lord Sangheon's suspicions.

430
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,327
You are right, Your Majesty.

431
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,205
He already started to suspect you.

432
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,874
It is only a matter of time
before he finds out the truth.

433
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,210
Whatever we do, we must hurry.

434
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,465
Send Eun-seo right away.

435
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,928
Why did you not tell me

436
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,472
Lord Changun attacked His Majesty?

437
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,350
We were coming back
from Officer Yoon's grave.

438
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,563
So His Majesty did not wish to reveal it.

439
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,149
You were following the royal command?

440
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:35,154
Then when I ordered you
to bring Lord Changun to me,

441
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,866
you should have at least informed me then.

442
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,367
Please forgive me.

443
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,288
I thought that it would not be
too late to inform you

444
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:47,166
after I had caught him
and confirmed it first.

445
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,679
I see. You may leave.

446
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,954
Keep an eye on Commander Jung.

447
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:28,999
Yes, my lord.

448
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,861
Your Majesty.

449
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,658
Where is Eun-seo?

450
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,577
He just arrived at Seonwonjeon,
the Royal Portrait Hall.

451
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,242
What brings you here at this hour?

452
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,833
Where were you headed?

453
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,839
I was feeling lonesome,
so I was on my way out for a stroll.

454
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:03,510
Then I would like to chat with you.

455
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:08,223
I have many interesting things to share.

456
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,438
Sure. That sounds lovely as well.

457
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:19,067
Your uncle who was presumed dead

458
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,028
came back in the flesh

459
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,906
and tried to kill you, Your Majesty.

460
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,993
But it turned out
he was not trying to kill you.

461
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,748
He was trying to confirm
if a ridiculous rumor was true.

462
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,296
A rumor?

463
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,549
That the King was born a twin.

464
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:47,554
And that he shared
the womb with a twin sister.

465
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:55,229
That in itself would make things difficult
for you to keep the throne.

466
00:46:56,063 --> 00:47:00,400
But he claimed that
the siblings had secretly been switched,

467
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:05,781
and that the girl was now
the King of Joseon.

468
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,789
What do you think?

469
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,084
Very interesting, is it not?

470
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,593
Yes, it is very interesting indeed.

471
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,180
People outside the palace say

472
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,726
that a flesh-eating monster
lives deep inside the palace.

473
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,438
When I was young, I was afraid
of coming face to face with it.

474
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,567
So I never left my chamber at night.

475
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,735
But after a long time passed,

476
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,365
I realized they were talking about you.

477
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,701
Well…

478
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,287
it seems these rumors of the palace

479
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,667
are sometimes exaggerated
to the point of absurdity.

480
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,798
Is that so?

481
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,219
But Your Majesty…

482
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:14,182
The rumor is not entirely groundless.

483
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:18,770
When you were born,
you indeed had a twin sister.

484
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,442
I ordered Your Majesty's twin sister

485
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,445
to be killed.

486
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,162
You ordered her to be killed?

487
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,164
Yes.

488
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:42,252
And the people who knew
about your sister are gone as well.

489
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,172
Because I ordered them to be killed.

490
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,592
Why did you do it?

491
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,470
Why did you do such a cruel thing?

492
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,097
This was all for you, Your Majesty.

493
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,516
Unlike the commoners,

494
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,271
the birth of twins is considered
an ominous sign at the palace.

495
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:05,400
The late King who ascended
to the throne after murdering his nephew

496
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:11,073
was more afraid than anyone that
people would find out about the twins.

497
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:16,536
Thus, I was not left with much choice.

498
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:22,292
I could either kill you
and your sister both

499
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:28,090
or only kill your sister
and keep it secret.

500
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,592
Those were my choices.

501
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:39,142
Why are you telling me this right now?

502
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,563
If anyone else finds out about this,

503
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,566
I will kill them all.

504
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:52,322
I will kill anyone who stands in your way.

505
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,225
I trust…

506
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,688
that you will acknowledge
my loyalty to you, Your Majesty.

507
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,275
As long as you do,

508
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,068
I…

509
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:36,700
will have no regrets
even if people call me a monster.

510
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,370
You must pack up and leave the palace now.

511
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,288
What…

512
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,916
Your Majesty.

513
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,669
No, Your Majesty.
How could you tell us to leave now?

514
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,131
I will never leave your side.

515
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:37,677
With you here, I cannot win this fight.

516
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:42,808
My grandfather will hold you hostage
and force me to tell the truth.

517
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,437
But what are you going to do?

518
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,566
I will reveal that my grandfather

519
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,110
killed my father and plotted treason.

520
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,446
I have the ledger from Yeoyeon,

521
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,032
and if I can find sonangcho
through Royal Physician Seo,

522
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,867
I can do it.

523
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:05,956
But everyone in
the royal court follows Lord Sangheon.

524
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,419
You told us that it would not be enough
to bring him down.

525
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,466
Given this turn of events, I must try.

526
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,429
It will not take long.

527
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:26,017
I will make this work no matter what
and bring you back.

528
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,900
I want you to be there

529
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,778
when I pass the throne to Gyeom.

530
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,031
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

531
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,999
Have faith in me.

532
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:50,876
I…

533
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,461
will not die.

534
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,507
You know better than anyone…

535
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,177
what I have endured to come this far.

536
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:08,143
We have become a hindrance.

537
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,439
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

538
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,336
It is my understanding
that you have the girl's body.

539
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,214
I must see her body.

540
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,215
Why?

541
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,344
Do you not trust your man, Jung Seok-jo?

542
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:47,766
Ten years ago,
shortly after the royal preceptor died,

543
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:51,937
His Majesty behaved
like a different person for a while.

544
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,606
Only commoners play
with something like this.

545
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,566
How did you get this?

546
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,151
That…

547
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,948
Crown Prince, what is your take on this?

548
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,866
Is marriage what you desire?

549
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,036
Please be more considerate of them

550
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,831
and postpone the royal wedding
just a little bit.

551
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,875
What I mean is that you were wrong

552
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,670
to have gotten involved
in the murder of a lowly girl.

553
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,838
A petty life, did you say?

554
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,424
There is no such thing as a petty life.

555
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:26,012
And there is not a single person
who should die for no reason.

556
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,986
Please take care of them, Hyun.

557
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:45,824
I will come back right away
after taking them to a safe place.

558
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,329
Bok-dong.

559
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,666
Take good care of Court Lady Kim.

560
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:59,337
Yes, Your Majesty.
I will take good care of her.

561
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,758
Do not worry.

562
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:07,512
Once everything is settled,
I will come to get you.

563
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,639
You must.

564
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:14,519
You must come even if it is late at night.

565
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:20,358
We will wait for you with the lanterns on.
You must come to us.

566
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,324
Follow me.

567
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,266
I do not know
what His Majesty plans to do alone.

568
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,561
There is…

569
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,732
a place we must stop by.

570
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,880
What brings you here

571
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,382
at this hour?

572
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,386
I have something to tell you.

573
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:23,022
YEON-SEON

574
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:43,710
His Majesty was once
a court maid in the palace.

575
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,214
And His Majesty's name back then…

576
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,551
was Dam-i.

577
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:05,773
Commander Jung killed the Prince,

578
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,485
mistaking him for Dam-i.

579
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:13,781
It was His Majesty's wish
that this remained a secret to you.

580
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,825
But your father

581
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,370
poses the gravest danger to His Majesty.

582
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:24,209
So I ask that you protect His Majesty.

583
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,420
I beg of you

584
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,840
to protect His Majesty.

585
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,147
Lotus flowers brought me to you,

586
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,441
so I thought the name would be fitting.

587
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,985
Yeon-seon.

588
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:54,489
She told me to give these to you
if I ever met you.

589
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:55,990
LONGING, NOT

590
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,577
She told me they would help you
stay strong when things get hard

591
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:03,081
just like they had been helpful for her.

592
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,291
That court maid…

593
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,918
LIST OF COURT MAIDS

594
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,878
…died.

595
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,259
That girl must have been someone
quite special to you.

596
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,177
She was my first love.

597
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,641
We were born twins.

598
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,353
Me and my brother,
the eldest son of the Crown Prince.

599
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,065
After he died…

600
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,528
I had to take his place.

601
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,908
I may not be able

602
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,870
to tell you everything later on.

603
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:42,430
JWAJEON

604
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:34,982
YEON-SEON

605
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,452
Dam-i.

606
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,567
Is it you, Your Majesty?

607
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,531
Are you Dam-i?

608
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,333
I wish to break off the engagement.

609
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:01,379
One who covets
the crown must be coldhearted.

610
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,463
I am sorry, Hyun.

611
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:05,007
-Lord Jaeun!
-Lord Jaeun!

612
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,968
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

613
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:10,721
What is the path
you have chosen for your life?

614
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:14,809
No. You should kill me instead!
He has done nothing wrong!

615
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:19,605
The twin sister did not die.

616
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:23,025
I am his twin sister.

617
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:28,614
