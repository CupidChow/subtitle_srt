1
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,830
Take it.

2
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,549
No!

3
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,781
Where is…

4
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,409
Officer Yoon?

5
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,080
He passed away.

6
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,588
Officer Yoon told me
to make sure this was delivered to you.

7
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,945
Officer Yoon told me…

8
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,281
that you were friends.

9
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,785
He rests at a quiet spot by the stream…

10
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,830
that leads from Yanghwajin

11
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,291
to Mount Jeoldu.

12
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,378
You should pay him a visit.

13
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,693
Uncle, how…

14
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,426
Your Majesty.

15
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,627
Father.

16
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,614
Get him!

17
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,079
Protect His Majesty.

18
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,458
What? Damn it.

19
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,568
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

20
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,861
Were you injured?

21
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:52,990
I am fine.

22
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,119
What happened to the assassins?

23
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,788
Please forgive me.

24
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:05,044
I am sure it was my uncle, Lord Changun.

25
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,128
But…

26
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,007
Lord Changun passed away.

27
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,181
It would be wise
to keep this between us for now.

28
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,934
Even if we say
that my uncle was behind the attack,

29
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,770
no one would believe us.

30
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,106
Of course, Your Majesty.

31
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,694
Allow me to find a path for you.
Please be on alert as you follow.

32
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,882
EPISODE 17

33
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,433
Did you check if he was indeed a woman?

34
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,643
Damn it.

35
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,354
It seemed like it,

36
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,107
but, then again, it didn't.

37
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,775
What?

38
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,366
You scared me.

39
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,328
Well, you see,

40
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,913
Commander Jung came out of nowhere.

41
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,092
What do you mean Lord Changun
attacked His Majesty?

42
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,720
He already died quite some time ago.

43
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,597
I am wondering the same thing.

44
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,683
It is not like
he can come back from the dead.

45
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,152
Are you sure you are not injured?

46
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,280
Yes.

47
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,869
How was Commander Jung there though?

48
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:09,335
Could he possibly be aware of your secret?

49
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,380
I doubt it.

50
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,216
Even if he saw anything,

51
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,968
he would not be able
to speak of it easily.

52
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,639
The fact that I exist could very well lead

53
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,975
to his demise.

54
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,813
He will stay silent to at least

55
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,316
keep his mistake covered.

56
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,693
I see.

57
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,282
Your Majesty, Lord Jaeun shall enter.

58
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,259
I hear you were attacked by assassins
at Officer Yoon's burial site.

59
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,011
That is correct.

60
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,516
But it should not become public knowledge
for it will only cause mayhem.

61
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,184
I am aware.

62
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:12,106
But is it true that they were led
by our uncle, Lord Changun?

63
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,277
I know it is hard to believe,

64
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,280
but I am certain of it.

65
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,575
I will look into this matter.

66
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,244
Lord Changun and my brother
have always been close,

67
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,664
so there is a good chance
he is aware of this.

68
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,584
Thank you, Hyun.

69
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:43,012
Were you also at Officer Yoon's grave?

70
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:49,185
Mother told me
that you two were old friends.

71
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,273
Is His Majesty well?

72
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,567
Yes.

73
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:01,197
Let him know
that I will report back to him

74
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,407
once I find out more.

75
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,202
Will you also…

76
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,705
be informing Lord Sangheon?

77
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,838
This is something hard to believe.

78
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,342
A man coming back from the dead?

79
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,928
After I look into it,

80
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:29,308
it will be wiser for His Majesty
to inform Lord Sangheon himself.

81
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,950
How did your conversation go?

82
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,160
Does Commander Jung…

83
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,997
He seemed impassive as always which means
he probably did not see anything.

84
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,920
I see. That I am glad to hear.

85
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,308
Here you go.

86
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,728
The attack must have alarmed you.

87
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,063
This will help.

88
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,453
That reminds me.
I was wondering about Kang Eun-seo.

89
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,623
Would you allow me
to suggest that he stay at Samgaebang?

90
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,667
At Samgaebang?

91
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,462
Yes. From what I can gather,
he needs time to heal.

92
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,089
I cannot think of a better place.

93
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:46,427
He can also help my friends look
into the poisonous herb.

94
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,222
I had been worried about him as of late,

95
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,267
so that would definitely ease my mind.

96
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,247
Have we met before?

97
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,668
I was born in the Year of the Snake.

98
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,712
Since I am older, I will speak casually.

99
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,341
Or not.

100
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,094
It was Ji-un who sent you here,

101
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,722
so make yourself at home.

102
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,808
Please.

103
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,353
I brought this for you.

104
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,855
The tea will warm you up--

105
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,827
Are you all right?

106
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,249
Please let me know if you would like more.

107
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,918
I have an extra batch brewed.

108
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,044
Thank you.

109
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,509
Are you kidding me?
Yeong-ji, this is not cheap tea!

110
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,473
Well, drink up then.
It is time you earned your keep.

111
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,809
Shall we?

112
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,770
Now, let us hurry.

113
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,210
Anyway, out of all the places
that supply the palace with herbs,

114
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,254
this is the largest.

115
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,339
Welcome.

116
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,299
What can I get for you?

117
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,759
Oh, well…

118
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,763
From what I hear, you sell the good kind.

119
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,348
The good kind? For what exactly?

120
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,350
The liver or the eyes?

121
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,728
No, that is not what I mean.

122
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,815
You know. The sort of herb that is rare…

123
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,734
My lord, it is good to see you.

124
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,113
Have you brought in the herbs
that I requested?

125
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,919
As if you need to ask.

126
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,796
This way, my lord.

127
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,518
Are they for the royal infirmary

128
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,313
or Lord Sangheon?

129
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,106
They are actually for me this time.

130
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,152
I see. Well, we have a fresh batch
of dried foxglove and barberry root

131
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,072
which are of good quality.
Please take a look.

132
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,081
The umbilical cord of twins?

133
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,376
I happened to stumble on His Majesty's
while moving his placenta chamber.

134
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,837
According to the physician
who examined it,

135
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,756
it most certainly came from twins.

136
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,594
Are you saying you were not aware of this?

137
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,223
But that is preposterous.

138
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,309
The physician must be mistaken.

139
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,269
Twins within the royal family?

140
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,773
He should pay with his life
for even mumbling those words.

141
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,775
Bring him to me right away.

142
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,736
I will have him severely punished
for insulting His Majesty.

143
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,863
Forgive me, Your Highness.

144
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,076
I did not mean to cause a disturbance.

145
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,166
It will be wise for you
not to speak of such things either.

146
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,004
One might think you wish
to rebel against the King.

147
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,384
As if I ever would.

148
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,889
As I have been away for a while,
I wished to look in on you.

149
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:05,018
I apologize for troubling you
with an unnecessary concern, Grandmother.

150
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,077
The girl is dead?

151
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,248
His Majesty ordered the death

152
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,375
of all those who know about the twins,

153
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,712
so please bear that in mind.

154
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,466
This secret must be taken to the grave.

155
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,911
What brings you
to the Grand Queen Dowager's quarters?

156
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,704
Is it not obvious?

157
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,459
I have been away from the Capital,
so it is my duty to greet her.

158
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,712
I hope all is well.

159
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,965
Has His Majesty been in good health too?

160
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,863
No, wait.
He is a woman. I'm certain of it.

161
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,908
Rather than attacking me,
the man took His Majesty in his arms.

162
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,286
Quite odd, don't you think?
Either he has a death wish or…

163
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,165
-I must head to the palace.
-Are you out of your mind?

164
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,501
An attempt was made on His Majesty's life.

165
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,169
The palace must be on full alert.

166
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,921
Do not draw attention to yourself--

167
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,673
What if all is quiet at the palace?

168
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,884
It would confirm
that he really is a woman.

169
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,054
For he will try to keep
today's attack a secret.

170
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,820
In any case, what did you mean
by being able to return to the Capital

171
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,655
sooner than planned?

172
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,948
Oh, that.

173
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:28,036
It seems as though
things will go better than I thought.

174
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,181
-Hey, did you hear the rumor?
-What?

175
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,308
What rumor?

176
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,310
His Majesty and the Seungjeongwon scribe.

177
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,731
Someone saw them returning
to the palace at the crack of dawn again.

178
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,107
-At the crack of dawn?
-Yes.

179
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,734
-The two of them?
-Yes!

180
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,152
Where could they have been?

181
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,196
Who knows?
Probably a secret rendezvous point.

182
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,782
-No way.
-That is insane!

183
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,826
My goodness. Two men together?

184
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,621
Is that why he is avoiding
sleeping with the Queen?

185
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,415
-You're right.
-That must be it.

186
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,208
-My gosh.
-No wonder!

187
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,793
-It all makes sense now.
-No way.

188
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,211
-No wonder.
-My gosh.

189
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,716
Get back to work.

190
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,058
His Majesty sees Scribe Jung in private?

191
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,477
Someone saw them again

192
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,813
returning to the palace
at the crack of dawn today.

193
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,358
But they seemed like more
than just a monarch

194
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,943
and his loyal servant.

195
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,070
That is because…

196
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:50,077
a scribe is meant
to serve His Majesty in close proximity.

197
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,124
Is it not odd that he requests two sets
of bedding when you sleep together?

198
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,711
Is it possible
His Majesty prefers men to women?

199
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,717
I told you that in confidence!

200
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,344
But--

201
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,222
I have been fond of you
since before I came here.

202
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,265
You should not relay
such ridiculous rumors.

203
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,358
It is preposterous.

204
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,237
His Majesty obviously
cares a lot about me.

205
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,656
You saw for yourself.

206
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,492
He sent refreshments
to enjoy with my friend.

207
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,787
But Scribe Jung was also present.

208
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,705
That…

209
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,338
If you ever relay
such an asinine rumor again,

210
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,382
I will have you dismissed.

211
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,181
What? His Majesty prefers men?

212
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,143
Rumor has spread among the court maids

213
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,770
that he and Scribe Jung are intimate.

214
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,272
Silence!

215
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,024
Where you heard such a rumor is beyond me.

216
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,944
Look over there.

217
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,161
Goodness, look over there.

218
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,413
The rumors must be true.

219
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,915
There must be something between them.

220
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,917
But a man with another man?

221
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,461
Rumor has it
that they wander off together every night.

222
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,589
I wonder what made him that way.

223
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,136
What…

224
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,099
What if this leads to more trouble?

225
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,309
Let me think.

226
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,104
Scandalous rumors regarding His Majesty
and a Seungjeongwon scribe?

227
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,230
This must be stopped.

228
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,317
It will be over for us
if this rumor spreads.

229
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,485
This must be stopped!

230
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,156
Jil-geum sought out
a herbal shop he suspected.

231
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:55,285
Kang Eun-seo will inform you
of their findings tonight,

232
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,037
so I will escort you to the shrine.

233
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,250
Your Majesty!

234
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,627
Your Majesty.

235
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,174
Your Majesty.

236
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,470
Chief Royal Secretary,
what could this be about?

237
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,472
Is there urgent business?

238
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:19,142
No, Your Majesty.
You must be out for a walk.

239
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,685
Goodness. Well…

240
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,438
What…

241
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,776
The weather is excellent today.
It is the perfect day to go for a walk.

242
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,571
Scribe Jung, did you not say
you had business to attend to?

243
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,365
I have yet to conclude my report--

244
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,408
Scribe Jung, we should talk.

245
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,203
-But--
-Yes, we should talk.

246
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,038
-Come on.
-So from the provincial city…

247
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,040
Well, this is a perfect day for some…

248
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,961
What is the meaning of this?

249
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,754
I have yet to conclude my report.

250
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,422
You should keep your distance.

251
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,799
What do you mean?

252
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:55,387
Salacious rumors about you and His Majesty
are spreading within palace walls.

253
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,555
That you are in an intimate relationship.

254
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,686
-What?
-An intimate relationship.

255
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,407
I did not think too much of it

256
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,993
and considered it gossip
that would fade away.

257
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,869
But if the Chief Royal Secretary knows,

258
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,872
it means that
all the other officials do as well.

259
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,629
You should stop seeing
Scribe Jung for the time being.

260
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:36,636
If this were to reach
the ears of Lord Sangheon,

261
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,349
you and Scribe Jung both
will be in grave danger.

262
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,825
You are headed to
the King's quarters unannounced.

263
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,452
What do you plan to do?

264
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,829
Is it to ask about the rumors--

265
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,914
I told you not to speak of that!

266
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,507
I just…

267
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,845
I want to see him even if it is from afar.

268
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,475
Only then will I be at ease.

269
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,110
What do you mean he is not inside?

270
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,364
He left to go out on a walk.

271
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,325
I see.

272
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,704
Do you perhaps know which way he went?

273
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,207
Forgive me, but I do not.

274
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,555
At the herbal shop,

275
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,225
I saw the man
who was dressed as a royal physician.

276
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,687
Was it the man whom you spoke of?
The one who killed Eunuch Cho.

277
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,775
Yes, he is a royal physician
who goes by the name of Seo Seung-gyu.

278
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,529
I clearly saw
the scars he had on his wrist.

279
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,114
Royal Physician Seo Seung-gyu?

280
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,368
If we can find sonangcho there,

281
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,912
we can be certain
of Lord Sangheon's bidding.

282
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,498
I will keep looking into the matter.

283
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:39,384
Royal Physician Seo Seung-gyu is
the one responsible for your well-being.

284
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,846
He must be stripped of his position
and arrested immediately.

285
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,267
If I were to do so,

286
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,894
my grandfather would know
that something is off.

287
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,524
For the time being,
I will keep a close eye on him.

288
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,486
That will probably benefit me.

289
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,031
-But--
-Do not worry.

290
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:08,705
I will have Eunuch Hong look
into his whereabouts.

291
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,418
We should go.

292
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:17,046
I would like to go back to the office
and dig more into the herbal shop

293
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,673
that supplies the royal infirmary.

294
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,302
You should head out first.

295
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,306
I will wait a while before following you.

296
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,728
Is it because of the rumors?

297
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:38,026
I apologize for causing
so much unnecessary grievance.

298
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,403
How could you be the one to blame?

299
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:46,659
Rumors like this do not faze me anymore.

300
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,078
So please do not worry.

301
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,917
I told you that I am ready to endure
all the consequences.

302
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,679
Still…

303
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,267
it will be wiser for us
to be cautious for the time being.

304
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,738
What…

305
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,869
Why are you taking
this dangerous path at night?

306
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,747
Which department do you serve at?

307
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,959
Follow me.
I will escort you to a safer path.

308
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,502
This way.

309
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,045
This way, ladies.

310
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,423
My Queen, this is not--

311
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,592
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

312
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,221
But I should head back to my quarters.

313
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,031
Forgive me for I must say
that the Queen is already in bed.

314
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,118
Should I request
that she get up to see you?

315
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,371
There is no need.

316
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:01,169
Please tell her in the morning
that I came by.

317
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,754
Yes, Your Majesty.

318
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,416
Yu-gong.

319
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,965
What happened today
should never reach anyone's ears.

320
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,883
Do you understand?

321
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,640
Are you all right, Your Highness?

322
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,648
I truly believed…

323
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,820
that I did not need much.

324
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:14,617
All I wished for was
for His Majesty to hold my hand…

325
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,455
and acknowledge my love for him just once.

326
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,921
I thought that was all I needed.

327
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,215
Your Highness.

328
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,510
But…

329
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,763
I do not know what to do anymore.

330
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,100
What should I do?

331
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:54,133
A wicked rumor has been circulating
in the palace recently.

332
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,429
I do not understand how it even surfaced.

333
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,978
However, I do believe
it is due to there still being no heir.

334
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,232
Are you distancing yourself from the Queen

335
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,401
because her father is
one of Lord Sangheon's people?

336
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,281
Of course not.

337
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,579
I see. Well, I am sure
you are well aware of this,

338
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,873
but the Chief State Councilor is
a terrifying man.

339
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,710
If the rumors spread
while you remain childless,

340
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,796
he might suddenly turn against you.

341
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,674
So I urge you to act cautiously.

342
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,677
Gwajeonbulnapri is what they say.

343
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,471
GWAJEONBULNAPRI: A SAYING THAT SAYS NOT
TO DO ANYTHING THAT CAN RAISE SUSPICION

344
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,815
It will not do you any good
to keep Jung Ji-un by your side,

345
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,650
so find an excuse

346
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,988
to remove him from the palace.

347
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:04,120
I apologize for concerning you,
Grandmother.

348
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,121
However…

349
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,291
I will manage what goes on
in my residence,

350
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,668
so please let your worry subside.

351
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:34,066
I gave orders to set up a tea time
between you and your Queen.

352
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,402
Being seen together often

353
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,989
will make these rumors subside.

354
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,784
You should go to her.

355
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,273
My Queen,

356
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,651
about last night--

357
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,488
I will not ask you for the truth.

358
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,993
I will not beg you
to accept my love either.

359
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,079
Just…

360
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,334
allow me to produce an heir.

361
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,595
-My Queen--
-I am the Queen of this nation.

362
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,891
As a wife and as the Queen,

363
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,102
let me at least fulfill my duties.

364
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,562
And…

365
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,483
I urge you to also fulfill your duties

366
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,027
as the King of this nation.

367
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,615
If you give me your word,

368
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,537
I will not question anything else.

369
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,058
There must be a woman you fancy.

370
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,022
What is the meaning of this?

371
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,609
A bizarre rumor about His Majesty
and Scribe Jung floods the palace.

372
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,196
Jung Ji-un is an old friend of yours…

373
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,367
so I say this out of concern.

374
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,538
A man in love with the King.

375
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,125
How can one even comprehend that?

376
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,504
If you came here
to relay such a preposterous rumor,

377
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,756
I would rather you leave.

378
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,677
I am hardly interested
in the words spread by clueless people.

379
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,100
Rumor has it that a man

380
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,437
resembling Lord Changun
was spotted recently in the Capital.

381
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,149
Would you know anything about it?

382
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:26,113
After all, you were the first
to inform others of his passing.

383
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,032
Now that I think about it,

384
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,744
no one actually confirmed
that the body was Lord Changun's.

385
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,705
The funeral was quite rushed as well,

386
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:39,251
which makes me wonder
if it was to cover something up.

387
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,381
Now look who's being preposterous.

388
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,299
How can a dead man come back to life?

389
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,968
You say you do not care for rumors,

390
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,971
but I guess that is not entirely true.

391
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,275
I would very much like…

392
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,321
to someday meet
the woman that ring is meant for.

393
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:28,384
Lord Wonsan, it seems that Lord Changun
has sneaked out of the safe house again.

394
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,639
Find him before someone recognizes him.

395
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,890
Yes, my lord.

396
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,106
You have no idea
how much I missed this place!

397
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,654
Do you want to hear something amusing?

398
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,740
What if…

399
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,076
Just what if

400
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,328
the king of this nation…

401
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,415
was a woman?

402
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:03,252
A woman? You must have gone mad!

403
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:07,673
-As if that could be true.
-What if the prince was born twins

404
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,426
and they were swapped at some point?

405
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,345
And now we have a woman for a king.

406
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,764
That is absurd.

407
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,142
But it is true.

408
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,060
Pour me a drink, will you?

409
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,063
What is your name?

410
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,315
-It is So-wol.
-What?

411
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,317
-So-wol?
-That is Lord Changun.

412
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,360
I had too much to eat.

413
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,070
How is a dead man…

414
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,552
Lord Changun died from falling,
did he not?

415
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,056
Yes, my lord.

416
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:01,519
Apparently, he has been spotted alive.

417
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,608
Look into it and get back to me.

418
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,235
Yes, my lord.

419
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,195
That reminds me.

420
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:17,451
Your son must have
the utmost loyalty for His Majesty.

421
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,706
Being seen so often
by his side in close proximity…

422
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,461
could very well lead to such rumors.

423
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:34,885
My trust in you is the only reason
I gave him a position at the palace.

424
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,223
Do not disappoint me anymore.

425
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,312
I will keep that in mind, my lord.

426
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,362
-It's him.
-He is here.

427
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,613
Are you sure it is him?

428
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,907
I honestly thought he would stay away.

429
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,951
Shut your mouths.

430
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,209
Allow me to take those
to His Majesty tonight.

431
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,845
Your Majesty, the reports are here.

432
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,189
Could we perhaps talk?

433
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,937
It will be best if you stay away
from the quarters for the time being.

434
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,690
Last night, Her Majesty the Queen…

435
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,070
Well, there was an issue.

436
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,365
His Majesty is feeling troubled as is,

437
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,283
so it would be much appreciated

438
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,702
if you refrained
from visiting his quarters.

439
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,041
I will do that.

440
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,112
What do you mean I shall leave the palace?

441
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,410
The Grand Queen Dowager
and the elders of the royal family

442
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:10,374
have been voicing their concern about
the rumors between you and His Majesty.

443
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:17,047
I am well aware
that I have no right to say this,

444
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,674
but…

445
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:24,304
if your love for His Majesty
is truly in the form of loyalty,

446
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,057
please…

447
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,185
leave the palace on your own accord.

448
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,731
Your Highness--

449
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,316
His Majesty should no longer

450
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:41,530
be frowned upon
because of the rumors caused by you.

451
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,170
You are home later than usual.

452
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,970
Work kept me at the palace.

453
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,848
Was it really the work
at Seungjeongwon that had you busy?

454
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,059
Pardon?

455
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,106
Of course.

456
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,860
Why do you ask though?

457
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,531
It is nothing. You should get some rest.

458
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,965
A marriage proposal, you say.

459
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,218
With my daughter, you mean?

460
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,512
Yes, that is correct.

461
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,974
You should leave us.

462
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,165
You must be very well aware of the fact

463
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,709
that she participated
in the Crown Princess selection.

464
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,464
That is why I do not understand
why you are suggesting this marriage.

465
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:28,971
Actually, it is exactly why
this matrimony could benefit us both.

466
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,183
Was this suggested by Lord Sangheon?

467
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,397
If you intend

468
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,483
to use this as a pawn
in your political game--

469
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,401
Absurd rumors…

470
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,780
have been spreading
within the palace regarding my son.

471
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:51,243
I wish to bury them all
with this marriage.

472
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:28,947
Father.

473
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,242
I…

474
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,204
wish to marry
into Commander Jung's family.

475
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,792
His son has had my heart for a long time.

476
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,422
My feelings for him were strong enough
to make me want to give up…

477
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,300
on being the Crown Princess.

478
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,260
So-eun…

479
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,805
Please allow me to marry him, Father.

480
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,531
I will ask my husband
to write the marriage letter soon.

481
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,241
Please take care of the rest.

482
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,827
Yes, my lady. Please do not worry.

483
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,122
I will prepare only the best gifts
the Capital has to offer.

484
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,375
What is this about?

485
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,796
You should get going.

486
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:30,342
Shall we?

487
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,975
A marriage letter?

488
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:43,689
Your father told me the news.
The bride's family also approves of you.

489
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,067
They will look past it all,

490
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,362
so please go through with this marriage.

491
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:55,117
I do not know what you heard,
but it is not true.

492
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,161
That is not…

493
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,080
who I am.

494
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,041
Then what is it?

495
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,961
How could such a rumor spread?

496
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,549
Start a family of your own.

497
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:14,594
That way, people will forget.
Marry the young lady and have a child.

498
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,556
Live a normal life like others.

499
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,851
You were the one who told me
to follow my heart.

500
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,270
I know. I did tell you that.

501
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,440
But this is not what I meant.

502
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,985
You might end up
paying for this with your life.

503
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,989
I can endure

504
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,868
the ridicule and humiliation
that comes my way because of you.

505
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,495
But not you.

506
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,874
I cannot bear to watch you suffer.

507
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,710
Mother.

508
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,437
Follow me.

509
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,991
You will not have to write
the marriage letter.

510
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,534
For I…

511
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,204
will not get married.

512
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,997
Your opinion is irrelevant.

513
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,959
The girl's family has already agreed
to the marriage.

514
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,173
But it is only a rumor.

515
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,884
Why must you take it this far?

516
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:36,802
Are you sure…

517
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,346
it is just a rumor?

518
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,269
I know…

519
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,605
that His Majesty…

520
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,942
is actually a woman.

521
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,241
What do you mean…

522
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:03,745
There is no need to lie to me
for I am aware of it all.

523
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,375
So do as I say.

524
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,418
If you choose not to,

525
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:15,882
I might also not be able
to keep this secret buried.

526
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,718
What are you saying?

527
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,389
-You--
-I will kill her.

528
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:27,477
Because that will be the only way
to protect you and our family.

529
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,688
Are you saying…

530
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:34,568
that you would commit treason?

531
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,363
How can it be treason

532
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,158
when the King is a woman?

533
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,246
You will go through with this wedding

534
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,957
because you have no other choice.

535
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,015
Lord Changun has been located, my lord.

536
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:25,118
-Uncle, stop!
-Would you stop if you were me?

537
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,536
I'm dead if I get caught!

538
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:46,932
Damn it!

539
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,024
Please spare my life.

540
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,944
This was all Prince Wonsan's doing!

541
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,863
He said faking my death
could lead to His Majesty's demise.

542
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:05,283
The attack on His Majesty's life
was also orchestrated by him.

543
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,202
It was not my idea.

544
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:10,956
All I wanted was to confirm
if His Majesty is indeed a woman.

545
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:11,873
A woman?

546
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:18,380
Right. Take me to Lord Sangheon.

547
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:21,257
I will explain everything to him.

548
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,929
What are you doing?

549
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,555
Why are you doing this?

550
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,110
I am injured.

551
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,448
Wait!

552
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,492
Do you not know who I am?

553
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,911
I am His Majesty's uncle!

554
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,882
Please spare my life.

555
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,093
Let me live this once

556
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,554
and I will do whatever you ask.

557
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,848
Tell me to do tricks

558
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,183
or to crawl on my hands and knees.

559
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:17,188
See. I am willing to do anything.

560
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:21,234
Please. Please let me live this once.

561
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,987
The truth you have discovered…

562
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,032
will be buried alongside you.

563
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,772
Why?

564
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:03,234
Do you think that I would
not be able to kill His Majesty?

565
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,948
Father, please.

566
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,494
After the wedding,
you will leave the Capital.

567
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:17,248
Be a physician or whatever you want.
I will not interfere.

568
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,086
Why must you go this far?

569
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,213
Could you just…

570
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,550
let His Majesty's secret…

571
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,553
stay buried?

572
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,473
Do you really not know what will happen

573
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,017
once Lord Sangheon finds out the truth?

574
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,064
Just do as I say.

575
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,024
Because if you do not,

576
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,403
I will not be able to protect you
or His Majesty any longer.

577
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,332
A marriage?

578
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:04,337
So-eun will wed Jung Ji-un,

579
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,674
Commander Jung's son.

580
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,034
No.

581
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,455
This is impossible.

582
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,662
Where…

583
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,749
have you been all day?

584
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,418
You were absent at Seungjeongwon as well.

585
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,214
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

586
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,093
I have something to tell you,
Your Majesty.

587
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,142
I am…

588
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,187
getting married.

589
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,073
But why?

590
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,662
If it is because of
the rumors spreading within these walls,

591
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,747
please do not proceed any further.

592
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,209
We both knew it would be difficult.

593
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,086
It is what I want.

594
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,051
What…

595
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,513
What you want?

596
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,643
How could you tell me such a lie?

597
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,772
Why on earth
are you going through with this?

598
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,482
Please tell me

599
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,986
why you had a sudden change of heart.

600
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:41,244
We have stayed strong together until now.

601
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,705
So why?

602
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,041
Is there a reason…

603
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,420
you cannot tell me?

604
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,257
I do not want to lose you, Your Majesty.

605
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:59,012
And this is the only way…

606
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,099
for me not to lose you.

607
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,686
What are you saying?

608
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,273
If you do not wish to lose me, why--

609
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,232
This is…

610
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:17,447
where I should stop, Your Majesty.

611
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,296
Stop right there!

612
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,426
I have yet…

613
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,013
to tell you to stop.

614
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:53,733
Stop!

615
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,655
That is an order.

616
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,624
Forgive me,

617
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,293
Your Majesty.

618
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,536
Are preparations for
the wedding coming along well?

619
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:29,746
Yes, Your Majesty.

620
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:33,249
How could you make her falter
with feelings as shallow as yours?

621
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,167
JWAJEON

622
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,209
How dare you!

623
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,504
Forgive me, Your Highness.
I told him everything.

624
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,923
What? But I told you not to tell anyone.

625
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,259
What are you planning to do
after you meet Lord Sangheon?

626
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,636
A woman cannot be King.

627
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,971
I will take back what is rightfully mine.

628
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:49,474
Still no news regarding the sonangcho?

629
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:52,477
I will do whatever is necessary
to protect His Majesty.

630
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,811
Have faith in me.

631
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,856
-Your Majesty.
-I will not die.

632
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,445
