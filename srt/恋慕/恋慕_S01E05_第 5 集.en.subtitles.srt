1
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,520
You never had to tie it yourself.

2
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,774
Please stay still for a moment.

3
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,841
How dare you!

4
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,469
Hyun?

5
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,263
Ji-un?

6
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,223
What are you doing here?

7
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,558
Wait.

8
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,311
Do you two know each other?

9
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,566
Well…

10
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,069
We're… friends.

11
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,822
Very good friends to be exact.

12
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,783
Friends?

13
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,162
How was your new lecturer?

14
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,290
He always looks for shortcuts and is sly.

15
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,501
He's more interested
in talking his way out of everything.

16
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,087
Befriending someone like him
only proves their priority.

17
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,672
No need to see anything else.

18
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,639
What? Why didn't you tell me sooner?

19
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,433
Not being aware of it, I…

20
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,685
Forgive me.

21
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,314
I didn't want to burden you,
so please don't be enraged.

22
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,151
Could it be…

23
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,655
that you two spoke ill of me
behind my back?

24
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,491
Only someone guilty would ask that.

25
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,955
Hardly. It seems like Your Royal Highness
is more guilt-ridden.

26
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,457
What did you say?

27
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,625
Please stop.

28
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,885
Lord Jaeun, it seems as though
you were in quite the hurry.

29
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,304
This one doesn't even have
a string of beads.

30
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,182
Which means…

31
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,018
that it should be reserved
for someone like me

32
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,437
who looks good in anything.

33
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,824
Wait. That book is…

34
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,120
It's the one I asked
Royal Scholar Yang to transcribe.

35
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,580
Why is it in your possession?

36
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,332
Actually, this one's mine.

37
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,084
As if. Please hand it over.

38
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,044
Why should I when it's mine?

39
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,337
Hand it over.

40
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,464
There is no need. It's mine.

41
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:20,301
-I'd at least like to check.
-But there is nothing to check.

42
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,054
-It's--
-Are you seriously using him for cover?

43
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,224
-Of course not. It's really mine.
-Your Royal Highness!

44
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,143
What on earth? My gosh.

45
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,563
I'll leave you to your affairs then.

46
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,483
But… Hold on.

47
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,579
Is this where you ran off to?

48
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,125
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

49
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,380
How is it that you weren't by
His Royal Highness' side to protect him?

50
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,132
Pardon? Well--

51
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,383
I apologize, my lord.

52
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,458
EPISODE 5

53
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,010
I want a distance of five steps.

54
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,262
But I cannot tell
whether you'll run off again.

55
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,016
We're at the palace gates,
so where could I possibly go?

56
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,746
I was blessed with your company today.

57
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:16,292
Nonsense. Thanks to you,
I also had a great time for a change.

58
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,296
Wait.

59
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,055
I suspect you'd have more use for it.

60
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:33,726
You should give it to the lady
that steals your heart.

61
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,698
Good night.

62
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,285
But…

63
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,540
Where were you earlier though?

64
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,750
-Can we please drop it?
-My goodness…

65
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,128
I looked for you everywhere.

66
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,631
If you knew how worried I was… My gosh.

67
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,841
Silence.

68
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,695
You seem happy.

69
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,906
Did you have a good day
outside the palace walls?

70
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,993
As if that'd be the case.

71
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,178
Is something wrong?

72
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,930
What do you mean?

73
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:57,268
You're blushing.
It seems like you're having a mild fever.

74
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,770
Nonsense.

75
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,273
Enjoying a stroll outside the palace

76
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,692
has elevated my body temperature.

77
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,451
That…

78
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,873
It has to be returned to its owner
at tomorrow's lecture,

79
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,417
so have it well kept.

80
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,919
Pardon?

81
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:31,093
I see. I will do as commanded,
Your Royal Highness.

82
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,374
Where exactly did your mind wander off to
while on the horse

83
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,502
that you made such a foolish mistake?

84
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,922
I… I apologize.

85
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,969
You haven't been yourself these days,
Your Highness.

86
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,983
You are my precious grandson.

87
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,570
It is also why you must be perfect.

88
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,155
Do you understand?

89
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,617
Yes, Grandfather.

90
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,575
I apologize. I am not familiar
with horseback riding.

91
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,619
I'm aware of it.

92
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,622
You must also have been nervous
in front of my father.

93
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,043
I'll ask Guard Yoon for private lessons.

94
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,712
You may not get as good
as your late brother,

95
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:16,008
but you must not let others
see any difference between you and him.

96
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,011
Yes, Your Highness.

97
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,429
Do not address me that way.

98
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,977
Your injuries look severe.

99
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,105
A change of clothes seems like a priority.

100
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,234
CROWN PRINCESS CONSORT HAN

101
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,198
You did not have to return it.

102
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,493
From now on, please don't do anything
you're not ordered to do.

103
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,495
What you did

104
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,206
may seem like a matter of courtesy to you.

105
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,709
But in my eyes, they seem like
unnecessary actions of flattery.

106
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,586
Flattery, did you say?

107
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,714
That is not who I am. Why would I bother--

108
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,841
It's why you shouldn't do it!

109
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,609
Was this always here?

110
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,363
Was it Your Royal Highness
who attached this?

111
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,577
Why would I? That was always there!

112
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,329
You could have just said "no."
You didn't have to yell.

113
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,455
When did I…

114
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,214
When did I yell?

115
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,595
That reminds me.

116
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,266
I can't believe
you're actually friends with Lord Jaeun.

117
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,976
It surprised me.

118
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:06,071
It means,
"Birds of a feather flock together."

119
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,951
Whatever. Let's just get on
with today's lecture.

120
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,625
It was just a joke, though…

121
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,044
How cold-hearted.

122
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,546
Icy-cold indeed.

123
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,276
What do you mean
the Crown Prince seems like a woman?

124
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,656
Are you not aware of the trouble
you'd get into for saying that?

125
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,491
It's not like that.

126
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,453
I'm just saying that

127
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,624
he resembles the court maid
I saw at the royal hunting.

128
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,167
It's the same thing.

129
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,004
No, what you're saying is worse.

130
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,172
His Royal Highness is sacred.

131
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,676
You must truly have a death wish.

132
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,806
You think so too, right?

133
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,704
What on earth happened here?

134
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,623
Why is it a wreck?

135
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,054
Father.

136
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,638
Yes, So-eun.

137
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,521
I heard you went to Minister No's place
to see Ha-gyeong.

138
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,565
Are you back already?

139
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,900
Yes, Father.

140
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,364
Father, do you perhaps know anything
about a clinic named Samgaebang?

141
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,326
Samgaebang?

142
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:03,624
I heard it was recently torn down
by the Office of the Inspector General.

143
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,961
What's with the sudden interest
in the clinic though?

144
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,091
You taught me

145
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,677
to always keep my promises no matter what.

146
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,517
Truth be told, I must apologize
to the girl that works there.

147
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:27,272
I promised the physician
that I would apologize to that girl.

148
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,525
So what are you saying?

149
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,403
Please help me keep
the promise I made, Father.

150
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,908
Could you see to it
that I meet the physician?

151
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,540
Reading all night will be the death of me.

152
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,506
Your Royal Highness, be careful!

153
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,262
My goodness

154
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,406
Who kicked the ball?

155
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,077
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.
I committed a mortal sin.

156
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,871
That…

157
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,041
That was admirable.

158
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,669
Your prompt reaction, I mean.

159
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,129
Thanks to you,
His Royal Highness was unharmed.

160
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,382
Don't you agree, Your Royal Highness?

161
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,641
Goodness me.

162
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,018
Seeing the ball…

163
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,355
brings back old memories. What do you say?

164
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,483
Would His Royal Highness
like to kick the ball?

165
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,696
Have all the fun you want.

166
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:26,410
Then why don't I warm up a little?

167
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,414
Why are you still facing down?

168
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,374
Come along.

169
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:44,261
-He's right. Go and have some fun.
-Go this instant!

170
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,387
Have fun.

171
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,495
My gosh.

172
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,019
"According to Zengzi…"

173
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,911
It means,
"On you are the eyes of ten men."

174
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,793
"Pointing to you are the hands
of ten men."

175
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,920
"So how could it not be terrifying?"

176
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,756
That is what he said.

177
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,139
DAEHAKJANGGU

178
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,393
It means,
"Wealth brings prosperity to families

179
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,480
while virtue enriches a soul."

180
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,369
"For a wise man,
it should always be true."

181
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,487
What are you doing?

182
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,786
You skipped this passage.

183
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,914
SIMGWANGCHEBAN

184
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,131
You sweated earlier!

185
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,842
I'd rather you stay away.

186
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,177
Oh, right.

187
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,562
It means, "Being generous

188
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,398
will ease the body…"

189
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,986
Would you cut that out?

190
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,655
I just didn't want to inconvenience you.

191
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:55,118
That is what you get
for running around with eunuch trainees.

192
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,246
Who knew royal tutors
had extra time on their hands?

193
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,497
But…

194
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:03,710
It's actually a way of developing
one's physical and mental strength.

195
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:08,006
As if you'd know though.

196
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,739
It means, "One can only rule a nation
if all is well within his family."

197
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,247
"All goes well
when one's home is harmonious."

198
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,416
Hold on a second.

199
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,379
Was that for me to hear?

200
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,841
To Your Royal Highness,
the palace is home.

201
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,136
So what could be more important
than understanding

202
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,264
the people within it?

203
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,352
So you're saying

204
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,146
that I'm clueless as to what is going on

205
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,233
in the place I was born and raised in?

206
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:13,029
Well, that may be the case.

207
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:19,077
Fine. Then let me show you in person.

208
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,704
Pardon? In person?

209
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,081
Let me show you

210
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,208
just how much I know about the palace.

211
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,502
Hold on.

212
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,630
While we're at it,

213
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,718
I'll start with the royal institute.

214
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,138
Your Royal Highness, wait!

215
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:45,979
You dare block my way?

216
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,355
No, that's not it.

217
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,365
Excuse me for a second.

218
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,869
Gosh, it sure is dusty in here.

219
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,663
-Nice!
-Okay, it's my turn now.

220
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,207
Please give me good numbers.

221
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,793
Yes!

222
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,088
I…

223
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,635
-Nice!
-Darn!

224
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,764
Your Royal Highness, please.

225
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,307
Your Royal Highness…

226
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,393
Your Royal Highness, this is wrong.

227
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,936
Please, Your Royal Highness.

228
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,482
Goodness.

229
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,194
Did you trip and fall?

230
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,321
Stand up. Get on your feet.

231
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,902
Could something be troubling you?

232
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,445
Who's troubled…

233
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,532
isn't me but obviously Royal Tutor Jung.

234
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,909
Pardon?

235
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,663
Since the palace is my home,

236
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:30,041
I should know about everything
that happens within the walls.

237
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,418
It's what he taught me.

238
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:37,090
So I decided to take his lesson to heart
and look around the palace.

239
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,634
Sure. Please go ahead.

240
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,183
This way.

241
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,686
How are the Confucian classics
being stored?

242
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,105
Didn't I request

243
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:56,276
the Confucian classics with footnotes
to be stored well?

244
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,779
Oh, yes. The classics.
Well, they are over here.

245
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,992
Here you go.
They are well-organized in this cabinet.

246
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:05,869
Don't!

247
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:14,794
Please don't mind him
and see how well-organized the books are.

248
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,005
Here you go. What on earth?

249
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,011
What… My goodness.

250
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:33,730
It's as you said. They are
being stored with the utmost care.

251
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,524
Please…

252
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,447
Your Royal Highness?

253
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,502
-We deserve to die!
-We deserve to die!

254
00:29:56,085 --> 00:30:00,590
-We deserve to die!
-We deserve to die!

255
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,886
I deserve to die, Your Royal Highness!

256
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,935
-We deserve to die!
-We deserve to die!

257
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,067
The royal infirmary is responsible
for the well-being of palace residents,

258
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,402
but not even the herbs
are properly stored.

259
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,740
-We deserve to die!
-We deserve to die!

260
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:30,203
Just as you wish, you will take

261
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,788
your last breaths today!

262
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,184
What is going on here?

263
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,812
With his lecturer, His Royal Highness

264
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,690
is conducting an inspection
throughout the palace.

265
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,485
What? An inspection?

266
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,977
Are you all right?

267
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,271
Yes, my lord.

268
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,790
Is that you, Commander Yoon?

269
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,003
Your Royal Highness.

270
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,675
What are you doing here?

271
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,013
I heard you were conducting inspections.

272
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,392
Oh, that. I wouldn't call it
an inspection, per se.

273
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,936
It's part of my lesson today.

274
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,780
I must get back since His Majesty awaits.

275
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,544
Who takes that long on a toilet break?

276
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,380
Drink a lot of water when you can.

277
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,674
I speak from experience when I say I know…

278
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,468
the pain.

279
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,608
Where is your sense of hygiene?

280
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,778
Your Royal Highness, you see…

281
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,363
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

282
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,366
My hands are dirty because…

283
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,009
This seems…

284
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,345
like enough, Your Royal Highness.

285
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,892
Why is that? Please don't tell me
you are already worn out.

286
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,979
That is not what I mean.

287
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,111
Could I perhaps ask you
to accompany me somewhere?

288
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,075
And where would that be?

289
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,054
Isn't it splendid?

290
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,729
Why did you bring me here out of the blue?

291
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,857
Because…

292
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,485
you can see every corner
of the palace from here.

293
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,776
Do you perhaps know what these are?

294
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,365
They're daisies.

295
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,283
That is correct.

296
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,078
Daisies are easy to find

297
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,122
which is why it's commonly used
for medicinal purposes.

298
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:34,835
The dirt covering the roots
can't easily be washed off

299
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,005
and they must be scraped off
in order to be cleaned

300
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,634
which means that one's nails
always have dirt underneath them.

301
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,805
No matter how hard you try,
you cannot scrape them clean.

302
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,061
Are you saying this because of
my actions at the royal kitchen?

303
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,314
That I scolded her without knowing better?

304
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,943
Of course not.

305
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,782
What I want to say
is that they are human too

306
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,702
and cannot always be perfect.

307
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,456
Rather than scolding others
depending on what you see and assume,

308
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,959
why not trust

309
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:20,798
the loyalty and love they have
toward you and the people?

310
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:28,306
Every day, they try their best
to be of service to you and His Majesty.

311
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,891
And they probably

312
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,520
care for the people of Joseon
more than anyone.

313
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,564
MEDICINE

314
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,780
Not the palace itself,
but the people within the walls.

315
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,533
That is what I wanted you to see,

316
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,911
but you couldn't be patient enough.

317
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,379
You sure are naive.

318
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,593
Trust people's love and loyalty,
you suggest?

319
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,723
Human emotions are the hardest to trust.

320
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,768
Deceiving others for selfish reasons

321
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,813
and killing others to protect oneself.

322
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,818
That is human nature.

323
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,540
You are not to worry about other people.
Think only about yourself.

324
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,336
They must know their place.

325
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,923
Make them fear you.

326
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,759
So don't let them get close to you.

327
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,845
Only then will you survive.

328
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,061
For once at least,

329
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,148
can't you put your trust in others?

330
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,194
Not for anyone else, but for yourself.

331
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,906
For Your Royal Highness.

332
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,088
Don't distance yourself too much.

333
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,424
It'll only make you lonelier.

334
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,067
What's with the ruckus?

335
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:52,992
One of the court maids
must have had a dizzy spell.

336
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,911
Please don't mind her
and head back to your chambers.

337
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:18,809
Take her to her chambers
and have a physician look at her.

338
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,020
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

339
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,245
You should go with her too.

340
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,997
Pardon?

341
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,710
But I should be serving you
at your chambers.

342
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,254
As if you'll be of any help.

343
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:51,258
Thanks to you all
succumbing to fatigue so easily,

344
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,552
I'm not able to read my books in peace.

345
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,805
I do not wish to be bothered
by such instances,

346
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,935
so leave my chambers
and stay out of my sight tonight.

347
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,770
But Your Royal Highness…

348
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,731
That can't be allowed.

349
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,024
Yes, it can.

350
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,029
If you are that worried,

351
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,534
you two may stay and guard my chambers.

352
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,711
You are all dismissed.

353
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,924
Leave!

354
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,496
MILITARY SERVICE DIRECTORY

355
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:14,466
KIM GA-ON FROM UIRYEONG
JOINED THE MUNICIPAL ARMY AT 17

356
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,258
My lord!

357
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,509
-Goodness.
-Oh, no!

358
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,553
-Someone please help.
-Look.

359
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,727
How could this be?

360
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,868
One.

361
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,746
Two.

362
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,207
Three.

363
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,020
What do you mean Un-am is dead?

364
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,065
It's the second incident this month.

365
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,942
He's the second man to die

366
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,986
out of those who testified against
Preceptor Kang ten years ago.

367
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,866
They say he hanged himself,

368
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,536
but it doesn't seem that way to me.

369
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:12,209
I thought you'd have information
regarding this case,

370
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,087
but I must have been wrong.

371
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,050
It has been ten years…

372
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,886
since you have come to see me.

373
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,184
Never did I expect a heartfelt reunion
with a fellow classmate,

374
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,812
but greetings could have been exchanged.

375
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,607
I doubt you care about how I am doing.

376
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,235
Jung Ji-un, is it?

377
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:42,406
I heard your son
was appointed as a royal tutor.

378
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,953
If he takes after
how you were in your youth,

379
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:53,167
he will serve greatly
as the Crown Prince's tutor.

380
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,964
I robbed you of precious minutes.

381
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,301
I apologize for any inconvenience.

382
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,945
What about what I asked you to look into?

383
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,740
He's the son of Inspector Jung Seok-jo.

384
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,618
He replaced one of the royal preceptors
as a royal tutor.

385
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,328
The son of the Inspector?

386
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,955
That means
he's one of Lord Sangheon's people.

387
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,249
Darn.

388
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,169
-It must be why they are friends.
-Friends?

389
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,426
From the age where the Crown Prince
should have been chasing skirts,

390
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,638
he started pulling away from people.

391
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,725
So a male friend he meets secretly?

392
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,230
Don't you find that odd?

393
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,649
I don't think I follow.

394
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,612
Could the Crown Prince…

395
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,532
-like men?
-Pardon?

396
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:12,538
-That's absurd.
-Gosh, why did I never think of this?

397
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,667
It's more than unusual
for a man of his age

398
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,211
to not fool around with a girl.

399
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,506
He even lives in a palace
where he can have his choice of women.

400
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,466
But still, that's…

401
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,597
What?

402
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,476
What is this?

403
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,025
If it's not men he likes,

404
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,445
then he won't be able to resist women

405
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,782
once he's intoxicated by this scent.

406
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,788
JASEONDANG

407
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,714
Your Royal Highness,
your bath has been drawn.

408
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,133
Okay.

409
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,141
Your Royal Highness,

410
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,894
maybe it'll be a good idea
to skip your bath tonight.

411
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,654
No.

412
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,992
It's not just today
he'll be guarding my chambers,

413
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,328
so I can't avoid him forever.

414
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,247
You're not wrong.

415
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,082
However…

416
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,316
This is where you will wait.

417
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,663
You may leave as well.

418
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,206
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

419
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:33,762
I will serve His Royal Highness from here,
so see to it that his bed is made.

420
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,806
-Yes, Court Lady Kim.
-Yes, Court Lady Kim.

421
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,244
Why is the smoke heavier than usual?

422
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,874
What is that smell?

423
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,649
What is the meaning of this?

424
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,651
Your Royal Highness!

425
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,666
You…

426
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,085
What on earth are you doing in here?

427
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,712
Well,

428
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,882
an incense that elevates a man's vigor…

429
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:55,844
I mean, this was only to help you
regain your strength and energy…

430
00:50:55,927 --> 00:51:00,223
How dare you!
Who gave you this preposterous order?

431
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,017
Well…

432
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,188
I deserve to die!

433
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:10,567
It was, in fact,
Lord Changun who gave the order.

434
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,239
He said it would get me
in Your Royal Highness' favor.

435
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,878
Please forgive me, Queen Dowager.

436
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:34,007
I was only worried for the Crown Prince's
lack of interest in women.

437
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,718
In the name of being a loyal subject--

438
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,564
How can you be this immature?

439
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,610
How can I possibly face His Majesty now?

440
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,821
I apologize.

441
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,781
Beg for His Royal Highness' forgiveness.

442
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:01,743
Beg until your knees ache
and your hands burn like fire.

443
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:02,702
Do you hear me?

444
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,038
Over such a frivolous incident?

445
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,916
But what about my dignity as his uncle?

446
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,126
I will get on it right away.

447
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,506
Off I go.

448
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:24,099
Your gift was much appreciated.

449
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:30,772
If that were the case,
why didn't you embrace her warmth?

450
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:37,362
How could I possibly feel the warmth
of the woman you had your share of first?

451
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:41,032
That would be a mortal sin.

452
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,368
Hardly.

453
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:48,123
It is not what I intended
and I feel gravely ashamed

454
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,959
of my impertinence.

455
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,461
You are sorry?

456
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:03,263
Did you forget how I warned you

457
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,141
not to get cheeky with me?

458
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:16,443
Don't tell me you're still upset about
what happened during the royal hunting.

459
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:20,864
Come on. That's all in the past now.

460
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,576
I doubt anyone saw.

461
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,287
And bringing up that incident

462
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,332
wouldn't actually be in your favor.

463
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,549
Lord Sangheon.

464
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,849
Lord Sangheon.

465
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:53,063
I should have had you buried when the
former king was put to rest, you imbecile.

466
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,941
-Imbecile?
-You dare tried to murder the Crown Prince

467
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,777
under the protection of the Queen Dowager?

468
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:04,616
Murder him? That's absurd. I just…

469
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:14,250
Please forgive me, Lord Sangheon.
I have committed a mortal sin.

470
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:25,136
Challenging the authority
of the Crown Prince

471
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,264
is the same as challenging mine.

472
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,475
Do you understand?

473
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:33,770
Yes, of course. Of course I know.

474
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:38,733
This will probably be the last time
the Queen Dowager protects you.

475
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:44,656
Carry out antics such as this again,
hoping that she will shield you once more,

476
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,868
and your head will be separated
from your neck.

477
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:55,375
Of course.
I will keep that in mind, Lord Sangheon.

478
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:10,348
I will make a request to His Majesty
and have him be placed under house arrest.

479
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,143
Please let your anger subside.

480
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:16,187
Hold on a second. House arrest?

481
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,830
Your Royal Highness being this soft

482
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,584
will only hinder
your chances at being great.

483
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:44,090
As for myself,
I am not afraid to shed any blood

484
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,177
if it's in the name
of disposing of your enemies.

485
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,597
Whoever that may be.

486
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,570
Darn.

487
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,547
Did I startle you?

488
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:28,218
It is exactly why one shouldn't sin.

489
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,514
You must have lost your mind.
Lower your sword.

490
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,016
Lower it!

491
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:46,069
You… How dare you!

492
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,363
Harass the Crown Prince again

493
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,283
and my sword will do more
than just cut off a few beads.

494
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,452
Do you understand?

495
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,169
Do you expect to live to tell the tale

496
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,588
after mistreating
the Crown Prince's uncle?

497
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,591
Nothing happened to Lord Sangheon,

498
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:13,721
so why would I be in trouble?

499
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,227
It's not like anyone saw me.

500
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:29,654
His Royal Highness is too noble
to play childish games with you,

501
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,828
but I'd gladly welcome them at any time.

502
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:43,793
What? Childish games?

503
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,546
That little prick.

504
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,592
Darn it!

505
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,773
I am not afraid to shed any blood

506
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,902
if it's in the name
of disposing of your enemies.

507
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,070
Whoever that may be.

508
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,415
You must still be in shock,

509
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:26,794
so how about you rest
before the morning lecture?

510
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:36,471
Because of the act
Lord Changun pulled last night,

511
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:39,307
you barely got any shut-eye.

512
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,101
I'd rather not rest. Being in my chambers

513
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,355
will only cloud my mind
with more unnecessary thoughts.

514
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:49,108
Exactly. Which is why a nap
could be helpful.

515
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,362
Are you worried
about having nightmares again?

516
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,825
Are you not going to move?

517
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,497
Fine.

518
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:07,377
Request for today's morning lecture
to be pushed back.

519
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,338
I will stay here and take a nap.

520
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,841
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
I'll be right back.

521
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,113
Where are you off to?

522
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:38,616
Royal Tutor Jung.
It's nearly time for the morning lecture,

523
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,287
but His Royal Highness is still
in his office. I was heading over there.

524
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,746
As you were, then.

525
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,711
Are you all right?

526
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:53,298
Yes, I'm fine. I must have had
too many drinks last night--

527
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,595
I'll go to His Royal Highness.
You should get some rest.

528
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,888
No, that's not necessary. I can--

529
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,959
Your Royal Highness, it's time for your…

530
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,630
lecture.

531
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,160
Could he have a cold?

532
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,671
Your Royal Highness, it's me.

533
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,133
Your Royal Highness, it's me.
It's Royal Tutor Jung.

534
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:06,889
Royal Tutor Jung?

535
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:14,123
Are you all right, Your Royal Highness?

536
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:06,551
Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un is in fact
Samgaebang's real physician?

537
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,302
-No.
-Your Royal Highness!

538
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,179
Why do you have this book?

539
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:14,308
That girl must have been
someone quite special to you.

540
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,810
She was my first love.

541
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,478
You have a big problem!

542
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,690
The Minister of Personnel
lodged an appeal for your resignation.

543
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,525
He deceived me and the Crown Prince.

544
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:24,068
The degree of his crime is quite severe.

545
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,236
I'm in need of your help.

546
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:27,572
You are the only person
who can help me now.

547
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,490
There is nothing I can do for you.

548
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:32,118
So I advise you to stop asking.

549
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:37,206
