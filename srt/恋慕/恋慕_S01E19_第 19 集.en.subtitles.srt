1
00:00:54,429 --> 00:01:00,769
YEON-SEON

2
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,174
Dam-i.

3
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,409
Is it you, Your Majesty?

4
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,457
Are you Dam-i?

5
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,488
Why did you never tell me?

6
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,077
Why did you not tell me
that you are Dam-i?

7
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,959
That is not important

8
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,045
now that we are…

9
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,763
together.

10
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,938
I could not bear to see you get hurt

11
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,274
because of me.

12
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,529
And I did not want you
to strain your relationship

13
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,698
with your father even more.

14
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,206
It must have been difficult to look at me

15
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,626
without getting glimpses of the past.

16
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,882
I am well aware

17
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,594
that you also suffered for a long time.

18
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,847
This was a path…

19
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,601
that neither of us chose.

20
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,607
So please do not blame yourself.

21
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,823
I…

22
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,827
looked for you for a long time.

23
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,998
I went to the bridge
whenever I visited the Capital.

24
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,046
Despite having a lonely life,

25
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,216
she…

26
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,056
never let it break her
and lived her life with a smile.

27
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,935
I wished for that girl…

28
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,647
to be happy…

29
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,277
wherever she was.

30
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,658
It is what I wanted for you too.

31
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,496
Those memories we shared

32
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,749
may have been what helped me
endure all these years.

33
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,627
I…

34
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,298
was happy to have met you…

35
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,426
back then.

36
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,850
And now,

37
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,730
you have come back to me.

38
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,899
That alone…

39
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,446
is enough for me.

40
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,825
EPISODE 19

41
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,833
You are like an angel.

42
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,878
Let me see.

43
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,130
It is a bit long on this side,

44
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,883
but that can be fixed
by taking it in at the waist.

45
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,177
That will not be necessary.

46
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,096
Pardon?

47
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,389
I do not follow.

48
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,850
You may leave.

49
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,190
-There is something I must tell you.
-Allow me…

50
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,526
to speak first.

51
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,364
I have thought about it,

52
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,994
and I wish to break off the engagement.

53
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,873
Agreeing to a loveless marriage…

54
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,170
will only create misery for us both.

55
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,260
I am well aware
of the fact that your heart…

56
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,388
belongs to someone else.

57
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,766
And our heart…

58
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,187
is not something we can control.

59
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,274
Especially when it comes…

60
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,027
to loving someone.

61
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,698
I am sorry.

62
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,743
I truly am.

63
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,454
There is no need to apologize.

64
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,666
For I am the one
breaking off this engagement.

65
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,671
I will let my father know.

66
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,192
I hoped it would be true love,

67
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,362
but I guess pain was meant to be.

68
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,158
The memories I shared with you
will remain as such.

69
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,078
As memories.

70
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,298
In the end, you chose to cause trouble.

71
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,721
Do you not care
that it could put His Majesty in danger?

72
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,348
Has it ever been your intention…

73
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,312
to protect and serve His Majesty?

74
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,022
What do you mean by that?

75
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,318
Why did you never tell me
that His Majesty is in fact Dam-i?

76
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,407
Did you really intend to kill her?

77
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,619
You killed an innocent court maid

78
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,912
and now you’re going after Dam-i.

79
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,834
What is the path…

80
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,920
you have chosen for your life?

81
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,507
What other crimes have you committed

82
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,885
that I do not know about?

83
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,263
What is it that you wish to hear?

84
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,810
I suffered for a long time
because I could not forget

85
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,356
the loving father that you were.

86
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,025
I also wondered meaninglessly

87
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,903
about what it would be like
to forget everything…

88
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,698
and go back to how things used to be.

89
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,702
I may not be able
to completely forgive you,

90
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,747
but I was at least…

91
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,461
starting to believe…

92
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,465
that I could finally understand you.

93
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,140
There is no need to.

94
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,853
These recent revelations…

95
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,982
only tell me
that I must do what needs to be done.

96
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,952
If you must assassinate His Majesty
in order to keep the secret buried…

97
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,835
your blade will have
to go through me first.

98
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,272
Ji-un.

99
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,398
Why did you not tell me

100
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,567
Lord Changun attacked His Majesty?

101
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,944
His Majesty did not wish to reveal it.

102
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,199
You were following the royal command?

103
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,656
So this is how it will be?

104
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,383
Do tell.

105
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,388
What use could you possibly be to me?

106
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:54,476
I'll be of help
in any way you want, of course.

107
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,273
I have someone on Hyun's tail.

108
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,067
No one will move as quickly as him

109
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,195
when it comes to His Majesty,

110
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,741
so maybe that could be of use to you.

111
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,551
Your Majesty!

112
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,804
Why did you kill Eunuch Cho?

113
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,850
How…

114
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,854
could you even ask me that?

115
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,357
Speak the truth this very moment

116
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,860
and I will at least let you live.

117
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,490
We have evidence that it was you
who obtained the sonangcho.

118
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:53,410
So it would be wise not to play dumb.

119
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,089
Lord Sangheon ordered me

120
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,885
to take Eunuch Cho's life
after the late King's death was confirmed.

121
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,348
Since Eunuch Cho served
the late King for a long time,

122
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,225
he was at risk of

123
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,144
changing his mind at any time.

124
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,442
Please spare my life, Your Majesty.

125
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,696
Please do not kill me!

126
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,157
Do you know where sonangcho can be found?

127
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,788
Lord Sangheon…

128
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,418
would not have brought in any more
after the incident.

129
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,420
It entails too much danger.

130
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,135
As far as I know,
Lord Sangheon has the only batch.

131
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,892
You will go to Ganghwa
and escort Gyeom back here.

132
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,770
Once my grandfather learns
about my inquiries into the poison,

133
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,565
he will go after Gyeom.

134
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,358
Yes, Your Majesty.

135
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,449
I will think of an excuse
to visit my grandfather's residence

136
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,118
and check the poison myself.

137
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,703
If you go there,

138
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,581
Lord Sangheon will only
heighten security measures.

139
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,292
I will go instead.

140
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,129
But it is too dangerous.
You cannot do this alone.

141
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,089
Once Eun-seo returns--

142
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,716
You said so yourself

143
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,761
that Lord Sangheon will soon find out.

144
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,973
A covert operation is easier
when executed alone.

145
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,061
-But--
-I will not get hurt and leave you alone.

146
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,979
Have faith in me.

147
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,899
Scribe Jung…

148
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,736
If you are that concerned…

149
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,783
would you give me a hug?

150
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,176
Do not worry, Dam-i.

151
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,391
When I was young, a pretty little girl

152
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,770
scolded me for not training
in the fighting arts.

153
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,109
If only she knew
how hard I trained since then.

154
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,499
I will return unscathed, so do not fret.

155
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,255
Then I will return to the palace

156
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,549
and buy you some time.

157
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,640
What rumor?

158
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,478
Rumor has it
that the King was born a twin.

159
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,773
A twin who shared a womb with a girl.

160
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,530
Your Majesty, that is preposterous.

161
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,200
How could you believe such bizarre words?

162
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,660
You should never--

163
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,705
There is no need for you
to pretend anymore, Grandmother.

164
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,668
My grandfather let me know
the truth yesterday.

165
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,298
That I had a twin sister.

166
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,392
In the year I was born, those working
at the Royal Maternity Directorate

167
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,852
were all killed.

168
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,438
To bury the truth about twins being born,

169
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,650
everyone who knew was killed
and buried along with it.

170
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,029
Is that true, Grandmother?

171
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,158
How could you have told him?

172
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,621
All I spoke of was the truth.

173
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,583
We could not have kept

174
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,212
a secret of such magnitude
from him forever.

175
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,426
You must forget what you just spoke of.

176
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,846
Once people find out
that you shared a womb with a girl,

177
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,724
the authority of the royal family
will be heavily weakened.

178
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,977
Even worse when they find out
what was done to cover it up--

179
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,646
Saji is what they say.

180
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,149
It means that a secret between two

181
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,777
will surely be exposed to others someday.

182
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,448
The rumor has started
to spread like wildfire

183
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,742
and it will cause social unrest.

184
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,911
You must stop the rumor from spreading

185
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,288
or it will weaken your position
on the throne.

186
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,291
That does not scare me, Grandmother.

187
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,001
However…

188
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,462
what concerns me more

189
00:20:55,963 --> 00:21:00,425
is the hardship you
and my grandfather will face

190
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,971
when held responsible for what took place
to keep the secret buried.

191
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,099
You both

192
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:11,228
sacrificed countless lives for my sake

193
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:16,733
and must be held responsible
for such crimes.

194
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,739
But do not worry.

195
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,535
They are nothing more than rumors.

196
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,288
Unless my dead twin sister

197
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,291
comes back from the dead,

198
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,626
the secret…

199
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,463
will remain buried forever.

200
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,762
Of course.

201
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,309
A dead girl coming back from the dead?

202
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,649
If that were to ever happen,

203
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,030
I would gladly shed blood
on your behalf once again.

204
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,492
So do not worry, Your Majesty.

205
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,764
Lord Sangheon sends this.

206
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,903
My lord!

207
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,114
Let go…

208
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,533
Let go of her!

209
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,576
Drop your sword.

210
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,579
I must see Lord Sangheon.

211
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,541
-I will explain myself to him.
-That will not be necessary.

212
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,043
All he wants is your head.

213
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,801
Tie him up.

214
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,900
Mother, are you all right?

215
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,452
Mother!

216
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,500
-Yeong-ji, Jil-geum!
-Ji-un?

217
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,585
Ji-un!

218
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,629
-Get the door.
-What is going on?

219
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,088
My goodness.

220
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,721
Was it Lord Sangheon's men?

221
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,849
But why?

222
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,436
He must be aware
that I purposely kept His Majesty's secret

223
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,480
from him.

224
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,114
I hear he is in possession
of the sonangcho.

225
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,242
If you know where it is,

226
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,160
please tell me.

227
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,873
What do you plan to do with it?

228
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,959
I will expose Lord Sangheon's crimes.

229
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,504
Do you really believe
that could be done by finding some poison?

230
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,506
Our family is now in danger too.

231
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,842
So please.

232
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,261
You must tell me where it is.

233
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,066
Court Lady Kim…

234
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,202
Lord Jaeun…

235
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,769
Why are you taking it this far?

236
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,813
Please let us through, Jeong.

237
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,196
Lord Jaeun and His Majesty are close,
are they not?

238
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,907
His existence

239
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,660
will only be
a hindrance to what I have planned.

240
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:49,000
One who covets
the crown must be coldhearted.

241
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,254
One must have what it takes…

242
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,509
to rise above his family
and take their lives if needed.

243
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,846
Are you saying
I should kill my own brother?

244
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:09,729
His Majesty's most trusted eunuch
and court lady are being escorted

245
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,980
to safety by Lord Jaeun.

246
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,526
Bring them to me.

247
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,988
Then maybe,
I will give your offer some thought.

248
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,616
I am sorry, Hyun.

249
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,037
Resent the fact
that we were born brothers.

250
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,461
-Lord Jaeun!
-Lord Jaeun!

251
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,514
My lord…

252
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,312
No!

253
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,361
Lord Jaeun…

254
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,157
Consider this my last brotherly act.

255
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,284
Do not…

256
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,662
show your face again.

257
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,584
Move out.

258
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,839
Lord Jaeun!

259
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,591
Lord Jaeun!

260
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,374
You will find it in Lord Sangheon's study.

261
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,294
I hear that it is
where valuables are kept.

262
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,047
Search for the blue incense box.

263
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,966
You will find the sonangcho inside.

264
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,831
I see you made it out alive.

265
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,173
Please forgive me, my lord.

266
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,636
I cannot end things this way.

267
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,973
Please give me another chance.

268
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,185
Your error is too grave for me to pardon.

269
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,356
By not being able
to properly eliminate the girl,

270
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,942
you have hindered my original plan.

271
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,902
On top of that,

272
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,489
you tried to keep
the truth hidden from me.

273
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,411
Then at least…

274
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,455
let my family live.

275
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,798
So you say you are aware
of His Majesty's plan.

276
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,300
His Majesty…

277
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,387
will expose the private army
you are forming in Yeoyeon

278
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,974
and then pass the throne
to Prince Jehyeon.

279
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,354
She hopes to hide her identity as a woman

280
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,856
and abdicate the throne?

281
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,033
Thief!

282
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,036
What is this ruckus?

283
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:32,343
Is this how you are returning
the favor I've bestowed upon you?

284
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,896
Stop!

285
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,153
Father?

286
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,495
If anyone moves,

287
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,165
I will slit his throat!

288
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,466
Get out of here.

289
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,554
-But Father…
-Do not complicate things any further.

290
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,847
Leave!

291
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,652
Father!

292
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,469
Scribe Jung?

293
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,054
Scribe Jung.

294
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,228
You owe me, Lord Sangheon.

295
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,034
But this is urgent.

296
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,911
Please let me inside.

297
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,955
This information must reach His Majesty.

298
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,207
Nothing could be of more urgency!

299
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,085
As if someone like you
could have urgent news for the King.

300
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:35,049
If Ji-un does not return
to the palace in one hour,

301
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,261
you are to inform His Majesty.

302
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:39,762
You must…

303
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,098
relay this information.

304
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,058
I am counting on you.

305
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,983
Please let me in. Just this once.

306
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:53,734
Jil-geum?

307
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,695
What are you doing here?

308
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,989
Chun-saeng!

309
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,534
-Chun-saeng.
-What is the matter?

310
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,329
Are you crying?

311
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,606
Hyun!

312
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,902
Hyun?

313
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,278
Hyun!

314
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,780
Hyun…

315
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,200
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

316
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,996
I was unable to protect them.

317
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,042
Hyun, what on earth…

318
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,794
Bring the royal physician!

319
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,921
Yes, Your Majesty!

320
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,881
Hyun…

321
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,343
What happened?

322
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,417
You and your son…

323
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,130
risked your lives just for this?

324
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,851
You fool.

325
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,146
You said you wanted
to protect your family.

326
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,899
Is this what you meant by that?

327
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,572
Since he is
the son you so wished to protect,

328
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,492
I will let you watch his last moments.

329
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,801
No!

330
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,177
You should kill me instead!

331
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,013
He has done nothing wrong!

332
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,266
No!

333
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,730
No!

334
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,405
Reveal yourselves!

335
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,099
Any man who stands against my royal guards

336
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,934
will be considered a traitor!

337
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,068
-Your Majesty?
-Your Majesty!

338
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,117
What is the meaning of this, Your Majesty?

339
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:34,872
You took the words
right out of my mouth, Grandfather.

340
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,251
How dare you hold my eunuch
and commander against their will

341
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,420
at your private residence.

342
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,383
This is clearly treason.

343
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,051
Treason?

344
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,137
You of all people…

345
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,350
dare to say that word?

346
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:04,902
Yes.

347
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,572
Standing against me, the King,

348
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,491
makes you a traitor.

349
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,119
The King?

350
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,628
And this…

351
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,714
is evidence of that.

352
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,053
What are you waiting for?

353
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:35,057
Arrest Lord Sangheon and his men
on charges of high treason!

354
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,392
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

355
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,695
You are making a big mistake,
Your Majesty.

356
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,197
The one who has erred is you, Grandfather.

357
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,575
Am I wrong?

358
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,330
Let's go.

359
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,048
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty!

360
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,052
I apologize for not coming sooner.

361
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:17,475
Please do not say that.
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

362
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,358
Father, are you all right?

363
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,861
Ji-un!

364
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,029
Scribe Jung!

365
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,741
Goodness, look at you. You look awful.

366
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,455
-Ji-un, are you all right?
-What are you doing here?

367
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,207
Your father told me in advance

368
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,083
to escort His Majesty here.

369
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,255
-Commander Jung!
-Father!

370
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,176
My goodness.

371
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,434
Father…

372
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:59,618
Do you really believe you can get away

373
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,122
with treating me this way?

374
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,665
I do.

375
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,419
I have withstood
the hardships for this very moment.

376
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,129
You withstood the hardships?

377
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:17,886
What if I choose to reveal your secret?

378
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,139
What would you do?

379
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,433
You are a traitor

380
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,853
who murdered the late King
and framed the innocent.

381
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,732
So who would possibly believe your words?

382
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,277
They would consider it as lunacy

383
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,196
coming from a man who is about to die.

384
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,199
Do you honestly believe
that a mere poisonous herb

385
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,120
is enough to reveal the truth?

386
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,664
Yes, I will make sure it is.

387
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,168
A comparison of the poison
from sonangcho that you used

388
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,087
and the poison from busohwa
that Lord Changcheon allegedly used

389
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,050
will prove that the truth behind
my father's death was fabricated.

390
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,511
Royal Physician Seo Seung-gyu
who killed Eunuch Cho

391
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,139
will testify to that.

392
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,225
I also have

393
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,687
the ledger that confirms
your private army in Yeoyeon

394
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:13,025
that Officer Yoon died obtaining.

395
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,237
It is more than enough…

396
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,616
to expose your traitorous desires.

397
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:26,872
My soldiers are on their way
to Yeoyeon as we speak.

398
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,959
Every last one of your crimes

399
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,629
will be exposed

400
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,383
tomorrow at the royal court.

401
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,261
I expected no less…

402
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,181
from my grandchild.

403
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,978
I am proud of you, Your Majesty.

404
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,444
He poisoned the late King

405
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,905
and fabricated the evidence

406
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,074
which led to the death of innocent souls.

407
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,451
I hereby sentence traitor Han Gi-jae

408
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,370
to be executed by beheading.

409
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,630
In addition, Prince Jehyeon

410
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:19,842
who was falsely accused by Han Gi-jae

411
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:23,637
as well as Royal Preceptor Kang Hwa-gil
who was framed and executed for treason

412
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,223
will reclaim their titles

413
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:30,352
in hopes that
this will appease their sorrows.

414
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:31,979
Let them enter.

415
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,307
You will abdicate the throne?

416
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,102
That is correct.
I will be passing the throne

417
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,688
to Prince Jehyeon.

418
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,356
But why?

419
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,359
Where is this even coming from?

420
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,868
That night in the year of Sinsa,

421
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,663
the twin sister

422
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,208
did not die.

423
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:48,388
GANGNYEONGJEON

424
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,309
She returned to the palace as a court maid

425
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,811
at the age of 12.

426
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,982
After figuring out the truth,

427
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,110
my grandfather secretly
ordered her murder,

428
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,864
but the older brother
who had swapped places with her…

429
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,368
was killed in her place.

430
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,166
What are you saying?

431
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,962
What on earth are you talking about?

432
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,297
I am…

433
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,008
his twin sister.

434
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,894
Please bear with me until
Lord Sangheon's punishment is finalized.

435
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,854
Once I see the end of it,

436
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,608
I will pass the throne to Prince Jehyeon.

437
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,111
If you are to punish me

438
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,698
for deceiving everyone
and becoming the King,

439
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,243
I will accept it.

440
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,124
I will leave you and the new King

441
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,419
to come to a decision
regarding my punishment.

442
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,340
Your Highness!

443
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,926
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness…

444
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,678
Are you all right, Your Highness?

445
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,039
Have you finally come to?

446
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,208
Where is Ji-un?

447
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:09,321
His Majesty has exposed
Lord Sangheon's crimes.

448
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,783
Those who followed his command…

449
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,036
will also be executed.

450
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,832
Bring me fresh clothes.

451
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,295
I will inform His Majesty of my crimes.

452
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,092
As I…

453
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,178
shall also receive my punishment.

454
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,523
Take good care…

455
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,652
of your mother.

456
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,961
The attire suits you, Eun-seo.

457
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,854
You cannot pass the throne.

458
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,149
Please reconsider the proposition you made

459
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,693
to Grandmother.

460
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,029
Get on your feet.

461
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,907
You are the King of this state.

462
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:40,662
How could you possibly want me
to take your place?

463
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,751
My grandfather's crimes have been exposed.

464
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,504
In the eyes of the innocent lives he took,

465
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,924
I am not worthy of this position.

466
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,384
That position…

467
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,888
is rightfully yours.

468
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,183
If you are not worthy of it,

469
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,311
then who could be?

470
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:09,941
The throne is yours and no one else's.

471
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:26,166
This is not an order, but a request.

472
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,545
I know you will do right by the crown.

473
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,424
Please see to it
that our father's wishes are met.

474
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,427
Your Majesty…

475
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,125
I am here…

476
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,214
to disclose all my wrongdoings.

477
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,051
Are you seeking forgiveness?

478
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,932
I have no intention of forgiving you.

479
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:28,019
You took the lives of guiltless people

480
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,649
and even killed an innocent girl
while your son watched.

481
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,609
You also

482
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,195
killed my older brother

483
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,907
and the rightful heir to this throne.

484
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,326
With your own hand.

485
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,372
That is why…

486
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,834
even execution by beheading

487
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,795
is not enough to pardon your crimes.

488
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,755
I am aware of that.

489
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,307
I heard Lord Wonsan is colluding
with my grandfather.

490
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,934
I have sent soldiers to Yeoyeon,

491
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,104
so I am sending you there to supervise.

492
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:17,110
Nobody knows the land better than you.

493
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,282
Once you complete this task,

494
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,411
I will decide on your punishment.

495
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

496
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,443
It is my understanding
that you have the girl's body.

497
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,987
I must see her body.

498
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,115
No!

499
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,785
No, Father. Please.

500
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:10,121
-Why are you trying to kill her?
-This has nothing to do with you. Move.

501
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,122
Father!

502
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,291
No!

503
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,430
You asked for me, Your Majesty?

504
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,015
Yes, Bok-dong.

505
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,017
What can I do for you?

506
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,978
I have a request.

507
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:37,816
Arrange a date for a night with the Queen.

508
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,109
Pardon?

509
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,946
A night with the Queen?
What do you plan on doing?

510
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:54,541
Your father colluded with Lord Sangheon
to raise an army in Yeoyeon.

511
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,585
Yes, I am aware of it.

512
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,672
I am also aware of the appeals being made

513
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,551
regarding the removal of my title
and my position in court.

514
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,928
Any punishment

515
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,264
will be accepted with honor.

516
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,436
I will do what I can to stop your father

517
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,771
from being executed.

518
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,732
And you…

519
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,569
should leave the palace.

520
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:27,157
I will say
that you succumbed to an illness,

521
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:31,369
so live a new life away from the palace.

522
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,749
I do not understand, Your Majesty.

523
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,501
Why would you do that for me?

524
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,172
I promised…

525
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,468
that I would tell you everything.

526
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,763
I will tell you now.

527
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,639
I…

528
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,767
am not a man.

529
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:42,440
Your Majesty, how…

530
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:44,818
I am truly sorry.

531
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,490
Please forgive me for deceiving you…

532
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,618
all this time.

533
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,789
This is impossible.

534
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:02,877
This is the reason
why I could not tell you anything.

535
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,131
I am a woman.

536
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,510
It is why I could not be your friend…

537
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,889
or your husband.

538
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,853
The guilt weighing me down…

539
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,023
is what kept me from embracing you.

540
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,109
Why…

541
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,988
Why did you choose to tell me the truth?

542
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,240
Why now after all this time?

543
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,534
Why?

544
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,413
You should have kept the secret buried.

545
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,666
What if I use this against you

546
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:45,837
and blackmail you into
excusing my father's crimes?

547
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,007
What if I choose to threaten your life?

548
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:55,346
Then I will accept it as my fate.

549
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,392
The way I have wronged you

550
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,936
is greater than that.

551
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,857
My Queen…

552
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,944
you are someone I am not worthy of.

553
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,157
By no means does this diminish you,

554
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,410
so any resentment you have…

555
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,498
should be directed at me.

556
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,872
Father…

557
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,668
I hope you are well.

558
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,921
MEMORIAL TABLET OF PRINCE DOHYEON

559
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,058
Are you here to see your father?

560
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,309
Yes.

561
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,729
Did my brother perhaps pay a visit too?

562
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:37,282
He did three days ago.

563
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,784
Right.

564
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:48,459
Your brother requested
that I deliver this to you.

565
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:03,182
A LONG FISHING LINE PROPERLY SETS
IN THE WATER. ONCE A LONG-AWAITED RIPPLE…

566
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,978
Do you perhaps know where he went?

567
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,981
Forgive me,
but that I have no knowledge of.

568
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,730
This is where you were, Your Majesty.

569
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,654
Tomorrow, you will…

570
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,199
pass the throne to Prince Jehyeon.

571
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,578
It is a day I have been longing for,

572
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:08,539
but I cannot say I am in good spirit.

573
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:13,920
Maybe I am putting too much weight
on Gyeom's shoulders.

574
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:20,134
I am sure
that Prince Jehyeon will do great.

575
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,348
Commander Jung came to see me.

576
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,101
He officially reported his crimes.

577
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,439
I am aware of that.

578
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,277
I apologize…

579
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,864
for I have yet to forgive…

580
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,784
your father.

581
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,286
If I am being honest…

582
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,458
I may never be able to forgive him.

583
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,921
You do not have to.

584
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,883
Especially if it is for my sake.

585
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,971
No matter what you decide to do…

586
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,433
I will not resent you.

587
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,235
Your Majesty!

588
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:20,987
Your Majesty, my goodness.

589
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:26,993
Lord Sangheon has disappeared from
his prison cell at the State Tribunal.

590
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,453
What?

591
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:07,742
Goodness.

592
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,163
How could this have happened?

593
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,786
A long fishing line
properly sets in the water.

594
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,206
Once a long-awaited ripple appears,

595
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:57,458
many follow as they spread out.

596
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,794
This quiet night, the water is cold

597
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,963
and fish are all but biting.

598
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,507
So I come back to shore

599
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:09,637
with an empty boat filled with my dream.

600
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,306
MOONLIGHT

601
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,226
MY DREAM

602
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,645
It is not the moonlight

603
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,273
but his dream he returns with.

604
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:26,070
MOONLIGHT, MY DREAM

605
01:05:56,994 --> 01:06:01,999
