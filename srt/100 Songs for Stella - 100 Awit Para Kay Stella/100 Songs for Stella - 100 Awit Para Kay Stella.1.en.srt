1
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,813
<i>Idiot.</i>

2
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,415
But you are one of the most
valuable employees of AdvertisCom.

3
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,420
So actually the most valuable.

4
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:35,929
But the company refuses
to address my grievance.

5
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,352
Send a memo
telling them not to mind your stuttering.

6
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:47,106
So, the company really won't do anything?

7
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,069
Is that really the reason, Fidel?

8
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,867
You even used to join in the teasing.

9
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,087
You're more sensitive now because of that.

10
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,850
<i>Eyes, tired.</i>

11
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,352
<i>Brain, beaten.</i>

12
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,896
<i>Go home, house.</i>

13
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,691
<i>Eat, sleep.</i>

14
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,568
<i>Awake, get up.</i>

15
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,278
<i>Breathe.</i>

16
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,445
<i>Attack.</i>

17
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:39,450
<i>Over and over again.</i>

18
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,145
<i>Yaya</i> Mildred!

19
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,563
That's Fidel, my son!

20
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,023
Let him in, please!

21
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,066
Please come in, sir.

22
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,402
<i>-Yaya,</i> is that him?
-Yes, ma'am.

23
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,487
Fidel! My son!

24
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,283
Grant! Aliyah! Fidel's here!

25
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,958
Come on, Aliyah, it's your brother Fidel.

26
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,295
I spoke with your Uncle Bob.

27
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,048
You can stay here for as long as you like.

28
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,591
So you won't be alone anymore.

29
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:40,970
Unless you have
a girlfriend or a live-in partner?

30
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,309
You weren't at Papa's wake and funeral?

31
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,191
Because your dad's relatives
would only gossip about me.

32
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,777
Okay, hear me out.

33
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,073
Just the two of us.

34
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,663
<i>Yaya</i> Mildred!

35
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,539
-Yes?
-Fidel's dinner, please!

36
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,167
<i>Why make him sleep here?</i>

37
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,294
He's an idiot when he speaks.

38
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,421
It can't be in Aliyah's room.

39
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,798
What about my stream?

40
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,008
Okay, what if he stays here with us?

41
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,386
Where will you put him up, in my room?

42
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,847
Hey, Grant,
Fidel's your older brother, okay?

43
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,392
Says the one who left her own son.

44
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,981
Grant just isn't used to sharing his room,

45
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,734
but I'm sure in time
you'll be okay together.

46
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,779
I'll just go home, Ma.
I don't want to be a burden.

47
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:40,822
No, you're not.

48
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,115
Why did you…

49
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,744
leave me back then, Ma?

50
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,126
I only left your dad. Not you.

51
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,797
Because the life he gave me
wasn't the one he promised.

52
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:03,886
I was part of that life, wasn't I?

53
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,560
Are you disappointed
that this is all I am?

54
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,980
Son, no. Son, it's not like that.

55
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,189
It isn't like that!

56
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,860
I always have to prove
something to all of you.

57
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,238
You all exhaust me.

58
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,856
Yes, I'll be there
in about ten to fifteen minutes.

59
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,316
-The line's long.
<i>-Okay.</i>

60
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,400
Yeah.

61
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,869
-Hello?
<i>-Sis.</i>

62
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,329
<i>You didn't buy it.</i>

63
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,624
My credit card got declined.
I couldn't buy it.

64
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,751
-Please find a way, okay?
-Alright.

65
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,877
Yeah, okay.

66
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,821
Just a sec, okay?

67
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,785
Boss, congrats, looks like
everyone's enjoying themselves.

68
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,414
We actually have just a few attendees.
We'll barely earn anything.

69
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,584
At least we got the food
and drinks at a discount, right?

70
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,170
We just need good word-of-mouth

71
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,507
so that more people will join
our all-singles events.

72
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,843
Guys, did you see Clyde Pelayo?

73
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,763
He already registered online and
even paid, but I can't seem to find him.

74
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,557
Maybe he didn't show up.

75
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,810
What a waste, he's even a cutie.

76
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,607
Let it be.

77
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,693
It's his loss for not showing up.

78
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,465
Are you Clyde?

79
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,300
Clyde Pelayo?

80
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,596
Do you know me?

81
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,223
No.

82
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,559
I saw your photo inside.

83
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,230
There's really nothing to gain here…

84
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,949
You registered for our event, right?
Why didn't you come in?

85
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,743
I'm just not in the mood.

86
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,828
What a waste of your payment.

87
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,414
Just let it be.

88
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,958
I'm the one at a loss, not you guys.

89
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,466
If you still want to join,
you're welcome, okay?

90
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,100
In case you didn't know,

91
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,103
I'm also an upcoming singer.

92
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,607
I have two songs I want you to hear.

93
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,616
that's the one I'll choose
as my launching single.

94
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,702
Why me?

95
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,748
-I'm not an expert.
-Come on, please.

96
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,506
It's a bit noisy here.
You want to go over there?

97
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,765
The second one, let me hear it.

98
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,862
<i>Song number one, "How Have You Been?"</i>

99
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:37,702
<i>I stumbled by the bench we used to meet at</i>

100
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:43,791
<i>Your name, still carved, untouched on it</i>

101
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:49,255
<i>Time has passed and slipped away</i>

102
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,884
<i>Yet your memory still remains</i>

103
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:59,348
<i>And should our paths cross once again</i>

104
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:05,021
<i>I'll probably just say hi and then…</i>

105
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,190
<i>How have you been?</i>

106
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,990
<i>I'm hoping your heart</i>
<i>Has found the joy it was yearning</i>

107
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,535
<i>How have you been?</i>

108
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:27,335
<i>Do you still sometimes</i>
<i>Think of me as well?</i>

109
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,046
<i>How have you been?</i>

110
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:36,469
<i>Perhaps a lot has changed since then?</i>

111
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:42,558
<i>But if you ask me</i>
<i>Nothing much has changed</i>

112
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:48,939
<i>Through all the time</i>
<i>That slipped from view</i>

113
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:53,402
<i>It has always been and still you</i>

114
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:58,783
<i>And should our paths cross one more time</i>

115
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:04,664
<i>I'll probably just say hi and then…</i>

116
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,084
<i>How have you been?</i>

117
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,716
<i>I'm hoping your heart</i>
<i>Has found the joy it was yearning</i>

118
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,969
<i>How have you been?</i>

119
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:26,894
<i>Do you still sometimes</i>
<i>Think of me as well?</i>

120
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,271
<i>How have you been?</i>

121
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,572
which do you think will be a hit?

122
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,659
I can't answer that question.

123
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,079
But what I can tell you is
which song was catchier.

124
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,542
I found the first one kind of lame.

125
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,835
The other one is better.

126
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,713
The second one?

127
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,050
Who wrote that? You?

128
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,182
Yes. Me.

129
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:15,734
<i>It's been a year since singer-songwriter</i>
<i>Clyde Pelayo launched his debut single.</i>

130
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,487
<i>It has finally become certified platinum.</i>

131
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,283
I can't believe it.
I just keep writing songs.

132
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,368
Based on how I feel inside.

133
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,995
<i>Whatever the public wants,</i>

134
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,496
<i>well, thank you so much.</i>

135
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,000
I hope they continue to support
my upcoming songs as well.

136
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,087
<i>You're mostly making love songs.</i>
<i>So how about your love life? How is it?</i>

137
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,922
<i>Well, I'm single right now.</i>

138
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,551
<i>But there's someone I like.</i>
<i>Not from showbiz.</i>

139
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,637
<i>I'll let you know when we're together.</i>

140
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,808
Oh, so you have someone you like.

141
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,935
Stop teasing me about that.

142
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,066
Aya, how many attendees do we have?

143
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,572
Wait, weren't they 23 yesterday?

144
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,907
Well, here it is.

145
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,494
It spiked after Clyde posted
our poster on his "my day".

146
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,330
Maybe people think
he's our surprise guest.

147
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,081
The venue's capacity is only 30.

148
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,917
Should we do two batches?

149
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,543
But our overhead will double.

150
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,837
Ro, look for a bigger venue.

151
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,841
And, Aya, email our attendees
that we're changing location.

152
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,512
And here it is,
the most awaited speed dating segment.

153
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,138
How about a round of applause?

154
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,684
Remember, only three
minutes per round, okay?

155
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,270
And when you hear the magical bell,

156
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,441
that's the cue for the boys
to move to the next table.

157
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,485
-Is that clear?
-Yes!

158
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,986
Then,

159
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,420
Hey, Ro, thanks.
Even if it was super last minute…

160
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,339
Our venue looks great, perfect.

161
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,591
That's what we do in RainStar.

162
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,634
That's right.

163
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,512
Everyone who registered
arrived except this one.

164
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,639
Junjie Santisima?

165
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,766
Oh, that's Clyde.

166
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,102
Clyde?

167
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,729
As in Clyde? He's coming?

168
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,650
Oh, my gosh,
he's really courting you, isn't he?

169
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,653
No. He's just promoting a new song.

170
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,363
You don't like him?

171
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,449
Well, whatever his agenda is,
I'll support him.

172
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,201
It boosts our sales anyway.

173
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,246
Oh, there he is.

174
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,330
He just parked.

175
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,707
Do you want to go meet him?

176
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,292
Oh! Of course!

177
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,002
Ro, let's go!

178
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,059
I hope I'm not disrupting your gathering.

179
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,605
I'm single too,
so I thought I'd join you.

180
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,193
I just got here
and you already want me to sing.

181
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,945
Come on!

182
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,573
Okay.

183
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,617
If it's okay with your organizer.

184
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,951
Where is that person?

185
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,454
There.

186
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,915
Ms. Stella?

187
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,292
Is it okay if I sing?

188
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:35,893
Tonight is a very special night for me
because this is going to be the first time

189
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,229
that I'll be performing my
new song for the public.

190
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:48,113
Thank you.
And to make this night even more special,

191
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,741
I'd like to sing to someone
in front of me.

192
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,159
So I can really feel it.

193
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,412
Ms. Stella…

194
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,208
Would that be you?

195
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,001
Sis, that's you!

196
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,336
That's you!

197
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,337
Ms. Stella!

198
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,421
Sis, go on.

199
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,806
This wasn't part of our deal.

200
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,894
Okay.

201
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:23,399
I'm dedicating this song to someone
who makes my heart skip a beat.

202
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,903
The title is

203
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,155
"Black Lipstick."

204
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,419
<i>Song number two, "Black Lipstick."</i>

205
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:48,674
<i>From the start</i>
<i>You were different, I could feel</i>

206
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,930
<i>Tongue-tied and trembling</i>
<i>I lost what was real</i>

207
00:16:55,681 --> 00:17:00,477
<i>I get mesmerized by your beauty</i>

208
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:06,775
<i>They say you're cold</i>
<i>But they don't know why</i>

209
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:13,407
<i>Inside your heart</i>
<i>There's joy you hide</i>

210
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,620
<i>Hiding behind the…</i>

211
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:24,501
<i>Black lipstick, oh, your shadowed smile</i>

212
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:29,673
<i>Hiding the beauty</i>
<i>That held me for a while</i>

213
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,180
<i>Black lipstick, eyes that softly gleam</i>

214
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:41,643
<i>Even when hidden, they shine in between</i>

215
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:48,484
<i>All my life, I'll be caught in your spell</i>

216
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:54,364
<i>By rose-like lips that I know too well</i>

217
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:59,578
<i>Still you conceal them behind…</i>

218
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:05,584
<i>Black lipstick, oh, your shadowed smile</i>

219
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:10,839
<i>Hiding the beauty that held me for a while</i>

220
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:17,304
<i>Black lipstick, eyes that softly gleam</i>

221
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:22,518
<i>Even when hidden, they shine in between…</i>

222
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,563
<i>Black lipstick</i>

223
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,833
So, Stella?

224
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,085
Are you my girlfriend now?

225
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,170
Hey!

226
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,506
-That's embarrassing!
-Court her first!

227
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,468
Ms. Stella.

228
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,683
Can I court you?

229
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,985
I don't know, it's up to you.

230
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,996
That was just for fun,
don't take it too seriously.

231
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,708
If you're really not comfortable
with what Clyde does,

232
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,669
tell him you're not interested
so he'll stop.

233
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,215
Unless you're also interested.

234
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,518
Hey!

235
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,520
Wow, you're here!

236
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,564
I thought you didn't like crowds?

237
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,736
Who's the organizer of this event?

238
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,362
"RainStar Events."

239
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,948
It was short notice.

240
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,994
Good thing the Koreans backed out.

241
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,370
Why, Fidel?

242
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,247
Nothing.

243
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,708
I just saw someone I know.

244
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,001
Wait, hey!

245
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,046
Isn't Clyde Pelayo your buddy?

246
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,214
He's here.

247
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,007
Is that him?

248
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,508
Why don't you say hi?

249
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,554
No, I might bother him.

250
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,556
I'll just leave.

251
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,484
<i>Song number seven, "Really Now?"</i>

252
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,112
<i>Really now, is this how</i>

253
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,199
<i>Fate has let me down again</i>

254
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,118
<i>And I was just too blind to see</i>

255
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:50,916
<i>There's no escaping from your memories</i>

256
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:55,629
<i>We always seem to find our way back here</i>

257
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,382
Hey, bro!

258
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,509
You're here!

259
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,517
I'm the owner of Bale Ganaka.

260
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,437
Wait. Is this what it is?
You're renovating your dad's place?

261
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,274
-Yes.
-Wow…

262
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,150
It looks great, bro.

263
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,235
Amazing.

264
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,488
Who would've thought it's destiny?

265
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,992
You two know each other?

266
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,037
This guy, Fidel,

267
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,958
is one of
the most important people in my life.

268
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,964
And you,

269
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,051
how did you two meet?

270
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,554
At one of my events.

271
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,891
Stella here is my future girlfriend.

272
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,145
How embarrassing.

273
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,063
Here's how it went.

274
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,191
At the time when I was sad,

275
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,069
I was really down in my career.

276
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,279
You know how it is…

277
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,365
Stella was there to catch me.

278
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,286
It just so happened I was there
when he was sulking.

279
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,792
Wait, you guys…

280
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,796
How do you guys know each other?
What's the story?

281
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,970
<i>Song number eight, "Heartbeat."</i>

282
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:33,268
<i>My heart is pounding, beating still</i>
<i>From seeing you, oh, what a thrill</i>

283
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:40,859
<i>I could've sworn</i>
<i>I've left those memories behind me</i>

284
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,573
We were friends, before.

285
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,459
He was even my classmate.

286
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,594
<i>See, right!</i>

287
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:13,225
<i>That's what people get for joining</i>
<i>this all-singles event by RainStar!</i>

288
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,603
-Goals! Wow!
<i>-A round of applause for Marvy and Aiza.</i>

289
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,649
Lucky you, guys. Wish I had that too.

290
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,566
I wish

291
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,861
I experience that too, right?

292
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,245
This is my friend.

293
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,748
Actually, the very handsome proprietor.

294
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,416
Wow, proprietor!

295
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,752
Owner of Bale Ganaka.

296
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:45,423
It's Fidel Lansangan!
Let's give him a round of applause!

297
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,636
The question everyone's asking.
We're all curious.

298
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,847
Bro, are you single?

299
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,809
He said single!

300
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:01,064
So, for those who still
haven't found a match,

301
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,899
maybe you'd like to try Fidel

302
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,317
in speed dating.

303
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,988
Come on, bro, give a little speech.

304
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,408
Let me take over.

305
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,292
<i>Song number nine, "Déjà Vu."</i>

306
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:08,215
<i>It's like I've been here before</i>
<i>This feeling, the fall</i>

307
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,468
<i>But you'll catch me once more</i>

308
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,803
<i>It's like there's no fear at all</i>

309
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:18,266
<i>Feels like I've been here before</i>

310
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,149
<i>Song number 14, "Back To Where I Started."</i>

311
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,374
<i>Song number 23, "Memory Lane."</i>

312
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,105
Sis!

313
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,856
Sis! You're famous now!

314
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,900
-Quick, look at this!
-What's that?

315
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,403
The netizens are shipping you with Clyde.

316
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,864
And it's trending on X, #WhateverClyde!

317
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,616
Just say yes already!

318
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,037
If it were me back in college,

319
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,581
yeah, I would've done it.

320
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,835
Just to feel a little thrill,
I'd jump right in.

321
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,670
But I'm not a kid anymore

322
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,299
who'd jump into a relationship
just 'cause I got giddy, right?

323
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,926
So, you are getting giddy!

324
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,096
You're giddy!

325
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,602
Were you the one who wrote your new song?

326
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,939
Of course.

327
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,941
All of my songs, I write myself.

328
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,196
What was your inspiration
when you wrote it?

329
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,790
Why? Did I ever wear black lipstick?

330
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,210
No. It's like a metaphor.

331
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,673
Like, even if a person
has a streak of darkness,

332
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,925
you still like them.

333
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,512
-Black lipstick.
-So…

334
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,182
If someone's got black lipstick,
she's bad.

335
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,517
Not at all.

336
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,481
Let's hang out?

337
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,358
When are you free?

338
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,235
No, I'm too busy to go on a date.

339
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,029
Date, already?

340
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,573
I said just hang out.

341
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,372
Okay, I'll update you when I'm free.

342
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,082
Okay.

343
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,506
Fidel!

344
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,388
Hey, Fidel!

345
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,932
You have a visitor.

346
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,445
Is your event done?

347
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,114
Yeah, everyone left already.

348
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,698
Why'd you stay behind?

349
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,451
For you.

350
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,369
Of course.

351
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,749
All right, let's just talk at the Bale.

352
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,752
Auntie, please bring her there.

353
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,756
Doy, get her some coffee
or whatever she wants.

354
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,133
Okay, bro.

355
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,051
Okay, we'll go ahead.

356
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,994
I inherited this from Papa,

357
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,329
this property.

358
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,790
When he passed away.

359
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,671
I just had it renovated
and… rented it out.

360
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,759
At least you have a passive income.

361
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,511
Not just passive.

362
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,974
This is really the only thing
I keep myself busy with.

363
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,643
So you live here?

364
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,104
Yes, when no one's renting.

365
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,776
In that bedroom, the master's,
that's where he sleeps.

366
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,946
When there is a tenant,
Fidel locks himself up.

367
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,325
Oh, right, before I forget.

368
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,951
Ms. Stella.

369
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,789
She said she wants to
rent our Bale Ganaka.

370
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,666
If it's possible, she's
asking for a discount.

371
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,169
She said she'll be
using it for about five days.

372
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,379
That's fine.

373
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:03,718
Just talk to Aunt Jingrose instead
because she's the manager here

374
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,137
and also Doy, my cousin.

375
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,557
Oh, thank you so much.

376
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,354
That's it?

377
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,773
That's why you came?

378
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,402
You could've just emailed.

379
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,737
You're too much.

380
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,447
Don't you want to catch up?

381
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,783
It's been a long time since we've met.

382
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,577
Would you like us to eat out? My treat.

383
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,745
Oh, no need.

384
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,247
Doy and I have lunched.

385
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,415
It'd be better if it's the two of you.

386
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,125
So my nephew gets to go out.

387
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,044
-Is it okay if I take Fidel?
-Yes!

388
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,088
Thank you. Come on, let's eat.

389
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,173
-Stella--
-Show me around. Come on.

390
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,178
Is this okay?

391
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,930
Here.

392
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:49,848
What?

393
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,308
Us.

394
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,643
Being together.

395
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,314
Clyde isn't my boyfriend yet.

396
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,775
I know.

397
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,069
I'm talking about…

398
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,487
Vern.

399
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,698
Vern? Who's Vern?

400
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,241
Your husband.

401
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,493
It's Von!

402
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,536
Von?

403
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,497
I don't know where that Vern came from.

404
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,500
Nothing. We've long split up.

405
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,092
Since when?

406
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,760
It's been a while.

407
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,683
Why did you split up?

408
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,560
Because he's insane.

409
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,062
And you?

410
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,314
You're turning 35.

411
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,651
You don't have a girlfriend.
You don't have a wife either.

412
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,282
Marriage isn't my thing.

413
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,287
I've given up on dating too.

414
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,668
Why?

415
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,300
I'm comfortable

416
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,220
being alone.

417
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,808
Not worrying about anything except

418
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,477
myself.

419
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,397
Same here.

420
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,859
I'm content staying this way.

421
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,405
Content that…

422
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,366
that you're single.

423
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,576
Isn't it true

424
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,245
you promote

425
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,122
matchmaking and…

426
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,708
and… speed dating?

427
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,128
Yes, so what? There are
so many Korean restaurants here,

428
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,588
are they owned by Koreans?

429
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,675
So how did you

430
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,844
end up with that job?

431
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,517
Before I joined RainStar,
I worked at a call center.

432
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,436
But there were so many rude callers.

433
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,272
Then the last one yelled at me.

434
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,567
So, I yelled back at him.

435
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,653
Then, I got fired.

436
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,758
Clyde is so good at writing songs.

437
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,635
The way he strings his lyrics.

438
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,178
It's impressive.

439
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,305
Yeah.

440
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,110
That's you.

441
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,365
You're the one who can write that.

442
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,491
Clyde…

443
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,826
Clyde is what?

444
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:01,414
Clyde's the only one
who writes… his songs.

445
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,139
Don't you have feelings for me anymore?

446
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,059
Have you moved on?

447
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,067
That was such a long time ago, Stella.

448
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,029
So much has changed.

449
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,781
With you.

450
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,532
With me.

451
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,829
So, there's nothing anymore?

452
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,254
Nothing.

453
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,429
Aren't you the one with Clyde?

454
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,598
What do you mean?

455
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,017
The one who said #WhateverClyde.

456
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,311
Miss, can we take a photo with you?

457
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,605
-With me?
-Yes.

458
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,648
Bro.

459
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,484
<i>Song number 30, "Is There Still a Place?"</i>

460
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,281
<i>Do I still have a place in your life?</i>

461
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:24,789
<i>Especially now that</i>
<i>Your world seems so full</i>

462
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:29,252
<i>Do I still have a place in your life?</i>

463
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,171
<i>Is it really like that?</i>

464
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:36,342
<i>It seems you're slowly drifting away</i>

465
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:41,139
<i>So I just have to ask</i>
<i>Is there still a place</i>

466
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,184
<i>In your life?</i>

467
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,269
Bro, what the fuck?

468
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,856
All your new stuff is just
sad-boy, shy-guy songs.

469
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,524
That's not my branding.

470
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,031
Straightforward, bro.
No beating around the bush.

471
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,372
Sorry, but… it feels like
your new stuff isn't inspired by love.

472
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,750
Aren't you in love right now?

473
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:12,879
No, I'm not.

474
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,548
Have you ever been in love?

475
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,425
Of course.

476
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,759
Then maybe draw from that.

477
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,948
<i>Song number 31, "If You're Not."</i>

478
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,286
<i>If you weren't such a fool…</i>

479
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,706
<i>You should have said</i>

480
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,043
<i>What you truly feel</i>

481
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:58,382
<i>If you weren't such a fool</i>

482
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:04,555
<i>You should have taken a chance</i>
<i>Now there's nothing you can do</i>

483
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,604
<i>Song number 33, "I Wish You Let It Be."</i>

484
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:15,942
<i>I wish you let your heart be</i>

485
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,070
<i>Its beat not be locked away</i>

486
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:23,282
<i>I wish you had let it be, just set it free</i>

487
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,953
<i>Now regret's the only thing you can see</i>

488
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,917
<i>Song number 37, "What If I."</i>

489
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,220
<i>Happy ever after, after all</i>

490
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,860
No, it's still wrong, bro.

491
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,488
I don't feel the…

492
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:12,123
But everything I write is about love.

493
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,875
Is it really love?

494
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,296
Then what is it?

495
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,134
It's not love, it could be…

496
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,177
Fascination, no…

497
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,724
If it's infatuation, that's not it either.

498
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,145
Limerence, bro, do you know that word?

499
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,608
I've never heard of limerence.

500
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,278
The person
you're talking to in your songs.

501
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,989
What you have isn't love.

502
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,657
It's limerence.

503
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,201
It's all just in your head.

504
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,871
The meaning of those
moments you're together.

505
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,665
Your fantasy, that maybe
you two will be together.

506
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,544
Your disappointment
when she doesn't notice you.

507
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,963
But outside of your mind, in real life,

508
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,300
it doesn't really mean anything because

509
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,762
you don't have an emotional connection.

510
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:13,059
That's a heavy accusation.

511
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,395
What accusation? Bro…

512
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,691
Bro, I'm not talking about you.

513
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,195
I mean the character in your songs.

514
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:44,590
The last time we met was
at the foot of Mount Arayat.

515
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,467
Since then,

516
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,178
we never saw each other again.

517
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:53,682
Not even chat, DM, or call…

518
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,725
Nothing.

519
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,519
But why though?

520
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,854
You don't want to admit to Stella

521
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,065
that you wrote the song.

522
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,358
Well, Auntie.

523
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,986
I signed an NDA.

524
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,365
I can't go around telling people that

525
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,660
I'm Clyde's ghostwriter.

526
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,161
What will you do, bro?

527
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,164
Isn't Clyde courting Ms. Stella?

528
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,958
Does Clyde know you have a past?

529
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:22,545
I don't plan on competing with Clyde.

530
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,754
Yeah, right.

531
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,049
But Stella is the one
your heart beats for.

532
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,677
I think, bro,

533
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:33,305
you're scared she'll find out
you still have feelings for her.

534
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,016
Because if Ms. Stella finds out,

535
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,186
you'll hope again that
she'll reciprocate your feelings.

536
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,814
But what if it's just one-sided?

537
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,775
If she likes Clyde,
then you'll just get hurt again.

538
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,153
That's love.

539
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,488
It's a gamble.

540
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,995
Because you young ones, you know?

541
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,540
You let fear control you,
you give in to it.

542
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,836
See, Mom just dropped the generation card.

543
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:07,089
But if you both feel the same,

544
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:11,051
and what you let rule you
is fear instead of love,

545
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,221
then you'll never reach the next level.

546
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,026
Really, karaoke?

547
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,698
Don't you miss singing?

548
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,286
Well…

549
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,039
It's been so long since I last sang.

550
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:41,874
Why?

551
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:42,833
It's just…

552
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,377
Work alone already drains my energy.

553
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,130
Why so?

554
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,924
It's like you're not…

555
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,927
…you weren't the vocalist
of Tampururaught before.

556
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,013
Okay.

557
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,516
It's just us here anyway.

558
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,519
Even if you're off-key, if there's anyone

559
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:05,606
who won't judge you here, it's me.

560
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,568
Let's just do a duet, okay?

561
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,424
<i>And more</i>

562
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,968
I know what's next. Wait.

563
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,428
I already have my next song.

564
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,974
You're singing this one. Solo.

565
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,894
Just don't pick something high-pitched.

566
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,688
You know this one well.

567
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,984
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN
CLYDE PELAYO

568
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,861
-Just that--
-There.

569
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:53,821
You can do it.

570
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,909
No, I don't know this.

571
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,244
You don't know that song?

572
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,455
-You haven't even heard it?
-No.

573
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,124
-So you won't sing it?
-No.

574
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,002
I'll go home. And don't call anymore.

575
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,378
-No, don't.
-I'm going home.

576
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:14,633
<i>I stumbled by the bench we used to meet at</i>

577
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:19,680
<i>Your name, still carved, untouched on it</i>

578
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:26,103
<i>Time has passed and slipped away</i>

579
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:30,941
<i>Yet your memory still remains</i>

580
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:36,155
<i>And should our paths cross once again</i>

581
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:41,744
<i>I'll probably just say hi and then…</i>

582
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,496
<i>How have you been?</i>

583
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,130
<i>I'm hoping your heart</i>
<i>Has found the joy it was yearning</i>

584
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:56,592
<i>How have you been?</i>

585
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:04,433
<i>Do you still sometimes</i>
<i>Think of me as well?</i>

586
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,352
<i>How have you been?</i>

587
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:10,981
That's enough?

588
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,566
You didn't know that one.

589
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,405
-Can I ask you something?
-What?

590
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,827
Are you ashamed that you liked me before?

591
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,915
Of course not.

592
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:36,256
I'm more embarrassed by the things
I did back when we were in college.

593
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,801
Damn.

594
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,680
A hundred poems.

595
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:49,103
I even cringe whenever I remember.

596
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,773
Why do you cringe though?

597
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,983
You just loved, that's all.

598
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,738
But it wasn't really love…

599
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,868
what I felt for you back then.

600
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,421
What was it?

601
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,098
What?

602
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:31,854
I was only in love with the… idea

603
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,358
of… you being

604
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:40,821
my girlfriend… of you being my girlfriend.

605
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:46,493
Because I saw you as perfect.

606
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:52,458
To the point that all my endeavors…

607
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:57,796
Excelling in academics,
trying to look good.

608
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:03,635
Writing poems.

609
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:08,474
Helping you when you ran away from home.

610
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,893
All of that.

611
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,936
You…

612
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:13,896
You were the…

613
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,315
the end goal.

614
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,942
So when…

615
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,863
when you rejected me,

616
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:30,245
when you didn't return

617
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:35,542
the "love" I gave you,

618
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,587
it hurt.

619
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:48,972
How about you?

620
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,226
-How are you now?
-Me?

621
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,437
Are you happy?

622
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,647
Yes.

623
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:58,857
Yes.

624
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,070
And besides, everything I need
to survive, I already have.

625
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,535
What?

626
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,911
Nothing.

627
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:16,291
Nothing, I just remembered the last time
I saw you, when we went to Arayat.

628
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,920
You cried so hard back then.

629
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,255
You were like

630
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,550
a child whose ice cream was taken away.

631
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,683
You went and revealed to me

632
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,978
that you and Von were already married.

633
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,024
And that you were even expecting a child.

634
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:48,198
Don't you and Von even have a child?

635
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,623
You didn't even make me the godfather.

636
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,504
Can I meet him?

637
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,942
Son of a bitch.

638
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,403
You're still playing that fucking song?

639
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,821
Didn't I tell you…

640
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,367
I want peace in my house!

641
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,202
I turned it off.

642
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,787
What? Fuck you.

643
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,038
You're talking back?!

644
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,998
You fucking bitch!

645
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,042
Give that to me.

646
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,877
Let's see.

647
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,088
You won't stop here, huh?

648
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,047
Fuck you.

649
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,591
Are you stupid?!

650
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,426
All right then, huh?

651
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,844
There!

652
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,596
Fuck, keep playing it then!

653
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,271
I thought I hit the jackpot with you.

654
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,651
I tied myself down with you.

655
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,696
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

656
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,241
Why am I even putting up with you?

657
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,328
If you hadn't gotten pregnant, damn it!

658
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,876
What?

659
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,587
You're leaving me?

660
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,258
You're damaged goods, Stella!

661
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,593
No one else will want you.

662
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,938
Do you want me to leave you?

663
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,318
Stella?

664
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,422
Help me.

665
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,218
Help me.

666
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,850
<i>I can't stop thinking that</i>

667
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,561
it's my fault.

668
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,741
I know Von was insane,
and I still didn't leave.

669
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:22,913
For sure,

670
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:24,748
you wanted

671
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,793
the whole family

672
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,462
for Ulan?

673
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,300
I've just been lying to myself.

674
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,263
I always say I'm okay.

675
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,100
But I'm not.

676
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,690
I don't want to fall in love
'cause I don't want to get hurt.

677
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,532
But when I'm alone,
I get consumed by loneliness.

678
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,915
What should I do?

679
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,884
Maybe…

680
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,556
Stella, it's time

681
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,517
to move on.

682
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,938
Even if it's just to let go of the pain…

683
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,316
the sorrow.

684
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,905
No…

685
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,950
I don't know if it would help.

686
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,871
I want you to realize that…

687
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,166
you are strong.

688
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,422
Very.

689
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,851
<i>Song number 40, "Extraordinary."</i>

690
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:32,792
<i>Song number 44, "LOVEU4U."</i>

691
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,654
<i>Song number 50, "Breeze."</i>

692
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,781
Beautiful!

693
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,032
That was great!

694
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,450
It's beautiful!

695
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,036
-You got the right blend, bro!
-Ouch!

696
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,079
So, did you…

697
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:16,169
No, I just reflected on it deeply.

698
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:19,130
Maybe you really should
be sent somewhere far.

699
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,216
So you can think things through.

700
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,301
I don't want to spend.

701
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,346
So, should I sponsor a vacation for you?

702
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,598
Where would I go?

703
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,226
Wherever you want, bro. Just say it.

704
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,853
I won't say no to that.

705
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,189
All right. I'll take care of it.

706
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,149
I'll tell the label. They'll reimburse.

707
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,904
I'll sing this song, "Breeze,"
later at the event.

708
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,447
You've memorized it.

709
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,241
Even the chords?

710
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,159
That's how beautiful it is.

711
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:49,619
Come later,

712
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,246
so you can see me perform.

713
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,499
I'm planning something
to hype people up more.

714
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,377
If I'm in the mood.

715
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,922
<i>I won't drag this out since you all know…</i>

716
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,390
How's everyone doing?

717
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,475
Wow, are you really all single?

718
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,601
Yes!

719
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,147
You're all so good-looking
you got no partners?

720
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,648
None!

721
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,649
Yeah, right.

722
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,070
Don't worry. We're all single here.

723
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,113
But me…

724
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,490
I'm hoping so badly.

725
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,036
-Stella, where are you?
-Here!

726
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,538
Over here!

727
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,628
Okay, this is my first time
singing this song.

728
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,340
I hope that after I sing this,

729
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,843
you'll agree to be my girlfriend.

730
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:03,568
<i>Not like the clouds that drift and go</i>

731
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:09,240
<i>Unlike the waves, its ebb and flow</i>

732
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:12,368
<i>My love for you</i>

733
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:19,793
<i>Will never end</i>

734
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:25,548
<i>No fleeting spark that fades away</i>

735
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:31,054
<i>This flame of mine is here to stay</i>

736
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:39,521
<i>You are the breeze</i>
<i>On top the mountain high</i>

737
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:44,275
<i>My safe refuge when the storms arrive</i>

738
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,946
<i>The end uncertain</i>

739
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:53,326
<i>I'll keep on just to take</i>

740
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:58,289
<i>The same air you're breathing</i>

741
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,711
So, Stella?

742
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,672
Be with me already.

743
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,656
Stella.

744
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,033
Tell me the truth now.

745
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,870
Are you the one writing his songs?

746
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,457
Only you could write a song
with such depth.

747
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,293
I didn't…

748
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,961
I don't…

749
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,464
Stella, wait!

750
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,632
There's nothing for you to find here.

751
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:51,509
Fidel…

752
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,101
"BLACK LIPSTICK"

753
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,605
Fidel?

754
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,731
Fidel.

755
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,191
Fidel, please answer me.

756
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:10,236
Stella, you know I stutter
and now you're pressuring me.

757
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,947
Do you still have feelings for me?

758
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,293
So what if I do?

759
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,711
It's just yes or no, Fidel.

760
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:27,795
Yes.

761
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,891
What's your plan?

762
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,518
What are you going to do?

763
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,687
Now that we met again.
You intend on doing anything?

764
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,524
Stella.

765
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,527
I don't want to hope again.

766
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,738
I'm fine like this.

767
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,324
Just admiring you from afar.

768
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:00,370
I've learned from what happened
between us before.

769
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,333
It's like you didn't really learn, like…

770
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,460
Nothing's changed.

771
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,632
You're still the same,
rejecting your feelings.

772
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,346
You too, Stella.

773
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:23,017
You're still waiting
for me to speak first.

774
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,688
You know that's my weakness, right?

775
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:30,441
And when you don't get what you want,

776
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,695
I'm the one to blame again,
I'm the coward again.

777
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,114
The…

778
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:37,949
Clyde's song.

779
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,742
Clyde's song, sing it for me now.

780
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,958
-Stella.
-Fidel, sing it.

781
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,349
<i>Unlike the clouds that</i>

782
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:09,731
<i>Drift away on their own</i>

783
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:18,114
<i>Unlike the waves along the shore</i>

784
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:25,872
<i>My love is not fleeting</i>

785
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,585
<i>Not fleeting</i>

786
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:37,884
<i>You are the breeze atop the mountain</i>

787
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:43,973
<i>You are my shelter in every storm</i>

788
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,561
<i>Even if the path is rough</i>

789
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,272
<i>Even if the end is uncertain</i>

790
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,066
<i>I will journey through it</i>

791
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:59,197
<i>Just to breathe in your scent</i>

792
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:17,882
<i>You are the breeze atop the mountain</i>

793
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:23,846
<i>You are my shelter in every storm</i>

794
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,058
<i>Even if the path is rough</i>

795
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,727
<i>Even if the end is uncertain</i>

796
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,063
<i>I will journey through it</i>

797
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:37,402
<i>Just to breathe in your scent</i>

798
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:43,574
<i>No matter how dark</i>
<i>My love for you guides me…</i>

799
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,034
I'll head back to the event.

800
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,577
They can handle it.

801
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,662
No…

802
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,915
Let's just meet tomorrow.

803
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,584
Or… the next day.

804
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,337
Or… when you're free.

805
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,256
When I'm free.

806
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,258
Or just give me a call.

807
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,228
Where's Clyde?

808
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,271
-Clyde.
-Clyde?

809
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:16,274
He's gone home,
he said he still has things to do.

810
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,735
Wait, where were you?

811
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,194
Sis!

812
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,988
You're trending again!

813
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,948
#LuckyYouStella.

814
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,576
I know what's on your mind!

815
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:30,913
How do we ride this traction
to promote RainStar's future events?

816
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,374
Boss, the media's here,
they're looking for you.

817
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,792
Why is the media here?

818
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,461
They were to interview Clyde,

819
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:39,380
but missed him
so they said it had to be you.

820
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,257
You're going to be on TV, sis!

821
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:45,344
Stella! People are asking
why you haven't given in to Clyde.

822
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,054
<i>Sorry, this is private property.</i>

823
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,848
<i>How will he convince you?</i>

824
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,725
<i>But what should he do to woo you?</i>

825
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:51,768
<i>But, Stella!</i>

826
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,436
<i>-I'm really sorry.</i>
<i>-Ma'am!</i>

827
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,645
Wait a minute.

828
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,231
You're so pretty, rosy cheeks!

829
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,441
No way!

830
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,402
Isn't that your dream?

831
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,196
-Enough!
-To see your face on TV.

832
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,781
You're going to be famous!

833
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,115
Hey, Fidel. Enough!

834
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,492
Come on, one last time.

835
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:08,951
-Fidel!
-Just a peek…

836
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,453
Fidel! Enough!

837
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:13,289
-No way, I look ugly!
-Wait, no, it's fine.

838
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:15,208
-Give it to me! Hey!
-I just want--

839
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,417
You're so annoying!

840
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,335
Ouch.

841
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:18,669
Ouch!

842
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:19,921
I said no!

843
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,382
-Give it to me!
-Just one last peek.

844
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,718
-I'll play it--
-Oops! It's gone.

845
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,012
See, it's ugly!

846
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:30,223
-No, it's not.
-I don't want to.

847
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,975
That's enough.

848
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:44,278
Why then?

849
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:48,908
What?

850
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,827
Why haven't you

851
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,204
answered him yet?

852
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,709
'Cause I'm taken.

853
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,840
Then why haven't you

854
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:04,966
rejected him?

855
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,469
He's still so hopeful.

856
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:14,141
That's the real reason
you'd want me to reject him?

857
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,769
What else could it be?

858
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:22,400
If you're not comfortable
with what Clyde's doing,

859
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,778
I can always tell him to stop.

860
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:30,157
Don't worry.

861
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:31,826
I understand.

862
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:38,416
It's also an added promo for RainStar,

863
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:41,043
and a boost to your sales.

864
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,014
But you?

865
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:54,891
What do you think?

866
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,229
Is Clyde really serious about me?

867
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:07,278
He's just using you as a publicity stunt.

868
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,948
You're both just using each other anyway.

869
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,455
I was going to ask you

870
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,081
to eat out,

871
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:23,502
but Clyde's fans might wonder.

872
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,880
Who's with you…

873
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:29,300
Who's that guy you're dating?

874
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,680
But really,

875
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,516
I haven't even said yes to him.

876
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,937
Because in their eyes, I'm still single.

877
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,732
That's not how people think.

878
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,446
Are you game to

879
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:52,615
go out of town?

880
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,460
<i>How many days will you be in Zambales?</i>

881
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:08,297
<i>Just one week, Auntie.</i>
<i>Clyde's covering everything.</i>

882
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,049
<i>Oh, Clyde's going with you there?</i>

883
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,051
<i>No, just me. I'll be writing there.</i>

884
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:17,682
While I'm on vacation,
Aya will be in charge.

885
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:21,185
But if there's anything
you need to ask or tell me,

886
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:24,063
you can always call me on Viber.

887
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,315
Your vacation is so sudden, sis.

888
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,858
Wish we were all like that.

889
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,652
Boss really deserves a break.

890
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:32,029
Just enjoy, don't worry, we'll be fine.

891
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,197
-Thanks!
-Oh, sis.

892
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:38,869
Someone emailed me, asking if
RainStar could organize a corporate event.

893
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,579
That's big money.

894
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,915
But that's not our forte.

895
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,001
Let's give that a pass.

896
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,296
<i>Song number 54, "Melody."</i>

897
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,592
<i>It rises and falls, like a staircase</i>

898
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,929
<i>Like the tune of an unforgettable song</i>

899
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,016
<i>That's what we've been through</i>

900
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,602
<i>Our life feels so colorful</i>

901
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:06,439
<i>Melody-ody-ody</i>

902
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,775
<i>Our life feels so colorful</i>

903
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,778
<i>Melody-ody-ody</i>

904
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:16,699
<i>True love, may it last forever</i>

905
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:23,247
Do you remember
our Freshies Night back then at PAC?

906
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:30,004
When I first told you
that I had a speech defect?

907
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:37,303
And then you said to me,
"So what if you stutter?"

908
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,888
That was a long time ago.

909
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:40,848
I don't remember.

910
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:44,310
I can't remember what I was wearing then.

911
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:47,271
Maybe for you

912
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:53,319
it was just an ordinary day, but for me,

913
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,072
it was a core memory.

914
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:58,699
Of course, you already liked me then.

915
01:07:58,783 --> 01:07:59,992
Yeah.

916
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:02,369
But it's true.

917
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:07,291
Do you remember when I ran away from home?

918
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:08,751
Then I came to see you?

919
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:15,800
And then that night we…
we checked into a motel.

920
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:19,553
And you even kissed me then.

921
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,264
That was my first time, you know?

922
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,475
Yeah, it was so obvious.

923
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,772
And you were acting so shy, even though
I knew you were really into it.

924
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:37,238
Well, I didn't really want to
take advantage of your vulnerability.

925
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,364
Yeah, right!

926
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,700
You were embarrassed 'cause
you never had any experience then.

927
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:43,536
That too.

928
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:50,376
You waited almost… over a decade
before you gave me another kiss.

929
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,133
Come on, you're so slow!

930
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,634
Okay, I'm ready, let's go.

931
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:05,975
Ta-da!

932
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,310
It still works!

933
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,478
Yeah.

934
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,147
Why'd you bring that here?

935
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,691
Déjà vu, right? Look.

936
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:17,027
A mountain, you, me, a hundred poems.

937
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,529
Wait.

938
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:20,781
My favorite is still the first one.

939
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:22,491
Which one?

940
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,870
-"The Girl With Black Lipstick."
-I don't want to hear it!

941
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,165
-I don't want to hear it!
<i>-"Black lipstick but kind-hearted…"</i>

942
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,666
-Wait!
-Why?

943
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:34,295
When you're famous,
I'll sell this, it'll be a memorabilia.

944
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:35,963
I can even auction it.

945
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:38,424
-Why would I even be famous?
-Many would buy this.

946
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,341
Let me see.

947
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:42,428
-You're not giving this back, are you?
-I'll give it back.

948
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,264
You better give it back.

949
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,242
You know, I could…

950
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,661
I could compose…

951
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:12,541
a song based on these poems.

952
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,376
Don't.

953
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,754
Enough drawing from the past.

954
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:18,756
If you're going to write a song,

955
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:22,384
maybe you should write about
what's happening now?

956
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:30,100
I don't really have anything
in the present to draw from.

957
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:34,271
It's about time you make new memories.

958
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:43,572
<i>"Her lipstick was black, but she was kind"</i>

959
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:46,784
<i>"I was simply amazed by her natural…"</i>

960
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:48,786
<i>"Beauty"?</i>

961
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:51,789
<i>Song number 61, "Let Go."</i>

962
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:57,461
<i>I will now let go of the past</i>

963
01:10:57,544 --> 01:11:02,174
<i>Maybe I'll find peace</i>

964
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:07,137
<i>I will now let go of the past</i>

965
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:11,558
<i>Maybe tomorrow I'll finally gain</i>

966
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:14,311
<i>The peace I long for</i>

967
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:18,565
<i>Song number 62, "Oh My."</i>

968
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,624
It's that beautiful?

969
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,836
It's beautiful, and so relatable.

970
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,798
I feel like this should be our theme song.

971
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:45,843
If this were our theme song,

972
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,637
I could write your parts.

973
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,098
Or… maybe you could write it?

974
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,475
No, I don't know how to do that anymore.

975
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:54,601
Come on, do it.

976
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,770
No, I can't. Seriously, it's beautiful.

977
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,731
I'm sure Clyde would love it.

978
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,155
I'm not giving this to him.

979
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:09,908
Why?

980
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:11,452
It's mine.

981
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:18,167
The only thing my contract forbids
is writing for others.

982
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:22,296
It's not forbidden
for me to write for myself.

983
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:23,797
And besides…

984
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:28,052
I thought this was supposed
to be our theme song?

985
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:32,181
-Exactly.
-Then why would I write it for him?

986
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:35,434
It's not really a big deal
if you give it to Clyde.

987
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:36,643
That's also money.

988
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,063
And besides, I know what you're writing,

989
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,648
the songs you compose,
are really for Clyde.

990
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,734
Clyde, Clyde…

991
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:44,818
Clyde!

992
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:48,864
It's always Clyde.

993
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:54,161
If my songs ever become famous,

994
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:59,124
I want the world to know that
I'm the one who wrote them.

995
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:04,963
That I wrote this for you.

996
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,966
And I should be in his position.

997
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,804
Would he even be famous
if not for my songs?

998
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:15,432
Why am I the one,
why am I the one who has to hide?

999
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,142
Fidel, I get you.

1000
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:22,189
You don't really like me either, for sure.

1001
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:24,775
Hey,

1002
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:26,819
where is that coming from?

1003
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:30,155
You can't even
bring yourself to reject him.

1004
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,117
Because

1005
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:37,413
you're keeping him as a backup.

1006
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,457
In case I'm not enough, right?

1007
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:43,293
You'd have someone else to turn to.

1008
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:44,211
Fidel,

1009
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,214
let me remind you, I asked you.

1010
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:49,550
I volunteered.

1011
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:53,887
I'd talk to him, but you stopped me.

1012
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:54,847
I didn't stop you!

1013
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,558
All I said was that

1014
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,227
you two are just using each other.

1015
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:03,480
You know, if you really cared about me,

1016
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,732
you should've rejected him long ago!

1017
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,611
You want to yell at me?

1018
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,114
You're already yelling at me!

1019
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:13,490
Let's shout at each other!

1020
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:17,995
There, satisfied?

1021
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:19,830
You want to yell at me? Fine!

1022
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:21,415
Stella, I'm sorry.

1023
01:14:21,498 --> 01:14:24,418
Von was the last one who yelled at me!
Don't ever yell at me!

1024
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:25,711
Stella.

1025
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,464
Stella, wait.

1026
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:31,049
Stella, wait!

1027
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,385
I'm sorry, I just got triggered.

1028
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:37,681
-Stella, I won't do it again.
-Do you know what your problem is?

1029
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:42,561
You love it, don't you?
You love the idea that you're not enough.

1030
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:45,606
Because even then,
you've always been insecure.

1031
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:46,523
Right?

1032
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,650
Then what do you do? You start doing shit.

1033
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,486
Like these trips.

1034
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:53,363
You'll write me poems,
you'll compose songs.

1035
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:56,992
Not because you want them,
but because you've got something to prove.

1036
01:14:57,075 --> 01:15:00,662
To society, to Clyde,
to me, to yourself, to everyone.

1037
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,915
Stella, I'm sorry. Please.

1038
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:04,708
I'll fix it.

1039
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,001
Just don't leave me.

1040
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:07,211
Hey!

1041
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:09,171
Are you hearing yourself?

1042
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:11,548
You'll fix yourself
as long as I don't leave?

1043
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,470
Shouldn't you be fixing yourself

1044
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:17,804
for your own sake?

1045
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,766
Shouldn't you fix yourself
even if I'm here or not?

1046
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,479
Are you breaking up with me?

1047
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:27,773
If I say yes, what will you do?

1048
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:30,526
You'll write a song about it?

1049
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:32,694
Write me 100 poems?

1050
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:36,114
Then mope around.

1051
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:39,243
Blame me for everything
that happens to you,

1052
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,286
blame me for your misery.

1053
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:43,288
Isn't that what you'll do?

1054
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,124
Maybe we rushed things a bit.

1055
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,751
-No, Stella.
-Yes, we did.

1056
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:52,422
We rushed because we already
knew each other, we had history, right?

1057
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:53,882
That's all this is.

1058
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,176
Stella…

1059
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:59,763
We don't have to be perfect to be lovers.

1060
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:02,015
Yes, but what happens then?

1061
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:07,563
Fidel, I don't want us hurting each other.
Like this, I don't want to hurt you.

1062
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,110
Maybe we need space, some time.

1063
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:15,153
That's enough.

1064
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:19,157
Maybe like before,
maybe let fate decide for us.

1065
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:21,118
That's enough.

1066
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:22,327
Don't follow me.

1067
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,039
That's enough.

1068
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,040
Stella!

1069
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:47,311
That's enough, out now.

1070
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:49,271
Yeah.

1071
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:51,982
It looks like something is hanging.

1072
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,360
Nice. Look here.

1073
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,908
-Ms. Ching!
-I'll send you the deposit, okay?

1074
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,994
-Yes?
-What's up?

1075
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:08,081
Your album's release is in June.
You're still missing four tracks.

1076
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,666
Have you spoken to Fidel?

1077
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,793
I sent him on a vacation.

1078
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,128
He needs inspiration.

1079
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:14,713
Hey!

1080
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:17,215
Your office will reimburse me for that,
okay?

1081
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,800
I promised him.

1082
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,469
Okay, fine. I'll talk to Finance.

1083
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:21,928
Where did he go on vacation?

1084
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,805
He said…

1085
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,474
-To Tanay.
-Stella's there.

1086
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,978
That's impossible. How do you know that?

1087
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,396
No, really.

1088
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:36,610
Look.

1089
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:57,422
Sorry, Clyde.

1090
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,716
We need to redo the layout.

1091
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,927
Marketing wants a bigger smile.

1092
01:18:03,303 --> 01:18:04,471
How big?

1093
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:06,973
Like candid, natural, laughing.

1094
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:10,811
Just tell them the earlier one was fine.

1095
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:40,215
Sis?

1096
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:44,636
You go ahead,
I've got something to finish.

1097
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,404
CAUGHT BUT NOT JAILED

1098
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:03,321
I KNOW SOMEONE LIKE THAT
YOU MADE HIM EXPECT FOR YOU

1099
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:11,371
Oh, my gosh, this is crazy, girl. My God.

1100
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,540
She's deliberately not answering Clyde!

1101
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:14,916
-But how?
-Well?

1102
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,543
They say she has another suitor.

1103
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:17,961
You're already in bed.

1104
01:19:18,044 --> 01:19:19,671
Then you move to a cot.

1105
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,339
Someone whispered to me.

1106
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,425
She was a flirt back in college.

1107
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:25,010
Like, a total fuckgirl.

1108
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:34,603
The girl is just using the clout
to hype up her events.

1109
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:36,146
That's Clyde Pelayo, girl.

1110
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:37,355
And your other option?

1111
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:38,273
Is a junkie.

1112
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:40,066
And Clyde's rival

1113
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,235
seems like he has a speech defect.

1114
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:52,412
Clyde.

1115
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:54,998
Clyde.

1116
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,459
Aren't you going to say anything?

1117
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:03,673
That we're not a couple?

1118
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,967
Why don't you and Fidel say that?

1119
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,053
Because who would even listen to us?

1120
01:20:09,429 --> 01:20:10,931
You're the famous one.

1121
01:20:11,014 --> 01:20:12,724
Everyone would listen to you.

1122
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:16,353
Clyde, mine and Fidel's reputations
are at risk.

1123
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:20,106
Even my staff was affected.

1124
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,150
-Do you still think that's fair?
-Fair.

1125
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:27,072
Do you know what's fair?

1126
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,074
You shouldn't have let me court you.

1127
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,202
When you and Fidel had something going on.

1128
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:34,412
I never once agreed to let you court me.

1129
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:38,875
And do you really think

1130
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,545
Fidel and I planned this?

1131
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,555
You know what's sad?

1132
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:59,729
I entertained the idea that
maybe we could be together.

1133
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:00,856
But what, Stella?

1134
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,109
But you don't know me.

1135
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:06,278
You don't acknowledge me.

1136
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:10,699
You didn't know I was once married.

1137
01:21:11,741 --> 01:21:15,161
I was married.
You didn't know that I lost a child.

1138
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:19,165
My child never had the chance to live.

1139
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:22,586
'Cause I never had
the courage to leave that devil.

1140
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,213
That I've been all over the place

1141
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:28,091
and will keep search high and low
to get what I want.

1142
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:39,436
You don't know that I always think
and feel that I don't deserve to be

1143
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:42,105
Clyde Pelayo's girlfriend,
because who am I?

1144
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,566
My life is such a mess.

1145
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,322
Does Fidel know?

1146
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:51,448
Yes.

1147
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:53,909
I actually wonder.

1148
01:21:54,534 --> 01:21:57,287
Why is it that until now
you still haven't noticed

1149
01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:00,206
that all your songs, the ones he wrote,

1150
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,168
if not for me, were all about me.

1151
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:09,424
-He told you that?
-He didn't need to tell me.

1152
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:13,553
He doesn't need to say anything to me.
Because I know him.

1153
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,574
SOUR COUPLE

1154
01:22:35,575 --> 01:22:37,160
BETRAYAL AWARD

1155
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,793
Let me hear the songs
you wrote in Zambales.

1156
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:54,386
Clyde,

1157
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:57,931
Stella and I have known
each other a long time.

1158
01:22:58,014 --> 01:22:59,349
I wasn't asking you, Fidel.

1159
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,954
Just up to that point.

1160
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:30,797
Nothing more?

1161
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:32,549
Nothing else.

1162
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:37,012
Fidel,

1163
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:42,017
did you tell Stella that
you're the one writing my songs?

1164
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:46,396
I can sue you.

1165
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:48,523
You violated the NDA.

1166
01:23:53,236 --> 01:23:57,741
Is that really the only
reason you're angry?

1167
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,085
Clyde,

1168
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:12,797
I've thought about it.

1169
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:18,803
I don't want to write in secret anymore.

1170
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:22,390
I don't want to live in…

1171
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:26,853
in your shadow or anyone else's.

1172
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,148
Fine.

1173
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:32,567
If you want to sue me,

1174
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:36,112
I understand.

1175
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:43,161
It's fine, so I won't
have to keep living like a ghost.

1176
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:50,794
My lawyer will talk to you.

1177
01:24:59,969 --> 01:25:01,096
How is he?

1178
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:05,141
Now, or since the time you left
them with their father?

1179
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:07,310
Jingrose…

1180
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,981
He's been locking himself up for days now.

1181
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:14,234
He's usually just there.

1182
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:19,114
He's afraid to go out,
afraid people might see him.

1183
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,581
My child!

1184
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:29,624
Come on now.

1185
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:38,383
Grant and Aliyah showed me

1186
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:41,719
what people are saying about you online.

1187
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:46,933
So,

1188
01:25:48,017 --> 01:25:50,019
they must be thrilled.

1189
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:57,694
They were concerned about you,
and told me to check on you.

1190
01:26:08,621 --> 01:26:09,789
You've seen me now.

1191
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:14,169
I'm still alive.

1192
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,380
Still breathing.

1193
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:25,346
You can leave now, Ma.

1194
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:26,931
My child.

1195
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:31,102
I'm sorry I left you back then.

1196
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:38,902
That was so long ago, Ma.

1197
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,407
I don't even care anymore.

1198
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:50,914
I abandoned you back then.

1199
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:53,625
I won't leave you now.

1200
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:57,670
Especially now that you're
going through something.

1201
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:00,089
Ma.

1202
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:09,390
Do you really think

1203
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:12,352
I'm still affected by

1204
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:14,437
the things they say?

1205
01:27:15,855 --> 01:27:19,442
By the way they mock me

1206
01:27:20,693 --> 01:27:22,528
because of how I speak?

1207
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:29,786
Even my own mother

1208
01:27:30,703 --> 01:27:31,996
discarded me.

1209
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,166
And I survived.

1210
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:40,505
Ma…

1211
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:45,260
I can take care of myself…

1212
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:46,928
Ma…

1213
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:51,557
I don't need your help.

1214
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:55,561
I know that.

1215
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:03,236
So what?

1216
01:28:04,153 --> 01:28:08,032
Am I just supposed to
let go of the fact that you left me?

1217
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:16,457
I'm here

1218
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,584
because you're my child.

1219
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,463
Because I love you.

1220
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,175
I want nothing else from you.

1221
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:40,815

I work part-time
as a medical transcriptionist.

I love to travel.

And…

1231
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:02,480
My dream…

1232
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:08,736
My dream destination is Greece.

A scholar of the nation.

01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:49,730
Musician.

1253
01:32:51,482 --> 01:32:54,318
I have a speech defect.

1254
01:32:56,153 --> 01:33:00,074
I don't stutter when I read

1255
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:02,702
and when I sing.

1256
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:05,413
But I stutter when…

1257
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:10,334
when I say long sentences.

1258
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:17,675
That's why I usually limit
my sentences to just three words.

1259
01:33:21,345 --> 01:33:22,346
From now on…

1260
01:33:24,974 --> 01:33:25,975
I will no longer

1261
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:29,478
limit my… myself.

1262
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:35,192
If I stutter, then I stutter.

1263
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:41,907
<i>Song number 70, "Unshaken."</i>

1264
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:05,431
Only seven joined.

1265
01:34:05,514 --> 01:34:07,975
Are we still
pushing through with the event?

1266
01:34:09,685 --> 01:34:10,728
Not anymore.

1267
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:12,146
We'll just lose money.

1268
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,524
Tell them the event is canceled.

1269
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:18,527
Damn that Clyde!

1270
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:21,489
It's not even Clyde's fault.

1271
01:34:22,656 --> 01:34:25,117
It's my fault. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1272
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:27,703
So what do we do now, sis?

1273
01:34:31,415 --> 01:34:33,125
Maybe this is a sign.

1274
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:38,506
For RainStar to explore
different kinds of events.

1275
01:34:40,674 --> 01:34:45,429
Surely we're not limited
to just all-singles events.

1276
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:51,185
RainStar should be known
for how well we mount events.

1277
01:34:51,268 --> 01:34:52,520
Whatever kind.

1278
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:59,235
We shouldn't have to rely on
the endorsement of one bitter singer.

1279
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:08,828
Maybe we should all take
a mini sabbatical.

1280
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:10,996
Even just for a month.

1281
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:17,128
Surely after a month,
this would have calmed down.

1282
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:20,506
I'll think about what Ronan said.

1283
01:35:21,632 --> 01:35:25,010
But if you also want to
start looking for other jobs,

1284
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:27,513
it's okay with me, I'll understand.

1285
01:35:27,596 --> 01:35:30,307
As for me, sis, I'll wait the one month.

1286
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:35,104
I'll only look for another job if I hear
directly from you that RainStar is gone.

1287
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:36,897
Me too.

1288
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:39,108
Of course. Me too.

1289
01:36:01,797 --> 01:36:02,631
Hey!

1290
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,182
-She was my bandmate in college.
-Hi.

1291
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:16,562
Don't worry.
They don't care about local showbiz.

1292
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:23,319
I'm surprised you came to meet me.
I thought I was a stranger to you now.

1293
01:36:23,402 --> 01:36:25,696
Wow, you really had to say "stranger."

1294
01:36:25,779 --> 01:36:27,531
I even know your band's name.

1295
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:29,158
Really? Okay then, what is it?

1296
01:36:29,241 --> 01:36:30,201
Z-cleft.

1297
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:32,578
Wow! You're updated!

1298
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:35,539
I don't know much about you.

1299
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:38,334
Except for, you know…

1300
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:40,711
the rumors…

1301
01:36:40,794 --> 01:36:43,339
But tell me, are you and Fidel…

1302
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:45,382
Clyde?

1303
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:46,300
Ouch!

1304
01:36:46,383 --> 01:36:48,427
-You like gossip.
-Okay!

1305
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:50,346
Erase that!

1306
01:36:50,429 --> 01:36:51,805
Whatever that is,

1307
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:53,599
you can handle it.

1308
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:55,309
You're a big girl now.

1309
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,103
<i>I don't know. I feel lost.</i>

1310
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:01,815
Feels like I don't really know myself.

1311
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:03,651
That's deep.

1312
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:05,361
Yeah, it is.

1313
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:07,196
I mean…

1314
01:37:07,821 --> 01:37:10,616
Who am I without my work?

1315
01:37:11,825 --> 01:37:14,036
Who am I without Fidel?

1316
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:19,124
Who am I without my grieving for Ulan?

1317
01:37:21,126 --> 01:37:22,127
You know,

1318
01:37:22,836 --> 01:37:24,171
when we disbanded,

1319
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:27,424
I also felt a bit lost then.

1320
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:30,970
Just a social science student
until I graduated.

1321
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:34,181
Then I went abroad to work.

1322
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:35,599
For several years.

1323
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:36,809
But it was fine.

1324
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:38,394
I mean, I managed.

1325
01:37:39,436 --> 01:37:41,772
I could indulge a little now and then.

1326
01:37:43,566 --> 01:37:44,692
But…

1327
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:46,944
I didn't feel happy.

1328
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:49,280
Why?

1329
01:37:51,073 --> 01:37:52,408
It's like…

1330
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:54,868
Everything happening in my life then

1331
01:37:54,952 --> 01:37:56,662
was what others wanted for me.

1332
01:37:57,663 --> 01:38:00,082
My family, my girlfriend.

1333
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:04,169
But what I really wanted for myself

1334
01:38:05,087 --> 01:38:05,921
was nothing.

1335
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:09,842
That's why I went back to a band.

1336
01:38:12,803 --> 01:38:14,972
This has since been my passion.

1337
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:17,391
Though it's a showband.

1338
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:20,144
I mean, all covers…

1339
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,564
But at least it's still related to music.

1340
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:29,528
I don't earn as much compared
to when I was in Singapore.

1341
01:38:31,614 --> 01:38:32,948
But I can say,

1342
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:35,367
and I can say it proudly,

1343
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:38,912
for the first time in my life,

1344
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:40,998
I'm happy.

1345
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,542
That's it.

1346
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:45,669
That's my advice for you.

1347
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:49,548
Remember. What's your passion?

1348
01:38:50,549 --> 01:38:54,053
Instead of moving out of fear,

1349
01:38:54,803 --> 01:38:59,266
remember what makes your blood rush
when you think about it?

1350
01:39:00,392 --> 01:39:01,935
That's what you should go after.

1351
01:39:03,145 --> 01:39:06,148
I'm sure you'll find yourself again.

1352
01:39:08,275 --> 01:39:11,111
So? Let's jam.

1353
01:39:28,253 --> 01:39:31,757
<i>Song number 79, "Thanks to You."</i>

1354
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:37,221
<i>Thank you, thank you</i>
<i>You opened my eyes</i>

1355
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:42,601
<i>Thank you, thank you</i>
<i>And I learned to breathe</i>

1356
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:48,065
<i>I'll no longer hide in my burrow</i>
<i>I'll greet the world</i>

1357
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:50,651
<i>Thank you, thank you</i>

1358
01:39:50,734 --> 01:39:52,486
<i>Thank you</i>

1359
01:39:56,240 --> 01:40:01,036
I thought your lawyer
was going to talk to me?

1360
01:40:02,871 --> 01:40:05,040
Could I really do that to you, bro?

1361
01:40:15,592 --> 01:40:19,430
This song doesn't fit the theme
of my album. I know you know that.

1362
01:40:20,347 --> 01:40:21,306
Bro…

1363
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:27,813
I didn't write this for your album.

1364
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:34,319
For yourself.

1365
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:36,113
Bro,

1366
01:40:37,364 --> 01:40:40,075
that's what you should do too.

1367
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,245
Stop pretending already.

1368
01:40:44,997 --> 01:40:48,625
Your fans would appreciate that more.

1369
01:41:01,054 --> 01:41:02,139
You know, bro…

1370
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:10,189
just to measure up to my father's legacy.

1371
01:41:21,366 --> 01:41:23,410
I know I could never match that.

1372
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:26,789
You don't need to match him.

1373
01:41:28,957 --> 01:41:31,960
Make a name for yourself.

1374
01:41:39,009 --> 01:41:40,761
Step out of his shadow…

1375
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:53,398
Bro, this album…

1376
01:41:53,482 --> 01:41:55,901
It's the last time I'm gonna buy
a song from you.

1377
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:57,528
What?

1378
01:41:57,611 --> 01:42:01,657
I've accepted it. Okay?
I accept the fact that I didn't inherit

1379
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:04,493
my dad's talent for songwriting.

1380
01:42:04,576 --> 01:42:07,830
So instead of hiring you
as my ghostwriter,

1381
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:12,042
I'll take you on as my mentor,

1382
01:42:23,762 --> 01:42:24,888
You're not kidding?

1383
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:29,268
-You're known for jokes!
-You're not kidding?

1384
01:42:29,351 --> 01:42:31,895
Fidel? I'm not joking either.

1385
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:32,938
-Yeah!
-For real?

1386
01:42:33,021 --> 01:42:34,022
Yes!

1387
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:35,816
All right, but…

1388
01:42:39,152 --> 01:42:41,488
that you were my ghostwriter.

1389
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:44,408
And of course, this upcoming album,

1390
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:47,661
I feel like my fans might disown me.

1391
01:42:49,204 --> 01:42:53,458
If that's what you think is right.

1392
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:57,421
Fine!

1393
01:43:02,175 --> 01:43:03,218
Anybody home?

1394
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:06,305
Ma'am, delivery, parcel.

1395
01:43:07,222 --> 01:43:08,181
Okay.

1396
01:43:29,578 --> 01:43:32,581
<i>Sis? Did you watch</i>
<i>Clyde's live stream earlier?</i>

1397
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:34,583
Not yet.

1398
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:39,379
<i>Stop bashing Fidel and Stella.</i>

1399
01:43:40,088 --> 01:43:41,924
<i>Nothing's going on between us.</i>

1400
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:43,383
<i>We're both single,</i>

1401
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:49,014
<i>And it's not true that she used me.</i>

1402
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:54,394
<i>In fact, I was the one whoused her</i>
<i>to advance my career.</i>

1403
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:00,776
<i>Stella, I feel guilty.</i>

1404
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:07,324
I feel like I'm the reason
why your business suddenly collapsed.

1405
01:44:15,248 --> 01:44:17,709
I want RainStar to handle my album launch.

1406
01:44:18,293 --> 01:44:20,545
That's not our forte. Are you sure?

1407
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:23,548
You're talented, Stella.
You can definitely do it.

1408
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:27,260
All right!

1409
01:44:28,303 --> 01:44:29,888
My people would love that.

1410
01:44:37,479 --> 01:44:40,357
By the way, what pushed you
to release a statement?

1411
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,192
Was it because you felt guilty?

1412
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:51,284
Here's the thing,

1413
01:44:54,579 --> 01:44:56,164
The history between you two.

1414
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,041
I was touched.

1415
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:00,544
It's like a movie.

1416
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:13,098
two people in love don't end up together.

1417
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:17,352
You're not the only reason
why we broke up.

1418
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:27,404
I'm sure Fidel told you that we broke up.

1419
01:45:31,366 --> 01:45:32,701
Well, now you know.

1420
01:45:59,561 --> 01:46:00,979
Put this in the lobby.

1421
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:03,065
It's wasted here, no one sees it.

1422
01:46:03,148 --> 01:46:05,150
Let's cut this one up, okay?

1423
01:46:05,233 --> 01:46:07,319
All right, everyone,
15 minutes to showtime.

1424
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:12,866
Double time. Sound crew,
check all the mics, especially Clyde's.

1425
01:46:12,949 --> 01:46:15,118
Report to me if there's a problem.

1426
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:16,828
Okay? Are you taking notes?

1427
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:18,288
-Stella.
-Give it to me.

1428
01:46:18,789 --> 01:46:20,916
Why are you here? Go take your place.

1429
01:46:20,999 --> 01:46:21,917
Oh, nothing.

1430
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:27,380
For accepting this event.

1431
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:30,801
I accepted this because it's work.

1432
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:33,887
And you?

1433
01:46:34,554 --> 01:46:36,264
No hidden agenda, right?

1434
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:40,477
You gave this to me
because I'm good at my job.

1435
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:44,356
Of course.

1436
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:49,402
Did you invite Fidel?

1437
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:51,905
Of course, but…

1438
01:46:52,697 --> 01:46:54,825
Nope. He said he had plans.

1439
01:46:58,161 --> 01:46:59,121
All right.

1440
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:01,498
Go take your place there.

1441
01:47:07,629 --> 01:47:11,133
Thank you so much for coming here
to our album launch.

1442
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:16,847
Let's all welcome my album
together, because at 12:00 a.m.,

1443
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:20,016
all the tracks will drop on
every streaming platform.

1444
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:34,406
I hope you like it.

1445
01:47:37,534 --> 01:47:41,788
<i>The night is quiet, we're side by side</i>

1446
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:46,042
<i>But why can't I seem to be at ease</i>

1447
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:50,255
<i>There's a chill in the air</i>
<i>A sparkle in the stars</i>

1448
01:47:50,338 --> 01:47:55,051
<i>But why do I still feel this fear, hey</i>

1449
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:59,389
<i>One wrong move and it's gone, hey</i>

1450
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:02,726
<i>That's what my mind keeps saying</i>

1451
01:48:02,809 --> 01:48:08,273
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Don't just blow this chance away</i>

1452
01:48:08,356 --> 01:48:10,358
<i>Don't you waste it, hey!</i>

1453
01:48:10,442 --> 01:48:16,323
<i>Oh, no! Here I go again</i>

1454
01:48:16,406 --> 01:48:20,452
<i>Falling for you all over again</i>

1455
01:48:20,535 --> 01:48:27,042
<i>I hope our story won't be broken</i>
<i>The one I've long been waiting for</i>

1456
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:33,131
<i>Oh, no! Here we are again</i>

1457
01:48:33,215 --> 01:48:37,844
<i>My heart is enchanted once more</i>

1458
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:41,765
<i>I hope this scene won't be ruined</i>

1459
01:48:41,848 --> 01:48:46,311
<i>I hope I won't mess it up, oh, no!</i>

1460
01:48:46,394 --> 01:48:50,315
The merch is sold out, Clyde!
Even the physical albums.

1461
01:48:50,398 --> 01:48:52,734
Even on pre-order, it's all gone.

1462
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:57,405
I'm sure Uncle Casimiro
is so proud in heaven.

1463
01:49:03,495 --> 01:49:05,705
Thank you for taking care of me.

1464
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:08,291
Just like how you cared for my dad before.

1465
01:49:09,459 --> 01:49:10,835
Of course!

1466
01:49:10,919 --> 01:49:12,545
I'm your handler after all.

1467
01:49:15,298 --> 01:49:17,676
I hope that even if I can't live up to

1468
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:20,303
my dad's legacy,

1469
01:49:21,763 --> 01:49:23,431
you'll still take care of me.

1470
01:49:24,015 --> 01:49:27,060
You don't have to
prove anything to people.

1471
01:49:27,978 --> 01:49:29,688
Your dad is already a legend.

1472
01:49:30,522 --> 01:49:33,984
You… are just starting to make your mark.

1473
01:49:36,361 --> 01:49:38,655
Clyde? Take your position. Last song.

1474
01:49:42,492 --> 01:49:44,536
Stella, by the way…

1475
01:49:45,954 --> 01:49:47,247
Go watch from the audience.

1476
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:49,958
Hey! What are you planning?

1477
01:49:55,213 --> 01:49:56,298
Hey!

1478
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:04,139
I hope you enjoyed all the tracks.

1479
01:50:05,765 --> 01:50:07,058
This is for you, Dad.

1480
01:50:17,068 --> 01:50:19,571
there's something I want to say
to all of you…

1481
01:50:22,157 --> 01:50:23,700
All of my songs…

1482
01:50:35,337 --> 01:50:37,130
I didn't write a single one.

1483
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:46,973
Since I was a kid,

1484
01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:53,188
people already expected me to
follow in my father's footsteps.

1485
01:50:55,982 --> 01:50:59,069
For me, that was a lot of pressure.
Because honestly,

1486
01:51:01,696 --> 01:51:03,907
I'm not really good at writing songs.

1487
01:51:07,285 --> 01:51:09,245
So I was forced to get

1488
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:12,457
a ghostwriter.

1489
01:51:14,959 --> 01:51:16,419
So that somehow,

1490
01:51:18,463 --> 01:51:23,843
I could at least pretend to be as good
as the one and only, Casimiro Pelayo.

1491
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:29,432
I idolize him.

1492
01:51:33,269 --> 01:51:36,272
Sorry also to my fans
because I deceived you.

1493
01:51:37,023 --> 01:51:40,235
So if you want to turn your backs
on me, I understand.

1494
01:51:42,028 --> 01:51:43,822
But I just don't want to pretend.

1495
01:52:01,506 --> 01:52:06,094
I'd like to invite up here on stage,
the one who truly wrote my songs…

1496
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:09,639
Fidel Lansangan!

1497
01:52:12,475 --> 01:52:13,601
Bro, where are you?

1498
01:52:14,686 --> 01:52:16,771
Where's Fidel?

1499
01:52:16,855 --> 01:52:18,314
There he is! Fidel!

1500
01:52:21,734 --> 01:52:23,570
Come up here, bro. Come on.

1501
01:52:23,653 --> 01:52:24,904
Do your best.

1502
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:38,460
Bro, please!

1503
01:52:38,543 --> 01:52:41,671
Maybe you could be the one
to introduce the song to them.

1504
01:52:58,813 --> 01:53:02,775
Hello to all of you,

1505
01:53:03,693 --> 01:53:04,861
everyone.

1506
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:11,951
This last track of Clyde's album

1507
01:53:12,035 --> 01:53:16,581
is my thanks
to someone very special to me.

1508
01:53:18,166 --> 01:53:22,212
She made me feel that I could be

1509
01:53:23,546 --> 01:53:27,800
befriended, valued,

1510
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:30,720
loved,

1511
01:53:31,429 --> 01:53:36,809
even with all my flaws.

1512
01:53:40,146 --> 01:53:42,440
Even though we didn't end up together,

1513
01:53:45,568 --> 01:53:48,071
I'm grateful.

1514
01:53:48,154 --> 01:53:50,823
Because of her,

1515
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:58,540
I learned to love

1516
01:53:59,332 --> 01:54:01,501
myself.

1517
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:09,133
Clyde.

1518
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:13,388
Bro. Maybe…

1519
01:54:15,473 --> 01:54:16,849
I just have one request.

1520
01:54:19,102 --> 01:54:22,272
Maybe you could be the one to sing too?
Would that be okay?

1521
01:54:27,443 --> 01:54:28,570
Go, Fidel!

1522
01:54:36,953 --> 01:54:38,538
You can do it, Bro.

1523
01:54:48,339 --> 01:54:51,676
<i>Song number 100, "One Path."</i>

1524
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:59,142
<i>Always lacking, never enough</i>

1525
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:06,107
<i>My reflection splintered, jagged and rough</i>

1526
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:11,112
<i>Every futile attempt I try</i>

1527
01:55:11,195 --> 01:55:16,117
<i>I can't escape this dark of night</i>

1528
01:55:17,869 --> 01:55:23,875
<i>When you left, I thought I would break</i>

1529
01:55:23,958 --> 01:55:29,797
<i>Lose myself with each step you take</i>

1530
01:55:29,881 --> 01:55:34,928
<i>But through the silence, pain, and tears</i>

1531
01:55:35,553 --> 01:55:40,516
<i>I found a truth that's crystal clear</i>

1532
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:45,647
<i>That there's not just one road to take</i>

1533
01:55:46,272 --> 01:55:51,527
<i>Not just one choice I have to make</i>

1534
01:55:51,611 --> 01:55:57,408
<i>Thanks to you, I finally know</i>

1535
01:55:58,493 --> 01:56:03,331
<i>I found the path that is my own</i>

1536
01:56:24,519 --> 01:56:25,520
Stella!

1537
01:56:30,108 --> 01:56:33,611
Hey, what's wrong?

1538
01:56:37,031 --> 01:56:37,907
Nothing.

1539
01:56:39,492 --> 01:56:40,785
I'm proud of you.

1540
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:43,579
I'm so proud of you.

1541
01:56:46,249 --> 01:56:47,875
Thank you.

1542
01:56:51,587 --> 01:56:55,008
For being part of

1543
01:56:56,092 --> 01:56:57,427
my growth.

1544
01:57:01,556 --> 01:57:02,640
I felt…

1545
01:57:04,809 --> 01:57:07,437
for the first time…

1546
01:57:10,398 --> 01:57:14,444
that I was truly happy with myself.

1547
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:19,073
And… I feel like

1548
01:57:19,907 --> 01:57:24,954
I don't need anything else in life.

1549
01:57:30,084 --> 01:57:31,252
Not even me?

1550
01:57:37,425 --> 01:57:40,178
What's the right answer to that?

1551
01:57:41,929 --> 01:57:42,972
Maybe…

1552
01:57:47,727 --> 01:57:49,645
Maybe just the truth.

1553
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:00,865
Yes, Stella.

1554
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:06,037
Even you.

1555
01:58:13,503 --> 01:58:15,379
But, Stella,

1556
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:18,674
I just want you to know

1557
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:22,804
that I admire and…

1558
01:58:22,887 --> 01:58:25,765
and I still respect you.

1559
01:58:27,558 --> 01:58:28,559
Okay?

1560
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:33,272
You have a special place

1561
01:58:34,065 --> 01:58:35,233
in my heart.

1562
01:58:46,369 --> 01:58:48,412
Looks like this is it, huh?

1563
01:58:52,166 --> 01:58:54,377
Looks like this is all we'll ever be.

1564
01:58:57,880 --> 01:59:01,592
Just… remedies for each other's wounds.

1565
01:59:02,301 --> 01:59:03,594
Don't…

1566
01:59:03,678 --> 01:59:07,390
Don't speak as if it's final.

1567
01:59:09,684 --> 01:59:11,394
Who knows, maybe

1568
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:16,691
fate still has a plot twist for us.

1569
01:59:18,776 --> 01:59:19,819
Maybe.

1570
01:59:22,363 --> 01:59:23,406
Maybe so.

1571
01:59:33,666 --> 01:59:35,001
Fidel…

1572
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:45,595
<i>Thank you for the joy</i>
<i>The laughter, the smiles</i>

1573
01:59:46,721 --> 01:59:51,267
<i>Thank you for the tears</i>
<i>The grief, all the trials</i>

1574
01:59:53,102 --> 01:59:58,316
<i>Though the verses of our poem end</i>

1575
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:05,072
<i>A new rhyme waits just 'round the bend</i>

1576
02:00:08,409 --> 02:00:10,203
Enjoy your life, okay?

1577
02:00:13,497 --> 02:00:16,959
With your new mindset,
I want you to enjoy.

1578
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:20,922
Don't think of me. Don't worry about me.

1579
02:00:24,508 --> 02:00:26,969
Write lots and lots of poems.

1580
02:00:28,429 --> 02:00:29,847
Lots of songs.

1581
02:00:30,848 --> 02:00:32,683
Even if they're not about me.

1582
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:39,315
If you need to forget me, do it all.

1583
02:00:48,157 --> 02:00:49,367
As long as…

1584
02:00:51,535 --> 02:00:53,704
I'm here,

1585
02:00:55,498 --> 02:00:56,499
whenever…

1586
02:00:59,126 --> 02:01:02,004
whenever you need help.

1587
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:17,311
<i>That there's not just one road to take</i>

1588
02:01:18,062 --> 02:01:23,484
<i>Not just one choice I have to make</i>

1589
02:01:23,567 --> 02:01:30,032
<i>Thanks to you, I finally know</i>

1590
02:01:30,116 --> 02:01:35,955
<i>I found the path that is my own</i>

1591
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:51,095
Von. Let's talk.

1592
02:01:55,391 --> 02:01:58,978
Go smoke outside, okay?
I just need to talk to this one.

1593
02:02:04,066 --> 02:02:07,028
What do you want, Stella?

1594
02:02:07,111 --> 02:02:08,946
I haven't confronted you yet,

1595
02:02:10,072 --> 02:02:11,907
after everything you did to me,

1596
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:14,076
since Ulan was gone.

1597
02:02:14,869 --> 02:02:18,539
Do you know that because of you,
I can't learn to love anymore?

1598
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:23,044
Stella, what the fuck?

1599
02:02:23,919 --> 02:02:25,421
You're still stuck there?

1600
02:02:26,756 --> 02:02:28,382
Look at me, I'm happy now.

1601
02:02:29,508 --> 02:02:31,510
-Move on already!
-I'm not done yet.

1602
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:35,014
Even after what you did to me,
I'll still thank you.

1603
02:02:35,723 --> 02:02:38,017
As cheesy as this may sound,

1604
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:40,227
if not for you, I wouldn't be strong.

1605
02:02:41,812 --> 02:02:43,898
Then I contributed a lot to your life.

1606
02:02:43,981 --> 02:02:44,982
Asshole!

1607
02:02:45,649 --> 02:02:46,692
What do you want?

1608
02:02:47,318 --> 02:02:48,652
For me to say sorry?

1609
02:02:48,736 --> 02:02:51,280
I don't need it.
I don't need your apology.

1610
02:02:52,198 --> 02:02:54,116
Now I can do everything myself, Von.

1611
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:56,702
In fact, I can even apologize to myself.

1612
02:02:59,413 --> 02:03:02,875
you didn't leave this bastard
even when he bared his horns."

1613
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:08,547
Von, I declare from this moment on,

1614
02:03:08,631 --> 02:03:10,424
you have no power over me.

1615
02:03:14,637 --> 02:03:15,805
Fuck you!

1616
02:03:17,056 --> 02:03:18,265
Idiot!

1617
02:03:18,349 --> 02:03:20,059
You delusional bitch!

1618
02:03:20,935 --> 02:03:22,561
What do you think, huh?

1619
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:25,815
You'll never find another man like me!
