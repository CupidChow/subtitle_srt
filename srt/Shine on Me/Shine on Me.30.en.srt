12
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,220
Hello?

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,180
Zhuang Xu.

14
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,220
You're missing out on the get-together.

15
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,340
It's rare to get everyone together
like this since graduation.

16
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:44,340
You're the only one missing.

18
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,660

Is that so?

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,300
Yeah.

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,500
Forget it.

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,759
Let's grab a drink next time.

23
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,120
Sure.

24
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,760
I heard that.

25
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,380
Zhuang said we're not done yet,

26
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,300
so there's going to be an after-party.

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:09,880
Chris,

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,140
birthday girl,

29
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,280
come on, make it happen.

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,220
Let me think.

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,320
Mia and I need
to take care of something,

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,280
so we'll pass.

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,100
Chris, it's your birthday.

35
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,340
You accepted the presents,

36
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,760
so now you've gotta do your part
and entertain.

37
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,200
Right.

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,780
We won't be joining you then.

Justin,

40
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,040
didn't you have something to do too?

41
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,360
Yeah...

42
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,960
I almost forgot.

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,380
I should get going as well.

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,579
What is wrong with you guys?

45
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Why is everyone being such a buzzkill?

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,300
Come on,

00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,120
it's the middle of the night.

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,079
What could you possibly have to do?

49
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,620
How about we all go see a movie?

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,680
There's a new blockbuster out
I haven't seen yet.

51
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,680
Exactly.

52
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,079
It's late. There's no way
you're that busy.

Let's go see a movie.

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,620
I've been wanting
to see the new release too.

- It's settled.

Sure.

Let's go.

60
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,920
Kevin,

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,540
are you a total blockhead?

62
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,300
Do you not know how to take a hint?

63
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,160
What?

64
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,740
You can't just insult me

65
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,520
because I have amnesia.

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,200
I...

67
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:27,320
Couldn't you tell

68
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,360
we were trying to give Zhuang and Chris

69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,200
some alone time?

70
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,960
Honestly,

71
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,400
even before the amnesia,
back at Changbai Mountain,

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,280
you were completely clueless,

73
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,240
always playing the third wheel.

74
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,380
And you're still doing it now.

75
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,780
You should've told me sooner.

76
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,920
Just watch me. I'll make up for it.

77
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,040
If I'd known
it was going to be this freezing,

78
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,579
I would've bundled up more.

79
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,720
I've noticed

80
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,380
that ever since you got

81
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,700
that call from your classmate,

82
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,740
you've been a bit out of it.

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,660
You want to head over there?

84
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,060
Seriously, go ahead.

85
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,780
Don't worry about us.

86
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,180
No.

87
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,880
They say a stroll under the moon

88
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,180
is the height of romance.

89
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,120
Too bad,

90
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,980
the guy I'm with doesn't have
a romantic bone in his body.

91
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:34,820
Chris.

92
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,260
Zhuang Xu,

93
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,360
there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

94
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,560
Are you

95
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,760
in love with your student's cousin?

96
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,720
Yes.

97
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,960
When I asked you at Changbai Mountain,

98
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,780
you dodged the question.

99
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,580
But now you're being so upfront.

100
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,140
Is it because you've picked up on

101
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,000
my feelings for you?

102
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,760
So,

103
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,460
is this your way of turning me down?

104
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,260
I'm so sorry, Chris.

105
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,080
Please,

106
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,820
what are you sorry for?

107
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,100
It's not like

108
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,159
you've done anything wrong.

109
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,940
But,

110
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,380
for the sake of my pride,

111
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,100
let's just act like this never happened.

112
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,740
Don't let the others find out.

113
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,060
Of course.

114
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,320
I guess I was a bit too impulsive,

115
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,160
wasn't I?

116
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,400
But that's just who I am.

117
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,140
I like things clear-cut.

118
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,480
Starting the new year with a clean slate

119
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,600
and no lingering what-ifs

120
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,460
is my birthday gift

121
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,080
to myself.

122
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,560
But Zhuang Xu,

123
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,020
I want to give you a gift too.

124
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,080
I don't know

125
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,680
what kind of misunderstanding there

126
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,120
is between you and her,

127
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,220
but...

128
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,080
she doesn't have a boyfriend.

129
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,320
Dr. Lin

130
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,420
is just one of her suitors.

131
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,659
At the café on the summit
of Changbai Mountain,

132
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,840
Kevin and I overheard the conversation

133
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,340
between him and your student.

134
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,760
What did you say?

135
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,880
Yeah.

136
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,240
You heard me.

137
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,760
The girl you like

138
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,620
is still single.

139
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,360
At the very least,
you were honest with me,

140
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,980
so I hope

141
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,760
you land the girl of your dreams.

142
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,020
Though, I have a feeling

143
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,820
Dr. Lin won't be easy to beat.

144
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,980
You'd better step up your game.

145
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,840
Seriously,

146
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,800
why are you two moving so slow?

147
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
We already picked out the seats.

148
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,500
There are only four in this row,

149
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,840
so you guys will have to
sit in the next one.

150
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,080
Works for me.

151
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,100
Or you and Justin

152
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,900
could move to the front.

153
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,680
Zhuang,

154
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,000
what do you say?

155
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,300
Where are you sitting?

156
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,220
Come pick a spot.

157
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,500
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,780
Something came up.

159
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,860
I have to go.

160
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,320
You're not coming?

161
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,820
Sorry.

162
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,140
Did I mess up again?

163
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,960
Why did he bolt?

164
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,500
Yeah, Chris,

165
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,380
what's

166
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,660
the deal?

167
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,560
How should I know?

168
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,679
It doesn't matter.

169
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,760
If he's not coming, so be it.

170
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,159
I'm the birthday girl,

171
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,520
and I'm still here, right?

172
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,539
Let's go.

173
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,900
Movies are on me.

174
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,100
I've invited Bai and Li Xin

175
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,820
over as well.

176
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,080
The more, the merrier, right?

177
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:57,920
Take it.

178
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,040
I'll be right back.

179
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,720
Xiguang,

180
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,300
Rong just texted me

181
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,580
asking where we are.

182
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,920
She told me earlier she was working late

183
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,680
and couldn't make it.

184
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,760
Well,

185
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,980
what do you think?

186
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,620
It's fine.

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,420
It's your birthday,
so it's totally your call.

188
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,020
Alright.

189
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:21,960
I'll send her

190
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,780
the address.

191
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,160
Come to think of it,

192
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,040
I have no idea

193
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,660
what's been going on

194
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,860
with Zhuang Xu and Rong.

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
Rong hasn't mentioned him

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,340
over dinner recently, not even a peep.

197
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:43,720
Is that so?

198
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,560
Dr. Lin

199
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,660
is just one of her suitors.

200
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,560
The girl you like

201
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,420
is still single.

202
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:34,960
Sir,

203
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,260
can we go a little faster?

Miss Siliang.

A big round of applause, everyone.

Nie Xiguang, Xie Xiaofeng,

217
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,280
don't just sit there
stuffing your faces.

218
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,040
Sing a few songs.

219
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,780
Come on.

220
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:29,940
No way.

221
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,760
Singing is the one thing

222
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,640
we're absolutely hopeless at.

223
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,540
You guys go ahead.

224
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,800
Save yourselves the ear torture.

225
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,520
Alright, who's next then?

226
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,380
I'll go.

227
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,780
These quail eggs in the braised platter

228
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,720
are amazing.

229
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,540
There are only five or six of them,

230
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:39,940
so eat up, quick.

231
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,200
Take it easy, would you?

232
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,320
Or there won't be any left
before we know it.

233
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,100
Got it.

234
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,260
I'll leave one for them.

235
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,340
[Yusen]
I was three minutes late on purpose,

236
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,760
and you didn't even notice?

237
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,280
Is it possible

238
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,580
I was just waiting for you to confess,

239
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,360
but you actually turned it around
on me instead?

240
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,140
So, were you brave enough to sing today?

241
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,680
Nope.

242
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,680
But I was brave enough to polish off

243
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,580
a ton of duck tongues and fruit.

244
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,180
That's a shame.

245
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,100
The food here is actually pretty bad.

246
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,620
I was thinking of

247
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,700
taking my girlfriend out
for a late-night snack later.

248
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,120
Even though your girlfriend is stuffed,

249
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,660
she can still keep you company.

250
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,460
How did your meeting
with the professors go today?

251
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,180
It went really well.

252
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,760
Professor Elio said

253
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,700
he wants to explain
the whole blind date thing

254
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,340
to you personally.

255
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,520
Look who's here.

256
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,120
Let's welcome the belle
of Jiangning University

257
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,900
Business School, Ye Rong.

258
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,000
Here you are.

259
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,600
Your gift.

260
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,420
Happy Birthday.

261
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,240
Thanks.

262
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,720
Come here.

263
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,720
You didn't even come to dinner,

264
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,960
and yet you got me
such an expensive gift?

265
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,220
I thought it looked nice,
so I picked it up for you.

266
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,860
Boss.

267
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,080
Xiaofeng.

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,120
Xiguang, you're here too.

269
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,200
I happened to be in Shanghai.

270
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,400
I'm the one who found out.

271
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,660
Turns out she only invited Xiaofeng

272
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,100
and didn't bother asking us to hang out.

273
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,400
Really?

274
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,180
I just had some errands to run

275
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,820
near Xiaofeng's school,

276
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,620
so I dragged her along

277
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,600
to keep me company.

278
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,300
Oh, so I was just a tag-along?

279
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,220
Why are you joining in too?

280
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,120
Ye Rong,

281
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,740
is the pay at Shengyuan
really that high?

282
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,620
Your outfit looks like

283
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,740
it cost a fortune.

284
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,020
Is your company hiring?

285
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,240
Can you give me a referral?

286
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,620
Can you guys let us girls talk

287
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,260
without jumping in?

288
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,800
Zhuo Hui,

289
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,400
why don't you guys go play pool
over there?

290
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,360
We're going to catch up for a bit.

291
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,820
Alright buddies,

292
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,140
let's go start a game.

293
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,720
Let's go.

294
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,260
We all came to Shanghai for work,

295
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,680
but why do I feel like

296
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,280
I'm still such a country bumpkin?

297
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,320
Rong is looking
so polished and chic lately.

298
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,800
It's probably because she's slim.

299
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,940
Xie Xiaofeng,

300
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,960
I'm warning you.

301
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,000
Don't poke where it hurts.

302
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,740
I was talking about myself!

303
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,840
Is this a new bag?

304
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,420
I haven't seen you with this one before.

305
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,400
Yeah, I just got it last month.

306
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,800
Did you buy it yourself,

307
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,600
or...?

308
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,620
I bought it myself.

309
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,940
My year-end bonus
was actually pretty good.

310
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,420
Unlike you, I don't have

311
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,440
a boyfriend to buy things for me.

312
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,840
I don't have anyone
buying me things either.

313
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,500
Stop teasing me.

314
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,140
It really makes a difference
when you're with the right firm.

315
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,040
I wouldn't even dream of

316
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,320
a bag this expensive on my salary.

317
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,940
The most important thing
is following the right boss.

318
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,640
I got lucky

319
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,320
and picked the right side
as soon as I joined the company.

320
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,920
But it is exhausting indeed.

321
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,020
I've been helping my boss

322
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,460
with a project

323
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,120
for Fengteng Group,

324
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,500
working overtime every day.

325
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,520
Otherwise,

326
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,500
I wouldn't have been this late.

327
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,480
Everything's exhausting.

328
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,920
At least your paycheck
makes it worth it.

329
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,900
Once I hit my one-year mark here,

330
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,180
I'm definitely switching jobs.

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,480
True.

332
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,540
Boss,

333
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,560
are you still at that trading company?

334
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,600
Yeah. I've got a mortgage to pay,

335
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,560
so I don't dare make any sudden moves.

336
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:15,820
Xiguang,

337
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,440
are you still doing PV in Suzhou?

338
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,120
The way the PV market is right now...

339
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,560
I heard

340
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,460
Shengyuan has already cut ties
with Shuangyuan.

341
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,980
With your resources,

342
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,980
you could do anything.

343
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,680
Why stay in Suzhou

344
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,680
and grind it out in PV?

345
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,320
Just because the real estate market
is booming

346
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,700
doesn't mean

347
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,100
everyone should flock there at once.

348
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,160
Someone has to stick with the industries

349
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,740
that are out of favor.

350
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,640
We all have our own missions.

351
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,080
Besides, I find

352
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,880
the new energy sector quite interesting.

353
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
I like doing things

354
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,280
that are challenging.

355
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,980
I guess I was overthinking it.

356
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,000
With so much room for error,

357
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,780
you really can afford
to just follow your whims.

358
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,080
I wouldn't say
I have "much room for error".

359
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,660
Time is the one thing that costs

360
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,460
everyone the same.

361
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,640
Besides,

362
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,000
manufacturing requires
a huge investment.

363
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
If you mess up once,

364
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,940
you could go straight into bankruptcy.

365
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,160
There are plenty of examples of that.

366
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,520
Xiguang,

367
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,460
don't jinx yourself.

368
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,340
Who in their right mind
talks about going bankrupt?

369
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,080
What jinx?

370
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,500
It's just expecting the unexpected.

371
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,480
My parents started from nothing

372
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,320
and fought their way up

373
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,160
through countless failures.

374
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,420
If I don't pull my weight

375
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,020
and I fail,

376
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,000
it's just returning wealth to society

377
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,800
so that more capable people
can take the lead.

378
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,200
Xiguang,

379
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,360
after working for six months,

380
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,920
your mindset
is on a whole different level.

381
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,020
Seriously,

382
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,960
you sound like

383
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,720
a real powerhouse in the making.

384
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,400
So you guys noticed?

385
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,220
Does that mean
I'm already exuding "boss energy"

386
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,800
before I've even made it?

387
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,020
Alright,

388
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,340
while they're playing pool,

389
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,400
let's get some singing in.

390
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,060
If we wait until they're back,
we won't get a turn.

391
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,440
They're all total mic hogs.

392
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,480
Queue up a few songs for me.

393
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,080
You know

394
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,820
my playlist.

395
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,100
Of course.

396
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,040
Your beloved oldies.

397
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,940
Zhuang Xu, you finally made it.

398
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,700
Zhuo Hui.

399
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,560
I thought you said you couldn't make it.

400
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,640
Welcome.

401
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,700
I didn't expect our big heartthrob

402
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,620
to show up today.

403
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,180
The two of you

404
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,760
arriving back-to-back like this.

405
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,520
You sure you didn't come together?

406
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,660
- No.
- No.

407
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,960
I just finished another gathering,

408
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,180
so I'm only getting here now.

409
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,320
Sorry about that.

410
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,940
This was a bit last minute.

411
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,800
Happy Birthday.

412
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,240
Thanks.

413
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,780
Zhuang Xu has to
do a punishment shot first!

414
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,980
- Drink up!
- Drink up!

415
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,060
That's what you get
for being the last one to arrive.

416
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,460
If I'd known there was a "late tax,"

417
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,520
I would've just couriered

418
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,280
the gift.

419
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,560
Come on, quick.

420
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,720
Hurry up.

421
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,780
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

422
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,340
- Great!
- Great!

423
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,680
Sit down.

424
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,220
Come on, hurry.

425
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,020
It's my song.

426
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,380

If you guys know any decent girls,

431
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,060
set me up.

432
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,960
I'm still out here struggling

433
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,600
while every one of you

434
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,400
is coupled up.

435
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,520
Isn't Zhuang Xu still single too?

436
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,380
What's the rush?

437
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,980
He's single by choice.

438
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,120
I'm single because I have no choice.

439
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,080
How is that even the same thing?

440
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,760
You had better explain yourself.

441
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,940
What exactly have you been telling
the professors

442
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,560
about me?

443
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,820
Right before we headed
into the restaurant today,

444
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,420
I happened to see

445
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,600
Nie Xiguang's boyfriend
dropping her off.

446
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,360
They even shared a kiss.

447
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,080
I didn't know where to look

448
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,040
and just hurried inside.

449
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,400
It was so sweet though.

450
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,520
You haven't had enough to drink yet,
have you?

451
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,180
Maybe you've had too little.
Just drink up and shut it.

452
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,020
Give me a break.

453
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,600
What are you doing?

454
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,580
You've been glued to your phone
messaging this whole time.

455
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,860
It's been a good long while, okay?

456
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,160
Let me get a toast in with Zhuang Xu.

457
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,740
Come on.

458
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,360
- Come on.
- Alright.

459
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,660
Come on, Zhuang Xu.

460
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,000
Bottoms up, everyone.

461
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,360
Awesome!

462
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,720
Love it.

463
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,640
- Nice.
- Marvelous.

464
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,340
Who picked Faith?

465
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,280
I did.

466
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:43,940
Skip it.

467
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,760
I've had too much to drink
and I can't hit the notes anymore.

468
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,500
How much did you guys drink?

469
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,520
You're tossing it back like water.

470
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,500
Can't blame us this time.

471
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,140
Zhuang Xu started it.

472
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't buy it.

473
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,640
I'd believe anything before I believe
Zhuang Xu was the ringleader.

474
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,040
It was me.

475
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,380
They're all just having a blast.
Let them be.

476
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,520
Skip it, next song.

477
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,360
Xigua,

478
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,020
you really like

479
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,640
this song, right?

480
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,480
I'll take this one.

481
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,600
Unbelievable.

482
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,480
Our big heartthrob

483
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,320
is actually going to sing.

484
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,960
He's sung this one before,

485
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,420
when we went to karaoke
before graduation.

486
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,580
Wait, wasn't that place full?

487
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,400
I thought we never went.

488
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,680
My bad, I must be mixing it up.

489
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,880
It was another time later on

490
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,040

Will do.

559
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,660
- Bye Xiguang.
- Bye.

560
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,180
Bye.

561
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,960
Why isn't he done yet?

562
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,240
So many little bunnies.

563
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,860
You're so tiny.

564
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,200
Are your mom and dad

565
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,140
in there too?

566
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,020
So cute.

567
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,140
Nie Xiguang.

568
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,580
Would it be okay if I didn't sing that

569
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,900
under your balcony?

570
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,000
How did you know?

571
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,700
On New Year's Day,

572
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,880
you and Lin Yusen weren't a thing,

573
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,500
were you?

574
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,220
Why did you lie to me?

575
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,260
It doesn't even matter anymore.

576
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,980
We're a thing now.

577
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,620
Is that so?

578
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,420
I figured as much.

579
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,520
But back then,

580
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,440
why lie to me?

581
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,280
After graduation,

582
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,740
I thought you'd work in Shanghai.

583
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,920
I even submitted a few résumés

584
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,480
for you at the job fair

585
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,520
that were all close to Huaya.

586
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,680
But you never showed up.

587
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,780
I couldn't help but call you,

588
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,820
but your phone was always off.

589
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,480
I tried Jiang Rui too,

590
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,380
but same thing.

591
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,500
Later, I went back to Nanjing

592
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,540
and stopped by Jiang Rui's place.

593
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,760
Ms. Zhang told me

594
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,080
that both of you
had gone abroad to study.

595
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,000
Then it's our meeting on New Year's Day.

596
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,840
You told me

597
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,720
you were already with someone else

598
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,940
and that the trip was just a study tour.

599
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,900
And now, someone tells me

600
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
you two weren't even together back then.

601
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,760
What did I do wrong, Nie Xiguang?

602
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,680
I could have accepted
a hundred different reasons,

603
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,480
but don't you feel any regret

604
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,180
to miss out like this?

605
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,880
I don't get

606
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,040
what you are trying to say.

607
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,720
But there is one thing

608
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,980
I've always wanted to clear up with you.

609
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,020
Go ahead.

610
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,420
Back in college,

611
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,680
I asked Ye Rong about you two.

612
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,620
She told me

613
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:36,740
you were just neighbors

614
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,920
who barely knew each other.

615
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,600
That's the only reason
I confessed to you.

616
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,960
I never had any intention

617
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,080
of stealing someone else's guy.

618
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,220
I texted you back then

619
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,300
to explain everything,

620
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,520
but you never replied.

621
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,220
Did you ever get that message?

622
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,260
I did.

623
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:01,880
But I...

624
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,840
Well then, I have no regrets now.

625
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,940
I've cleared my name.

626
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,980
I'm good now.

627
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,460
I'm getting off here.

628
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,440
Please wait for the next one.

Nie Xiguang.

648
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,120
Nie Xiguang.

649
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,780
Nie Xiguang.

650
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,600
I'm so sorry.

651
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,380
I know I messed up big time.

652
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,740
I had so many misconceptions about you,

653
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,880
and I've been trying to make it up.

654
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,820
I thought once I got to Shanghai,

655
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,520
we could start over.

656
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,720
I thought I still had time.

657
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,320
But the second we graduated,
you vanished.

658
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,220
I looked everywhere for you.

659
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,240
I thought you'd gone abroad.

660
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,620
I went to Jiang Rui's place to find you,

661
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,060
but Ms. Zhang told me
you were studying overseas.

662
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,880
Nie Xiguang, you said it yourself.

663
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Back at graduation, you said

664
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,560
the "big grape" would come back.

665
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,000
Let go of me.

666
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,040
I know I shouldn't be doing this.

667
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,720
You're with someone else now.

668
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,240
I shouldn't have come here
just to humiliate myself.

669
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,940
All my life,
I've been terrified of losing.

670
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,360
But Nie Xiguang,

671
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,420
I've already lost everything.

672
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,940
What else is there to lose?

673
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,880
You think I've lost my mind, don't you?

674
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,640
Of course I have!

675
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,240
Otherwise,
how could I have lost control?

676
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,820
I've been holding it in for so long.

677
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,400
I can't tell you how many times I wanted

678
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,120
to find you.

679
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,360
In Changbai Mountain, or right here,

680
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,080
but I held back.

681
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,200
Nie Xiguang,

682
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,980
I've been fighting this
every single day.

683
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,060
But why tell me now

684
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,680
that you weren't even together

685
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,360
on New Year's Day?

686
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,260
How am I supposed to accept that?

687
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,580
Why do I keep missing my chance?

688
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,240
The world has been so unfair to me,

689
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,580
and so have you.

690
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,240
Whether you can accept it or not

691
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,680
has nothing to do with me.

692
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,460
Why did I lie to you

693
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,300
on New Year's Day?

694
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:53,920
Can't you just stop

695
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,080
and think for a second?

696
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,540
For a big-shot investment banker,

697
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,660
you shouldn't be this forgetful.

698
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,100
I don't know

699
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,140
what's gotten into you today,

700
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,680
but it doesn't matter anymore.

701
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,620
I have a boyfriend.

702
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,500
So please, keep your distance

703
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,740
as a fellow alumnus.

704
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,100
Don't say

705
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,180
such inappropriate things to me.

706
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,100
Inappropriate?

707
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,480
Now you're telling me
it's inappropriate?

708
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,380
Weren't you the one being inappropriate

709
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,060
from the very start?

710
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,520
You knew we weren't a match,

711
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,340
yet you were so obsessed

712
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,320
with forcing your way into my life.

713
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,260
And then, the moment I finally gave in,

714
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,480
you just walked away and disappeared.

715
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,180
If you could be inappropriate

716
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,060
back then,

717
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,220
why can't I be now?

718
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,240
Zhuang Xu, stop lying to yourself.

719
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,080
Is it really that hard

720
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,220
to reach out to someone?

721
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,120
If our phone is off,

722
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,460
is that really the end of it?

723
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,700
You say you misunderstood me,

724
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,060
but what right do you have to say that?

725
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,420
Just because of some gossip?

726
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,880
We spent so much time together.

727
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,780
I did so much

728
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,760
and said so much.

729
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,280
Were you just blind and deaf?

730
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,520
With your IQ and EQ,

731
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,960
did you really see nothing
through it all?

732
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,480
You just didn't want to.

733
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,380
You just took advantage of my feelings.

734
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,300
I didn't even know

735
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,680
I was the "big grape."

736
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,520
But even if

737
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,720
I had understood back then,

738
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,560
why should I be the one
to come crawling back?

739
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,920
So there was never

740
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,820
a "missing chance."

741
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,760
Even if there hadn't been
a misunderstanding on New Year's Day,

742
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,000
I still would have chosen him.

743
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,600
No.

744
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,580
It wasn't even a choice.

745
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,420
You say...

746
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,080
you still have feelings for him.

747
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,540
That's fine.

748
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,860
Take your pick.

749
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,060
When he walked into my life,

750
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,280
saying honestly
about his feelings for me,

751
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,160
it was never about making a choice.

752
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,600
I was always going to end up with him.

Excuse me, miss.

You look like

777
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,320
a lost little girl.

778
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,380
Why did you come

779
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,260
all the way out here for me?

780
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,240
Something upset you

781
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,640
at the birthday party?

782
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,380
No.

783
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,900
Well...

784
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,500
My feet just led me here.

785
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,560
I want to go back soon.

786
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,940
In a bit.

787
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,740
But...

788
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,420
why don't you go say hi to Professor Xi

789
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,200
and Professor Elio?

790
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,140
Lovely lady.

791
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,720
You must be the girlfriend

792
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,820
Vincent went to the ends

793
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,940
of the earth to finally find.

794
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,620
So please, don't be mad at him

795
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,440
about the blind date.

796
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,240
I was the one who forced him.

797
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,900
I promise you,

798
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,660
Vincent

799
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,580
is a man

800
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,020
of true integrity.

801
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,780
Okay,

802
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,140
my esteemed professor,

803
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,740
thanks for your recommendation.

804
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,560
Professor Elio's Chinese is impressive.

805
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,640
Elio used to be

806
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,740
Professor Xi's student.

807
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,160
He spent years grinding away

808
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,960
at his Chinese just to pursue her.

809
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,300
Her student?

810
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,020
He started out

811
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,240
in Computer Engineering.

812
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,020
But by chance,

813
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,680
he sat in on one
of Professor Xi's lectures.

814
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,760
After that, he actually went all out
to catch up on medicine.

815
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,760
Eventually,

816
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,180
he managed to become

817
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Professor Xi's student.

818
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,660
Even though he didn't start chasing her

819
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,480
until after graduation,

820
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,140
we all say he had

821
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,580
some ulterior motives.

822
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,800
How could you guys

823
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,760
say that about him?

824
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,980
Actually,

825
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,520
that's exactly how Elio

826
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,020
used to smugly describe himself.

827
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,560
Well.

828
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,700
Looks like Professor Elio's Chinese

829
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,360
still has plenty of room
for improvement.

830
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,760
So, how did your talk

831
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,680
with the professors go today?

832
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,400
Pretty good.

833
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,140
I'm really interested

834
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,840
in brain-computer interfaces.

835
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,820
Back in school,

836
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,180
I even took some extra courses

837
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,520
in Bioengineering for it.

838
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,100
But BCI

839
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,620
covers a lot of ground,

840
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,000
involving everything
from computer science

841
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,300
to neuroscience.

842
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,660
I'm planning

843
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,940
to do some systematic studying soon.

844
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,600
You even minored in Bioengineering?

845
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,860
Didn't you say

846
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,880
you were so busy in school

847
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,460
that you didn't even have time to date?

848
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,560
Well, mystery solved.

849
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,420
That's exactly why I was so busy.

850
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,080
That makes sense.

851
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,300
The logic holds up.

852
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,780
It's because you're a total brainiac.

853
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,240
You're too kind.

854
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,280
Your boyfriend just has broad interests

855
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,300
and doesn't need much sleep,

856
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,800
so I have more time on my hands.

857
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,580
I'm far from being a brainiac.

858
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,480
Since when did you get so humble?

859
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,980
Are you saying
I'm not usually the humble type?

860
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,260
I was just joking.

861
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,960
I'm actually quite modest deep down.

862
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,720
Probably because

863
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,000
I've met some real geniuses.

864
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,900
Don't be so hard

865
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,180
on yourself.

866
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
So, when do you plan

867
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,420
on joining Professor Xi's team?

868
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,400
I told the professor

869
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,800
that I can only join

870
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,480
once I've wrapped things up

871
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,540
at the company.

872
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,200
Will that delay

873
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,740
your work with the professor?

874
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,620
Not really.

875
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
They just got back,

876
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,460
so they'll need some time

877
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,200
to set up the lab

878
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,260
and put the team together.

879
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,840

Nothing much.

[Shuangyuan Photovoltaic]

887
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,160
It's finally warming up.

888
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,000
This winter felt like it lasted forever.

889
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,480
I'm so over wearing heavy coats.

890
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,020
Oh, by the way, Xiguang,

891
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,900
Yuhua and I found

892
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,180
a dry cleaner that's a total steal.

893
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,520
Do you want to drop off

894
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,660
your winter clothes with ours?

895
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,760
Sure.

896
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,620
If we bring in a big batch,

897
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,760
do we get a group discount?

898
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,560
Of course we do.

899
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,720
But honestly, hearing that from you

900
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,440
doesn't really go with

901
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
the whole "heiress" thing, does it?

902
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,520
Keep talking like that

903
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,540
and lunch is no longer on me.

904
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,620
What about Mr. Lin then?

905
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,020
If you're not treating,

906
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,260
I'm sure Mr. Lin wouldn't mind
picking up the tab.

907
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,580
Mr. Lin always does
whatever his girlfriend says.

908
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,320
So I'll be at the plant all morning

909
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,700
and grabbing lunch over there.

910
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:06,940
Got it.

911
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,400
Classic.

I know, the lock screen
is just so sweet.

915
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,020
I'm showing you

that it's not office hours yet.

917
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,540
So,

918
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,640
this is just a boyfriend

919
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,800
checking in.

920
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,860
Xiguang,

921
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,640
you've changed.

922
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,100
You're not the shy girl anymore.

923
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,480
I can't believe you're actually flexing
your relationship back at us.

924
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,700
I had to level up.

925
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,940
Alright, back to work.

are you at work yet?

929
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:58,960
I just started.

930
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,280
I'm calling you

931
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,300
during office hours

932
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,300
on purpose

933
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,080
because I've actually got some business

934
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,780
to discuss.

935
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:05,980
Business?

936
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:06,940
Right.

937
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,900
Chengrui is bidding

938
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,740
for the design

939
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,200
of the Fengteng Group's

940
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,820
Suzhou Intelligent Digital Center.

941
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,200
After visiting your company last time,

942
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,860
I had a sudden spark of inspiration.

943
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,180
I want to collaborate

944
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,980
and incorporate the BIPV concept

945
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,940
into the architectural design to create

946
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,100
a green, energy-efficient building.

947
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,920
I was wondering
if you guys would be interested

948
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,620
in partnering up?

949
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,160
Of course we are.

950
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,520
Then see

951
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,280
when you're free.

952
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,660
I'll bring my design team over

953
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,500
to your office

954
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,100
so we can all sit down and talk about

955
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:33,840
the feasibility of the plan.

956
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,180
We're free anytime.

957
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:35,960
Great.

958
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,400
Suzhou is just a stone's throw away.

959
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,520
We'll be there this afternoon.

960
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:39,920
