Lin Yusen has a thing for her,

never mentioned her by name,

50
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,280
Lin Yusen was under the impression

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,820
that I was the one inviting him
to Wuxi all along.

52

But

119
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,320

Shao Jiaqi said he's a surgeon.

122
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,700

126
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,600
How could you be so thick-headed?

127
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,200
Why on earth would he blame you?

128
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
The accident was his own fault.

129

133
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,320

After all, his last name isn't Sheng.

144
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,680

A car crash, seriously?

163
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,540
You know, young folks are so flighty.

164

Speeding around just for kicks,

165
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,660
and then, boom.

166
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,600
Anyway, enough about him.

167
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,520
I'll have some top-shelf stuff
waiting for you.

169
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,660
I'll head over to Shanghai to meet you.

170
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,120
The Sheng family doesn't know about you.

171
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,620
Odds are that Lin

172
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,740
felt like he'd lose face,

173
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,480
so he kept his mouth shut.

174
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,620
Besides, he's totally fine.

175
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,220
Since that's the case,

176
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,400
let's just act

177
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,320

178
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,720

179
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,380
You're amazing.

180
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,640
You didn't even have to
ask a single question.

181
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,860
But you have got everything sorted out.

182
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,620
Next time something comes up,
just give me a heads-up sooner.

183
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,220
Should we

184
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,540
tell Mom about this?

00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,060
She's fragile.

188
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,500
No need to stress her out.

189
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,420
Head over to the villa.

190
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,679
Mom.

191
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,340
Check

192
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,360
this out.

193
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,700
Who gave you that?

194
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,120
Is someone trying to woo you?

195
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,240
No.

196
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,700
Qian gave it to me.

197
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,360
She was in Wuxi today
with Luo Ke and Mr. Zhao

198
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,260
for a little trip.

199
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,840
We all grabbed a bite together

200
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,780
and she just handed me this.

201
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,740
Said she accidentally bought
a duplicate.

202
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,600
That's a pretty flashy gift.

203
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,500
What's her deal anyway?

204
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,420
Is she solid?

205
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,960
Totally.

206
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,380
Her family runs
a massive factory in Suzhou.

207
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,480
She took us

208
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,920
on a tour.

209
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,780
We had lunch
in their private VIP lounge,

210
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,240
and the staff

211
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,760
were literally treating her
like royalty.

212
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,360
And Mr. Zhao

213
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,520
is even more loaded

214
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,580
and has got deep connections as well.

215
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,980
They've been

216
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,340
getting into some new investment lately

217
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,280
and made a killing.

218
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,960
Qian said she's putting in
a little seed money to test the waters,

219
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,400
and if it pays off,

220
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,380
she'll let me in on the action.

221
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,700
Hey Mom,

222
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,460
remember when Mr. Nie said

223
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,960
he was going to give you some cash?
Did he ever come through?

224
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,300
He gave me a chunk.

225
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,720
But it was barely more
than what we spent

226
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,060
on those clothes and shoes
the other day.

227
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,620
He's here. Get upstairs.

228
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,860
Chengyuan?

229
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,200
What are you doing here?

230
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,360
Tell your "good" daughter,

231
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,100
Ma Nianyuan,

232
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,020
to get out here.

233
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,520
I'll get her right away.

234
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,400
Nianyuan,

235
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,780
get down here now. Mr. Nie is here.

236
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,220
Coming.

237
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,300
He is furious with you.

238
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,340
Stop it.

239
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,760
Mr. Nie, you're here.

240
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,740
I bought

241
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,600
some imported cherries today.

242
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,320
They're delicious.

243
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,760
Let me go grab some for you.

244
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,500
Nianyuan bought them
specifically for you.

245
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,820
She's been dying for you to come over.

246
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,440
I...

247
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,780
How dare you lie to me?

248
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,740
Chengyuan, what's wrong?

249
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,500
Hey, don't get worked up.

250
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,120
How could Nianyuan ever have
the guts to lie to you?

251
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,480
Mr. Nie, I swear I didn't.

252
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,120
Why on earth would I lie to you?

253
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,000
Level with me.

254
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,540
Two years ago,

255
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,020
when you set up that meeting
with Lin Yusen in Wuxi,

256
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,020
what really went down?

257
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,920
What did you tell Shao Jiaqi?

258
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,080
Did you actually tell him

259
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,220
you were my daughter?

260
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,280
I never said that.

261
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,720
Shao Jiaqi just got the wrong idea.

262
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,480
The "wrong idea"?

263
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,740
And you didn't think
to set him straight?

264
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,220
I...

265
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,780
I...

266
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,200
Fine.

267
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,940
Just great.

268
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,900
It's crystal clear to me

269
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,460
you played him on purpose.

270
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,980
You even had the balls

271
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,720
to say Lin Yusen was into you

272
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,320
and asked you out.

273
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,380
When really, you were

274
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,600
the one who went crawling to Shao Jiaqi,

275
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,280
wasn't it?

276
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,220
I've really been raising a total snake.

277
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,940
You didn't even show your face

278
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,960
after Lin Yusen's accident.

279
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,140
You let him pin it all on me,

280
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,660
and he's been tanking my projects
ever since.

281
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,620
It cost the company a fortune,

282
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,560
and I didn't even hold it against you.

283
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,580
But I never thought

284
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,180
you'd go as far as posing
as my daughter

285
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,940
just to throw Xiguang under the bus!

286
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,740
You...

287
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,400
Chengyuan.

288
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,240
What's wrong?

289
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,900
You're scaring me, Chengyuan.

290
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,120
If she messed up, then tear into her,

291
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,820
but don't let it get to you!

292
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,400
You're the only one

293
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,160
I've got to lean on now!

294
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,640
I've been home

295
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,500
praying for you every single day,

296
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,280
hoping you'd stay safe and sound.

297
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,120
Please, don't scare me like this.

298
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,940
This isn't your problem.

299
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,640
Of course it is.

300
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,900
It's my fault for being a lousy mother.

301
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,860
My health's been a wreck.

302
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,140
I just didn't have the strength
to keep her in line.

303
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,300
And I never managed to get her

304
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,440
a decent dad.

305
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,320
Chengyuan.

306
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,420
You can't let anything happen to you.

307
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,660
You're all I have left.

308
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,960
All right.

309
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,920
It's fine.

310
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,920
But I'm washing my hands

311
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
of her for good.

312
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,740
You're not

313
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,760
staying the night?

314
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,700
I can't even look at her right now.

315
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,560
Then I won't hold you up.

316
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,300
I'm gonna give her a serious earful.

317
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,480
Go home and try to get some sleep.

318
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,500
How did I raise

319
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,880
someone as stupid as you?

320
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,740
A guy that high-caliber

321
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,340
comes to see you,

322
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,140
gets into a wreck on the way,

323
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,260
and you don't even bother
to go look after him?

324
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,520
I...

325
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,900
I said something

326
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,920
that made Shao Jiaqi think

327
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,380
I was Mr. Nie's daughter.

328
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,880
That has to be why

329
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,860
he agreed to come to Wuxi.

330
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,440
I figured

331
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,060
we'd get to know each other first,

332
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and even if he found out

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,460
the truth later,

334
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
he wouldn't be too mad

335
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,140
with a pretty girl like me into him.

336
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,680
Plus, I could use him

337
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,000
to network and meet more people.

338
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,780
Who knew he'd end up in a car crash?

339
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,520
Shao Jiaqi said it was bad.

340
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,620
He can't even be a surgeon anymore.

341
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,560
So you got cold feet?

342
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:28,760
Scared he'd find out

343
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,220
you aren't Nie Chengyuan's daughter

344
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,740
and take it out on you?

345
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,500
And you didn't dare

346
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,720
tell Nie Chengyuan the truth either.

347
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,900
Well, look at you now.

348
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,500
The cat's out of the bag anyway.

349
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,500
You only managed to hide it
for two years

350
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
because that man was decent enough

351
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,400
not to come looking

352
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,440
for "Nie Chengyuan's daughter"

353
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,780
or tell the Sheng family.

354
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,220
Otherwise,
you wouldn't have lasted a day.

355
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,700
You think you'd still be sitting here?

356
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,680
Even I'd be kicked out on the street.

357
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,380
Listen,

358
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
what's done is done.

359
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,060
You can't run from it.

360
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,380
Why didn't you double down?

361
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,920
Men are at their most vulnerable

362
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,180
when they're hurt.

363
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,260
If you had gone to look after him

364
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,420
and given him a sincere apology,

365
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,300
you could've actually had a shot.

366
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,580
After all,

367
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,520
his career as a surgeon is over,
that's all,

368
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,740
but that's about it, right?

369
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
With the Sheng family backing him,

370
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
he can do whatever he wants.

371
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,960

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,620
Impressive. Expanding in this climate?

742
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,680
Now that's what I call an entrepreneur

743
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,380
with vision.

744
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Sure, Europe and the U.S.
might not be buying anymore,

745
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,780
but we still have

746
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,440
our massive domestic market,

747
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,240
especially out here.

748
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,260
It's getting clearer every day

749
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,800
that the government
is shifting its focus

750
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,840
back to the Northwestern China.

751
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,240
PV stations in the desert

752
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,560
are definitely going
to be popping up everywhere.

753
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,320
We might be a bit out of the way,

754
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,540
but when it comes to sunlight,

755
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,480
nobody beats us.

756
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,120
Exactly.

757
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,700
The long daylight hours out here

758
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,120
make it the perfect spot
for solar power.

759
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,000
You bet.

760
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,360
It's winter now,

761
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,660
so the days are short.

762
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,900
But in the summer,

763
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,340
the first light of dawn

764
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,100
hits your house

765
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,160
as early as 4 AM.

766
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,460
Eat up.

767
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,219
Come on.

768
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,780
Lin,

769
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,159
since you're already out here scouting,

770
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,159
you must be looking to start

771
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:21,940
a project in the area, right?

772
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,380
Who knows, maybe you'll be building

773
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,679
a power station here soon

774
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,659
and we'll

775
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,739
all cross paths again.

776
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,179
I sure hope so.

777
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,060
Come on.

778
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,219
This is where we're staying.

779
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,340
It's a great bang for your buck,

780
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,120
and the owner is super welcoming.

781
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,179
Hey.

782
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,440
Brought you a guest.

783
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,900
Give him the same deal
you gave us, alright?

784
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,800
You got it.

785
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,120
Who's checking in?

786
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:58,960
He is.

787
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,620
ID, please.

788
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,700
Here you go.

789
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,080
Perfect.

790
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:02,920
Okay.

791
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,920
Hang on a sec.

792
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,440
Sure.

793
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,700
Lin,

794
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,840
we're picking up our car tomorrow

795
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,560
and heading back to Lanzhou.

796
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,240
How about you?

797
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,660
I'm staying one more day,
then heading to Lanzhou too.

798
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,380
Shame we can't

799
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,360
stick around for another day.

800
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,900
The trip would've been
a lot more lively with you.

801
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:17,840
No rush.

802
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,940
Like you said,

803
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,720
our company

804
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,580
might be doing projects
out here someday.

805
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,760
We'll grab a drink together then.

806
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,200
Now that sounds like a plan.

807
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,060
Yeah, absolutely.

808
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,440
Yeah, we didn't even get our fill today.

809
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,080

these envelopes and postcards.

812
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,840
A bit too artsy-fartsy for my taste,

813
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,880
but if you like them,

814
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,780
feel free to take some.

815
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,040
These are actually quite beautiful.

816
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,480
Thank you.

817
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,260
