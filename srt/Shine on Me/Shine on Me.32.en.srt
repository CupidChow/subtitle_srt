Wow, there's more today.

13
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,039
Mr. Lin has been ordering us

14

snacks and milk tea
for three days straight.

some kind of special occasion?

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,420
I guess so.

Xiguang,

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,160
is your boyfriend

23
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,920

24
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,000
I have no idea.

25
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,580
Maybe his family had
a massive red bean harvest.

27

Hello there,

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,000
our generous Mr. Lin.

29

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:26,940
Thanks.

31

Take a seat.

32

It's been a long trip.

It's fine.

- Here are the documents.
- Thanks.

36
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,740
Wang asked me to come along too.

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,060
That's right. Take a look.

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,220
We could use some feedback.

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,660
Alright.

40
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,380
Come on, have a seat.

41
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,079
Let's get started.

42
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,600
Sure.

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,579
This is the result

44
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,480
of integrating

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,960
the PV system

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,160
into our original design.

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,320
The PV modules

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,540
are mainly installed on the roof

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,260
and the side elevations.

50
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,900
On the sides,

51
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,300
they function as sunshades.

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,520
Take a look

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,480
and give us your thoughts.

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,560
I think there might be an issue here.

55
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,640
If the spacing between the modules

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,860
on the lower part
of the building is off,

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,020
it could cause

58
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,720
localized shadows

59
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,260
when the light shifts.

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,340
Those shaded areas

61
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,780
won't just stop working.

62
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,300
They'll actually consume power

63
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,860
from other cells and turn it into heat.

64
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,560
This leads to localized overheating,

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,660
triggering the "hot spot effect,"

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,240
which degrades the performance

67
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,060
and lifespan of the PV modules.

68
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,220
While we can use

69
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,220
bypass diodes

70
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,880
to mitigate the effect,

71
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,980
the risk

72
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,680
is still quite high.

73
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,160
I see.

74
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,840
I thought our communication

75
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,720
was thorough enough,

76
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,440
but I didn't expect

77
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,740
this kind of problem to pop up.

78
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,100
We'll have to keep refining it.

79
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,079
Should we just remove

80
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,780
the PV modules from the lower section?

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,420
But if we do that,

82
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,480
the total power output

83
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,420
will take a huge hit.

84
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:57,940
No rush.

85
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,640
We still have time.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,320
Have a seat.

87
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,240
Xiguang,

88
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:17,779
did you have something

89
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,019
on your mind earlier?

90
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,520
I wanted to ask

91
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,700
if we're strictly limited to adding

92
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,840
PV to the original design.

93
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,120
Is it possible

94
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,000
to make some small adjustments

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,060
to the design itself?

96
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,460
What kind of adjustments?

97
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,260
Let's hear it.

98
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,260
How about turning the podium

99
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,100
into a wave design?

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,540
Waves?

101
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,720
I don't know much about architecture.

102
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,640
I'm just thinking out loud.

103
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,460
I mean,

104
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,120
the main building
keeps the sail imagery.

105
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,800
But the part that was the hull

106
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,260
expands outward

107
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,600
in layers of curves,

108
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,360
like waves.

109
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,340
The PV panels would be spread out
like scales.

110
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,440
When the sun hits them,

111
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,000
it would look like sunlight
shimmering on the sea.

112
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,940
This would increase

113
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,300
the total surface area
for the PV modules.

114
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,160
Plus, a wave design

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,100
makes it easier for us

116
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,440
to adjust the installation angle

117
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,300
to the optimal tilt for Suzhou.

118
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,300
Humanity's pursuit of technology

119
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,240
and the future

120
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,040
is like a small sailboat

121
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,100
on a vast,

122
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
directionless ocean.

123
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,800
Aunt, you said

124
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,100
Chengrui's concept

125
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,860
was "Setting Sail
and Braving the Waves."

126
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,580
Before, it was just the "sail."

127
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,820
With this change,

128
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,060
we actually include the "waves" part.

129
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,480
It ties the whole theme
together perfectly.

130
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,380
Yes.

131
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,760
I can see it now.

132
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:30,780
But

133
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,860
why didn't you bring this up
during the meeting?

134
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,940
Well, I don't know Mr. Wang

135
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,000
that well.

136
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,300
If he felt I was overstepping my bounds,

137
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,320
it would have been awkward.

138
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,180
Not at all.

139
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,240
Wang is very straightforward

140
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,659
and doesn't care

141
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,060
about social pleasantries.

142
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,880
Still, Xiguang,

143
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,380
you're so worldly

144
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,240
and such a natural with people.

145
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,040
I wouldn't call it being worldly.

146
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,780
She's just considerate

147
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,000
and she always tries to see things

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,700
from other people's perspectives.

149
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,600
Isn't that exactly
what being worldly means?

150
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,880
Still,

151
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,560
you don't have to be that considerate

152
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,500
all the time.

153
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,200
It's

154
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
a bit unfair to yourself.

155
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,760
I won't.

156
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm no fool.

157
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,680
Fair enough.

158
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,320

I'll see you out.

166
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,620
Okay.

Let's go.

168
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,040
Let's go.

169
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,140
I didn't realize you had

170
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,360
a talent for architecture, Xiguang.

171
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,340
Oh, stop it.

172
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,760
Don't overpraise me.

173
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,500
Anyone can give an opinion

174
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,880
or have a moment of inspiration.

175
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,880
Turning it into an actual design

176
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,020
on paper

177
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,320
requires real vision

178
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,300
and a solid foundation

179
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,520
from the designers.

180
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,920

Fine.

was being a bit of a killjoy.

00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,660
why don't you

381
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,240
just bring the doctor to him?

382
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,180
Since he's dealing with dizziness,

383
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,600
that's right up my alley.

384
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,280
What do you think
about bringing me along?

385
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,600
Seriously, you've run out here

386
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,940
like six times already.

387
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,060
What are you rushing for?

388
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,720
Look who's talking.

389
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,160
You've been sitting here

390
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,160
since 8 AM.

391
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,600
And you have the nerve
to call me impatient.

392
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,820
I'm just soaking up some sun

393
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,000
and getting

394
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,640
my vitamin A, B, C and D.

395
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,600
Yesterday, Guang

396
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,020
told me

397
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,240
she was bringing her boyfriend home.

398
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,400
She said

399
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,720
he used to be a doctor

400
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,800
and could check you out.

401
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,120
I was so excited I barely slept a wink.

402
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,000
How did she

403
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,440
suddenly end up with a boyfriend?

404
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,240
I wonder what he looks like.

405
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,460
Yesterday you were going on and on

406
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,640
about how he just needs
to be a decent guy.

407
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,440
Today, all you care about is his looks.

408
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,840
Why are you being so annoying?

409
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,480
Don't think you're getting a free pass

410
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,480
just because you're feeling dizzy.

411
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,240
Fine.

412
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,340
A car's coming.

413
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,960
It has out-of-town plates.

414
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,980
It's definitely them.

415
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,160
Grandma.

416
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,720
Guang.

417
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,460
Grandpa.

418
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,320
Grandpa.

419
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,860
Guang.

420
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,780
Have you two been waiting in the yard
this whole time?

421
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,420
I just got here.

422
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,000
Your grandpa's been waiting
since early this morning.

423
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,140
Grandpa, Grandma,

424
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,900
this is my boyfriend, Lin Yusen.

425
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:12,760
This is my grandpa and grandma.

426
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,579
Hello.

427
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,640
Hello, Lin.

428
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,660
Hello.

429
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,720
Thank you, Grandma.

430
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,260
Grandpa,

431
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,060
are you still feeling dizzy today?

432
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,240
Yusen used to be

433
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,319
a neurosurgeon.

434
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,260
Let him take a look at you.

435
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,420
No need.

436
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,300
What's wrong?

437
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,240
What's going on?

438
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,660
You've been dizzy for days.

439
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,500
Do we need to go to the hospital

440
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,340
for a CT scan?

441
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,100
Grandpa,

442
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,680
look me in the eyes.

443
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,580
It's okay, I'm fine now.

444
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,740
I just can't move
my head around too much

445
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,900
or keep shifting positions.

446
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,480
The moment I move, everything spins.

447
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,680
Let's go inside and sit down.

448
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,460
I'll give Grandpa

449
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,300
a quick check-up.

450
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,520
Okay,

451
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,340
come on in.

452
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:55,700
Alright.

453
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,680
Come on.

454
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,680
Easy.

455
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,580
- Careful.
- Okay.

456
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,840
Take it slow.

457
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,140
Keep your head still.

458
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,240
Follow my finger with your eyes.

459
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,380
Look left.

460
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,180
Look right.

461
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,020
Look up.

462
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,620
Look down.

463
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,400
Grandpa,

464
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,980
does the dizziness

465
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:23,920
get worse

466
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,080
when you turn your head to the left

467
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,240
or roll onto your left side?

468
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,120
How did you know?

469
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,000
I can see it in your eye movements.

470
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,960
Does Grandpa have
any underlying conditions?

471
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,720
Any issues with his neck?

472
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,860
His neck is fine.

473
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,320
His blood pressure is a bit high,

474
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,860
but he's been taking his meds

475
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,800
and it's well under control.

476
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,140
Based on his symptoms,

477
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,660
it looks like BPPV.

478
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,940
I'll do a few more tests

479
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,720
to figure out

480
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,900
exactly which ear crystal
is out of place.

481
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,820
You might get a bit dizzy

482
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,540
during the exam.

483
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,680
That's fine.

484
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,880
I'm used to it by now.

485
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,860
As long as you figure out what's wrong.

486
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,720
First, sit up.

487
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,060
Alright.

488
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,300
Come.

489
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,300
At this angle,

490
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,480
does it feel like the room is spinning?

491
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,160
Not really.

492
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,640
Okay.

493
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,240
It's spinning.

494
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,180
This is the worst.

495
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,420
The whole house
feels like it's flipping over.

496
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,700
Come on.

497
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,320
It seems like a displaced crystal

498
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,720
in the left posterior canal.

499
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,340
What does that even mean?

500
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,280
I've never heard of that.

501
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,300
Ear crystals falling out of place?

502
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,540
Me, neither.

503
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,220
Don't worry.

504
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,240
It's not a big deal.

505
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,760
Think of ear crystals

506
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,000
as tiny stones

507
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,360
in your ear.

508
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,300
When they shift,

509
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,360
they can make you feel dizzy

510
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,360
and lose your balance.

511
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,860
Let's try a repositioning maneuver
here at home.

512
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,920
If that doesn't work,

513
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,660
we'll head to the hospital.

514
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:45,740
Grandpa,

515
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,100
just follow my lead

516
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:47,940
and don't fight the movement.

517
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:48,840
Okay.

518
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,700
There we go.

519
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,060
Lie down.

520
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,740
Here.

521
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,480
Come on.

522
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,320
Are you

523
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,200
still feeling dizzy?

524
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,520
It stopped.

525
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,480
So fast.

526
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,520
That's incredible.

527
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,120
The fix for BPPV

528
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,000
is usually instant.

529
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,260
But Grandpa,
you shouldn't have just ignored it.

530
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,380
If you let it drag on,

531
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,720
it's just going to keep coming back.

532
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,340
That's not good for you.

533
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,660
Exactly, Grandpa.

534
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,260
If you'd gone to the hospital sooner

535
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,180
to get this fixed,

536
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,820
you wouldn't have had to

537
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,760
suffer so much.

538
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,320
Will it come back?

539
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,120
It might.

540
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,780
So Grandpa,

541
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,880
get plenty of rest,

542
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,540
but try to stay active.

543
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,180
Try to stay calm
and don't get worked up.

544
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,820
If it happens again,

545
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,980
give us a call

546
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:48,940
or

547
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,080
just go straight to the hospital.

548
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,800
He won't go.

549
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,040
The bank gave us a free check-up,

550
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,540
and the results came back.

551
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,840
They even brought in

552
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,080
doctors from the city

553
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,920
to walk us through the report,

554
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,420
but he still wouldn't go.

555
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,080
It's nothing serious.

556
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,120
Why drag myself all the way
to the city for that?

557
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,340
Then the check-up
would be a total waste.

558
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,540
That won't do.

559
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,500
Get

560
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,400
the report out

561
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,880
and let me have a look.

562
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,000
Can you even read that?

563
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,960
He can.

564
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,940
Grandma, your blood vessels
are getting a bit stiff,

565
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
and your total cholesterol
is a little on the high side.

566
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,960
Your LDL is slightly elevated too.

567
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,720
Nothing serious.

568
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,060
I'll write down

569
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,780
some dietary tips for you.

570
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,940
I won't be able to read them.

571
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,160
Times were tough when I was a kid,

572
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,660
so I never went to school.
I can't read.

573
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,820
In that case,

574
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,000
Xiguang and I

575
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,840
will record a video for you.

576
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,020
That's a great idea.

577
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:49,920
Nice.

578
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,900
Should you be on camera, or should I?

579
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,500
Let Lin do it.

580
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,200
Grandma.

581
00:21:59,420 --> 00:21:59,820
Well,

582
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,060
Lin is a doctor,

583
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,680
so he's the professional here.

584
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,660
She just wants

585
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,100
to show off to her friends
back in the village

586
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,320
when they're playing mahjong.

587
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,120
Lin, check out mine.

588
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,740
Come on, look at Grandpa's report.

589
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,900
Grandpa, Grandma,

590
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,920
you're both in great shape.

591
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,320
Grandpa is all clear, too.

592
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,280
Just take your meds on time

593
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,300
and get regular check-ups.

594
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,220
See? I told you.

595
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,400
It's so good to have a doctor
in our family.

596
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,320
Now we can finally breathe
a sigh of relief.

597
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,180
Lin,

598
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,460
thanks for all your help today.

599
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,440
Just stay put

600
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,600
while I get dinner started.

601
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,260
I'll help you out.

602
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,600
Grandpa,

603
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,760
you should get some rest.

604
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Since we just fixed your ear,

605
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,820
we don't want it shifting again.

606
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,140
Avoid overexerting yourself
or any sudden movements

607
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,940
for the next couple of days.

608
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,340
- Okay.
- Yeah.

609
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,460
Grandpa, why don't you
find a show to watch?

610
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,440
Okay.

611
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,840
Here you go.

612
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,560
I'll go help Grandma.

613
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,380
Come on, let's go get the fire started.

614
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,580
Have you ever even seen

615
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,280
a wood stove before?

616
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,460
Only on TV

617
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,700
and at those rural retreats.

618
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,180
Spoken like a true city boy.

619
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,640
Aren't you?

620
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,260
I

621
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,240
grew up

622
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,800
at my grandparents' house.

623
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,960
I didn't move back to Wuxi

624
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,880
until I started elementary school.

625
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,120
Starting fires, feeding chickens,
herding geese.

626
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,060
I can do it all.

627
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,640
Let me show you how to start the fire.

628
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,540
First,

629
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,700
clear out the ash from the firebox.

630
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,280
There.

631
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,740
Now,

632
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,360
grab me some straw bundles.

633
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,280
Give them here.

634
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,740
You light it.

635
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,080
There we go, that's enough.

636
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,020
Now,

637
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,660
add some bean stalks.

638
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,540
Yeah, those ones.

639
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,400
Put them in like this.

640
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,040
And the firewood.

641
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,740
You have to stack it this way.

642
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,600
You need gaps in the middle

643
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,900
for the fire to catch.

644
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,740
See?

645
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:11,900
Like this.

646
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,540
Done.

647
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,140
Grandma, the fire's going.

648
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,220
I think

649
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,680
I've got the hang of it.

650
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,240
Here,

651
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,360
hand me the tongs.

652
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,580
I'm taking a photo

653
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,700
to send to Ms. Sheng.

654
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,960
I'll tell her

655
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,780
you're stuck here doing chores

656
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,420
at my grandma's.

657
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,880
She'll need

658
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,000
to send chocolate to bail you out.

659
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:04,820
Then

660
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,260
that'll be at least five jin of it.

661
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,840
I'm worth at least that much.

662
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,520
That's a bit steep, don't you think?

663
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,700
What if Ms. Sheng wakes up,

664
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,720
sees the message,

665
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,280
and says she can't afford it?

666
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,220
Then I guess

667
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,440
I'll just have to stay here

668
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,400
and tend the fire
for the rest of my life.

669
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,700
Works for me.

670
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,240
Not here.

671
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,520
Your face is so red from the heat.

672
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,440
I just wanted to check your temperature.

673
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,780
Is it hot?

674
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,840
Get back behind me.

675
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,020
Let me feel the heat too.

676
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,980
Guang, Lin,

677
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,780
look.

678
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,540
The rice crust turned out perfect today.

679
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,200
You're amazing, Grandma.

680
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,060
It's because you two
did such a great job with the fire.

681
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,120
Take the dishes out.

682
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,080
Lunch is ready.

683
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,220
Come here.

684
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:04,820
Here you go.

685
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,800
Thank you.

686
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,180
Thank you.

687
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,940
You have to try
this wild crucian carp soup.

688
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,440
It's so fresh.

689
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,820
The stuff from the supermarket

690
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,840
doesn't even come close.

691
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,160
This really is the best I've ever had.

692
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,020
I didn't add anything to it.

693
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,140
It's all natural.

694
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,080
And try

695
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,780
these sweet and sour ribs.

696
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,580
They're Grandma's specialty.

697
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,500
Dig in.

698
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,160
Delicious.

699
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,520
She actually learned

700
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,020
how to make these from me.

701
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,960
Since I was too dizzy to cook today,

702
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,580
next time we'll each do half the dishes

703
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,260
and have a cook-off.

704
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,080
You're on.

705
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,320
That sounds great.

706
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,760
Once you guys have Yusen

707
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,340
as a judge,

708
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,840
you can finally get off my back.

709
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,500
It sounds like

710
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,740
you've been the judge for a long time.

711
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,660
Grandpa and Grandma
are both such good cooks?

712
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,920
Of course.

713
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,340
Back in the day,

714
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,280
having weddings at hotels

715
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,320
wasn't a thing.

716
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,760
Whenever there was a celebration
in the village,

717
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,160
everyone would ask them
to be the head chefs.

718
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,840
I'd just tag along and feast for free.

719
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,580
Too bad I don't have
that kind of talent.

720
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,360
Even if I use
the same ingredients and steps,

721
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,920
it never

722
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,040
tastes the same.

723
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,040
Maybe next time I'll give it a go.

724
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,060
No more messing with the fire for me.

725
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,860
I'm moving up

726
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,900
to head chef.

727
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,420
I can't let Grandpa and Grandma's skills

728
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,760
be lost to time.

729
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,640
Alright.

730
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,300
I'll teach you everything.

731
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,220
- Yes.
- Definitely.

732
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,480
Now, eat up.

733
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,180
Come on. Dig in.

734
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,140
Hold on, I need to take this.

735
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,040
Hello?

736
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,240
Xiuzhen,

737
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,120
I can't make it to mahjong today.

738
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,380
Yeah,

739
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,480
Guang is back.

740
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,620
And her boyfriend is here too.

741
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,300
Yeah, they just started dating.

742
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,940
He's tall

743
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,160
and so handsome.

744
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,880
Plus, he's an amazing doctor.

745
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,060
Let me tell you,

746
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,220
my husband

747
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,340
had been feeling dizzy lately

748
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,760
and he fixed him up
in just a few minutes.

749
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,380
Why would I lie to you?

750
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,080
He even sat down

751
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,140
with our check-up reports

752
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,940
and broke everything down

753
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,100
for us,

754
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,280
point by point.

755
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,920
For real?

756
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,480
Could he take a look at mine?

757
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,560
I just had a check-up too.

758
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,880
Wu took me.

759
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,380
But after I got the report,

760
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,320
no one told me

761
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,300
what it actually meant.

762
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,980
Well,

763
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,440
I don't know

764
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,700
when they're leaving.

765
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,060
Guang,

766
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,600
Grandaunt Xiuzhen is asking

767
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,560
if Lin could help

768
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,080
look at her report.

769
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,740
I guess I talked too much.

770
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,040
Sure thing.

771
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,240
We aren't leaving until tonight anyway.

772
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,060
Grandaunt Xiuzhen has

773
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,660
the best mulberries.

774
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,840
Tell her to bring some over for me.

775
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,040
Okay.

776
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,680
Xiuzhen,

777
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,540
they aren't leaving until after dinner.

778
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,260
Bring your report over.

779
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,020
Yeah.

780
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,780
And...

781
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,160
You sold me out like that?

782
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,000
Guang wants some of your mulberries.

783
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,800
Mulberries are expensive, you know.

784
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,020
A basket costs a fortune.

785
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,580
I'll go pick some

786
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,020
and bring them over right away.

787
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,400
You didn't charge much

788
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,400
for a visit, did you?

789
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,440
How much?

790
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,840
That's way too much.

791
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,780
A standard visit

792
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:17,920
was 14 yuan.

793
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,620
Alright.

794
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,000
Fourteen yuan.

795
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,820
That's a win.

796
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,100
You'll even have change left over.

797
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,820
Alright.

798
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,980
It's nothing serious.

799
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,820
Lin, do you know how to read pulses?

800
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,140
I don't know how to do that.

801
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,600
Grandaunt,

802
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,220
I was trained in Western medicine.

803
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,260
Well, you'll have to work harder

804
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,840
to master both Chinese
and Western medicine.

805
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,440
That's a new one.

806
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,140
I'll look into it when I get back.

807
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,580
Why are there so many people?

808
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,200
I just ran into them on the road

809
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,460
and chatted for a bit.

810
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,480
I didn't expect them all

811
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,340
to follow me once they heard

812
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,080
your granddaughter's boyfriend

813
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,140
is a doctor

814
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,140
who can explain the reports.

815
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,140
They even brought some veggies
from their own fields.

816
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,580
I have plenty of my own, though.

817
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,300
The village organized

818
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,220
check-ups

819
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,560
for everyone over 70

820
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,300
last month.

821
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,980
But a lot of people

822
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,580
couldn't understand the results.

823
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
So they wanted to come by

824
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,620
and get some answers.

825
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,140
Don't invite anyone else.

826
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,080
I promise,

827
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,360
no more.

828
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,600
I've been taking my meds,

829
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,360
but my blood sugar still won't go down.

830
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,580
I wanted to ask

831
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,480
how I should be taking them.

832
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,280
What are you taking right now?

833
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,780
Let me show you.

834
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,600
Just these two.

835
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,440
[Gliclazide Tablets]
Diabetes.

836
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,270
[Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets]
I'll have to consult

837
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:52,540
with another doctor.

838
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,140
Granduncle, just a moment.

839
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,640
Is the doctor you're asking reliable?

840
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,240
Which hospital are they from?

841
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,060
Very reliable.

842
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,340
He's the vice chair

843
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,480
of endocrinology at Huashan Hospital.

844
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,440
Huashan?

845
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:12,940
Where's that?

846
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,960
It's not just some city hospital.

847
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,140
Granduncle,

848
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,220
you've seen "The Legend
of the Condor Heroes," right?

849
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,320
They have
the "Sword Duel on Mount Huashan."

850
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,480
I have.

851
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,920
I've seen it many times.

852
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,320
Eastern Heretic,Western Venom.

853
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,100
What else was there?

854
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,140
The five masters,

855
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,720
vying for the number one in the world.

856
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,780
Exactly.

857
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,980
So, anything with the name "Huashan"

858
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,080
is top-tier.

859
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,180
It's a major hospital in Shanghai.

860
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:40,880
I see.

861
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,000
That'll do.

862
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,380
What?

863
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,440
Nothing.

864
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,580
Have one.

865
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,720
You don't need to get your hands messy.

866
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,760
Hi, Dr. Chen.

867
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,240
Sorry to bother you.

868
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,580
I have a family friend here,

869
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,420
72 years old,

870
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,160
with a 25-year history of diabetes.

871
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,880
Why are more people coming?

872
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,340
I didn't tell anyone else.

873
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,120
It wasn't me.

874
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,280
I'll go check.

875
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,380
Okay.

876
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,400
Got it.

877
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,540
I've got it down.

878
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,220
Thanks, Dr. Chen.

879
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,260
What do you think you're doing?

880
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,720
We're looking for Nie Chengyuan

881
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,300
to collect a debt.

882
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,580
Don't be a coward!

883
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,780
Where is he?

884
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,380
Tell him to get out.

885
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:31,740
Stay back.

886
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,340
Nie Chengyuan!

887
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,680
Aren't those

888
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,820
the Wu brothers?

889
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,280
They're always hanging around
with Qian Dashun.

890
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,620
What are they doing here today?

891
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,360
At first,

892
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,680
I thought it was just Li.

893
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,040
I never expected them

894
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,320
to just barge right in

895
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,260
the second I opened the door.

896
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,320
Qin,

897
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,360
I'm sorry,

898
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,800
but I really had no choice.

899
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,460
Who are you?

900
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,800
What are you doing here?

901
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,500
So, you're

902
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,820
Nie Chengyuan's daughter?

903
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:09,620
Look,

904
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,860
your dad owes us money,

905
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,060
and we're here to collect.

906
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,219
Nonsense.

907
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,440
How could Chengyuan possibly

908
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,620
owe you money?

909
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,219
Don't you come in here

910
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,260
talking trash.

911
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,000
Ma'am,

912
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
I have proof.

913
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:22,780
Look,

914
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:23,860
here's the IOU.

915
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,320
See for yourselves
if you don't believe me.

916
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,080
[Borrower: Qian Dashun]
[Guarantor: Nie Chengyuan]

917
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,020
Lin,

918
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,580
what does it say?

919
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,639
Read it to me, quick.

920
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,980
Hereby received from Wu Ergun
an investment

921
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,860
of 350,000 yuan

922
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,199
for the Yuancheng Group

923
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,900
real estate project,

924
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,080
with a three-month term

925
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,159
and a monthly interest rate of 2%,

926
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,080
guaranteed

927
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,659
by Nie Chengyuan.

928
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,040
It says it

929
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,020
right there.

930
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,340
Qian Dashun is the one
who took the money.

931
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,520
Why are you coming after my dad

932
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,440
instead of him?

933
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,020
And besides,

934
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,360
just because his name
is down as a guarantor

935
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,380
doesn't make it true.

936
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,560
This isn't

937
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,800
even my dad's handwriting.

938
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:05,780
I don't care

939
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,700
whose handwriting it is.

940
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,500
The paper says he's responsible,

941
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,020
so he has to pay up.

942
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,940
What gives?

943
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,720
Qian Dashun is the one
who borrowed from you,

944
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,240
so go deal with him.

945
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,880
Why are you here

946
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,600
making a scene at our house?

947
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,680
It's all one and the same.

948
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,980
Everyone in this village knows

949
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,900
Qian Fangping
is hooked up with your son.

950
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,060
It's no secret that your son

951
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,640
and Qian Fangping

952
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,060
are pretty much an item.

953
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,760
If Qian Dashun

954
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,540
hadn't sworn
that Mr. Nie was vouching for him,

955
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,340
nobody would've lent him a thing.

956
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,620
Now look what happened.

957
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,140
That old man got drunk

958
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,660
and blabbed

959
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,120
that all the money was gone.

960
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,920
Then he vanished the very next day

961
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,460
and is not answering his phone,

962
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,140
so we have no choice

963
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,760
but to come to Mr. Nie.

964
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,760
No matter how you look at it,

965
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
this has nothing to do with us.

966
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,820
If you're so sure you're right,

967
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,900
go take it up with the police.

968
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,680
Now get out.

969
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,520
- Leave!
- Get out.

970
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,360
Qin,

971
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,320
I'm not here to force Chengyuan to pay.

972
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,440
Please, just have a little heart

973
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,140
and have Chengyuan help us find him.

974
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,940
I lent them 220,000 yuan.

975
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,120
I gave them

976
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,180
everything I saved

977
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:03,980
from a lifetime

978
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,120
of working the fields.

979
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,760
They've got over 100,000 of mine too.

980
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,260
That was my money
for my medical treatments.

981
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,640
How could you guys lend anything

982
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,820
to Qian Dashun?

983
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,900
Don't you know

984
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,040
what he's like?

985
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,780
How could you buy anything
that came out of his mouth?

986
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,900
I heard

987
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,420
Chengyuan was his guarantor.

988
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,940
We've been neighbors forever,

989
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,340
so I figured

990
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,500
he wouldn't just disappear.

991
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,860
I just wanted

992
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,960
to make a little interest.

993
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,160
My note

994
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,640
only promised 1%,

995
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,400
while theirs were all 2%.

996
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,020
I never thought Qian Dashun

997
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,820
would actually run off.

998
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,180
Guang,

999
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,580
call your dad.

1000
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,240
Tell him to get back

1001
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,520
and deal with his own mess.

1002
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,040
Dear,

1003
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:55,860
what's wrong?

1004
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,700
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

1005
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,860
I'm fine.

1006
00:36:59,420 --> 00:36:59,840
Grandma,

1007
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,300
why don't you take Grandpa
back to his room?

1008
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,660
Alright,

1009
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,680
but what about all this?

1010
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,060
Xiguang and I will take care of it.

1011
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,660
Don't worry.

1012
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,200
Thank you,

1013
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,620
Lin.

1014
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,200
Let's go.

1015
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,360
Sheng Bokai

1016
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,860
is obsessed with fast-tracking
his son's career,

1017
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,600
and he expects us
to do all the heavy lifting.

1018
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,020
He really hasn't thought this through.

1019
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,360
An opportunity

1020
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,740
like Intelligent Digital Center project,

1021
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,380
right here in Jiangsu,

1022
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,860
is way too big of a deal for me
to just let it go.

1023
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,900
Exactly.

1024
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,300
He expects us

1025
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,160
to just pave the way for them?

1026
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,260
He's clearly

1027
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,360
overestimating himself.

1028
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,880
With Yuancheng's reputation

1029
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,000
here in Jiangsu,

1030
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,600
even if they bring in Durand,

1031
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,440
they still won't be able
to compete with us.

1032
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,480
Still, we can't get complacent.

1033
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,720
The current proposal

1034
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,840
still needs a bit of polishing.

1035
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,420
Got it.

1036
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,660
Xiguang,

1037
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,580
why are you calling me today?

1038
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,640
I'll be there right away.

1039
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,400
My dad is on his way back from the city.

1040
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,620
You guys

1041
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,680
should wait outside.

1042
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,120
Wait a second.

1043
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,860
Why should we have to

1044
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,700
wait outside?

1045
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,460
What,

1046
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,680
is your yard made of gold or something?

1047
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,740
We can't even stand here?

1048
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,820
If you don't leave,
I'm calling the police.

1049
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,460
Go ahead.

1050
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:09,980
Who are you trying to bluff?

1051
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,900
You think they're gonna lock us up?

1052
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,140
Besides,

1053
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,160
I'm not scared of getting hauled in.

1054
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,660
It wouldn't be my first time anyway,

1055
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,320
right?

1056
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,600
We really should call the police.

1057
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,280
Whether someone
gets arrested is one thing,

1058
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,200
but every debt

1059
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,240
has its debtor.

1060
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,500
The one who owes you is Qian Dashun.

1061
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,860
Once the police are here,

1062
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,340
we can get this all cleared up.

1063
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:33,960
Fine.

1064
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,380
We'll be right outside

1065
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,460
waiting for Mr. Nie.

1066
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,300
If he doesn't show up,

1067
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,420
we aren't budging.

1068
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,440
I'm so sorry about this.

1069
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,440
You guys

1070
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,920
should head home.

1071
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,940
It's a mess here,

1072
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,960
and I don't want
any of you getting hurt.

1073
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,100
We're staying right here

1074
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,680
with you.

1075
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,480
It's okay.

1076
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,440
I'm going to lock the gate.

1077
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,320
I won't be opening it again

1078
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,360
until my dad gets back.

1079
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,860
We'd better head out.

1080
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:13,680
Okay.

1081
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,120
Guang,

1082
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,100
if anything goes sideways,

1083
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,400
just give us a shout.

1084
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,160
My son's home today
if you need an extra hand.

1085
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,780
It's fine.

1086
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,420
We're heading out.

1087
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,080
Okay, get home safe.

1088
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,580
Dr. Lin,

1089
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,060
those two

1090
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,540
who were making the biggest scene

1091
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,160
are the worst troublemakers
in the village.

1092
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,280
We don't

1093
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,160
even talk to them.

1094
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
Integrity just runs in the Nie family.

1095
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,920
Old Nie and Qin

1096
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,480
are the most honest,

1097
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,820
decent people you'll ever meet.

1098
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,680
Everyone in the village has nothing

1099
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,980
but good things to say about them.

1100
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,120
They're really well-respected
around here.

1101
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,260
Grandaunt Xiuzhen,

1102
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,540
I know.

1103
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,360
I can tell

1104
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,460
just by looking at Xiguang.

1105
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,080
Alright, I'm off.

1106
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,380
Be careful.

1107
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,220
Don't worry.

1108
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:19,940
Let's go.

1109
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,200
Listen up.

1110
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,740
Nie Chengyuan's daughter

1111
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,820
and her boyfriend are both here.

1112
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,500
This is a rare chance.

1113
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,100
Even if it's just to save face

1114
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,680
in front of his future son-in-law,

1115
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,860
he'll have to pay up.

1116
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,040
Usually,

1117
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,400
it's just his parents at home,

1118
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,680
which makes it hard to get our money.

1119
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,780
What if

1120
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,700
they fake a faint

1121
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,920
just to frame us?

1122
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,320
Yeah.

1123
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:45,660
Right?

1124
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,280
We're camping out right here

1125
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,560
and we can't let them slip away.

1126
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,740
Are we gonna

1127
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:51,960
scare off

1128
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,700
the girl's boyfriend?

1129
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,620
Yeah,

1130
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
maybe we shouldn't have blabbed

1131
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,580
about all the mess

1132
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,900
her dad got into.

1133
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,520
Your life savings are gone,

1134
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:03,840
and you're worried

1135
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,140
about her boyfriend?

1136
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,080
If we weren't leading the way,

1137
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:07,900
you wouldn't get

1138
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,320
a single penny back in your lifetime!

1139
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,460
But Qian is the one
who actually owes us the money.

1140
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,220
It's all the same.

1141
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,480
You think Nie Chengyuan

1142
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,680
is any better?

1143
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,460
Don't worry.

1144
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,660
I just finished
the repositioning maneuver for Grandpa.

1145
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,800
He'll be fine after he gets some sleep.

1146
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,040
Don't be scared.

1147
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,540
It's nothing serious.

1148
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,040
I'm not scared.

1149
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,080
I'm just so fed up with all this.
