190
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,300
Is there any compensation

191
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,100
from you and the company?

192
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,900
For instance,

193
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,040
an overtime meal stipend?

194
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,060
Absolutely.

195
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,560
However,

196
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,300
it might not be appropriate
to bill the company.

197
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,420
How about I pay you
out of my own pocket?

198
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,940
The honey-glazed crispy pork looks good.

199
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,080
Over there.

200
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,640
Yum.

201
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,460
We're here.

202
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,940
Better food in the cafeteria

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,200
isn't all good news.

204
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,400
Actually, come to think of it,

205
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,440
it's mostly bad.

206
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,800
Let's hear it.

207
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,780
First,

208
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,500
it's too crowded,

209
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,360
and the lines are forever.

210
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,880
Second,

211
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
the food is so good

212
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,540
that I've been overdoing it

213
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,660
and now I'm gaining weight.

214
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,440
But I remember

215
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,000
back when I first joined,

216
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,080
someone told me

217
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,060
bad food at the cafeteria makes you fat

218
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
because you binge later
to feel satisfied.

219
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,060
Who?

220
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,540
Who would say

221
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,800
such nonsense?

222
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,520
A little puppy said that.

223
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,000
Anyway,

224
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,220
you guys are quick.

225
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,380
Already digging in.

226
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,640
You didn't

227
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,940
sneak out of work early, did you?

228
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,340
Here,

229
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,020
have some juice
to get some vitamins into your system.

230
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,500
Hey, don't call us out like that.

231
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,780
We only slipped away
a few minutes earlier.

232
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,900
I'm so jealous.

233
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,580
We've got two giants crushing us.

234
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,900
We can't even move.

235
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,460
We're the ones who are jealous.

236
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,500
You get to enjoy eye candy

237
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,100
like Mr. Lin every day.

238
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,520
What's there to envy?

239
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,500
It's not like he belongs to us.

240
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,860
Xiguang.

241
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,800
Xiguang, a quick question.

242
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,380
The food here is better now.

243
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,320
So why have you been

244
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,400
eating out every night instead?

245
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,800
Eat up.

246
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,940
The year-end party gifts

247
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,360
are coming in at 12:30 PM.

248
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,660
We need to go and check them in.

249
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,380
Hurry up.

250
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,040
This one is great!

251
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,900
I want this one

252
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,580
and that one, too!

253
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,000
We have great taste.

254
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,980
Everything's so practical.

255
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,620
I don't really care about these.

256
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,440
I just want to win the paid leave.

257
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,980
Who doesn't want that?

258
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,480
Cui Qin,

259
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,380
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Lin, and Procurement

260
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,980
have a meeting

261
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,540
at 3 PM.

262
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,820
I need you to take the minutes.

263
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,180
Mr. Wang,

264
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,580
I have to go to the plant
this afternoon.

265
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,960
I'm not sure when I'll be back.

266
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,180
Mr. Wang,

267
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,820
I'll take care of it.

268
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:58,980
Alright.

269
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,760
Thanks.

270
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,360
Nie can do it too.

271
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,260
Thank you.

272
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,780
What's your point?

273
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,040
So you're not dodging Mr. Lin anymore?

274
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,140
What are you talking about?

275
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,100
When did I ever dodge him?

276
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,160
Got any proof to back that up?

277
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,240
Due to external factors,

278
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,920
many of Procurement's suppliers

279
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,560
need to be re-vetted and re-engaged.

280
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,400
Mr. Lin recently

281
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,380
provided us

282
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,520
with the company's

283
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,940
key raw material

284
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,200
[PV Glass Price Comparison]
external RFQ list in 2012.

285
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,320
This helped us streamline

286
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,140
the supplier shortlist much faster.

287
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,620
Then, based on

288
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,400
my past experience with the vendors

289
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,560
throughout our collaborations,

290
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,720
Procurement has drafted a preliminary

291
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,880
supplier assessment list.

292
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,900
First, regarding photovoltaic glass,

293
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,380
our top recommendations

294
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,640
are these two manufacturers:

295
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,660
Qicai Glass and Mingyan Glass.

296
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,460
From a pricing perspective,

297
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,780
Qicai is about five percent

298
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,080
higher than Mingyan.

299
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,360
However,
Qicai's quality control and capacity

300
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,020
are more stable.

301
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,540
Furthermore, over the past few days,

302
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,560
I have been in contact with them.

303
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,740
Technologically, they have

304
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,520
made another breakthrough,

305
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,960
and they have very warmly invited us

306
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,920
to conduct an on-site inspection.

307
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,880
Qicai Glass

308
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,040
is an old friend of ours.

309
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,580
Their management team

310
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,680
truly prioritizes R&D innovation

311
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,800
and quality control.

312
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,280
You should consider

313
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,420
flying there for a visit.

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,660
We're on the same page.

315
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,760
I'm planning to go.

316
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,060
I've met Mr. Wu from Qicai

317
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,400
once before.

318
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,200
I'll fly out this time as well.

319
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,800
Let's try to finalize everything
in one trip.

320
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,080
Wang Qi,

321
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,980
you're coming with me.

322
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,620
What dates are we talking about?

323
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,480
There are a lot of meetings and events

324
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,120
before Chinese New Year.

325
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,500
Mr. Zhang asked me to attend those.

326
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,660
I'm afraid

327
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,100
my schedule is already packed.

328
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,600
This inquiry list

329
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,740
from Administration

330
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,940
is quite comprehensive.

331
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,460
I wonder who prepared it.

332
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,500
Actually, we should consider
bringing that person along.

333
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,620
As for my team,

334
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,960
I'll be bringing Mr. Wang Xin.

335
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,000
I had Nie put together

336
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,720
this inquiry document.

337
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,580
Wang Qi reminded me

338
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,800
that with the end of the year
approaching,

339
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,820
we need to check

340
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,720
the department's schedule.

341
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,940
It could just be the three of us.

342
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,040
Why don't you coordinate

343
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,900
the schedule with them?

344
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,400
Sure.

345
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,020
Then let's wrap up

346
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,780
today's meeting.

347
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:16,760
Okay.

348
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,020
Nie, wait.

349
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,200
Nie,

350
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,760
you looked

351
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,360
very distrustful.

352
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,960
Because

353
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,240
you have a bit of a track record.

354
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,680
True.

355
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,240
But not this time.

356
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,000
Because

357
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,800
I'm still caught in a dilemma.

358
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,180
About what?

359
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,700
The approach.

360
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,900
I believe

361
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,160
pursuing a girl

362
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,220
should be upfront.

363
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,120
But doing so in the office

364
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,000
will definitely get

365
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,800
people talking.

366
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,420
It wouldn't be fair to you.

367
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,520
You're overthinking it

368
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,340
a bit.

369
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,200
That's just how the world works,

370
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,460
so I have to consider every detail.

371
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,300
But there is a way.

372
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,360
Nie,

373
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,820
why don't you stop

374
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,300
hiding your true identity?

375
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,200
Then, most of the talk

376
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,680
will be focused on me.

377
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,140
And I can finally show you
what I'm made of.

378
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,620
Mr. Lin,

00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,800
What brought on the sudden switch to PV?

569
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,000
Shengyuan really doesn't take
Shuangyuan seriously.

570
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,520
And the people working
under them are even...

571
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,260
Oh?

572
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,780
Did someone there offend you, Mr. Wu?

573
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,300
It was your

574
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,460
former Head of Procurement.

575
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,140
Not only did he drag his feet
on payments,

576
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:52,940
but he also claimed

577
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,640
our quality control was subpar.

578
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,100
He was basically trashing
our reputation.

579
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,740
You mean Mr. Mo?

580
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,780
Right,

581
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,100
that's the one, Mo.

582
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:01,860
Why?

583
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,460
Does he have a bad reputation

584
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,620
at your company, too?

585
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,880
There was

586
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,860
a high-quality dorm,

587
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,120
but Mr. Mo's relative cut the line

588
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,180
and snatched it up.

589
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,880
When Mr. Lin found out,

590
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,800
he went to great lengths

591
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,940
to get them back for us.

592
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,600
Ever since then,

593
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,660
Mr. Mo has been...

594
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,180
He actually dared

595
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,140
to give you an attitude?

596
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:34,960
Let's drop it.

597
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,460
That's just how it is

598
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,760
in these big family businesses.

599
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,200
Everything is so intertwined.

600
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,740
So, is he no longer

601
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,200
in charge of procurement?

602
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,620
Late last year,

603
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,700
during a HQ internal audit,

604
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,980
he was flagged

605
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,800
for financial irregularities
during his time there.

606
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,720
Later, they found out

607
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,880
his record at Shuangyuan
wasn't clean either.

608
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,200
So...

609
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,360
I just didn't realize

610
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,500
he had crossed you as well.

611
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,420
I'm going

612
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,280
to bring this up with my grandfather.

613
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,800
Why didn't you lead

614
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,860
with such a massive piece of good news

615
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,840
the moment we met?

616
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,000
Forget about telling your grandfather.

617
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,080
It's fine.

618
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,700
I'm not a petty man.

619
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,840
I only have one question.

620
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,260
Is he behind bars?

621
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,660
Pretty much.

622
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,920
Sen,

623
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,880
you've only just arrived,

624
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,720
and you've already settled
an old score for me.

625
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,020
I'm

626
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,960
a big believer in fate and energy.

627
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,800
Our signs must be perfectly aligned.

628
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,640
We really should

629
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,360
stay in close touch.

630
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,560
I'd be more than happy to.

631
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,780
I'm new to the industry,

632
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,220
so I have a lot to learn from you.

633
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,440
Of course.

634
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,860
We're in the same supply chain.

635
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,180
We rise and fall together.

636
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,340
To be honest,

637
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,140
my beef with Mo

638
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,720
isn't just

639
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,140
about a personal grudge.

640
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,700
The main thing is,

641
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,200
he cut ties with us

642
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:48,940
and immediately started

643
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,320
sourcing
overpriced Japanese products instead.

644
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,640
In fact, over the last few years,

645
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,300
the quality of domestic PV glass

646
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,480
has completely caught up.

647
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,920
There's really no need

648
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,140
to be so obsessed with foreign brands.

649
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,420
True.

650
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,600
Full localization

651
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,560
of the entire PV industry chain

652
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,420
is only a matter of time.

653
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,080
Exactly.

654
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,660
We've been talking all this time,

655
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,760
and I still don't have
your contact info.

656
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,480
Come on,

657
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,960

let me show you around.

661
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,960

662
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:22,940
How about

663
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,160
having dinner

664
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,340
in our VIP dining room today?

665
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,600
It's just up ahead.

666
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,860
Mr. Lin,

667
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,000
please don't mind the simplicity.

668
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,420

and Char Siu

670
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,460
are more authentic

671
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,200
than any five-star restaurant.

672
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,720
Then let's see

673
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,560
if your kitchen's quality control
lives up to its name.

674
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,100
By the way,

675
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,400

676
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,940
in Northwest China

677
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,480
are about to go out to tender.

678
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,320
Sen,

679
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,680
do you have any plans for those?

680
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,660
I used to deal with

681
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,040
their upper management.

682
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,220
This is the first time
I've met Mr. Wu in person.

683
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,900
I thought he was
just another second-gen

684
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,560
riding the coattails of Aiyue Group.

685
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,520
I didn't expect him
to know the business so well.

686
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,240
That's how Cantonese entrepreneurs are.

687
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,620
Low-key and practical.

688
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,880
So, about the terms
we discussed today...?

689
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,180
Squeeze them a bit more on the price.

690
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,000

691
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,820

692
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,820

693
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,760
you play the good cop.

694
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,320
So,

695
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,200
do you guys have

696
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
WeChat yet?

697
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,080
Yeah.

698
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,080
But I don't use it much.

699
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,180
I mostly use it

700
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,020
to chat with my girlfriend.

701
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,860
I just got it recently.

702
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,700
Haven't used it much either.

703
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,380
But this app

704
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,860
will likely become the mainstream.

705
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,040
For sure.

706
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,140

Mr. Lin, you didn't even
give me a heads-up.

Now I'm way behind the curve.

00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,360
Sure.

718
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,180
I'll take it.

00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,180

Mr. Lin,

00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,760

Before booking,

735
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,280
she even asked for my preferences.

736
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,020
I told her I had none,

737
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,920
that we could just share a room,

738
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,700
totally up to her.

739
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,260

00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,360
before I left,

926
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,760

00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,100
will all be aimed at you.

946
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,220
With the way he's been acting,

947
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,140
even for someone whose romantic radar

948
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,020
is as rusty as mine,

949
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,820
it's pretty obvious.

950
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,240
So you can bet the others
have noticed too.

951
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,840
But don't worry.

952
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,000
My lips are sealed.

953
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,000
Ms. Chen,

954
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,720
Thanks for telling me this.

955
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,960
We've actually

956
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,020
thought about it,

957
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,560
but we decided

958
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,860
to just let things take their course.

959
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,240
After all, there's no rule

960
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,620
against workplace dating,

961
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,440
so we decided

962
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,520
there's no need to hide it.

963
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,440
Actually,

964
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,640
I went through

965
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,340
something similar

966
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,060
back in college.

967
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,380
It wasn't as severe

968
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,260
as what you faced,

969
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,820
but...

970
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,960
that feeling

971
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,640
of being wrongly accused

972
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,160
and having no way to explain yourself

973
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,140
is the same.

974
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,520
And

975
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,380
even long after,

976
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,720
it still haunts you out of nowhere,

977
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,960
making you

978
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,920
humiliated

979
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,420
and wronged.

980
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,660
It's like living under a shadow.

981
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,820
That's why I'll do everything I can

982
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,880
to make sure nothing like this

983
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,120
ever happens to you,

984
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,420
or anyone else in this company,
ever again.

985
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,840
Look at you,

986
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,040
talking like you're my boss

987
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,960
and you're here to protect me.

988
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:40,960
No, that's not it.

989
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,320
It's just back then,

990
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,880
I wished someone
would have protected me.

991
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,700
I did have friends who helped

992
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,440
and comforted me.

993
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,960
So I just...

994
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:53,840
I get it.

995
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,100
I mean, you might not be my boss,

996
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,780
but listening to you,

997
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,520
I somehow feel a sense

998
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,620
of security.

999
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,180
Alright.

1000
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,440
Since you and Mr. Lin

1001
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,660
have already thought this through,

1002
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,660
I'll keep my mouth shut.

1003
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:11,880
I just hope you don't think

1004
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,060
I'm being nosy.

1005
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,400
Not at all.

1006
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,300
I feel quite comforted.

1007
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,960
The milk custard

1008
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,800
was totally worth it.

1009
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,720
Alright, it's getting late.

1010
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,200
Go

1011
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,940
take a shower and get some sleep.

1012
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,640
Wait, Ms. Chen.

1013
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,060
I think you misunderstood.

1014
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,160
Mr. Lin and I

1015
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,520
aren't in a relationship yet.

1016
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,900
"Yet"?

1017
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:42,980
Got it.

1018
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,820
Just call me Chen.

1019
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,760
Everyone in the department

1020
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,460
calls me that.

1021
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,000
