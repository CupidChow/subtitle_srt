why didn't you have some more?

124
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,760
Because I filled up on water.

125

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,320
So we don't need
to exchange them anymore?

187
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,000
Now, the only thing I want to exchange

188
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,860
is the honor of your visit.

189
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,640
♪Just you and me♪

190
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,860
Lead the way, then.

191
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,500
♪Just you and me♪

192
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,840
Let's go.

193
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,560
What kind of pastries did you get?

194
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,300
The ones you gave a thumbs-up to
back in Guangzhou.

195
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,220
Have some first.

196
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,520
I'll eat in a sec.

197
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,640
Photos first.

198
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,080
Then let's head to the study.

199
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,080
Most of these

200
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,240
are textbooks and books

201
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
I bought

202
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,480
when I was studying abroad.

203
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,240
My old place in Puxi
was too small to fit them all.

204
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,160
So I had them all shipped here
when I moved back to China.

205
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,140
There are a few photos,

206
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,200
also taken during my time

207
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,200
abroad.

208
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,120
You really were a looker,

209
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,900
even with that total disaster
of a bowl cut.

210
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,240
Don't you

211
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,860
have a photo album?

212
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,160
We have to go through them
one by one like this?

213
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,620
I never really got around to organizing
the photos from this period.

214
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,620
I have albums from when I was a kid.

215
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,080
They're at my grandparents' place.

216
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,820
I'll take you there next time.

217
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,480
I'm such an idiot

218
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,900
for falling for your tricks
every single time.

219
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,740
How can you call it a trick?

220
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,260
You've got a welcoming host,

221
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,720
delicious Cantonese food,

222
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,260
and you still get to see the photos,
don't you?

223
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,320
Was your schedule always this packed?

224
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,780
That's just life in med school.

225
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,880
Actually, back when I took the gaokao,

226
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,200
I was going

227
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,820
to apply for business school.

228
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,820
Then how did you

229
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,720
end up in medicine?

230
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,040
That's

231
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,260
a long story.

232
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,860
Your parents have told you

233
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,620
about my family, right?

234
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,000
It's okay.

235
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,420
It was a long time ago.

236
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,040
Do you want to hear it from me?

237
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,180
Do you want to tell me?

238
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,280
Of course.

239
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,920
I want to tell you everything

240
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,520
about myself.

241
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,680
But it might take

242
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,760
a while.

243
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,820
That's fine.

244
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,780
I've got all the time in the world.

245
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,980
You have a midnight curfew, don't you?

246
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,280
That's true.

247
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,100
But

248
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,960
if we can't finish today,

249
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,220
there are plenty of midnights
ahead of us.

250
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,980
You can tell it in installments.

251
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,880
Thank you.

252
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,400
My parents

253
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,320
bought this place
and did the renovations themselves.

254
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,200
But they never lived here

255
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,920
for a single day.

256
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,380
Before the renovations
were even finished,

257
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,600
my dad was stationed abroad.

258
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,660
After the accident happened,

259
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,620
my mom wanted to take me

260
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,460
out of the country with her.

261
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,040
But

262
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,120
considering my grandparents' health,

263
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,640
she chose

264
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,380
to leave me in Shanghai.

265
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,780
I was seven back then.

266
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,200
For a long time,

267
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,800
I lived with my father's parents

268
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,180
in a tiny, old apartment

269
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,340
in Puxi,

270
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,080
barely sixty square meters.

271
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,340
Grandpa Sheng would often pick me up

272
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,460
to stay at his place for a few days.

273
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,940
My dad's parents never stopped me,

274
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,460
but they never went with me either.

275
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,800
I used to wonder why

276
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,420
when I was little,

277
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,580
but I never really gave it much thought.

278
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,480
Probably because

279
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,920
the loss of my dad
was such a heavy blow,

280
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,420
my grandparents passed away from illness

281
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,280
quite early on.

282
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,980
My mom asked me to move abroad again.

283
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:10,280
But by then,

284
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,280
I was already

285
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,200
in a great high school

286
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,300
and wanted to stay for university.

287
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,440
So, at 13,

288
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,240
I moved into the Sheng family estate.

289
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,040
Grandpa Sheng

290
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,340
was always very good to me.

291
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,700
I took the gaokao quite early.

292
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,980
My first choice was business school,

293
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,280
partly

294
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,480
because I wanted to help
my grandpa with the load,

295
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,040
and partly

296
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,940
to carry on my dad's legacy.

297
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,420
That was when

298
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,880
someone finally told me the truth

299
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,600
about what happened to my dad.

300
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,540
Someone was afraid

301
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,920
you'd step up to help.

302
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,140
Most likely.

303
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,780
They chose to tell you

304
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,500
right before the gaokao.

305
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,540
That's incredibly low.

306
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,140
But it worked.

307
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,600
I changed my major

308
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,380
and applied to med school instead.

309
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,720
I was always more interested

310
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,480
in medicine anyway.

311
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,660
Throughout university,

312
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,040
I used my heavy workload as an excuse

313
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,040
and rarely visited the Sheng house.

314
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,440
When I absolutely had to go,

315
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,460
I'd mostly just spend my time

316
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,780
reading alone in the study.

317
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,920
Later,

318
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,920
I went to the U.S. for grad school.

319
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,260
Eventually,

320
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,220
I chose to come back
and become a doctor.

321
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,280
Being a doctor means constantly facing
the cycle of life and death.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I gradually learned to let things go.

323
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,220
But I still didn't have

324
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,440
much contact with the Shengs.

325
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,680
When I accompanied my grandpa

326
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,060
to Ms. Yu's party,

327
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,640
it was just a coincidence.

328
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,080
I was doing an exchange
at a hospital in Wuxi.

329
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,540
Grandpa sent a car to pick me up,

330
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,640
so I went along.

331
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,500
Then later,

332
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,760
I got into that car accident.

333
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,400
During that time,

334
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,080
I was filled with so much bitterness
and resentment.

335
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:35,900
So when my grandpa

336
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,000
asked me to work at Shengyuan,

337
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,340
I agreed immediately.

338
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,540
Even though I started from the bottom,

339
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,540
I didn't care much at first.

340
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:51,980
After all,

341
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,820
I never studied business.

342
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,580
But did I really need to "study"

343
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,220
to handle a few small projects?

344
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,120
After six months at Shengyuan,

345
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,260
Sheng Xingjie messed up

346
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,000
a project.

347
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,080
I found a way to fix it.

348
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,460
Grandpa promoted me right away

349
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,780
to the same level as Sheng Xingjie.

350
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,240
I got things done,

351
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,700
made some friends,

352
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,460
and caused a bit of trouble

353
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,700
for Mr. Nie.

354
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,640
Mr. Nie

355
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,660
probably thought
it was more than "a bit" of trouble.

356
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,540
He even warned me
that there are daggers in your smiles.

357
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,260
I'll take that as a compliment.

358
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,060
Do you even know what that means?

359
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,880
That is definitely not a compliment.

360
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,460
It's perfectly normal

361
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,280
for a surgeon to hold a knife.

362
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,620
And if I don't smile,

363
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,200
how can the patients feel at ease?

364
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,320
Isn't he

365
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,020
just praising

366
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,100
my professional ethics?

367
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,440
And after that, you went to Suzhou.

368
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,540
After that,

369
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,220
I went to Suzhou.

370
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,320
And then,

371
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,040
I got to know you all over again.

372
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,440
And my whole world shifted.

373
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,600
It's like my sanity finally returned.

374
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:22,720
Like

375
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,600
I've been made whole again.

376
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,000
My mind is at peace now.

377
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,920
I asked myself

378
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,760
if it was worth

379
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,240
wasting my time on things

380
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,960
I have no interest in,

381
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,080
just to make others

382
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,680
miserable.

383
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,260
Of course,

384
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,780
at the time, I thought it was,

385
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,300
because I was being dramatic,

386
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,960
feeling like

387
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,500
I had nothing left to lose.

388
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,840
But now,

389
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,320
I have so much more to live for.

390
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,400
Xiguang,

391
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,940
I don't want to give up.

392
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,840
I don't want over ten years of hard work

393
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,400
to go down the drain.

394
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,240
During Chinese New Year

395
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,880
at Tianchi Lake Hospital,

396
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,820
even though I was only there
to provide support,

397
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,900
the fulfillment

398
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,520
and sense of achievement

399
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,200
I got from saving the patient

400
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,940
far outweighed
everything I've done in business

401
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,340
over the past two years.

402
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,860
When I was in the Northwest,

403
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,860
standing in that vast, sandy wilderness,

404
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,000
looking out as far as I could see,

405
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,820
I suddenly felt

406
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,460
my heart clear.

407
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,940
The world is so wide.

408
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,800
The true value of medicine

409
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,080
doesn't just lie in clinical practice,

410
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,440
or at the operating table.

411
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,380
I can do so many things.

412
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,800
If one path is blocked,

413
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,740
I can just take another.

414
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,940
I can still put
what I've learned to use.

415
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,480
My hand is damaged,

416
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:24,940
but does that mean

417
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,920
I have nothing else to offer?

418
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,120
Isn't my brain

419
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,040
my most valuable asset?

420
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,080
What's with that look?

421
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,620
I think

422
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,620
you're

423
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,640
incredibly strong...

424
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,920
and amazing.

425
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,260
I used to be amazing.

426
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,660
But what if I'm not so amazing anymore

427
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,780
on a new path?

428
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,460
No way.

429
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,440
You're that sure?

430
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,120
Absolutely.

431
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:08,720
Okay.

432
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,900
What are you so happy about?

433
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,820
You've made up your mind

434
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,220
to do what you love.

435
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,280
Of course I'm happy.

436
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,560
To be honest,

437
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,480
instead of having a boyfriend
who's a high-flying CEO,

438
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,320
I'd much rather have

439
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,540
a brilliant doctor

440
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,300
or researcher.

441
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,440
I'm a bit fed up with CEOs, anyway.

442
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,080
But

443
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,460
what exactly are you going to do?

444
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,640
Be an internist?

445
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,540
Do research?

446
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,500
Or

447
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,740
teach at a med school?

448
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,400
When I was in Shenzhen,

449
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,820
I received an email.

450
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,820
It was

451
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,200
from that Chinese professor

452
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,100
I told you about.

453
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,940
The matchmaker?

454
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:25,780
Yes.

455
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,060
She's

456
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,200
a very wise lady.

457
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,600
She's

458
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,040
with Johns Hopkins University.

459
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,380
Her main research focus

460
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,060
is Brain-Computer Interface.

461
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,160
I joined her interest group

462
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,700
back when I was a student.

463
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,840
She told me

464
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,160
that she and her team

465
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,980
have come to China

466
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,580
and joined the CAS.

467
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,020
And they're

468
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,320
right here in Shanghai.

469
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,300
She heard about what happened to me,

470
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,320
so

471
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,940
she wanted to meet up this month.

472
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,940
Meet her!

473
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,620
Brain-Computer Interface

474
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,920
sounds so cool.

475
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,220
You can definitely do this.

476
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,860
No matter

477
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,620
if this is the path
for the future or not,

478
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,240
I know I can.

479
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,600
So this is the "good son"

480
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,080
you've raised!

481
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,100
Humiliating his own kin

482
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,580
in front of everyone.

483
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,900
Do you really think

484
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,440
a stunt like that only insults Yusen?

485
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,580
No, it drags our name through the mud.

486
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,360
Dad,

487
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,640
who's been filling your head with this?

488
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,360
It wasn't like that at all.

489
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,160
Xingjie

490
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,280
was just saying hi to Yusen, that's all.

491
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,520
Exactly.

492
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,120
They were just joking around.

493
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,260
Are you questioning me?

494
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm not senile yet!

495
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,420
Shengyuan

496
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,960
isn't your personal dictatorship.

497
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,880
Tomorrow,

498
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,660
have Yusen come by.

499
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:14,800
Understood.

500
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,860
Don't stay out too late in Shanghai.

501
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,860
Get home early, okay?

502
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,520
Got it.

503
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,320
Don't worry, Mr. Jiang.

504
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,660
Come visit us in Nanjing
when you have a chance.

505
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,420
Goodbye, Uncle.

506
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,080
Goodbye.

507
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,600
What do we do now?

508
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,540
Didn't you say
you wanted to go shopping?

509
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,640
I want to check out Tianzifang,

510
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,540
and maybe Wukang Road.

511
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,680
Mr. Li.

512
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,540
Alright.

513
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,080
Mr. Li told

514
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
me to head back.

515
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,100
He said Grandpa is furious.

516
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,040
I'll go wander around for a while.

517
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,180
You can come pick me up later.

518
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:02,940
Could you

519
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,320
make this a habit?

520
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,000
What?

521
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,200
Every time
before you get out of the car.

522
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,300
But

523
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,160
what if we're getting out together?

524
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,360
Should we still do it?

525
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,060
Wouldn't that be a little weird?

526
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,700
Xiguang,

527
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,320
you really know
how to kill the mood, don't you?

528
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,920
I'm off.

529
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,020
Bye.

530
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,320
Yusen,

531
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,780
Xingjie got an earful from Grandpa.

532
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,980
Now he's stuck in time-out
reflecting on what he did.

533
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,500
He didn't even show up
for breakfast today.

534
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,020
He had it coming.

535
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,180
He's been a total pain.

536
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:21,980
Yusen,

537
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,440
where's your girlfriend?

538
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,920
I only got to say a quick hi

539
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,720
to her yesterday.

540
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,620
I'd really like
to actually get to know her.

541
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,760
Let's make it somewhere else next time.

542
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,720
I'm not even sure

543
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,580
why I was called in today.

544
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,140
It's bound to be something good.

545
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:32,820
By the way,

546
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,100
just between us,

547
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,600
my dad was the one who snitched.

548
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,720
You really are the MVP
of throwing your dad under the bus.

549
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,580
Well, my dad loves doing
that kind of stuff.

550
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,080
It's in my genes.

551
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,740
Then I guess
I won't keep any secrets either.

552
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,960
My mom snitched too.

553
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,740
Thanks for the team effort, guys.

554
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,100
Yusen, you should head in.

555
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,800
We're taking off.

556
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,160
Wait up.

557
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:01,920
Grandpa.

558
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,760
Yusen, you're here.

559
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:04,760
Have a seat.

560
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,740
You mentioned that you took a trip
to Guangdong.

561
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,300
What was that for?

562
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,860
First, I went to Guangzhou

563
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,160
to sign
a strategic partnership agreement

564
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,800
with Qicai Glass.

565
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,180
Then I headed to Shenzhen

566
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,880
to meet
with some equipment manufacturers

567
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,920
about co-developing

568
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,060
new tech and machinery.

569
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,860
New tech and machinery

570
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,580
sounds like it would cost a fortune.

571
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,420
Actually, this plan

572
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,260
doesn't drain our cash flow.

573
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,340
If anything, it takes

574
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,580
some of the financial pressure
off Shuangyuan.

575
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,060
Go on, give me the details.

576
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,620
It's similar

577
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,300
to a "turnkey project" logic.

578
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,360
In the early stages, Shuangyuan provides
the application scenarios

579
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,380
and technical guidance,

580
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,160
while the equipment side funds the R&D

581
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,560
and provides the machinery

582
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,400
we need for production.

583
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,520
Once the technology matures,

584
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,180
it'll be rolled out to the wider market,

585
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,540
and Shuangyuan will share
the profits with them.

586
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,240
Good.

587
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,480
Well done.

588
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,100
That way, we save

589
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,980
on equipment costs,

590
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,260
and we can even make a bit of money

591
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,520
off the machinery
once the tech goes mainstream.

592
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,560
No matter the business,

593
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,120
the key to management

594
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,160
boils down to four words:

595
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,340
cut costs, boost efficiency.

596
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,560
It sounds simple enough,

597
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,660
but it's incredibly tough

598
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,980
to actually pull off.

599
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,040
We're standing on the shoulders

600
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,320
of the giants who came before us.

601
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,160
I'm just trying to keep things moving.

602
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,060
Whether you can keep things
moving or not

603
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,440
depends entirely on your grasp
of the big picture

604
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,740
and your control over the capital.

605
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,440
Zhang Ming

606
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,160
is supposed to retire this year, right?

607
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,440
His wife

608
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,900
has been pushing him to retire

609
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,360
so they can spend more time
with their children.

610
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,120
But with the way the PV market
is right now,

611
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,260
he just can't bring himself
to walk away.

612
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,180
He's a man of vision

613
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,560
and drive.

614
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,960
Back when

615
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,840
he was trying to convince me to invest

616
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,340
in PERC

617
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,720
technology,

618
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,080
he practically camped out at the office

619
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,020
and cornered me for days.

620
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,360
When he retires,

621
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,560
I want you to take over

622
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,100
the reins of this company.

623
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,900
I'm transferring
all of the Shuangyuan shares

624
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,800
into your name.

625
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,120
I've actually been meaning to tell you

626
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,660
that once Shuangyuan
is back on its feet,

627
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,120
I plan to get back into medicine.

628
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,220
You're going back to being a doctor?

629
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,640
I can't really be a doctor anymore,

630
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,500
but I'll do something related.

631
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,680
You still can't let it go.

632
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,520
Fair enough.

633
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,660
But what you do in the future

634
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,560
has nothing to do with me

635
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,600
giving you the Shuangyuan shares.

636
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,220
My word is final.

637
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,140
You can do whatever you want with them.

638
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,440
You can sell them,

639
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,460
or you can let

640
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,420
your future wife manage them.

641
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,160
It's none of my business.

642
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,880
I'll have to ask

643
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,220
my mom what she thinks.

644
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,340
Go ahead.

645
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,600
Do it now.

646
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,140
It's 2 AM in Switzerland.

647
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,720
She's fast asleep.

648
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,400
Asleep?

649
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,500
Well, that's as good as

650
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,440
a "yes," isn't it?

651
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,900
Unbelievable. These days,

652
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,860
you can't even give away shares
if you try.

653
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,040
Li,

654
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,060
first thing Monday,

655
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,460
get Legal and Finance

656
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,100
on this.

657
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,420
Grandpa.

658
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,560
No more excuses.

659
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,940
You're nearly 30.

660
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,699
It's time to settle down
and build your career.

661
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,100
I'm

662
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,719
giving you a business of your own.

663
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,760
This has nothing to do with your mom.

664
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,420
It's my decision.

665
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,320
Get going.

666
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,100
I guess that Nie girl

667
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,000
is still waiting for you.

668
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:50,500
Go on.

669
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,200
Tell Bokai

670
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,780
I'm giving him one last chance.

671
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,740
Put Xingjie in charge

672
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,340
of the Suzhou data center project.

673
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,160
If he blows it again,

674
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,520
I'm done with him.

675
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,640
Got you a coffee.

676
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,400
So, how did it go?

677
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,840
What did he want all of a sudden?

678
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,200
Grandpa

679
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,520
gave me all the shares in Shuangyuan.

680
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,260
[Shengyuan Group]
Got it.

681
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,400
Drag your feet on it.

682
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,140
No need to rush.

683
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:24,700
Hello?

684
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,380
Nie Chengyuan,

685
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,780
don't play games with me.

686
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,020
I was wondering

687
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,580
why you suddenly bailed
on my dad's birthday banquet.

688
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,340
Turns out
you just didn't want to be there

689
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,700
while your daughter was busy

690
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,840
backing up my nephew.

691
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,680
What are you talking about?

692
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,580
My daughter?

693
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,540
Xiguang?

694
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,080
She went to the banquet?

695
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Now, this is getting interesting.

696
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,660
You really had no idea

697
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,400
your daughter was there?

698
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,280
You're losing your touch

699
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,340
as a father.

700
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,260
Two nights ago, my nephew

701
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,760
was the talk of the town.

702
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,160
He was holding hands with your daughter

703
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,520
in front of everyone,

704
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,600
looking incredibly cozy.

705
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,460
They totally stole Xingjie's spotlight.

706
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,560
Everyone's saying

707
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,580
Nie Chengyuan's only daughter

708
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,920
has fallen for my sister's son.

709
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,920
Sure, he might not inherit

710
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,060
the Sheng fortune,

711
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,040
but

712
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,780
he's positioned himself

713
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,220
to swallow Yuancheng in one bite.

714
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,320
I didn't know she went there.

715
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,820
I only just found out they were dating

716
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,060
because of you.

717
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,800
I only started looking into it

718
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,840
after Lin Yusen moved to Suzhou.

719
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,260
Right, I remember now.

720
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,920
That's true.

721
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,440
Now that I think back on it,

722
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,300
it looks like

723
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,320
my nephew has been gunning

724
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,440
for your family all along.

725
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,260
No wonder he volunteered

726
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,340
to go to Suzhou.

727
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,220
Fine, I'll give him that. He's good.

728
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,480
You've spent half your life
building this empire,

729
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,140
only to let someone else
walk away with the prize.

730
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
What kind of nonsense is that?

731
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,260
I'm not dead yet.

732
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,980
Besides,

733
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,620
just because they're dating

734
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,960
doesn't mean anything is set in stone.

735
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,280
It's only a matter of time.

736
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,740
You've seen

737
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,960
my nephew's schemes

738
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,320
and tactics firsthand.

739
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,020
Combined with his face,

740
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,760
he will have your sweetheart

741
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,120
wrapped around his little finger.

742
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,020
You might as well

743
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,400
get used to the idea
of being his father-in-law.

744
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,020
Enough.

745
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,340
I'll deal with that.

746
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,080
Is that the only reason you called?

747
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,960
Anyway, about Shuangyuan.

748
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,840
Didn't you mention a few days ago

749
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,580
that you were thinking

750
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,360
about selling the plant?

751
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,220
Yeah.

752
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,060
I ran into a silicon supplier

753
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,100
last week

754
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,580
who's very interested in Shuangyuan.

755
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,260
European policies

756
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,260
are getting stricter by the day.

757
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,160
The overseas market is completely dead.

758
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,540
We might as well cash out
while there's someone

759
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,540
willing to take over.

760
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,780
After all, it's not

761
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,080
where our main focus is anyway.

762
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,560
That's not going to work now.

763
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,780
I don't know how my nephew

764
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,860
sweet-talked my dad,

765
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,440
but the old man suddenly announced

766
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,040
he's transferring
all the Shuangyuan shares

767
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:35,960
to him.

768
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,980
The paperwork has already reached

769
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,460
Finance and Legal.

770
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,520
It looks like a done deal,

771
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,740
unless...

772
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:44,860
Unless what?

773
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,400
Unless you block it.

774
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,160
A share transfer

775
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,380
requires the consent
of at least half the shareholders.

776
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,520
If you say no,

777
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,760
my dad can't go over your head.

778
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,240
That's all I'm going to say.

779
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
You decide what to do.

780
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,220
One more thing.

781
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,960
Fengteng is planning to build

782
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,120
a smart digital center in Suzhou.

783
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,360
Are you planning

784
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,040
to get involved?

785
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,740
For us, it's optional.

786
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:06,860
Why?

787
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,220
Is Shengyuan interested?

788
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,020
Xingjie is in charge of that project.

789
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:11,960
But

790
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,460
he's young and lacks experience.

791
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:14,820
I'd like you

792
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,800
and a few other old friends

793
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,540
to step in

794
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,040
and pave the way for him.

795
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,600
How exactly do you want me to help?

796
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,580
Nothing too complicated.

797
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,040
Just put together a team

798
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,740
to go through the motions with him.

799
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,040
Once he wins the bid,

800
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,540
we'll all share the profits.

801
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,840
Mr. Bokai,

802
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,020
bid-rigging is illegal.

803
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,760
Don't make it sound

804
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,860
so ugly.

805
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,460
Xingjie is still young.

806
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,980
What's wrong with a veteran like you

807
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,020
helping out him?

808
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,500
It's perfectly reasonable.

809
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
Don't try to wiggle out of it.

810
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,520
In return, I'll find someone to help

811
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,540
push through that permit

812
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,200
for your Nanjing project.

813
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:50,800
We'll see.

814
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,820
My head hurts. I'm hanging up.

815
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:57,960
Chengyuan,

816
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,180
who were you on the phone with?

817
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,080
Didn't I tell you to rest

818
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,420
and stop stressing yourself out?

819
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,940
Easy for you to say.

820
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,620
If I don't stress,

821
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,040
who's going to make the money? You?

822
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,220
Don't give me that talk

823
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,880
while you're living in a villa

824
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,180
and spending money like water.

825
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,940
It's easy to talk
when it's not your burden.

826
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,140
You're

827
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,700
such a baby.

828
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,420
Always so grumpy
when you're under the weather.

829
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,700
You'll never grow up, will you?

830
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,940
Does it still hurt?

831
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,400
Maybe we really should go see a doctor.

832
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,520
No need.

833
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,920
It's much better than yesterday.

834
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,920
Stop burning that incense.

835
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,620
It's probably

836
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,020
full of chemicals

837
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,100
or something.

838
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,920
It's giving me a headache.

839
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,500
Fine,

840
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,480
you're the boss.

841
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,760
I'll move the incense burner right away.

842
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,020
Calm down.

843
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,420
Also,

844
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,020
I've been

845
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,000
scolding Nianyuan for days.

846
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,380
She knows she messed up

847
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,440
and will never do it again.

848
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:01,660
But

849
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
Nianyuan has been out

850
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,160
with you before.

851
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,380
Obviously, someone is going to try

852
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,260
to get to you through her.

853
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,640
Who wouldn't want to rub off
on your good luck?

854
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,280
I'll tell her

855
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,340
to be more careful.

856
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,100
She needs to stay

857
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,460
far away from people like that.

858
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,980
I'm trying to think.

859
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,700
Just leave.

860
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,380
Alright.

861
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,320
Get some sleep.

862
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,160
I'll go check if the soup is ready.
