[Episode 28]

12
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,280
Why are you acting so skittish?

13
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,460
Can't you show a bit more poise?

14
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,680
I'm just worried
Mr. Nie is still fuming.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
It's probably best
to stay out of his way.

16
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,500
It's fine.

17
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,500
I'll talk him around

18
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,100
and just pin everything

19
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,940
on Lin Yusen.

20
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,160
Nie Chengyuan is paranoid anyway.

21
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,440
If I keep whispering in his ear,

22
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,100
he'll come to believe

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,200
it's Lin's own fault,

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,120
not yours.

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,620
Besides,

26

Lin Yusen

27
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,720
was probably up to something
from the start.

28
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,140
Mom,

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,880
that's brilliant.

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,780
It sounds simple,

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,700
but the art of talking
your way through things

32
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,700
takes a lifetime to master.

33
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,840
I'll never pull that off.

34
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,000
Mom,

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,920
why did you take down
the incense burner?

36
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,520
He's got a headache

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,020
and insists it's from the smell

38
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,640
of my incense.

39
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,040
Men just get so difficult

40
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,520
with age,

41
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,120
always second-guessing everything.

42
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,700
I used to judge Jiang Yun

43
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,540
for being so impulsive.

44
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,079
But after overhearing

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,780
Nie Chengyuan's calls lately,
I only just realized

46
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,940
she made off

47
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,400
with over half the cash and property

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,140
in that divorce.

49
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,840
Now Nie Chengyuan barely has

50
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,320
any liquid assets left.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,100
And here I was calling her stupid.

52
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,600
Turns out, I'm the real idiot here.

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,880
With all that money from the divorce,

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,579
she can live however she wants

55
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,480
and have her pick of any man

56
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,579
she fancies.

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,500
Isn't that way better than slaving away

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,940
for some 50-year-old man?

59
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,040
Mom, stop it.

60
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,400
Mr. Nie might hear you.

61
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,720
It's fine. He's in bed.

62
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,920
I know what I'm doing.

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,080
I'm just venting because I'm sick

64
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,600
of waiting on him
hand and foot these days.

65
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,740
I'm at his beck and call

66
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,400
all day,

67
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,420
and I don't even get a thank-you glance.

68
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,120
But that's what I get

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,200
for not being able to make a fortune.

70
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,480
Are you heading out?

71
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,360
Qian is in Wuxi.

72
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,120
Order whatever you guys want today.

73
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,000
It's on me.

74
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,340
Wait, didn't we agree I'd treat?

75
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,780
Last time you guys came to Wuxi,

76
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,760
Mr. Zhao picked up the tab.

77
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,320
I can't let that happen again.

78
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,920
Plus,

79
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,180
you just sent me

80
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,700
my cut from the boutique today.

81
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,620
A few grand a month

82
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,280
is nothing.

83
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,860
I'm treating

84
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,160
to thank Mr. Zhao.

85
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,520
That investment he set me up with

86
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,560
made 10% in just a few days.

87
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,800
If I'd known,

88
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,520
I would've put in more.

89
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,280
Too bad I only put in three million.

90
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,000
So you made three hundred thousand?

91
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,440
What are you jealous for?

92
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,340
Three hundred grand

93
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,760
is pocket change to you.

94
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,520
Yeah,

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,840
that's just wine money for you, right?

96
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,420
Not lately.

97
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,279
My family's been keeping
a tight leash on me.

98
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,899
My dad is annoyed with me,

99
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,680
so he cut my allowance
by more than half.

100
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,420
I'm practically slumming it now.

101
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,700
Yeah.

102
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,300
Asking home for money

103
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,820
always comes with a lecture

104
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,680
and a lot of attitude.

105
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
Making your own money
is much more satisfying.

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,320
Being at someone's mercy

107
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,040
really blows.

108
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,420
Is this investment thing legit?

109
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,460
How does it actually work?

110
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,560
I caught a bit of it last time,

111
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,300
but I didn't quite get it.

112
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,740
If there's a new way to make money,

113
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,580
don't leave me out.

114
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,840
I already burned through the cash

115
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,540
Qian helped me rake in.

116
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,480
Who's leaving you out?

117
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,920
When I told you last time,

118
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,960
you weren't even listening.

119
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,300
I don't feel like explaining it again.

120
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,280
Next time,

121
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,520
I'll get someone from the brokerage firm

122
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:53,960
to walk you through it.

123
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,880
When is "next time"?

124
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,880
You're holding up my hustle.

125
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,420
Just spit it out.

126
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,240
Just tell him.

127
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,460
Nianyuan and I are going to order.

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,380
Excuse me, we're ready to order.

129
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,520
So, this is the app.

130
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,500
I've used a lot of platforms,

131
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,040
but this is the only one
that's rock solid.

132
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,340
What do you mean by "rock solid"?

133
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,320
We'll have the Australian lobster.

134
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,060
Like, you won't lose money?

135
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,520
I'm not saying it's magic,

136
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,540
but

137
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,820
the platform does have

138
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,080
a very solid safety net.

139
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,300
They set the stop-loss

140
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,180
at 95%,

141
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,720
which means the most you can lose

142
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
is 5%.

143
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,880
But the upside

144
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,780
is unlimited.

145
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,240
More importantly,

146
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,960
the net value updates in real-time,

147
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,900
and with T+0 redemption,

148
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,580
it's super flexible.

149
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,480
Your capital won't be tied up at all.

150
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,840
Who cares about losing 5%?

151
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,640
I'll try putting in a million.

152
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,780
I want in too.

153
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,460
You putting in a million as well?

154
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,720
I just bought some jewelry,

155
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,200
so I don't have much left

156
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,240
in my allowance this month.

157
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,840
I'll start with 150 thousand...

158
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,820
200 thousand.

159
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,680
Yeah,

160
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,220
just put in a little bit for fun.

161
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,300
Later on,

162
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,040
you should go to a brokerage firm
to open an account.

163
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,860
I'm too lazy to go, though.

164
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,580
I'll just snap a photo of my ID

165
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,480
and have someone else handle it.

166
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,700
I think I'd rather go myself.

167
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,660
Where is it?

168
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,680
They have branches
in Shanghai and Suzhou.

169
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,660
I'm not sure about Wuxi.

170
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,280
Swing by Suzhou sometime
and get it all squared away.

171
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,820
I can go check out
the place in person too.

172
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:23,860
Sounds good.

173
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,080
Let's go together.

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,200
Since our building

175
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,100
is a bit unique,

176
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,200
the labor costs

177
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,420
for this specific installation

178
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,940
are higher than the market average.

179
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,260
We can handle it internally,

180
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,300
and I should be able

181
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,220
to get Finance to sign off on it.

182
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,520
But

183
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,540
you're also overcharging us

184
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,480
for standard materials and labor,

185
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,920
which is just ridiculous.

186
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,280
I swear,

187
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,320
we're just following

188
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,440
the market rates.

189
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,020
Mr. Bao,
let's not get defensive just yet.

190
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,740
Let's go through this item by item.

191
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,440
First, let's look at the cement.

192
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,560
I compared this to your quote

193
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,800
for the Phase II plant.

194
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,720
We didn't raise the price, did we?

195
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,600
True,

196
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,600
but the price of cement
has actually dropped

197
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,300
quite a bit lately.

198
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,380
So, how's the negotiation going?

199
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,800
Mr. Ding,

200
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,560
at this price,

201
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,040
we're barely breaking even

202
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,100
and just can't pull it off.

203
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,200
Shuangyuan

204
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,820
is all about mutual profit.

205
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,780
We'll make sure our partners

206
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,560
have a decent profit margin.

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,780
Mr. Bao, why don't you guys

208
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,600
go back and give it some thought?

209
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,640
Times are tough,

210
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,760
so we should focus

211
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,740
on making the deal happen.

212
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,240
Honestly, we're not in a huge rush

213
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,280
for this project,

214
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,800
so

215
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,200
we can wait for your reply.

216
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,780
[Area A, M1 Office]

217
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,560
She seems

218
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,360
so quiet and sweet, always beaming,

219
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,560
but man, she really knows

220
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,320
how to haggle.

221
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,840
She's got our costs

222
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,600
and profits

223
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,480
all figured out.

224
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,860
Well, at least she left us
some breathing room,

225
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,820
so it's manageable.

226
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,080
But make sure the work is solid

227
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,580
because she doesn't look like someone
you can easily fool.

228
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,400
Do it right the first time
to avoid any rework.

229
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,320
Got it.

230
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,400
I heard

231
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,740
she was Mr. Lin's girlfriend,

232
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,420
so I figured she was just a figurehead

233
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:14,920
who was here

234
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,020
to look good and pad her résumé

235
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,860
for a promotion.

236
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,560
Or maybe she was here
on someone's behalf

237
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,900
to ask for this,

238
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,900
so I padded the quote

239
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,100
to make things easier for everyone.

240
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,380
I didn't expect her to be the real deal.

241
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,300
And it seems like
she's actually calling the shots.

242
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,120
Mr. Lin?

243
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,660
The Deputy GM at their plant?

244
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
The really handsome guy?

245
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,179
Who else?

246
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,299
Are you serious?

247
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,360
I heard

248
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,340
he's got a background with Shengyuan.

249
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,039
I heard that
from the folks at the plant.

250
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,260
Who knows?

251
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:42,659
The car's here.

252
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's go.

253
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,940
Why didn't you grab dinner

254
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,020
with Mr. Lin today?

255
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,880
Mr. Lin's been slammed all day.

256
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,000
I haven't even caught a glimpse of him.

257
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,840
The park office called him away

258
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,340
for a dinner tonight.

259
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,100
Apparently some big shot is in town.

260
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,540
No wonder

261
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,540
you're free

262
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,720
to eat with us.

263
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,120
So it's just because your boyfriend
is not around.

264
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,900
You make it sound like

265
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
I'm the type to ditch my friends
for a guy.

266
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,140
Alright then,

267
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,280
if you're not that type,

268
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,500
come with us to Zhouzhuang
this Saturday.

269
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,040
I'm supposed to have dinner
at his place on Saturday.

270
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,860
Ms. Chen

271
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
has already got
all the ingredients ready.

272
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,640
Then let's move it.

273
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,580
Sunday works too.

274
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,860
Actually, I have some plans
this Sunday too.

275
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,680
I knew you were the type
to put your guy first,

276
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,380
but I didn't realize

277
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,080
it had gotten this bad.

278
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,180
It's just that you asked
on such short notice.

279
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,640
It's already Thursday,

280
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,620
and the seafood Ms. Chen ordered

281
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,260
has already arrived.

282
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:58,980
Next weekend,

283
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,340
I'm all yours

284
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,680
for both days.

285
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, make sure you tell him

286
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,980
Yuhua was the one who invited you,

287
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,820
not me.

288
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,740
After all, Mr. Lin sees me
every single day.

289
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,900
Sure, Xiguang is the type
to choose her man over us,

290
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,380
but you're no saint either.

291
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,500
Water's boiling.

292
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,240
Time to drop the noodles.

293
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,360
Slow down. Have some juice.

294
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,580
You bought this again?

295
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,120
This one has real fruit bits.

296
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:30,940
It's good.

297
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,040
By the way,

298
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,620
I wanted to ask you guys something.

299
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,960
Is anyone at the office

300
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,320
gossiping about me and Lin Yusen?

301
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Oh, for sure.

302
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,260
But it's not a big deal,

303
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
just some idle chatter.

304
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,020
That's just how it is.

305
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,000
They even talk

306
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,560
about Qiqi dating

307
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,360
that guy from Tech.

308
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,820
Did you hear something?

309
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,300
I was over at Engineering today

310
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,220
going over the deal
with the contractors.

311
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,820
I overheard them

312
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,740
chatting by the entrance

313
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,940
as they were leaving.

314
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,100
What'd they say?

315
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,680
They were hinting that Lin Yusen

316
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,600
is playing favorites with me.

317
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,220
It's none of their business.

318
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,780
You've been working your tail off,

319
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,300
and you've put in
more overtime than anyone.

320
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,280
Playing favorites, my foot.

321
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,720
If anything, I think Mr. Lin
is being too hard on you.

322
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,280
Exactly.

323
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,160
Isn't being favored supposed

324
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,400
to be getting paid for doing nothing?

325
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,080
You're out there
running yourself ragged.

326
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,040
Whatever,

327
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,780
don't let it get to you.

328
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,580
I'm not even mad.

329
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,240
Here.

330
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,800
Really?

331
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:29,960
Really.

332
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,560
First of all,

333
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,100
the fact that they're saying that

334
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,660
means I did a great job
driving a hard bargain.

335
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,640
Second,

336
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,220
I've been thinking

337
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,780
maybe I'm

338
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,200
still a bit green.

339
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,360
Putting me in charge of a project
like this,

340
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,040
Mr. Lin isn't exactly innocent
in all this.

341
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,720
He deserves

342
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,200
to be talked about.

343
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,480
True.

344
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,360
That logic is spot on.

345
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,220
Mr. Lin is definitely the "guilty" one.

346
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,000
Right?

347
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,460
What can I do?

348
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,720
For the sake

349
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,820
of Mr. Lin's reputation,

350
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,660
I guess I'll have to step it up

351
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,480
and make sure my work
is absolutely flawless.

352
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,400
Don't you dare call me the type

353
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,300
to ditch friends for a guy anymore.

354
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,560
I just turned down

355
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,000
Mr. Lin's invitation
for a late-night snack.

356
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,020
I told him I'm having

357
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,980
instant noodles with my friends.

358
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,040
What?

359
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,480
You want to invite
Yin Jie and Yuhua along?

360
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,940
Still no.

361
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,360
Trying to bribe my besties?

362
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,640
Nice try, but it's not going to work.

363
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,600
Our friendship is rock solid

364
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,860
and can't be bought with snacks.

365
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,020
Don't put us on a pedestal, Xiguang.

366
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,340
Actually, we're a total pushover
for snacks.

367
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,360
Ladies, please make your way downstairs.

368
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,980
I'm down in the parking lot

369
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,200
and I've got some good news for you.

370
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,580
Come closer.

371
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,020
What?

372
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,420
Get in.

373
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,660
Hurry up.

374
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Get in.

375
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,400

376
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,420
is this how you two

377
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,520
usually date? All hush-hush?

378
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,800
This is actually kind of a rush.

379
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,620
My heart

380
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,040
is actually pounding.

381
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,080
No, we don't.

382
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,000
As soon as you got downstairs,

383
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,580
you started acting all sketchy,

384
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,080
looking over your shoulder,

385
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,320
and making Yuhua and me

386
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,700
feel all sneaky too.

387
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,740
Yeah.

388
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,320
What exactly are you feeling
so guilty about?

389
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,340
Me?

390
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,460
Am I?

391
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,460
I guess I should do
some self-reflection.

392
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,360
Anyway, what was that good news
you mentioned?

393
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,380
I was at a meeting
at the park office today,

394
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,520
and the leadership

395
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,780
asked a lot of questions

396
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,900
about the PV industry
and how our company is doing.

397
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,740
They heard we're planning to build

398
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,800
a BIPV

400
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,020
and were really interested.

401
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,360
They want us

402
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,340
to get our materials submitted ASAP.

403
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,800
If we meet the requirements,

404
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,140
we can apply for a subsidy.

405
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,040
Really?

406
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,340
Mr. Wang looked into it,

407
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,320
but it led nowhere at the time.

408

If this is true, it's amazing.

409
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,340

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,960

412
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,500
Good grief.

418

Well, thank you

424

427
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,440
the specific date?

528

530
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,280

532
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,100

547
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,060

549

to me and Yuhua?

552
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,380

557

and assembly lines a few years back.

559
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,080
This time, I'd like to focus on the lab.

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,440
is Liuguang Garden.

564
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,900
Xiguang,

565
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,380
I heard from Lin

566
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,340
that you're in charge of
the whole thing?

567
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,120
Not really.

568
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,000
I just pulled the resources together.

569
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,460
The design and construction teams

570
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,440
were already set,

571
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,020
and Tech is handling

572
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,340
the PV system.

573
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,600
I'm mostly just

574
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,720
the go-fer.

575
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,740
Look at you,

576
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,240
being all humble.

577
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,560
Pulling all those resources together

578
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,540
and getting it done

579
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,180
right in such a short time

580
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,120
is no small feat.

581
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,340
Aunt,

582
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:14,820
Mom,

583
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,140
why didn't you

584
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,600
tell me you were coming?

585
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,740
You guys were being so sneaky.

586
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,880
You gave me quite a scare

587
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,740
when you hopped
out of the car at the site.

588
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,920
We were just taking a page

589
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,180
out of your book.

590
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,340
Ah?

591
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,380
Like how you startled me

592
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,780
at the banquet.

593
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,220
Huh?

594
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,400
Surprised me.

595
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,560
Xiguang mentioned

596
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,980
that the Head of Tech

597
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,040
is brilliant.

598
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,240
Why didn't we

599
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,060
see him

600
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,120
at the groundbreaking ceremony earlier?

601
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,380
Mr. Hua is a pretty straightforward guy,

602
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,640
not really

603
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,360
into the whole spotlight thing.

604
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,140
He thinks those events
are a waste of time.

605
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,460
Mr. Lin,

606
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,460
what brings you here?

607
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,920
Where's Mr. Hua?

608
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,260
I told him this morning

609
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,200
that I'd be bringing some VIPs

610
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,980
to tour the lab this afternoon.

611
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,340
Mr. Hua is in the lab.

612
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,380
He must have forgotten
to mention it to us again.

613
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,400
I'll go get him.

614
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,340
You guys have a seat.

615
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,300
Where's my phone?

616
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,280
Wait.

617
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,160
I...

618
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,860
Where's my phone?

619
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,480
Quick, help me find it.

620
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,540
I need to tell Mr. Lin

621
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,600
and Mr. Zhang the news.

622
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,340
Wait,

623
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,140
boss,

624
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,680
boss.

625
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,440
What is it?

626
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,340
Mr. Lin and the others are here.

627
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,060
They're right here.

628
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,880
Where?

629
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:41,680
Right here.

630
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,720
Mr. Lin,

631
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,920
I've got great news!

632
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,280
Our lab...

633
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,840
It's okay.

634
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,780
There are no outsiders here.

635
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,520
The photoelectric conversion rate

636
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,660
in our lab

637
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,420
just went up another 0.5%.

638
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,100
Really?

639
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:02,980
Are the numbers stable?

640
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,920
We've run the tests over and over.

641
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,360
Look,

642
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,720
the fluctuation is less than 0.1%.

643
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,360
Let's go to the lab.

644
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,160
Okay.

645
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,880
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

646
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,660
Mr. Hua is something else.

647
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,700
He refused to come out for dinner

648
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,980
with us no matter what.

649
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,420
I really wanted to pick his brain

650
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
about the technical details

651
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,220
of BIPV.

652
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,160
At a time like this,

653
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,180
Mr. Hua probably wishes

654
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,200
he could spend 24 hours a day

655
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,040
in the lab.

656
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,200
You can't drag him away.

657
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,420
For the technical side

658
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,100
of BIPV,

659
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,560
Mrs. Jiang,

660
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,580
you can just ask Xiguang.

661
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,540
She does way more
than just coordinate resources.

662
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,000
She's read a ton of

663
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,780
technical books.

664
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,580
At this point, she's an expert,

665
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,860
at least in the practical applications.

666
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,440
That's just how she is.

667
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,400
She's either being lazy

668
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,180
and doing nothing at all,

669
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,440
or she's going all in

670
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,200
to be the absolute best.

671
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,380
You two,

672
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,000
stop talking me up.

673
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,880
But Aunt,

674
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,900
feel free to ask me
any questions you have.

675
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,060
I can handle the basics,

676
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,460
and if there's anything
I'm not 100% sure about,

677
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,580
I'll check with Mr. Hua for you.

678
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,360
Sounds good.

679
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,180
I saw in your brochure,

680
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,620
here,

681
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,280
that the total area

682
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,000
of the PV panels at Liuguang Garden

683
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,340
is 460 square meters,

684
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,020
with a monthly output of over 4,000 kWh.

685
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,100
Is that output consistent?

686
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,740
And how much

687
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,040
did the cost of this building increase

688
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,160
compared to a standard one?

689
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,500
Lin,

690
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,740
for this

691
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,340
PERC technology,

692
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,280
can you still maintain

693
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,380
that kind of conversion rate

694
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,240
when moving from the lab

695
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,140
to actual production?

696
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,220
It'll definitely drop a bit,

697
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,560
but

698
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:29,940
one of the biggest perks

699
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,820
of PERC technology

700
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,780
is its stability.

701
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,920
We expect it to hold steady

702
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,140
at around 20%.

703
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,160
With this tech in hand,

704
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,380
Shuangyuan has a very bright future.

705
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,200
Sorry,

706
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,580
the traffic was a nightmare.

707
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,780
Mr. Zhang, have a seat.

708
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,680
Sorry I'm late.

709
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,120
We just got here too.

710
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,040
You recommended this place,

711
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
so we're waiting for you to order.

712
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,200
Well, I won't say no to that.

713
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,160
Excuse me.

714
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,440
The squirrel-shaped mandarin fish here

715
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,240
is legendary,

716
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,120
so we definitely need one.

717
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,860
[Uncle Shukai]

718
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,420
And then...

719
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,020
Uncle Shukai?

720
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,580
I'm out having dinner.

721
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,100
I see.

722
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,980
Thanks for the heads-up, Uncle Shukai.

723
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,400
Okay,

724
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,500
I'll let you know when I'm in Shanghai.

725
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,140
This one.

726
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,500
The gorgon euryale seed with osmanthus.

727
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,660
Did your uncle ask you
to head over to Shanghai?

728
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:28,540
Yeah.

729
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,640
And finally,

730
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,160
a bowl of three-shrimp noodles
for everyone.

731
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:33,920
Here,

732
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,040
see if you want anything else.

733
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,660
That's plenty.

734
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,700
We're watching our weight.

735
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,920
We can't even finish all this.

736
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,800
True.

737
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:39,960
Our appetites

738
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,680
aren't what they used to be.

739
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,480
That should do it.

740
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,400
Yusen,

741
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,140
was your uncle

742
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,180
calling

743
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,620
about the transfer

744
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,080
of the shares in Shuangyuan?

745
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:56,900
Yes.

746
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,340
I heard the news

747
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,400
on my way here too.

748
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,680
I don't think

749
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,140
you need to hold back.

750
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,100
Just be upfront about it.

751
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,740
Ms. Jiang and Nie

752
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,680
are bound to find out sooner or later.

753
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,460
Find out what?

754
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,600
Does it involve us?

755
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,520
For Lin's grandpa

756
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,080
to transfer his shares in Shuangyuan

757
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,020
to Lin,

758
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,820
he needs more
than half of the shareholders

759
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,780
to agree.

760
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,280
Don't tell me

761
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,740
Xiguang's dad is the one holding out?

762
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,460
You've been looking so preoccupied
this whole way.

763
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,920
Is it because of

764
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,320
the share transfer?

765
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,720
I didn't expect my dad to be against it.

766
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,800
Why?

767
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,660
Is it still because

768
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,820
we're dating?

769
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,720
But he already knows

770
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,180
the truth about what happened back then.

771
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,380
Xiguang,

772
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,360
I don't think you should be

773
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,460
stressing over this.

774
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,260
More importantly,

775
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,660
don't go shoulder
all the blame yourself.

776
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,960
Regardless of why

777
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,720
your dad is opposed,

778
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,640
he's just exercising

779
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,820
his legal rights as a shareholder.

780
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,640
And don't worry.

781
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,400
Once my grandpa

782
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,880
gives his word,

783
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,820
given his personality,

784
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,360
he'll make sure it happens
no matter what.

785
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,540
Alright then.

786
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,940
Let's just

787
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,460
wait and see how things play out.

788
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,960
Actually,

789
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,860
I think something else

790
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,140
is a bit more important.

791
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,020
What?

792
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,460

795
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,980
It makes us sound so distant.

Your mom and aunt

797
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,400

my "official status"

Well,

00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,160
it's a habit

804

worth breaking.

805
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,840
I mean, I could,

806
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,720
but then

807
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,200
you'd be missing a part of you,
your surname.

808
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,980
And what if I am?

809
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,620
Then you wouldn't be "whole" anymore.

810
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,700
It sounds like

811
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,040
you're trying to use
some pretty flawed logic

812
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,680
to talk your way out of this.

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,000
Now, Sheng Xianmin just says the word

942
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,280
and hands them over to Lin Yusen.

943
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,860
But where is Lin Yusen going
to find the funds

944
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,800
to expand production later on?

945
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,280
The big players are going to start

946
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,940
swallowing up the smaller ones
in the PV industry.

947
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,320
Without Shengyuan's backing,

948
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,340
Shuangyuan won't last.

949
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,620
So, whether it's sold or not,

950
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,300
this transfer by Shengyuan

951
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,760
hurts my interests.

952
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,160
Naturally, I can't agree to it.

953
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,220
How interesting.

954
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,560
You and I both started from nothing.

955
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,060
Now that you've made it big,

956
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,160
you think capital
is the only thing that matters.

957
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,480
Setting Yuancheng aside,

958
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,520
look at the giants
in the PV industry today.

959
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,160
Which one of them didn't start
from scratch?

960
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,860
What makes you think

961
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,100
Shuangyuan

962
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,200
won't make it

963
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,280
under Lin and Xiguang?

964
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,800
You're quite close with him, I see.

965
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,480
Do you even know who Lin Yusen is?

966
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,140
You're really okay with Xiguang

967
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:13,940
dating him?

968
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,380
You've got a point there.

969
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,920
I clearly have

970
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,460
poor track record at judging character.

971
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,940
That's exactly why

972
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,760
I don't interfere with her choices.

973
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,460
Just stay out of this.

974
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,680
The group's decision is final.

975
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,280
For the next phase,

976
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,340
we're focusing all our energy
on real estate.

977
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,240
PV might take off,

978
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,520
but real estate is a sure thing

979
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,020
with high margins.

980
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,020
So

981
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,120
you're dead set on selling.

982
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,740
In that case,

983
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,780
how about selling out to me?

984
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,200
It'll save you the trouble
of convincing Shengyuan.

985
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,800
I'll pay

986
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,940
full market price.

987
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,060
Of course,

988
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,860
don't forget to deduct

989
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,380
the construction fees you owe Shuangyuan.

990
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
You're planning to get into PV?

991
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,180
I have no such plans.

992
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,100
But Xiguang

993
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,560
is working her heart out at Shuangyuan,

994
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,360
and I don't want you
raining on her parade.

995
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,820
It doesn't matter who you sell it to,

996
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,179
so it might as well be me.

997
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,719
Let's consider it

998
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,040
a gift from me

999
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,960
to Xiguang.

1000
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,920
I'm just trying to talk business,

1001
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,100
but you're

1002
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,260
making me look like the heartless,

1003
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,320
money-grubbing villain here,

1004
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,560
putting me in a real bind.

1005
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,020
You actually care about that?

1006
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,360
Those descriptions

1007
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,320
aren't exactly wrong, though.

1008
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,199
At least you have some self-awareness.

1009
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:34,980
Fine.

1010
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,960
Since you want to play the hero

1011
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,659
and score points with Xiguang

1012
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,620
by making me look heartless,

1013
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,780
why not go all the way

1014
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
and be the "perfect mother"?

1015
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,780
What do you mean?

1016
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,139
Nothing much.

1017
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,540
Don't you still hold some shares

1018
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,440
in Yuancheng?

1019
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,880
If you want the shares in Shuangyuan,

1020
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,699
swap them for your Yuancheng holdings.

1021
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,219
I'll pay you the difference

1022
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,320
in cash.

1023
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,420
Those few shares I kept

1024
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,020
are just a memento

1025
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,560
of being one of the founders.

1026
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,380
I never thought

1027
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,220
you couldn't even tolerate that

1028
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,800
and want me completely
out of the picture.

1029
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,820
There's no need for that kind of talk.

1030
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
It's just business.

1031
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,140
Besides,

1032
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,620
you've already left the group

1033
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,900
and taken what was yours.

1034
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,260
You don't contribute
to the company anymore,

1035
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,280
so there's no point
in holding onto them.

1036
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
Whether I contribute or not

1037
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,960
isn't for you to decide.

1038
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,260
But if you think

1039
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,160
I don't,

1040
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,060
I don't mind.

1041
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,340
It doesn't stop the company

1042
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,320
from paying out my dividends every year.

1043
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,700
Actually, knowing it bugs you

1044
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,500
makes me even happier.

1045
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,500
Xiguang is interested
in the PV industry.

1046
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,000
Buying a company for her

1047
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,700
isn't exactly a tall order.

1048
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,560
It doesn't have to be Shuangyuan.

1049
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,600
Why are you acting

1050
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,160
like it's some rare treasure

1051
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,720
and trying to blackmail me?

1052
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,200
Mr. Nie,

1053
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,280
here's my advice.

1054
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,420
Don't back yourself into a corner.

1055
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,940
If you don't agree
to Old Mr. Sheng's transfer,

1056
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,940
you'll have to buy
those shares yourself.

1057
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,960
But you don't want to buy them
and you can't afford to,

1058
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,100
so how is this going to end?

1059
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,140
I don't know what you and Sheng Bokai

1060
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,980
are plotting,

1061
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,700
but

1063
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,300
for him like this,

1064
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,520
what's in it for you?

1065
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,260
Or are you just

1066
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,280
throwing

1067
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
your "fatherly weight" around

1068
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,040
with Xiguang?

1069
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,420
If that's the case,

1070
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,700
don't

1071
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,400
turn around

1072
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,700
and blame

1073
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,740
Xiguang or me

1074
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,980
when she grows

1075
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,300
even more distant

00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,720
from you.

1077
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,560
I'm off.

What are you doing?

1093
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,880
Just

1094

doing some drawings.

1095
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,360
Xiguang,

1096
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,120
I talked to your dad

1097
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,160
yesterday

1098
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,640
about the Shuangyuan share transfer.

1099
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,560
What did he say?

1100
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,280
Why is he against it?

1101
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,460
He said

1102
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,000
he doesn't want to waste any more energy

1103
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,080
on other industries.

1104
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,320
There's an upstream silicon supplier

1105
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,900
looking to do a full buyout
of Shuangyuan.

1106
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,160
So,

1107
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,660
he wants to talk Shengyuan

1108
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,820
into selling their shares together.

1109
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,960
If Shengyuan gifts those shares

1110
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,220
to Lin,

1111
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,980
he definitely won't sell,

1112
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,160
and the whole deal
will probably fall through.

1113
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,520
Selling Shuangyuan right now?

1114
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,180
That is so short-sighted.

1115
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,440
I'm not going to comment
on his judgment.

1116
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,520
However, I did offer

1117
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,660
to buy out

1118
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,760
all of his shares in Shuangyuan.

1119
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,220
Mom,

1120
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,660
you're such a boss.

1121
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,900
So Dad agreed, right?

1122
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,760
That way he wouldn't even have to bother

1123
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,920
convincing Shengyuan.

1124
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,700
No, he refused.

1125
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,920
He even said he wouldn't do it

1126
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,900
unless I traded my shares
in Yuancheng for them.

1127
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,480
How can he be like that?

1128
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,420
That's way out of line.

1129
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,160
Why is it okay to sell
to total strangers,

1130
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,920
but he attaches strings

1131
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,180
like that when it's you?

1132
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,740
Don't agree to it.

1133
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,800
You have to turn him down.

1134
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,600
I turned him down on the spot.

1135
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,340
But

1136
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,340
since I got back,

1137
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,140
it suddenly occurred to me

1138
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,280
that it might actually be a good idea.

1139
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:01,780
Xiguang,

1140
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,820
I just met with the lawyer.

1141
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,120
I've decided

1142
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,960
to transfer all of my shares

1143
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,220
in Yuancheng to your dad.

1144
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,420
Mom, no.

1145
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,680
Don't do anything rash.

1146
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,780
Don't hurt your own interests

1147
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,100
just because of us.

1148
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,980
Yusen

1149
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,900
is actually planning

1150
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,040
to go into medical research
later on anyway.

1151
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,160
He's not going to stay at Shuangyuan.

1152
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,720
Regardless,

1153
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,940
this has nothing to do with you.

1154
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,500
Seriously,

1155
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,220
don't be impulsive.

1156
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:25,700
Look,

1157
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,100
I can't explain this properly
over the phone.

1158
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,740
Just wait for me.

1159
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,200
I was planning to come home tomorrow,

1160
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
but I'm heading back right now.

1161
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:31,880
