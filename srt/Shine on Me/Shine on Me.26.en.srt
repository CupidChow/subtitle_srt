that the market is shifting fast.

102
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,700

103
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,260

more investment,

105

Actually, I don't think

107
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,980

108
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,320

about a deeper partnership.

111
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,360
I floated the idea

112
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,860
of co-developing new production gear

113
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,720

114
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800

115
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,240
and hitting the market together.

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,320
They seemed

117
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,440
really into it.

118
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,680
If we can get the collab to that level,

119
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,040
it wouldn't just take

120
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,420
the short-term pressure
off Shuangyuan's cash flow.

121
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,420
It would actually open up
a whole new equipment business

122
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,500
for us down the road.

123
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,120
It's a total win-win.

124
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,340
Tomorrow, I'll take the folks from Tech

125
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,500

126
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,560
and fly to Guangzhou,

127
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,900

144
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,560
It wasn't a hard guess.

145

146
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,740

Morning.

376
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,540
Is this what being in a relationship
feels like?

377
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,960
The first thing I do every morning

378
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,820
is look for his good morning text.

379
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,940
I want to tell him everything I'm doing,

380
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,060
and I want to know what he's up to, too.

381
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,000
Suddenly,

382
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,620
there's this person in my life

383
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,540
who feels closer than anyone else.

384
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,060
He's there every single moment.

385
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,140
He occupies my thoughts

386
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,420
more than anyone ever has.

388
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,100
[Target Position:
A stable, permanent role]

389
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,540
Lin Yusen,

390
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,260
I just noticed your name

391
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,280
is literally all wood.

392
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,620
Does your birth chart say you're short
on that element or something?

393
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,460
With this much wood, the only thing
I'm missing is sunlight.

394
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
That's a whole lot of forest

395
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,820
just waiting for a little morning glow
[* "Xiguang" means "morning glow"]

396
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,480
to shine through, you know?

397
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,420
I'm holding out for you to hit me
with that scorching midday blaze.

♪Our love's gonna find a way♪

405
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,000
We spent all day yesterday
scouting the market

406
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,280
and brought back a bunch of samples.

407
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,860
I still feel like this one

408
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,280
is the best fit for our PV panels.

409
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,120
This one might work as well.

410
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,800
But from what we've been hearing
around the actual stores,

411
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,420
the prices are still kinda
on the high side.

412
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,100
Maybe it's because

413
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,340
we look young,
so they don't take us seriously.

414
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,080
I'm planning to check some online

415
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,140
supply platforms.

416
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,880
Let's divide

417
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,780
and conquer.

418
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,120
We'll touch base on Tuesday,

419
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,500
and sit down with them

420
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,260
on Thursday or Friday,

421
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,800
depending on Mr. Ding's schedule.

422
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,420
Got it.

423
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,320
I need to wait for Mr. Hua

424
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,280
to get back to do

425
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,080
a final double-check

426
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,840
on the PV system design.

427
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,660
Actually,

428
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,400
in our design,

429
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,600
the PV panels

430
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,540
aren't flush against the wall.

431
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,000
There's a 50-centimeter gap.

432
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,480
Is there any way we could design

433
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,500
some kind of sun-tracking system?

434
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,560
Theoretically, it's doable.

435
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,760
But

436
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,520
it'll definitely drive up the costs.

437
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,460
Money really
is the ultimate dealbreaker, isn't it?

438
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,480
Let's put that on the back burner
until we've got the budget for it.

439
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,020
Did you guys see the news?

440
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,140
Starting on the 6th,
the EU is going to require

441
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,160
import registration

442
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,180
for all our PV exports.

443
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,960
If things keep going this way,

444
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,740
are we all going to end up out of a job?

445
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,760
No way.

446
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,620
Expanding and building

447
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,480
the Phase II plant at a time like this

448
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,740
just shows the bosses

449
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,520
are really bullish on the future of PV.

450
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,900
Anyway, I'm heading out.

451
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,640
Bye.

452
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,500
See ya.

453
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,900
Hey Aunt.

454
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,880
Xiguang.

455
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,920
I heard from your mom

456
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,060
that you're dating Lin now.

457
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,280
Yeah, that's right.

458
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,340
Awesome.

459
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,620
I'm all for it.

460
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,720
In the dating market,
either don't bother

461
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,320
or find a real head-turner.

462
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,120
At least it's easy on the eyes, right?

463
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,260
Heading out on a date

464
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,700
after work?

465
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,780
Nah.

466
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,100
He's been away on a business trip
for days.

467
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,560
He doesn't get back till tomorrow.

468
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,860
Sending him off on a trip
right after you just started dating?

469
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,840
Your company

470
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,260
is kinda heartless, huh.

471
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,060
He arranged it himself.

472
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,600
Lin's got it pretty tough then.

473
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,560
Aunt,

474
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,720
that's a bit of a double standard,
don't you think?

475
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,980
Alright,

476
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,800
I'll give you a break.

477
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,580
You know about his grandpa's
birthday banquet

478
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,300
on Saturday, right?

479
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,660
Yeah,

480
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,780
he mentioned it to me.

481
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,160
The Sheng family's making
a big deal out of this one.

482
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,380
We haven't worked

483
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,480
with Shengyuan in years,

484
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,100
and we still got an invite.

485
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,500
Your uncle

486
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,320
might even run into Lin there.

487
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,580
You're not going with Lin, are you?

488
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,680
Of course not.

489
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,660
Right.

490
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,100
It's not the right time yet.

491
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,140
So are you going?

492
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,840
I can't be bothered

493
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,140
with these pretentious banquets.

494
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,880
Your uncle will just check the box

495
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,980
and be done with it.

496
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,660
Speaking of which, we're bidding

497
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,460
on a smart digital center project

498
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,900
for Fengteng.

499
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,000
And we're kinda competing

500
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,540
with Shengyuan on it.

501
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,640
Ms. Shen.

502
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,880
Anyway, I've got some stuff to handle.

503
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,640
Let's catch up later.

504
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,480
You two

505
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,960
should come visit Nanjing sometime.

506
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:28,980
Sure.

507
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,480
Aunt, you should come hang out in Suzhou

508
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,220
when you have time.

509
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,200
Deal.

510
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,420
Bye.

511
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm back at the hotel now.

512
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,020
Aunt told me

513
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,780
that Uncle is also going
to your grandpa's birthday banquet.

514
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,900
[Lin Yusen]

515
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,320
Uncle's going too?

516
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,280
I'll go find him.

517
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,980
Don't

518
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,600
call him that then.

519
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,620
I was just following your lead earlier.

520
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,040
Your grandpa's birthday banquet

521
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,160
is a pretty big deal.

522
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,260
They even invited people like my uncle,

523
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,740
who they barely even work with.

524
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,580
On one hand, it's his 80th birthday.

525
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,600
On the other hand,

526
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,120
it's to officially announce his heir.

527
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,680
Is it my classmate's boss?

528
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,600
Yeah.

529
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,700
It's better they just announce it.

530
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,780
That way he might stop targeting you.

531
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,440
From how my classmate

532
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,400
reacted last time,

533
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
he's definitely got a grudge
against you.

534
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,620
Targeting me?

535
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,180
Him? Seriously?

536
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,960
You're so full of yourself.

537
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,660
Humility is for people who deserve it.

538
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,920
Otherwise, my humility

539
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,900
would be completely worthless.

540
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,100
Xiguang,

541
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,240
tomorrow,

542
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,680
I won't be able to head back

543
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,380
as planned.

544
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,240
I ran into some issues while negotiating

545
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:58,960
with the equipment suppliers

546
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,180
here in Shenzhen.

547
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,360
What kind of issues?

548
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,280
We haven't settled the details

549
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,580
on the upfront investment

550
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,280
and the revenue sharing ratios.

551
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,100
Then what are you going to do?

552
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:05,980
It's fine.

553
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,100
I just need to spend a bit more time

554
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,980
talking things through.

555
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,140
We're just looking

556
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,340
to maximize our own interests.

557
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,620
With the chance to participate

558
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,380
in a technical industry upgrade

559
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,700
at such a low cost

560
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,860
and get a piece of the pie

561
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,740
in the emerging equipment market,

562
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,280
no one can turn down

563
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,440
a win-win deal like that.

564
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,680
We'll

565
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,300
definitely reach an agreement.

566
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,580
I really want to see

567
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,320
what you're like
when you're negotiating.

568
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
It's mostly

569
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,100
just cold-blooded bargaining

570
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,460
and looking quite heartless.

571
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,940
Hardly a pretty sight.

572
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,940
I've seen you look good enough.

573
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,200
Now, I want to see you being "ruthless".

574
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,280
Wait, what's this?

575
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,800
We've barely been together,

576
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,180
and you're already tired

577
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,520
of my handsome face?

578
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,620
Lin Yusen,

579
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,060
I think I need to learn

580
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,500
how to be a nitpicker from you.

581
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,080
No need.

582
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,820
This is a bad example.

583
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,900
Too late.

584
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,140
I've already learned it.

585
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,260
I think I just got myself into trouble.

586
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,160
Yep.

587
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,840
I'm a very fast learner.

588
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,260
So

589
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,960
you're landing

590
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,680
in Shanghai on Saturday,

591
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,020
going straight to the banquet,

592
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,900
and then heading back to Suzhou

593
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,000
on Sunday?

594
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,900
I'll be back Saturday night,

595
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,520
but I won't get in

596
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,140
until about 1 AM.

597
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,100
So I won't stop by to see you.

598
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,740
Why are you in such a rush to get back?

599
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,820
Just sleep in
and come back later on Sunday.

600
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,640
There's a reason, of course.

601
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,080
What reason?

602
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,640
Something urgent at the office?

603
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,180
Nothing at the office.

604
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,760
But something for me.

605
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,640
I've been away
from my girlfriend for too long.

606
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,760
I want to take her

607
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,380
to Tongdexing for breakfast

608
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,280
on Sunday.

609
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,500
Xiguang.

610
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,800
Xiguang,

611
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,700
did you get everything?

612
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,820
Look,

613
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,620
I managed to snag
some beef rolls on sale.

614
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,100
I got it all.

615
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,040
I'll talk to you later.

616
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,760
Gotta go.

617
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,360
I'm going to Yin Jie's dorm

618
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,600
for hotpot tonight.

619
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,260
I'll wait...

620
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,280
I'll wait for you to have breakfast.

621
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,040
Deal.

622
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,300
Then I'll take Ms. Chen and Mr. Hua out

623
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,500
for Chaoshan beef hotpot.

624
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,800
What'd you hit me for?

625
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,820
I didn't say a word.

626
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,820
Your face says it all.

627
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,760
Your turn.

628
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,760
Uncle's going too?

629
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,760
I'll go find him.

630
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,540
Mom,

631
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,800
I'd like to apply for something.

632
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,560
[Mom]
I want to go to the Sheng family banquet

633
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,120
with Uncle.

634
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,820
You didn't tell Lin
you're coming, did you?

635
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,360
Of course not.

636
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,160
Otherwise, how am I supposed

637
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,040
to give him a proper surprise?

638
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,480
You young folks.

639
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,720
Jiang.

640
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,380
Mr. Zheng, are you working

641
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,960
as the greeter today?

642
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,180
It's my boss's birthday bash, after all.

643
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,320
It's an honor for me

644
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,220
to play greeter.

645
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,640
Besides, with you showing up,

646
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,140
I've gotta make sure
you're well taken care of.

647
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,560
And who is this?

648
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,560
My niece, Nie Xiguang.

649
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,300
Xiguang,

650
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,020
this is Mr. Zheng.

651
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,140
Hello, Mr. Zheng.

652
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,640
Your niece?

653
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,620
Wait, so she's Mr. Nie's daughter?

654
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,400
I heard Mr. Nie couldn't make it today

655
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,140
because of some business.

656
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,360
So she came with you instead?

657
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,980
I'm not really sure

658
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,000
about Mr. Nie's schedule.

659
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,980
The main banquet hasn't started yet.

660
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,260
Please head over
to the pre-dinner cocktail party

661
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:16,900
for a drink.

662
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,600
- Alright.
- Okay.

663
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,180
After you, please.

664
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,240
The old sir isn't here yet.

665
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,560
But the Sheng brothers have all arrived.

666
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,080
You know them, right?

667
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,620
I've crossed paths
with Mr. Bokai before.

668
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,840
But I haven't met

669
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,840
the other two.

670
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,280
Look over there.

671
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,720
The one with the red tie
is Mr. Zhongkai.

672
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,120
Hua is waiting for me over there.

673
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,840
I'll head over.

674
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,540
Sure.

675
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,680
The one grinning by the bar

676
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,800
is Mr. Shukai.

677
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,860
Mr. Zheng,

678
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,180
I've been looking all over for you.

679
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:03,940
Mr. Wang,

680
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,020
good to see you.

681
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,080
You go ahead and do your thing.

682
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,200
Alright, I'll catch up with you later.

683
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,740
Okay.

684
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,140
So this is

685
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,760
Chengyuan's daughter.

686
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,520
It's my first time meeting you.

687
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,320
So pretty.

688
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,920
You should really get out
and network more.

689
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,200
She was focusing on her studies before,

690
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
and just started working.

691
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,740
Where did she go to school?

692
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,960
Somewhere overseas, I assume?

693
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,380
She got into a school

694
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,720
in China on her own.

695
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,300
Jiangning University.

696
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,420
That's a top-tier college.

697
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,060
And she got in on her own merits?

698
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,840
That's really impressive.

699
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,380
By the way, Xiguang,

700
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,240
how many days are you staying
in Shanghai?

701
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,640
My son just got back from his studies

702
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,440
in the UK.

703
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,640
I should have him show you

704
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,680
around Shanghai.

705
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,840
She's heading back tomorrow morning.

706
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,140
Let's pick this up later.

707
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:54,820
We should

708
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,120
go say hi to the hosts.

709
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,200
Alright then, I'll leave you to it.

710
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,020
Okay.

711
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,160
Her son

712
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,600
is a notorious playboy.

713
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,180
If you ever run into him,

714
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,200
keep your distance.

715
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,320
I don't know how she has the nerve

716
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,180
to bring up her son.

717
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,040
It's like she's trying to pawn him off
on someone else's daughter.

718
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,040
We need

719
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,420
to be extra careful

720
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,960
when doing business with her.

721
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,080
She's the type

722
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,180
to cut corners

723
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,240
and pass off subpar goods as premium.

724
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,480
This really shows her true colors.

725
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,580
Mr. Jiang,

726
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,840
welcome.

727
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:26,940
And this is?

728
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,360
I never knew you had a daughter.

729
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
This is my niece,

730
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,180
Xiguang.

731
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,020
Nice to meet you.

732
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,140
Chengyuan's daughter.

733
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,320
Nie is holding out on us.

734
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,320
He's met my son

735
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
plenty of times.

736
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,220
But he sure kept

737
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,440
his own daughter well-hidden.

738
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,260
Xiguang isn't much of a socialite.

739
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,040
Not many young people these days

740
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,960
can actually stay grounded.

741
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,020
My son, Xingjie,

742
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,100
is about your age,

743
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,220
and he's the quiet type too.

744
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,300
I'll introduce

745
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,000
you young folks later.

746
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,060
Chengrui has been doing quite well
these past few years.

747
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,060
Congratulations.

748
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,780
You're too kind.

749
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,120
Alright.

750
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,220
Come on.

751
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,440
How is he even later than me?

752
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,720
Is he stuck in traffic?

753
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,420
Mr. Lin.

754
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:32,940
Long time no see.

755
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,460
Long time no see.

756
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,360
I've got some guests
to attend to over there.

757
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,500
Of course.

758
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,200
Don't let us keep you.

759
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,060
Mr. Sheng.

760
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,020
Xiguang.

761
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,560
Uncle.

762
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,180
Lin Yusen.

763
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,040
Your aunt actually had a point.

764
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,220
Just look.

765
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,440
In this entire ballroom,

766
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,820
Lin is definitely the standout.

767
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,920
He's turning

768
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,620
a lot of heads.

769
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,060
Let's go talk to him.

770
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,080
No.

771
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,260
I haven't figured out

772
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,700
what my first words to him
should be yet.

773
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,120
Old Mr. Sheng is here.

774
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,400
[Sheng Xingxiu]
[Sheng Xingle]

775
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,240
Here is the old birthday star
of the hour!

776
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,740
Wait, we aren't allowed

777
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,200
to use the word "old" today.

778
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,240
My bad.

779
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
I deserve a penalty for that one.

780
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,900
Total slip of the tongue.

781
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,820
Old Mr. Sheng
has always kept a low profile.

782
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,580
He's really going all out this year.

783
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,820
Quite a few people

784
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,080
from your company showed up too, right?

785
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,900
All the top brass is here.

786
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,140
Looks like he's about to pass the torch.

787
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,660
Who's that young guy?

788
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,780
Sheng Xingjie.

789
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,080
Sheng Bokai's eldest son.

790
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,100
He's handing it straight
to his grandson?

791
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,760
This is my grandson, Xingjie.

792
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,060
I hope you'll

793
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,560
all look out for him.

794
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,440
He must be in his thirties
by now, right?

795
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,780
He's in his prime.

796
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,600
The world

797
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,219
belongs to the young now.

798
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,159
We were left
on a bit of a cliffhanger before,

799
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,280
but now the mystery is solved.

800
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:32,980
What mystery?

801
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,880
See the most handsome one over there?

802
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,960
The grandson on his daughter's side.

803
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,600
He's actually incredibly capable.

804
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,960
He used to be a doctor

805
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,199
before switching careers.

806
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,340
There was a project

807
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,199
that ran into major trouble.

808
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,480
He took over as soon as he joined

809
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,520
and actually managed to fix it.

810
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,420
He's been rising through the ranks fast.

811
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,500
The old man

812
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,080
used to keep both him

813
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,460
and Sheng Xingjie by his side
at events like this.

814
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,239
Everyone thought...

815
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,220
What's the deal

816
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,020
with the heir?

817
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,100
Just a bit of winner's pride, I guess.

818
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,340
It's a family business after all.

819
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,280
Since he's from the daughter's side,

820
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,000
he'll have to

821
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,180
get used to playing second fiddle.

822
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,800
If it weren't for that car accident,

823
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,460
he'd still be

824
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,940
a high-flying surgeon.

825
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,520
He wouldn't be standing here,

826
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,240
being the subject
of everyone's pity and gossip.

827
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,280
"Playing second fiddle"?

828
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,560
Does he even need to?

829
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,160
No matter what,

830
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,440
he shouldn't make someone look bad

831
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,280
at an event like this.

832
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,600
If this is

833
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,300
your future leader,

834
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,240
I'm underwhelmed.

835
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,120
Jiang,

836
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,140
keep your voice down, down!

837
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:06,720
Why

838
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,320
are you getting so worked up?

839
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,420
Uncle,

840
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,560
let's go to Lin Yusen.

841
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,720
Didn't you say you wanted
to surprise him?

842
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,400
It'll be no fun if I'm tagging along.

843
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,660
I'll stay here.

844
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,180
You go ahead.

845
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,600
Alright.

846
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,460
Lin Yusen.

847
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,220
Xiguang?

848
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,740
What are you doing here?

849
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,480
You're not the only one who can't wait.

850
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,340
Can't I be just as eager to see you?

851
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,300
So,

852
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,860
I came here to pick you up.

853
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,580
I bet

854
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,560
you followed

855
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,380
Uncle here,

856
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,360
didn't you?

857
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,660
I was just about to go say hi to him.

858
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,180
[Honey]

859
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,080
The photos are in.

860
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,520
Mission accomplished!

861
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,300
Can I get a bump in my allowance

862
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,440
for next month?

863
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,760
Take a few more.

864
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,620
I'll give you an extra 200 per photo.

865
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,840
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

866
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,040
We meet again.

867
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,580
Good.

868
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,260
Lin, you look even sharper

869
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,360
all dressed up.

870
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,840
So it turns out you guys

871
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,840
snatched up our Mr. Lin

872
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,760
a long time ago.

873
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,140
Why keep such great news

874
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,320
to yourself?

875
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,580
We are going to be much closer

876
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
from now on.

877
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,420
If I've said anything to offend you,

878
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,980
please don't take it to heart.

879
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,720
You two

880
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,340
just stole

881
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,920
half the spotlight today.

882
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:46,960
We'll

883
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,980
go give Lin's grandpa our best wishes.

884
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:49,700
Okay.

885
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:55,960
Grandpa,

886
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,860
this is Mr. Jiang
from Chengrui Construction.

887
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,620
I remember you, Mr. Jiang.

888
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,200
Long time no see.

889
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,000
Mr. Sheng,

890
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,020
it's been a while.

891
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:04,960
You're

892
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,500
as sharp as ever.

893
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,040
I'm well past my prime.

894
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,340
I wish you more and more youth.

895
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,120
May you lead the industry
for another 30 years.

896
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,000
Well,

897
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,440
that would make me an old monster,
wouldn't it?

898
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,100
And this is?

899
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,580
This is my girlfriend, Xiguang.

900
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,300
Don't tell me

901
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,620
she's your daughter?

902
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,600
I wish.

903
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,520
Unfortunately,

904
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,880
I'm not that lucky.

905
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,420
She's my niece.

906
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,300
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

907
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,000
I wish you a long

908
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,060
and prosperous life.

909
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,480
Thank you.

910
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,440
Ah, so it's the daughter of Nie

911
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,020
and Jiang.

912
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,200
It's coming back to me now.

913
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,320
We met in Wuxi two years ago.

914
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,160
That's right.

915
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,420
You've become quite the young lady.

916
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,140
Girls really do change
as they grow up, don't they?

917
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,240
Yusen is almost 30,

918
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,860
and has finally found a girlfriend.

919
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,600
Now

920
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,760
I can finally set my mind at ease.

921
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,360
Grandpa,

922
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,800
you make it sound like

923
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,940
I was such a hard sell.

924
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,420
Well, weren't you?

925
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,980
What a waste

926
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,580
of such a handsome face.

927
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,260
You should bring Xiguang

928
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,800
to see me more often.

929
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,320
We'll have a meal together.

930
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,220
Will do.

931
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,420
Good.

932
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:23,820
Yusen,

933
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,760
take good care of her.

934
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,060
Mr. Jiang,

can I take Xiguang outside

946
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,100
