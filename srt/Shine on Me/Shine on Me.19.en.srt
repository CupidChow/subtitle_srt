Lin Yusen always carries himself

13
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,680
with such ease and confidence.

14
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,820
I had no idea he went through

so much growing up.

16
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,060
He didn't even have
his mom there for him.

17
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,640
The Sheng family
was on a real tear back then.

18
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,120
But as things turned out,

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,700
those sons of Chairman Sheng

20
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,240

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,500
a coup broke out in that country.

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,440
He got hurt in the crossfire.

30
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,780
Without timely medical attention,

31
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,540

That old man is absolutely insufferable.

He milked his talents

he stayed behind
to take care of his dad's parents.

50

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,700
might as well set it off.

189
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,700
You're not allowed
to bring it on the plane

190
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,240
anyway.

191
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,360
[Jiang Rui]
Nie Xiguang, where on earth are you?

192
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,100
You didn't sneak out
to meet that guy, did you?

193
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,220
Mind your own business.

194
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,760
Hey,

195
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,540
I can sure care
about my fireworks, right?

196
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,960
I haven't settled the score with you

197
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,200
for lying to me earlier today.

198
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,560
Then you stole my fireworks,

199
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,560
and you headed out
without even bringing me along.

200
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,560
You're getting
more and more out of line.

201
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,540
No way.

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
Tell your boss

203
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,120
I'm calling him out.

204
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,160
What's wrong?

205
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,860
See for yourself.

206
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,820
[Jiang Rui]

207
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,340
Ask him what the challenge is.

208
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,080
Alright.

209
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,980
He wants to know what the challenge is.

210
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,640
I knew she ran off with that guy.

211
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,000
A pursuit race.
Tomorrow on the black runs.

212
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,620
Alright.

213
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,880
Challenge accepted.

214
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,820
She just lets him use her phone?

215
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,140
Such a pushover.

216
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,060
I'm heading back.

217
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,940
Wait.

218
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,820
I made this while waiting for you
this morning.

219
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,060
I was too embarrassed
to give it to you in front of everyone.

220
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,780
Oh, a skiing one today?

221
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,600
You're really good with your hands.

222
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,580
Maybe I just have a knack

223
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,420
for precision work.

224
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,900
So what kind of snowman
is it going to be tomorrow?

225
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,020
Tomorrow?

226
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,180
Haven't come up with a design yet.

227
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,560
I'll have to think about it.

228
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,900
Alright then.

229
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,000
Well,

230
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,620
see you tomorrow.

231
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,360
See you tomorrow.

Where did Jiang Rui and Xiguang go?

249
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,960
They're already out the door this early?

250
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,280
Hu had breakfast delivered.

251
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,180
I've warmed it up.

252
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,200
Come grab some before it gets cold.

253
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,420
They headed out bright and early.

254
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,920
Said he's off to compete with Lin.

255
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,020
I told them not to push too hard.

256
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,040
They've really hit it off quick,
haven't they?

257
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,180
Come on, you know your son.

258
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,400
He's always been Mr. Social.

259
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,760
I stayed up thinking it over last night.

260
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,240
And I'm a lot calmer now.

261
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,140
Lin's a great catch, no doubt,

262
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,780
but with relationships,

263
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,080
you just can't rush into them.

264
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,140
We gotta let Xiguang

265
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,600
spend more time with him first
and see how it goes.

266
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,800
That's exactly right.

267
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,480
When I was young,

268
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,680
I learned that lesson the hard way.

269
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,960
What's the plan for today?

270
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,080
Hu said

271
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:17,960
he'll take us

272
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,040
to check out downtown Yanji.

273
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,500
You go enjoy yourselves.

274
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,880
I'm not gonna tag along
as the third wheel.

275
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,440
I'll just poke around near the hotel.

276
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:26,860
Ms. Sheng

277
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,880
invited me for tea

278
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,900
in the snow hut this afternoon.

279
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,460
You're seriously racing

280
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,100
Lin Yusen?

281
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,280
Isn't this whole race thing

282
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,920
super cringey?

283
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,100
How so?

284
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,840
This is a total adrenaline rush.

285
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,960
Come on, Lin,

286
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,680
we doing this or what?

287
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,960
I even switched to snowboard for this.

288
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,700
What do you think?

289
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,820
Why go snowboard?

290
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,520
Skis have higher speed.

291
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,260
Jiang Rui's gonna be salty if he loses.

292
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,980
No pre-race smack talk.

293
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,180
This is interfering with the game.

294
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,340
My bad.

295
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,860
I thought it was part
of the adrenaline rush.

296
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,680
Alright.

297
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,740
You guys go get your adrenaline pumping.

298
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,400
I'll be chilling at the bottom.

299
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,720
We can all head up together.

300
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,339
There's a café at the top.

301
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,000
You wanna see the view from the summit?

302
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:25,920
Let's roll.

303
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,740
This is the mighty peak

304
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,340
we're gonna conquer!

305
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,580
Stand farther away.

306
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,200
Don't let anyone think

307
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,280
we're together with him.

308
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:45,860
Xiguang,

309
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,200
let's grab a seat
at the café over there.

310
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,120
Easy now.

311
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,740
Let's see

312
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,840
which run we're taking.

313
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,740
You're even more hyped

314
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,920
than Jiang Rui.

315
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,840
You really came prepared, huh?

316
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,940
Good thing I did my homework too.

317
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,540
I suggest

318
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,580
we take this one.

319
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,440
It's the longest,

320
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,360
so we can really let loose.

321
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,520
Sounds good.

322
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,680
I was checking it out

323
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,360
on the gondola just now.

324
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,980
Hardly anyone's on it,

325
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,460
so it's pretty safe.

326
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,660
I'll head down and snap a couple photos.

327
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,580
You two figure out

328
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,700
the rules for your race.

329
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,760
Bye-bye.

330
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,700
What do you feel like drinking?

331
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,640
I'll skip the coffee.

332
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,860
Grab me an electrolyte drink

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,640
for a quick recharge.

334
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,680
Same here.

335
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,160
Alright.

336
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,240
I'll take these.

337
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,980
When we hit this run in a bit,

338
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,160
make sure you slow down right here.

339
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,120
Pay attention.

340
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,600
There's a steep drop.

341
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,740
If you don't ease off,

342
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,480
it'll be dangerous.

343
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,120
Slow down? Nah.

344
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,540
I'll just blast right through it.

345
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,480
The view here is incredible.

346
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,000
Better start thinking
about how to get down.

347
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,940
You insisted on coming up with me.

348
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,420
Worst case,
I'll just take the gondola back.

349
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,460
It's a deal then.

350
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,340
Let's take this run.

351
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,060
First one down wins.

352
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,280
You're on.

353
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,420
But let's set some ground rules.

354
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,360
Safety first, competition second.

355
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,340
Just ski at your own pace.

356
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,560
Don't go blowing past your limit

357
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,760
just to win.

358
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,980
Of course.

359
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,780
My precious life

360
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,140
has only just begun.

361
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,200
I'm not looking for a trip
to Orthopedics.

362
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,900
But if you lose,

363
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,740
you have to stop chasing Xiguang.

364
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,420
A race is just a race.

365
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,940
It's got nothing to do with her.

366
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,080
Even if I lose,
I'm still going to pursue her.

367
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,700
But isn't the way you put it

368
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,800
a bit inappropriate?

369
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,000
What if she hears about this...?

370
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,400
Wait, that's not what I meant.

371
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,840
Don't make it into something it's not.

372
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,100
You're not going
to snitch on me, are you?

373
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,940
Are we good now

374
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,620
regarding the time

375
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,760
Xiguang and I

376
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,600
lied to you?

377
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,740
Fine.

378
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,700
Just act like

379
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,740
I never said a word.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,700
Otherwise,

381
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,260
she'll probably beat me to death

382
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,780
with her ski poles.

383
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,300
Is she really that violent?

384
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,440
Of course...

385
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,880
Of course not.

386
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,120
Xiguang is very reasonable.

387
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,420
That pattern

388
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,200
on your snowboard is so unique.

389
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,940
I've never seen anything like it.

390
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,180
It even looks like there's a signature.

391
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah.

392
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,380
My mom had it custom-made for me.

393
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,060
If you like it,

394
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,860
I can get one made for you too.

395
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,500
Don't try to bribe me.

396
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,660
Until you're officially

397
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,560
Xiguang's boyfriend,

398
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,940
I'm not accepting any gifts from you.

399
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,680
You're really sticking
to your guns, huh?

400
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,200
I'm not accepting it

401
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,240
because my resolve isn't that strong.

402
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,120
Come on, let's go.

403
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,560
Let's shred.

404
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,200
What does "chase" mean?

405
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,500
Didn't Zhuang Xu
say she has a boyfriend?

406
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,800
Could it be that they broke up,

407
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,580
and this guy's her new suitor?

408
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,120
See? What did I tell you?

409
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,840
He's not her boyfriend.

410
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Don't go blabbing

411
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,280
about it everywhere.

412
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,400
It's none of your business.

413
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,400
Of course I won't say anything.

414
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,700
I don't even know them.

415
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,480
Why would I care?

416
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,780
I'll count down three-two-one,

417
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,820
and you both start together.

418
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,340
Stay safe, guys.

419
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,260
Safety comes first.

420
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,920
The First Xiguang Cup Pursuit Race

421
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,580
at Changbai Mountain

422
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,260
is about to begin.

423
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,280
Both racers are in position.

424
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,220
Three...

425
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,760
Two...

426
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,760
One...

427
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,960
Go!

428
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,180
That was insane.

429
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,780
I wish I were that good.

430
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,580
Lin Yusen.

431
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,040
Who won?

432
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,880
It was super close.

433
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,280
I barely edged him out.

434
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:55,820
Alright.

435
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,020
There's still a bit of a gap, honestly.

436
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,340
But come on, I haven't skied at all

437
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,040
for three years of high school.

438
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,140
Give me some time, and we'll go again.

439
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,420
I'm ready whenever.

440
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,000
I just got

441
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,020
some clips of you two.

442
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,940
That was seriously awesome.

443
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:05,860
Check this out.

444
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,640
I've made up my mind.

445
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
I'm going to tackle the black runs too.

446
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,040
You should fully conquer

447
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,820
the green runs first,

448
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,880
then move on to the blue ones.

449
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,240
Don't try to bite off
more than you can chew

450
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,320
and end up having to walk down,

451
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,200
blocking everyone else on the slope.

452
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,880
Hey, talk nicely.

453
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,760
Xiguang, you actually hit me?

454
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,860
I was putting in a good word
for you, alright?

455
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,760
Why does it sound like

456
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,020
you were bad-mouthing me?

457
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,820
No way.

458
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,420
I just said you have

459
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,500
that nurturing yet firm vibe.

460
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,780
You'd better not have.

461
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,180
Besides, I never say

462
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,460
I am heading straight
to the black runs this time.

463
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,560
I'll take it step by step, obviously.

464
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,340
Fine.

465
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,420
I'm done talking to you two.

466
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,820
You go have fun on the black runs.

467
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,780
I'm grabbing my board

468
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,900
and heading
to the green runs to practice.

469
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,960
I'll go with you.

470
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,980
No, go enjoy your own runs.

471
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,500
You're not mad, are you?

472
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,200
Mad at you? As if.

473
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,440
You guys are black-run level.

474
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,580
Skiing greens with me

475
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,800
would be no fun at all for you.

476
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,140
That's why I said we should split up.

477
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,240
Yeah, it's true.

478
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,940
Too flat, and way too crowded.

479
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,680
Can't pick up any speed.

480
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,280
Then it's settled.

481
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,800
We'll just ride at our own pace

482
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,440
and meet up for lunch.

483
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,240
I'll go off on my own tomorrow.

484
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,920
But today, I'm sticking with you.

485
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,020
No.

486
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,340
I appreciate the thought,

487
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,760
but my training plan

488
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,500
can't get messed up.

489
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,180
What training plan?

490
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,420
This afternoon,

491
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,080
I'm taking you to the blue runs.

492
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,820
Well,

493
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:27,860
fine.

494
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,840
Cheesy.

495
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,180
What's up?

496
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,280
Hey,

497
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,600
what's with the secrecy?

498
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,080
You've gotta play it smart

499
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,200
with your dating this time, okay?

500
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,180
Can't be all straight-up like before.

501
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,960
Wait a sec.

502
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,120
We're not dating yet.

503
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,840
I know.

504
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm just saying, when dealing with guys,

505
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
you need tactics.

506
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,860
You've never even been
in a relationship,

507
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,840
and you're giving me advice?

508
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,840
Internet wisdom.

509
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,040
Plus tips from the dorm crew.

510
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,060
Anyway,

511
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,860
while you were riding the gondola,

512
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,740
I laid the groundwork for you.

513
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,820
Now I'm just reminding you.

514
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,440
Don't spill the beans.

515
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,140
What groundwork?

516
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,360
It's supposed to be super effective.

517
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,180
I told him,

518
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,880
"This is the first time

519
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,960
Xiguang has ever stayed out this late

520
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,720
with a guy."

521
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,220
And

522
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
"This is the first time Xiguang

523
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,020
has cared this much about a guy."

524
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:18,960
That's it.

525
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,400
What?

526
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,860
Jiang Rui,

527
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,420
this is also the first time

528
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,280
I've ever smacked you on the head.

529
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,880
Let's go.

530
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,760
Be safe, okay?

531
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,360
Hey, loosen up.

532
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,940
These blue runs aren't super steep.

533
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,440
I'm totally chill.

534
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,100
Should I have let

535
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,480
Jiang Rui win

536
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,280
this morning's race?

537
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,940
No way, of course not.

538
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm not really

539
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,500
that competitive about it.

540
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,740
When I pulled ahead of him,

541
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,540
I did think about it for a split second.

542
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,260
But then I remembered

543
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,820
you named this whole thing,

544
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,240
and I immediately dropped

545
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,280
the idea.

546
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,760
Xiguang Cup.

547
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,120
There's no way I'm giving it up.

548
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,720
This is the first time I've seen Yusen

549
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,580
care this much

550
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,460
about a girl.

551
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,200
You sound like

552
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,400
he's never been

553
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,920
in a relationship.

554
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,720
He has been

555
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,420
all about books and work
ever since he was a kid.

556
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,360
Always making plans for everything

557
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,300
except romance.

558
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,020
If I hadn't heard

559
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,000
that from you,

560
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,600
I never would've believed it.

561
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,940
I'm a bit surprised.

562
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Maybe

563
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,740
it's the family influence.

564
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,820
He's just gotten used to
his own company.

565
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,580
Lin's really outstanding,

566
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,180
and he has a great personality too.

567
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:07,780
Yes,

568
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,360
I can

569
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,660
absolutely vouch for him on that.

570
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,840
Maybe we should just

571
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,160
let them be

572
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,420
and stay out of their business.

573
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,700
That's the greatest vote of confidence

574
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,960
you could ever show him.

575
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,100
So you've been in Switzerland

576
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,560
this whole time?

577
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,720
I'm teaching at a university

578
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,000
there in Switzerland.

579
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,980
The guy you met yesterday

580
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,600
is my current husband, Luo.

581
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,220
We got married a few years ago.

582
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,900
That's good to hear.

583
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,480
We should always look ahead.

584
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,020
What about you?

585
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,780
You probably already know

586
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,220
I got divorced

587
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,580
from Xiguang's dad a few years back.

588
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,620
I heard of it.

589
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,660
I always thought

590
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,760
couples who built everything

591
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,040
from scratch together,

592
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,080
would be different somehow.

593
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,700
Never imagined...

594
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,620
Well,

595
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,580
we're different anyway.

596
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,240
I walked away with half his fortune.

597
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,920
Now that's the kind of talk
that warms the heart.

598
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,600
We should definitely drink to that.

599
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,760
Cheers.

600
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,180
What are you up to these days?

601
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,900
I kept some shares.

602
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,260
Ever since the divorce,

603
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,900
I stopped getting involved
in the day-to-day operations.

604
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,800
These days I'm just taking it easy,

605
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,220
doing some casual investing,

606
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,320
picking up a bit of spare change.

607
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,020
It's quite comfortable
being less hands-on.

608
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,660
That said,

609
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,160
I can't help feeling it's a loss.

610
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,700
Back then, I always thought

611
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,280
you had sharper business instincts

612
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
and more talent

613
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,620
than your ex-husband.

614
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,740
You're back, Mom.

615
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,740
Where are Uncle and Aunt?

616
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,120
I wasn't with them.

617
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,240
I had tea with Lin's mom

618
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,200
this afternoon.

619
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,080
We chatted for so long
that we ended up having dinner together.

620
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,100
You didn't say anything about me,
did you?

621
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,380
No. What, you think

622
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,040
we don't have
our own things to talk about?

623
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,340
We just reminisced about old times.

624
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,540
What were you acting out just now?

625
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,420
Just watching

626
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,000
some ski tutorials.

627
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,540
You know, practicing on the sly.

628
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,380
Did Jiang Rui rub off on you
or something?

629
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,280
You're more dedicated to skiing

630
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,920
than to anything else.

631
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,620
I'm dedicated at work too,

632
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,440
you know.

633
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
Lin Yusen

634
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,000
threw a bunch of stuff at me,

635
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,300
and I finished
everything "above and beyond."

636
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,580
Those were his exact words.

637
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,080
Okay, practice away.

638
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:49,880
I'm heading for a shower.

639
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,660
Don't leave yet.

640
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,560
I have a question about work

641
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,160
to run by you.

642
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,300
Take a seat.

643
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,440
Here's the thing.

644
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,740
My company

645
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,820
is expanding the plant.

646
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,400
And there's this piece of land

647
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,700
that we haven't decided
what to do with yet.

648
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,640
So I suggested turning it

649
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,660
into a PV garden.

650
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,320
After talking it over

651
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
with Engineering and Tech,

652
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
we're planning

653
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,840
to make the main structure

654
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,240
of the garden BIPV.

655
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,200
That way it's more energy-efficient,
looks better,

656
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,380
and serves as a great showcase.

657
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,460
But the technical challenges
are pretty big,

658
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,000
and the budget's way higher

659
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,960
than traditional methods.

660
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,900
Mom, you used to work

661
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,080
in construction engineering.

662
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,520
Do you have any tips

663
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,580
on how to cut costs

664
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,360
without lowering the standards?

665
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,080
Even though Lin Yusen said

666
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,460
he'll fully back me on this,

667
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,160
I still want

668
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,000
to save where I can.

669
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,260
You've really grown up.

670
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,800
Happy to see you're starting

671
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,700
to take things seriously.

672
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,720
You and Dad have the same habit.

673
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,660
The second I do something
I'm supposed to,

674
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,440
you shower me with praise.

675
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,860
I was talking about

676
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,780
how Dad used to be.

677
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,800
That's actually not good, you know?

678
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,780
I didn't end up spoiled

679
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,420
all thanks to my solid moral compass.

680
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
Aren't you pretty good

681
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,560
at praising yourself too?

682
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,360
The PV Garden

683
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,380
may seem straightforward,

684
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,080
but managing every moving part

685
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,100
from top to bottom

686
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,820
is no less demanding

687
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,900
than a large-scale project.

688
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,280
It's a great way to sharpen

689
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,940
your execution and delivery skills.

690
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,220
Yeah.

691
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,640
I was running
between departments so much

692
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,960
that I actually dropped a few pounds.

693
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,620
Couldn't really tell.

694
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,740
When it comes to solving funding issues,

695
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,120
it really boils down to this:

696
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,860
boosting revenue and cutting costs.

697
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,960
For boosting revenue,

698
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,440
you could consider

699
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,000
whether you could introduce

700
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,080
some commercial operations,

701
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,340
like

702
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,100
selling drinks

703
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,000
or light snacks,

704
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,340
and then lease that part out

705
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,440
in advance.

706
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,540
If your PV structure

707
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,720
represents advanced concepts

708
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,920
and has a demonstrative role,

709
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,160
you could also look

710
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,420
into policy angles

711
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,680
to see if there's any way

712
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,240
to apply for government subsidies.

713
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,400
As for cutting costs,

714
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,700
you'll need to tackle

715
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,340
every single link,

716
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,420
design,

717
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,300
material price comparisons,

718
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,680
labor efficiency control.

719
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,880
These are

720
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,600
all ways to manage expenses.

721
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,540
Of course,

722
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,960
that would make things
a bit tougher for you.

723
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,460
Financially,

724
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,320
you could work out

725
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,820
reasonable payment schedules

726
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,840
with construction partners

727
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,480
already trusted by Shuangyuan.

728
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,160
That could help, too.

729
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,260
I'm starting to get some ideas.

730
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,980
For the leasing,

731
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,100
I can ask

732
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,780
the cafeteria contractor at the company.

733
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,940
As for price comparisons,

734
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,180
that's my specialty.

735
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,540
The moment I joined,

736
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,740
Lin Yusen threw me

737
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,680
into a mountain

738
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,580
of sourcing and quoting.

739
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,300
As for construction,

740
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,140
I can consider

741
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,000
the contractor from Phase II.

742
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,580
Given our history
of successful cooperation,

743
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,060
they'll likely be more flexible
on payment.

744
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
The previous halt in construction

745
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,200
was actually quite sudden

746
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,220
for the contractor,

747
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,100
so the new project scope

748
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,120
could be positioned

749
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,680
as compensation for that downtime.

750
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,040
Got it.

751
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,100
I'll think it through.

752
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,420
As soon as I'm back, I'll get moving.

753
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,840
For a company,

754
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,620
technology

755
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,060
will always be
the primary productive force.

756
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,800
To embrace new technology

757
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,780
is always a step in the right direction.

758
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,240
The greatest danger
in running a business

759
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,300
is developing a fear

760
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,240
of technical challenges

761
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,580
and a reluctance to invest.

762
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,480
Companies that fail to innovate

763
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,980
will eventually be phased out.

764
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,840
I've had several meetings

765
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,000
with Tech,

766
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,460
and I think they're

767
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,540
actually pretty impressive.

768
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,800
Lin Yusen is very optimistic

769
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,500
about the PERC technology

770
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,600
they're developing.

771
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,280
It could probably go
into mass production

772
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,000
in the second half of this year or next.

773
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,020
There's one more thing,

774
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,260
also about the plant expansion.

775
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,800
I only found out
just before Chinese New Year

776
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,560
that Dad's company

777
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,139
had been delaying payments
to the contractor.

778
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,719
I was so embarrassed

779
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,860
when I learned about it.

780
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,300
Even though no one

781
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,500
knows who I am at the company.

782
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,280
I don't know

783
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,520
about that.

784
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,080
Maybe he's facing
a bit of a cash crunch.

785
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,380
Did Shengyuan pressure him?

786
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,580
I have no idea.

787
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,239
But since Lin Yusen took over,

788
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,020
he secured a large sum

789
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,179
through financing.

790
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,540
The capital pressure

791
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,300
might be manageable for now.

792
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,120
Actually,

793
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:01,940
back in 2001,

794
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,220
I tried

795
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,500
to persuade your dad

796
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,360
to buy into a local PV company

797
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,180
in Wuxi.

798
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,460
At the time, the government

799
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,640
was also lobbying us to invest.

800
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,840
Unfortunately,

801
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,220
your father wasn't convinced

802
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,020
and didn't agree.

803
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,200
I remember in that company meeting,

804
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,740
I suggested investing in PV,

805
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,760
but he wanted to invest
in something else.

806
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,160
It ended up

807
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,260
with us investing in neither.

808
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,900
Then how did Shuangyuan come to be?

809
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,820
That was in 2005,

810
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,320
when I brought it up again.

811
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,740
He was still hesitant at first,

812
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,380
but then,

813
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,040
the Sheng family got interested too.

814
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,620
When they reached out to him,

815
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,880
he jumped at the chance.

816
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,580
Sadly, by then we had already missed

817
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,400
the first explosive wave
of the PV industry.

818
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,020
How could he be like that?

819
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,140
He wouldn't agree when you suggested it.

820
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,720
Don't overthink it.

821
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,380
He had his own views,

822
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,760
and they definitely held
their own weight.

823
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,920
Later on,

824
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,100
maybe he just couldn't resist

825
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,640
after seeing that 2003 market rally.

826
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,800
Mom,

827
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,800
was that company from 2001

828
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,080
you mentioned

829
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,880
Wanyang Photovoltaic?

830
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,600
From what I can tell,

831
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,360
they aren't doing too well these days.

832
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,820
A few years back,

833
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,560
Wanyang bought back shares
for their IPO,

834
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,120
so the initial investors

835
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
walked away with massive payouts,

836
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,080
over ten times

837
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,000
their investment.

838
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,100
If we had jumped in back then,

839
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,300
we would've made a killing.

840
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
Wanyang

841
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,500
is definitely in hot water now.

842
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,800
The business world is a battlefield.

843
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,760
One wrong move

844
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,520
and it's game over.

845
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,700
The industry has its ups and downs,

846
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,620
and crises always come out of nowhere.

847
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,240
If

848
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,300
you're going to run a business someday,

849
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,920
there's a paradox

850
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,800
you must remember:

851
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,440
Business
is inherently about chasing profit,

852
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,360
yet

853
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,800
you must remain clear-headed

854
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,520
amidst all the fame and fortune.

855
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,020
Back then, I always thought

856
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,500
you had sharper business instincts

857
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,920
and more talent

858
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,700
than your ex-husband.

859
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,720
Chengyuan,

860
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,660
I believe this is

861
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,520
the best time

862
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,280
to enter the PV industry.

863
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,360
In contrast, Mr. Xu's project

864
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,640
carries too much risk.

865
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,840
We can't be this reckless.

866
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,720
Yun,

867
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,900
could you at least

868
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,940
show me some respect at the company?

869
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,420
That's exactly why

870
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,660
I'm telling you this in your office

871
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,120
rather than at the meeting.

872
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,940
The meeting just ended,

873
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,680
and you chased me
all the way to my office

874
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,560
with a scowl on your face.

875
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,580
Everyone can see

876
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,000
that you disagree with me.

877
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,280
If the decision changes later,

878
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,220
everyone will know

879
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,400
that you're the one calling the shots.

880
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,380
Isn't this how we've always done it?

881
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,760
We've always talked things through.

882
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,940
That was then.

883
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:44,980
Besides,

884
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,360
you call this a collaborative attitude?

885
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,940
You're forcing me to do it your way.

886
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,060
I'm certain my attitude
is collaborative.

887
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,380
It's the same attitude

888
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,600
you used to have no problem with.

889
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,320
I haven't changed.

890
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,640
It's your perception that has changed.

891
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,600
Yun,

892
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,060
I really don't want

893
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,020
all this work stuff

894
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,980
to come between us.

895
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,460
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

896
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,260
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

897
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,280
Okay, cheers.

898
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,180
They say

899
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,500
a good wife keeps
her husband out of trouble.

900
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,720
Nie,

901
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,020
you're truly blessed

902
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,220
to have such a supportive wife
like Jiang Yun.

903
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,680
I heard

904
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,620
she was the one who stopped you

905
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,300
from investing in Xu's project.

906
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,660
It's a good thing you passed on it.

907
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,600
Mr. Gai took the plunge,

908
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,220
and now he's

909
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,920
completely stuck.

910
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,760
His cash flow is at a breaking point.

911
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,520
I'm a lucky man.

912
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,800
Well, everyone in Wuxi

913
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,780
knows that.

914
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,180
That's true.

915
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,340
We always

916
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
talk things

917
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,760
through.

918
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,040
Come on.

919
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,580
Here.

920
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,700
- Let's have another toast.
- Cheers.

921
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,340
Come on.

922
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:11,940
Okay.

923
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,080
Thanks, Rui.

924
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,280
Good boy.

925
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,960
Thanks, Hu.

926
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,460
Today's family time is checked off.

927
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,160
I'm heading out to ski with Xiguang
this afternoon.

928
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,220
Just go by yourself.

929
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,160
Why do you keep dragging Xiguang along?

930
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:30,880
Hey,

931
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,220
she's the one who's hooked now,

932
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,700
okay?

933
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,820
She and Lin

934
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,500
are meeting

935
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,680
at the ski center at 1 PM.

936
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,060
Just ask her yourself.

937
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,100
Where is she?

938
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,920
Nie Xiguang.

939
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:47,900
Nie Xiguang!

940
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,520
Coming.

941
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,660
Don't run off, Jiang Rui!

942
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,220
Hey.

943
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,540
The snow is blowing

944
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,220
right into my face.

945
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,160
So, let's stick to the plan
from yesterday:

946
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,400
we each do our own thing today.

947
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:12,800
Works for me.

948
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,780
It's almost 1 PM now.

949
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,860
What time should we regroup?

950
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,140
5:30 PM.

951
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,600
That's nearly five hours.

952
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,620
Can your legs even handle that?

953
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,300
Who do you think you're talking to?

954
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,300
Besides, we're leaving
the day after tomorrow.

955
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,460
We should make the most of it
while we can.

956
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,820
Lin,

957
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,820
are you leaving tomorrow afternoon?

958
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,620
Yeah, I'm flying to Beijing
tomorrow night.

959
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,740
My mom and Mr. Luo

960
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,580
are heading back to Switzerland
the day after.

961
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,240
She's heading back

962
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,360
to Switzerland already?

963
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,660
Yeah, they've got work to get back to.

964
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,140
5 30 PM it is, then.

965
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,160
Should we take a break

966
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,880
together in between?

967
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,880
Definitely not.

968
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,000
Our bathroom breaks

969
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,820
are never going to line up anyway.

970
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,100
It's a deal, then.

971
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,100
Tonight,

972
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,500
the snow hut hotpot is on me.

973
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,300
Deal.

974
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,340
Let's go.

975
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,920
Let's...

976
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,220
go!

977
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,400
Kevin, you got this?

978
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,120
[Descente Challenge Run]
Or you wanna just take the gondola?

979
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,660
Please.

980
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,360
Never ask a man if he can handle it,

981
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,760
okay?

982
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,200
Look,

983
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,000
it's the last day.

984
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,300
I've gotta push myself a little.

985
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,560
Besides,

986
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,460
if I can't make it,

987
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,240
I'll just ski half and hike half,

988
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,760
alright?

989
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,760
Zhuang, you're sticking with me.

990
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,700
And here I thought he was gonna

991
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,800
give some grand manifesto.

992
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,580
Whatever, I'm leaving you to it.

993
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,100
Min,

994
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,800
let's go.

995
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,220
Bye.

996
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,380
See ya!

997
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,180
Zhuang,

998
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,780
you better slow down.

999
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,360
We're the only two newbies

1000
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,140
left to look out for each other.

1001
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,760
Don't worry,

1002
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,420
risk management is my second nature.

1003
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:01,600
Zhuang,

1004
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,220
I think I see that guy who's chasing

1005
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,840
your student's cousin.

1006
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,440
He looks so slick out there.

1007
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,960
Seems like a total pro.

1008
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,920
Chasing who?

1009
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,120
