194
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,140
are just basic add-ons.

195
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,640
It's

196
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,500
not quite BIPV.

197
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,820
Then what's the total area

198
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,120
of the panels?

199
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,260
A bit over 200 square meters.

200
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,140
Two hundred.

201
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,840
So the power output
is around 30 kilowatts,

202
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,220
meaning 30 kilowatt-hours per hour?

203
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:27,980
Right.

204
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,540
At least when the sunlight is strong.

205
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,580
And how do you handle it

206
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,500
when there's not enough sunlight?

207
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,220
It's equipped
with a ground-source heat pump,

208
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,159
so we can run an energy storage cycle

209
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,140
and store the excess electricity

210
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,840
for later use.

211
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,320
A GSHP energy storage system?

212
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,960
Could you tell me more about that?

213
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,039
Certainly.

214
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,159
Hold on,

215
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,180
let me jot this down.

216
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,140
I also wanted to ask

217
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,220
about the costs.

218
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,600
Mr. Wei?

219
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,460
Our system is quite complex.

220
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,200
As for the costs,

221
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,400
I'll have to check with Finance.

222
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,080
Why don't you leave your contact info,

223
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,200
and I'll send the materials

224
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,760
to you?

225
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,240
Sure.

226
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,980
Are you on WeChat?

227
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,720
Let's add each other.

228
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,680
The garden is gorgeous.

229
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,640
Mind if I grab a few shots?

230
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,300
Not at all. Go right ahead.

231
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,820
I'm on WeChat.

232
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,740
Let me scan you.

233
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,740
Perfect.

234
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,000
Alright.

235
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,640
I'll get everything together

236
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,080
and send it over.

237
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,680
Thanks. Got it, you're added.

238
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,360
Alright.

239
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,260
Wait, isn't he your boss?

240
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,900
You're making your boss carry your bag?

241
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,040
Is that really okay?

242
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,760
Well, in our company,

243
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,320
it's all about project ownership.

244
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,060
And since I'm the lead on this one,

245
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,500
Mr. Lin is basically just my assistant
for now.

246
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,200
No big deal.

247
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,960
He is modest to a fault.

248
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,300
You have a great culture there.

249
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,920
Now I see why your boss

250
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,720
went with such a quirky phone case.

251
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,080
Thank you for your time.

252
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,500
We'll get going then.

253
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,600
Thanks.

254
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,120
Don't mention it.

255
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:29,840
Okay.

256
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,540
Mr. Wei,

257
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,200
you engineers

258
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,360
are so tunnel-visioned.

259
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,520
You really didn't catch that?

260
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,760
Catch what?

261
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:50,740
I mean,

262
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,940
he was carrying her bag.

263
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,320
But on second thought,
I guess it's normal.

264
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,680
Mr. Wu

265
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,860
did the same for me once.

266
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,060
No need to make a fuss.

267
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,060
Let's leave it at that.

268
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,900
I'm off the clock.

269
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,460
You could've just asked

270
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,620
our tech team

271
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,180
about the energy storage stuff.

272
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,680
True.

273
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,400
But there's

274
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,280
a slight difference here.

275
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,220
What is it?

276
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,920
I was discussing the garden design

277
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,500
with the tech team the other day.

278
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,240
They asked so many questions,

279
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,260
I felt like

280
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,320
such a

281
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,720
clueless amateur.

282
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,160
So I thought

283
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,820
I'd do some learning.

284
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,180
By asking an outsider,

285
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,200
I won't have to look so clueless

286
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,300
to the rest of the office.

287
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,920
Once I get back,

288
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,840
I'm actually gonna pick up

289
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,820
some books on photovoltaics

290
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,840
and just nerd out in my dorm room.

291
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,140
Fair point.

292
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,580
Save your money.

293
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,400
I'll let you have mine.

294
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,280
You've got them?

295
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,220
You bet.

296
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,800
Remember,

297
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,550
I started out

298
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,560
as a Deputy GM who didn't know jack.

299
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,420
I spent my nights grinding in secret

300
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,440
just to look like

301
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,960
I knew what I was doing.

302
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,340
Changing lanes is an uphill battle

303
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,780
every step of the way.

304
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,120
Just because

305
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,240
you were struggling

306
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,020
doesn't mean you have to

307
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,980
drag me down with you.

308
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,860
That's so cynical.

309
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,940
We're growing together, okay?

310
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,960
Gee, I'm touched.

311
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,360
No worries.

312
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,380
Okay.

313
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,120
Now that the work is done,

314
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,300
what should we do now?

315
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:29,980
Let's get back to the questions
from this morning.

316
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,120
The Dafo Temple?

317
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,300
Canton Tower?

318
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,240
Chimelong?

319
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,700
Or let't just hit everything

320
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,660
on the must-eat list?

321
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,920
I'll go with D.

322
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,980
Let's dig in.

323
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:44,920
How is it?

324
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:45,980

Thanks.

00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,020
You seem to be judging

345
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,860
my phone case.

346
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,420
This was my childhood idol.

347
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,000
I am not.

348
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,080
But,

349
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,420
your idol is a monkey?

350
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,060
It's the Monkey King.

351
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,020
He's just drawn it a bit rounder

352
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,900
and with bigger eyes.

353
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,380
But look,

354
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,280
here behind his ear

355
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,200
is the Golden Cudgel.

356
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,940
That identifies him.

357
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,340
I see it now.

358
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,680
I thought it was a monkey

359
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,840
from Mount Emei

360
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,280
that had snatched a cigarette
from a tourist.

361
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,860
My apologies, Monkey King.

362
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,280
I failed to recognize your greatness.

363
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,440
Wait.

364
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,280
It's the drawing

365
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,400
on this phone case.

366
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,600
Why did they make him

367
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,260
look so round, squishy,

368
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,540
and so fluffy?

369
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,500
Seriously, every animal on the cases

370
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,640
you buy, has zero neck.

371
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,620
I...

372
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,600
Let's drop it.

373
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,600
I can't believe

374
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,140
the Monkey King is your idol.

375
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,440
In the "Deity" category.

376
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,340
Wait, you categorize them by realms?

377
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,660
Of course.

378
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,820
I had way too many idols growing up.

379
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,340
I had to categorize them
just to keep the rankings straight.

380
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,520
I used to list my idols on the wall,

381
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,720
ranking them

382
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,400
by brains and brawn.

00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,000
I had no idea you were

384
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,460
such a little troublemaker back then.

385
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,740
I bet you were a real headache
for your parents.

386
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,780
It wasn't that bad.

387
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,320
What about you?

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,000

389
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,760
I was a golden child.

390
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,400
I just had my moments

391

of being a little rascal.

Let's hear more about these "moments."

393
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,860
I rolled around in the mud

394
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,120
and I once defeated a giant goose
with a stick.

395
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,920
Wait,

396
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,820

00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,220

it might not "work."

So the plan is just to keep me eating

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,020
Rimang Energy

573
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,760
now faces an extreme risk of default.

574
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,760
We were nearly the ones

575
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,260
in that news.

576
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,000
This lesson taught us

577
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,900
one thing.

578
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,060
The grass isn't always greener

579
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,620
on the other side.

580
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,880
As it happens,

581
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,500
the "Western integrity"

582
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,240
so lauded by the international media

583
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,740
for years

584
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,800
has fallen far short

585
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,860
of the hype.

586
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,680
Moving forward,

587
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,760
we must be extra cautious

588
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,160
with risk control,

589
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,520
especially when overseas entities

590
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,840
are involved.

591
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,860
We were

592
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,140
far too optimistic in our evaluation

593
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,060
of this project.

594
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,180
Fortunately, Zhuang warned us in time,

595
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,140
or the consequences
would have been unthinkable.

596
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,200
A meltdown of this scale

597
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,080
is not something we could have recovered

598
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,720
from with just a few internal reviews.

599
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,580
Zhuang,

600
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,100
you deserve the top credit

601
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,240
for our narrow escape

602
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,800
this time.

603
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,640
Thank you for the recognition, Mr. Song.

604
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,080
This was a joint effort

605
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,820
between Investment Banking

606
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,140
and Risk Management.

607
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,800
Shake it off.

608
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,480
Who could've guessed a giant like that

609
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,200
would sink so low

610
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,100
as to forge guarantee documents?

611
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,200
It's an extreme case.

612
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,000
Exactly. Stop beating yourself up.

613
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,280
Even the old pros

614
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,100
got blindsided by this.

615
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,520
Besides,
Mr. Song isn't pinning this on us.

616
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,420
Stop making excuses for me.

617
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,140
I own my actions.

618
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,520
I messed up, and I'm not hiding from it.

619
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,500
Zhuang,

620
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,600
do you feel

621
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,620
that this industry

622
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,020
no longer offers broad-based growth,

623
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,300
but only structural opportunities?

624
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,420
I've noticed

625
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,460
the top-tier firms

626
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,200
have indeed started

627
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,040
preparing for early exits.

628
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,800
Zhuang Xu.

629
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,620
I'm here to apologize.

630
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,580
I was indeed reckless

631
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,900
regarding that Rimang Energy project.

632
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,320
I've read the research report

633
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,000
you led.

634
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,360
Your positive take

635
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,500
wasn't off base.

636
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,560
Besides,

637
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,840
I'm your colleague.

638
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,020
We're

639
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,060
on the same team here at Huaya.

640
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,660
You don't need to apologize to me.

641
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,640
The main thing is,

642
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,980
I make mistakes too.

643
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,440
Aside from the boss,

644
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,060
I don't want

645
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,040
to have to apologize to everyone here

646
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,260
If you don't need my apology,

647
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,460
let me thank you instead.

648
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,740
Thank you

649
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,120
for sparing me
from endless self-reflection meetings.

650
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
I don't think that's necessary either,

651
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,600
but alright.

652
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,920
I accept that.

653
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,940
In that case,

654
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,180
if you guys are free after work,

655
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,100
dinner is on me.

656
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,020
Let's celebrate

657
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,920
our narrow escape.

658
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,540
Great.

659
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,920
Kevin and Justin
are definitely wide open.

660
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,260
Zhuang, don't work late tonight.

661
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,420
Let's grab a drink and a bite,

662
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,320
and just catch up.

663
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,300
Free drinks?

664
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,860
Of course, I'm in.

665
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,300
Come to think of it,

666
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,480
I believe this is the first time

667
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,760
our little squad has grabbed dinner
off the clock.

668
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,120
Come on.

669
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,040
Let's raise a glass
to our very first team bonding.

670
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,180
Cheers!

671
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,280
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

672
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,560
Alright, next,

673
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,680
let's all raise a glass to Zhuang.

674
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,260
Seriously, Zhuang,

675
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,380
if it weren't for you,

676
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,560
our year-end bonuses

677
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,600
would've been history.

678
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,040
Bonuses? Please.

679
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,220
The whole department

680
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,920
would've been axed and reshuffled.

681
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,840
We definitely owe Zhuang a drink.

682
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,560
You guys are laying it on a bit thick.

683
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,940
Besides, Mr. Song was the one

684
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,720
who made the final call.

685
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,520
Yeah, but he's not around right now.

686
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,460
Exactly.

687
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,740
We're off the clock.

688
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,600
No boss talk.

689
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,480
Whatever the case,

690
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,160
thank you, Zhuang.

691
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,060
Come on.

692
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,080
Seriously,

693
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,600
a restructure is out of the question.

694
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,420
I mean, we've got the hottest girl

695
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,720
and the most eligible guy

696
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,440
in the entire Shanghai finance scene

697
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,520
right here in this group.

698
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,580
Well, the "most eligible guy"

699
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,600
is obviously me.

700
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,380
But wait.

701
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,100
Who's the "hottest girl" then?

702
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,780
Kevin,

703
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,060
explain yourself.

704
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,680
Forget it.

705
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,380
I'll just take a shot,

706
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,580
okay?

707
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,880
Oh, give me a break.

708
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,080
You're just looking for any excuse
to knock one back.

709
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,780
Seriously, Kevin,

710
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,180
are you moonlighting

711
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,360
as a liquor promoter here?

712
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,260
Sure looks like it.

713
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,660
You on a quota tonight?

714
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,240
I think I had you all wrong.

715
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,800
I never knew you were so funny.

716
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,660
I feel like

717
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,980
we only truly got to

718
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,740
know each other today.

719
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,360
Is that so?

720
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,020
Glad to meet you, Chris.

721
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,280
Justin just crowned himself
the most eligible.

722
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,500
He's gotta have a drink, right?

723
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,060
Exactly.

724
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,300
What a narcissist.

725
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,200
Make it two shots.

726
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,220
Fine.

727
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,340
Hello?

728
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,480
Not yet.

729
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,580
Probably around 10 PM.

730
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,340
You go to bed first.

731
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,600
Oh my goodness.

732
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,840
This is huge.

733
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:04,940
Is Huaya's number one heartthrob

734
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,780
off the market?

735
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,420
Yeah.

736
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,420
So gentle

737
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,620
and checking in like that.

738
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,760
What nonsense?

739
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,720
It was my brother.

740
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,440
He's visiting from Nanjing

741
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,600
for his winter vacation.

742
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,900
Poetry?

743
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,300
Does Xu actually read this stuff?

744
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:57,820
Xu,

745
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,660
you're back.

746
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,780
You reek of alcohol.

747
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,500
How much did you drink?

748
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,420
I'm not drunk.

749
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,560
You should really cut back
on the drinking.

750
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,560
There's no getting out of these things.

751
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,700
I'll go get you some warm water.

752
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,440
Good thing I'm here.

753
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,220
Otherwise,

754
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,320
if you got this drunk,

755
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,020
would you have just spent the night
on the couch?

756
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,920
Have some water.

757
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,800
Then go freshen up and get some sleep.

758
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,280
Zhuang Fei.

759
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,800
Tell me.

760
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,800
Back then,

761
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,120
if she had come to Shanghai with me,

762
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,660

about me drinking too much

Would she have urged me
to come home earlier?

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,700
Would she have called me like you did,

767
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,160
asking what I'm up to,

768
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,460
and when I'll be back?

775
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,520
here are two sets of documents
for you to review.

776
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,120
You finished

777
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,420
two completely different plans already?

778
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,040
They're just

779
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,560
rough drafts.

780
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,040
I need you

781
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,480
to confirm the overall direction.

782
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,060
But all the departments

783
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,639
were really fast and helpful.

784
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,940
I should really give you
the credit for that.

785
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,080

The night I got back here,

789
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,199
I invited some girls from the office

790
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,820
who live on-site

791
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,639

with everything.

a lot from them.

And when Mr. Hua from Tech

798
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,719
heard about

799
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,400

For aesthetics and efficiency,

807
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,060
BIPV

808
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,920
is the clear winner.

809
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,940
It's a new building concept.

810
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,900
I find it really interesting.

811
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,400
Plus, Engineering

812
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,160

look into

BIPV before.

Shuangyuan

818
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,720
has a huge edge,

819
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,840
being backed by developers

820
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,320
like Shengyuan and Yuancheng.

00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,480
But it was

822
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,140
sidelined recently

823
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,120
due to overseas sanctions.

on the future

826
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,380

827
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,960
I believe

828
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,280
it will see

829
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,800
widespread adoption

830
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,320
in public and commercial buildings.

831
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,720
Since the government is promoting

832
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,900
energy conservation
and emission reduction,

833
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,400
it's clearly the inevitable trend.

834
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,820
Then why the hesitation?

835
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,440
I'm hesitating over the budget.

836
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,360
Even though BIPV

837
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,900
is technically challenging,

838
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,920
Mr. Hua is already itching

839
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,040
to get started and says

840

841
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,400
But the budget

842
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,600
still makes me hesitant.

843
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,920
After all, the industry
is in a downturn.

844
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,880
Is it really necessary

00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,280
to build a garden like this

846
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,160
and eat into our cash flow,

847
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,820
especially right now?

848
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,240
Good points.

849
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,400
But honestly,
the frontline working conditions

850
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,820
are long overdue for an improvement.

851
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,780
Plus, with integrated tech,

852
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,280
this garden

853
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,660
becomes

854
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,700
a vital demo site.

855
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,300
It'll give clients a hands-on feel

856
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,540
for what we do.

857
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,340
That should help us

858
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,260
land more contracts.

859
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,580
Right.

860
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,840

Anyway,

862
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,580
just go for it.

Phase II of the plant

881
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,920
is a resumption of construction
after a long halt.

882
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,680
With the gap in between,

883
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,140
some staff turnover

884
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,660
and coordination gaps

885
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,880
were bound to happen.

886
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,420
But these are small hiccups.

887
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,560

888
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,900
and cleared

889
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,460
most of the hurdles already.

Barring any surprises,

891
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,220
the work should wrap up by late March.

892
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,740
We'll need Administration's support

893
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,300
for the final inspections.

894

is made on time.

However,

for the Phase II plant construction

912

924
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,880
still hasn't hit our account.

in their replies,

no actual follow-through.

by next month,

933

934
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,740
join Shengyuan in issuing

I have some great news.

955
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,120
We'll see each other
in just a few days anyway.

956
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,120
I was just saying.

957
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,040
It's not like
I'm actually going to Suzhou.

958
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,300
Right, speaking of Changbai Mountain,

959
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,620
the parents had already agreed

960
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,460
to go skiing abroad,

961
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,440
so why did you suddenly change it

962
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,120
to Changbai Mountain?

963
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,140
What's wrong with Changbai Mountain?

964
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,060
Don't just assume
everything abroad is better.

965
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,220
It's the largest natural ski resort

966
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,740
in Asia,

967
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,640
and the food there is amazing.

968
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,940
You'd never find
anything tasty overseas.

969
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,640
Why are you being so cranky?

970
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,480
Are you in a bad mood or something?

971
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,560
You can actually tell?

972
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:52,840
Of course I can.

973
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,380
It's not

974
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,620
that Deputy GM from the Sheng family

975
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,460
giving you a hard time again, is it?

976
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:00,920
No,

977
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,420
it's not him.

978
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,760
He was actually comforting me.

979
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,360
About what?

980
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,740
My company

981
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,700
is expanding the Phase II plant, right?

982
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,140
Well, I only found out today
after a meeting

983
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,800
with Engineering and Finance,

984
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,680
that my dad has been behind

985
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,260
on the expansion payments
this whole time.

986
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,060
If he doesn't pay up soon,

987
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,340
the company is going to issue
a formal notice.

988
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,680
Wait, really?

989
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,060
Yeah.

990
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,720
When I found out,

991
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,860
I was

992
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,820
so mortified.

993
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,500
Maybe your dad is having

994
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,600
some liquidity issues.

995
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,460
But still,

996
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,520
it's a corporate matter.

997
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,400
Why take it so personally?

998
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,580
Business is business.

999
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,800
At worst, he can just offset
the debt with equity.

1000
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,280
No unpaid wages,

1001
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,020
no need to feel awkward.

1002
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,260
Fine.

1003
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,780
You do have a point.

1004
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,960
That's what Lin Yusen said, too.

1005
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,600
Sounds like you and Mr. Lin

1006
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,440
are getting closer and closer.

1007
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,280
For sure.

1008
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,860

1010
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,720
are finally working on him.

1011

Alright, I'm hanging up.

1012
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,800
I can't take this anymore, Xiguang.

1013
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:19,900
I'll hang up first.

1014
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,440
Bye.

1015
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:23,940
See you on Chinese New Year's Eve.

1016

Bye.

1017

[Group for Class 5, Grade 12]
Everyone cool with that?

1018
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,740
Then the 5th day
of Chinese New Year it is.

1019
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,160
Wait,

1020
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,180
what'd I miss?

1021
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,460
Everyone's back in Nanjing
for the break anyway,

1022
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,940
so we're hitting up a class reunion.

1023
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,560
I can't make the 5th.

1024
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,920
Why?

1025
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,140
I'm hitting Changbai Mountain
on the Spring Festival.

1026
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:48,760
By the 5th,

1027
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,960
I'll still be shredding the slopes.

1028
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,680
Why not before Chinese New Year?

1029
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,620
Some are still interning,

1030
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,780
and some haven't made it back yet.

1031
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,400
We won't have a full house
until after the festival.

1032
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,760
Bummer.

1033
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,160
Guess I'm missing out.

1034
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,060
Changbai Mountain?

1035
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,140
I was there two years ago.

1036
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,300
You've gotta stay

1037
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:04,840

1040
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,300
No way.

1041
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,620
That's exactly

1042
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,100

I learned it the hard way.

Remember

1048
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,740
when I was limping around

1049
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,620
for quite a while?

1050
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,520
Yeah,

1051
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,960
so that was from skiing.

1052
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,420
