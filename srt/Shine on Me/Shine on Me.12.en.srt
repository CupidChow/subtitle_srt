74
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,820

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,140
nothing ever happened,

78
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,340

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,920
I still owe her an answer.

80
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,440

189
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,880
We'll be off, then.

190
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,260
Drive safe.

191
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,800
Bye.

192
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,660
- Bye.
- Bye.

193
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,900
See ya.

194
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,080
Xiguang,

195
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,780
are you guys leaving so soon too?

196
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:25,820
No way.

197
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,620
Did you really change

198
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,580
into another outfit?

199
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,080
This looks gorgeous on you too.

200
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,080
You're totally outshining

201
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,620
my bridal wardrobe

202
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,480
with all these changes.

203
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,620
That's just because

204
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,800
she accidentally got her dress stained.

205
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,480
The snow is going
to get a lot worse later.

206
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,780
Traffic will be a nightmare,

207
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,380
so we've decided to head out now.

208
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,720
But how are you guys getting back?

209
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,340
Xiguang,

210
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,840
he was drinking.

211
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,600
No way he's driving, right?

212
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,180
We'll grab a cab.

213
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,820
I'll have someone pick up the car later.

214
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,040
Okay. Safety first.

215
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,380
Thanks for coming,

216
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,480
you guys.

217
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,680
I'll let you get going.

218
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,880
Go, do your thing.

219
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,960
Let's catch up soon.

220
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,680
See you.

221
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,400
Take good care of her, okay?

222
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,280
Apparently, my confession

223
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,200
just knocks people speechless.

224
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,060
Sorry.

225
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,040
Nie Xiguang,

226
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,060
it shouldn't be like this

227
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,400
if you're turning me down.

228
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,460
You should be holding your head high
and saying,

229
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,800
"Lin Yusen,

230
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,599
I'm not exactly falling for you.

231
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,640
You haven't made the cut."

232
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,400
Instead of acting like this,

233
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,540
as if you owe me

234
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,700
something.

235
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,520
That's not it.

236
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,040
It's not that you didn't make the cut.

237
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,200
It's just...

238
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,800
I haven't

239
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,280
quite moved on

240
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,480
from someone I used to care for.

241
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,300
You saw it

242
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,060
back there.

243
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,760
If you're going to be with someone,

244
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,300
you need to be all in.

245
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,740
And right now,

246
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,800
I'm just not there.

247
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,040
Actually,

248
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,660
back at the hotel,

249
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,720
I lied.

250
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,540
I said

251
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,760
I'd be an idiot

252
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,940
not to seize the moment.

253
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,340
But in fact,

254
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,340
confessing to you then

255
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,260
is where the real stupidity
would have been.

256
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,880
It would've made a mockery

257
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,920
of the whole "annual plan"
I stayed up all night

258
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,720
mapping out.

259
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,300
But

260
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,720
it turns out

261
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
these things

262
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,640
don't follow a script.

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,400
It's a first for me.

264
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,200
Quite the experience, actually.

265
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,420
I knew you'd turn me down,

266
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,160
but

267
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,780
so soon?

268
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,840
Now what?

269
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,000
My pride

270
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,880
is taking a bit of a hit.

271
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,260
Anyway, it was expected.

272
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,600
It's like being handed

273
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,400
a death sentence with a tumor,

274
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,820
only to be told

275
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
it's benign.

276
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,220
Alright.

277
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,440
I guess we'll just have to
play the long game.

278
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,260
Let's leave it at that for now.

279
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,240
We'll pick this up back in Suzhou.

280
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,180
A

281
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,120
tumor?

282
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,180
That was

283
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,020
a clumsy metaphor.

284
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,660
I'm not going back to Suzhou.

285
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,560
I'm

286
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,620
heading to Wuxi.

287
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,880
I still have

288
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
a day and a half of leave, anyway.

289
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,340
And I haven't seen

290
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,420
my mom in ages.

291
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,940
Besides, I've been really craving her...

292
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,140
You don't need a reason to go home.

293
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,280
Alright then.

294
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,200
Let me at least drop you

295
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:17,940
at the station.

296
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,620
No, it's fine.

297
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,240
I'll just

298
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
grab a cab.

299
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,140
Nie Xiguang,

300
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,600
are you going

301
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,040
to avoid me forever now?

302
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,780
No.

303
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,040
It feels wrong

304
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,300
to let you help me,

305
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,680
knowing I can't give you what you want.

306
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,320
Well,

307
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,420
I'm not exactly an expert at this.

308
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,460
But isn't this just

309
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,140
how

310
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,180
the whole "pursuit" thing works?

311
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,780
So,

312
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,140
not only are you turning me down,

313
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,480
you're telling me
I'm not even allowed to try?

314
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,320
What if I'm never going

315
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,020
to...?

316
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,180
I don't want

317
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,420
to string you along like that.

318
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,660
Nie Xiguang.

319
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,920
It's one thing to have
no confidence in yourself,

320
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,660
but why do you have
so little faith in me?

321
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,460
Didn't you say

322
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,240
I was great at everything I do?

323
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,600
You're the kind of girl

324
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,980
who can't even

325
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,100
bring herself to say

326
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,900
a flat-out "Never to accept me".

327
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,920
With a heart as soft as yours,

328
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,520
how much of a failure would I be

329
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,800
if I couldn't win you over?

330
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,240
Too scared to let me give you a ride?

331
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,680
I'm just courting you.

332
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,380
This isn't some business deal.

333
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,320
I'm not looking for an ROI.

334
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,200
Why do you feel like

335
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,820
you owe me

336
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,420
just for saying no?

337
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,800
I want this

338
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,500
to be something good for you,

339
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,160
not a weight on your shoulders.

340
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,960
You say...

341
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,040
you still have feelings for him.

342
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,420
That's fine.

343
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,100
Take your pick.

344
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,260
♪Will we ever be close, you and me?♪

345
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,280
♪Oh, wherever you are,
whatever you want♪

346
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,740
♪Don't hesitate to call me,
just let me know♪

347
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,940
♪I hope you'll never forget♪

348
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,980
♪My heart has only you♪

349
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,380
♪Every moment of every day♪

350
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,020
♪Our love's gonna find a way♪

351
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,680
I'm completely worn out today.

352
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,660
Let's just grab a cab.

353
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,740
I'll give you a lift.

354
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,180
I'm heading that way anyway.

355
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,680
No, it's okay.

356
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,140
I've still got some work to finish up.

357
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,180
And the subway is a straight shot.

358
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,860
See you around.

359
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,620
Zhuang Xu, stop right there.

360
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,100
There's something

361
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,320
I've been wanting to say
since yesterday.

362
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,480
I thought

363
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,860
maybe it's all in the past

364
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,200
and it didn't really

365
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,160
matter anymore.

366
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,700
But now I just can't

367
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,680
keep it in anymore.

368
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,840
Why didn't you tell me you moved

369
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,380
to Investment Banking at Huaya?

370
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,620
It was just a standard transfer.

371
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,640
Nothing special.

372
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,860
Then why were you so quick

373
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,640
to bring it up

374
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,880
the moment you saw her today?

375
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,180
You can say
it was Zhuo Hui who brought it up.

376
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,000
But you'd rather tell Zhuo Hui than me?

377
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:13,840
And another thing,

378
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,660
where did you go

379
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,500
when you walked out suddenly?

380
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,020
You just bolted out of here to find her.

381
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,260
Don't you feel...

382
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,840
humiliated?

383
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,880
It has nothing

384
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,080
to do with you.

385
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,680
Nothing to do with me?

386
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,460
Why?

387
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,960
Didn't we grow up together?

388
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,200
Aren't we childhood sweethearts?

389
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,180
Did you never once

390
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,660
have feelings for me?

391
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,240
I didn't know

392
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,100
that I had to be held accountable
for feelings

393
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,880
that were never even confirmed.

394
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,440
Are you blaming me?

395
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,320
Yes.

396
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,420
I was cautious, I know.

397
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:17,820
But

398
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,240
is that so wrong?

399
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,480
If I were still the same person

400
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,780
I used to be,

401
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,760
I could afford to be reckless

402
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,980
and risk everything,

403
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,800
because I could actually

404
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,540
back us up.

405
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,200
But

406
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,940
am I that person anymore?

407
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,340
No, I'm not.

408
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,340
I learned the hard way

409
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,380
how cruel the world can be,

410
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,920
and how quickly people change.

411
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,760
Is it really a crime

412
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,920
that I didn't want to rush into this?

413
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,380
I just value

414
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,760
our bond too much.

415
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,200
What if we got together

416
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,140
only to realize

417
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,000
it wasn't working?

418
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,720
Would reality tear us apart so badly

419
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,960
that we couldn't even stay friends?

420
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,440
How thoughtful of you.

421
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,140
You're so much more mature than I am.

422
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,740
Are you mocking me?

423
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,040
Are you taking out

424
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,980
all the frustration you felt

425
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,300
with Nie Xiguang

426
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,580
on me?

427
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,760
Why do you keep bringing her into this?

428
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,500
What's between us

429
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,660
has never had anything to do with her.

430
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,200
Am I the one bringing her into this?

431
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,080
If she hadn't met you

432
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,720
and started pursuing you,

433
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,720
things wouldn't be so messy between us.

434
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,820
What exactly

435
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,260
did you tell her about us

436
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,320
back in college?

437
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,020
Is it about Zhuang Xu?

438
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,560
Yes.

439
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,440
Him?

440
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,280
Even though

441
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,380
we've been neighbors since childhood,

442
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,840
I don't really know him that well.

443
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,240
You're asking the wrong person.

444
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,920
Xiguang is going all out

445
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,020
to win over Zhuang Xu.

446
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,260
How can you be so unfazed?

447
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,620
Aren't you worried

448
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,440
she'll actually steal him away?

449
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,220
Don't you think

450
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,900
she's the perfect touchstone?

451
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,080
She's from a wealthy family,

452
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,160
and she's got the looks.

453
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,580
If Zhuang Xu

454
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,140
can turn down this golden opportunity,

455
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,040
I might actually believe

456
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,860
he'll never have a change of heart.

457
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,320
Still...

458
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,360
you seem so sure of yourself.

459
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,560
You've got Zhuang Xu
wrapped around your finger, right?

460
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,740
What did she tell you?

461
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,080
You believe her over me?

462
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,520
Always that same line.

463
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,280
Sometimes I think

464
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,960
maybe whatever's between you and her

465
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,420
was never about me at all.

466
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,040
You're just

467
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,780
using me

468
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,000
to one-up her.

469
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,520
She's your imaginary enemy...

470
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,440
but it was never about me.

471
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,540
What are you talking about?

472
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,800
Ye Rong,

473
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,460
do we really have to

474
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,480
spell it out?

475
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,680
Forget it.

476
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,560
It doesn't matter anymore.

477
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,380
Life finally

478
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,740
beat some sense into me.

479
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,240
It's best

480
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,120
if we just move on.

481
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,200
Move on?

482
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,020
So that's how it is.

483
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,620
Makes sense.

484
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,740
Your female colleagues
in Investment Banking

485
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,840
might come
from an even more powerful family

486
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,920
than Nie Xiguang.

487
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,500
However,

488
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,320
you don't have to
be so full of yourself

489
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,940
or insult me like this.

490
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,540
Did you really think

491
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,280
I wouldn't have

492
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,360
better options than you

493
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,140
in a city like Shanghai?

494
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,620
Good to know.

495
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,540
I used to

496
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,580
always take your word for it.

497
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,800
Thanks, Senior.

498
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:13,940
Nie Xiguang.

499
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,840
It was her.

500
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,400
The senior made it very clear:

501
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,360
the interview calls went out

502
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,820
first thing Monday afternoon.

503
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,240
I was on that list.

504
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,640
But that afternoon,

505
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,960
Nie Xiguang
was the only one in the dorm.

506
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,960
She took the call,

507
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,840
but she never told me.

508
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,100
There must be a mix‑up.

509
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,660
I don't think
she'd do something like that.

510
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,280
Why wouldn't she?

511
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,000
The facts are right in front of you.

512
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,180
Tell me, Zhuang Xu.

513
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,020
Why wouldn't she?

514
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,240
Are you saying she didn't have a motive?

515
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,400
Why do you trust her so much?

516
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,240
Maybe the person making the calls

517
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,140
just missed your name.

518
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,780
Zhuang Xu.

519
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,820
You've changed.

520
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,580
You weren't always like this.

521
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,320
I really thought
you were the only constant in my life.

522
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,740
Let me tell you something:

523
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,740
that is exactly who Nie Xiguang is.

524
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,840
She's arrogant and self-centered.

525
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,280
She just has to
have whatever she wants,

526
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,320
and couldn't care less

527
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,220
about others' feelings.

528
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,740
But I didn't think

529
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,940
she'd go this far.

530
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,580
If you don't believe me,

531
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,520
go ask your senior.

532
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,360
There's always a record

533
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,640
of those calls, isn't there?

534
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,260
If they never made the call,

535
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,000
I'll apologize for my suspicions.

536
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,420
But if they did,

537
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,760
you have to stand by me.

538
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,760
I'm going to confront her
in front of everyone.

539
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,160
Xu,

540
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
is Jiang Rui's cousin

541
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,800
into you?

542
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,640
Who told you that?

543
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,520
Rong told me.

544
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,000
She wasn't bad-mouthing her.

545
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,780
She just seemed a bit upset.

546
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,460
Jiang Rui's cousin

547
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,660
seems pretty overbearing.

548
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,380
Knowing full well about you and Rong,

549
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,060
she still bragged in the dorm

550
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,120
about how she's going to win you over.

551
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,540
I see.

552
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,660
Xu,

553
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,260
do you like her?

554
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,840
I don't think what she's doing

555
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,100
is right.

556
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,620
Focus on your studies.

557
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,980
This is none of your business.

558
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,900
Just a few more lessons for Jiang Rui.

559
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,000
After that, I'm done.

560
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,360
Xu.

561
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,820
[Inpatient]

562
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,660
How about

563
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,140
we borrow from Aunt

564
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,000
to settle with Jiang Rui's cousin?

565
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,480
Why are you bringing this up?

about Jiang Rui's cousin
lending you money.

that she helped you,

573

so you're bound to end up with her.

for trusting you.

Isn't it about time?

597
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,440
Come on, give me a guy's take,

598
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,420
and help me break it down.

599
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,060
If I confess now,

600
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,340
do you think I've got a good shot?

601
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,260
You should've gone for it ages ago.

602
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,600
Why bother earning brownie points?

603
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,900
You don't need them.

604
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,320
Never mind.

605
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,000
Actually, it's still a bit too soon
for that.

606
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,600
Let me give it some thought

607
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,160
and come up with the perfect plan.

608
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,340
What plan?

609
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,380
I pulled an all-nighter to finish one.

610
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,740
Care for a look?

611
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,140
That color

612
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,720
looks great on you.

613
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,220
Right?

614
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,820
Ms. Zhou.

615
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,960
It's been ages since I last saw you.

616
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,840
Look at you, all grown up

617
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,040
and more stunning than ever.

618
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,140
Why do you still have such dark circles

619
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,360
when you slept in so late?

620
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,580
I didn't sleep well.

621
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,120
There's soy milk,

622
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,980
youtiao, and pancakes in the kitchen.

623
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,060
Just ask Ms. Yan
to warm them up for you.

624
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,540
Once you're done, come have a chat

625
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,000
with Ms. Zhou.

626
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,380
Okay.

627
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,580
Eat over here.

628
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,140
Okay.

629
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,600
Xiguang,

630
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,740
I heard

631
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,280
you're working in Suzhou?

632
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,860
She applied all by herself.

633
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,820
Turns out the place

634
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,640
is actually a Yuancheng investment.

635
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,740
Small world, right?

636
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,720
So,

637
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,560
I figured I'd let her
learn the ropes there.

638
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,300
It's nice and all,

639
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,860
but if she's not working in Wuxi,

640
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,420
dating becomes such a hassle.

641
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,800
You don't want her ending up

642
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,360
with some guy from Suzhou.

643
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,380
That's a bit of a stretch.

644
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,720
She's still young.

645
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,320
Honestly,

646
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,280
I haven't even given it a thought.

647
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,480
Has no one come to you
wanting to set her up?

648
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,260
Oh, there are plenty,

649
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,880
but the matches didn't seem right,

650
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,720
so I turned them all down.

651
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,440
Xiguang.

652
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,520
You can date,

653
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,420
but you need

654
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,380
to take your time.

655
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,860
You should date for at least two years

656
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,980
to see his true character, okay?

657
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,140
Ideally,

658
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
it should be someone local.

659
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,920
Suzhou is just way too far.

660
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,380
Exactly.

661
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,760
Just listen to your mother.

662
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,280
Remember Ms. Sun's daughter?

663
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,420
She married someone from Zhejiang.

664
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,080
And now?

665
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,080
They only get to see each other

666
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,140
once every month or two.

667
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,720
I got it.

668
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,060
Look at her, she's blushing.

669
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,120
She's got her head buried in her bowl.

670
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,220
Oh, by the way,

671
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,780
your uncle mentioned

672
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,780
that for Chinese New Year,

673
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,140
our family should go on a trip abroad.

674
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,540
Would you like to go?

675
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,320
Where to?

676
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,200
He suggested Switzerland.

677
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,960
We'd rent a chalet

678
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,600
and go skiing.

679
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,740
I'm still on the fence, though,

680
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,840
as you've always been afraid of flying.

681
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,180
I'm fine.

682
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,140
If you want to go, Mom, we'll go.

683
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,900
But if it's for skiing,

684
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,440
why do we have to go abroad?

685
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,400
We can do that here,

686
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,640
like Xinjiang or Changbai Mountain.

687
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,260
Why fly so far?

688
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,560
I only have a few days off anyway.

689
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,760
True.

690
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,300
Flying abroad

691
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,560
takes over twenty hours.

692
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,060
I've never been

693
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,980
to Changbai Mountain.

694
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,160
It might be worth a visit.

695
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,440
I'll talk to your aunt.

696
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,680
After you finish breakfast,

697
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,680
go visit your grandparents.

698
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,640
You might not

699
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,900
have much time to spend with them

700
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,800
during Chinese New Year.

701
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,800
Okay.

702
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,480
After lunch

703
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,240
at your grandparents',

704
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,260
be back early.

705
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,360
You've still got that trip to Suzhou.

706
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,100
Got it.

707
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,820
Should I pack
some Jingqiao sesame cakes for you?

708
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,600
If you're the one craving them,
just buy some.

709
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,720
Don't use me as an excuse.

710
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,600
I'll get going.

711
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,640
Bye, Ms. Zhou.

712
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,940
Drive safe.

713
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,080
Take it easy, okay?

714
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,660
Got it.

715
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,080
Since when did Xiguang start driving?

716
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,620
I made her get her license
right after the gaokao.

717
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,800
So you're still in touch

718
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,760
with your former in-laws?

719
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,220
I don't go there myself.

720
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,460
But Xiguang does.

721
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,740
Those are two separate matters.

722
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,340
Her grandparents are really kind.

723
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,980
Back when I first got married,

724
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,800
Nie Chengyuan and I were busy
running the business,

725
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,940
and my parents weren't in good health.

726
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,020
So Xiguang was basically raised by them.

727
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,180
They've built a real bond.

728
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,540
And now,

729
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,280
with my parents gone,

730
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,940
I can't let Xiguang

731
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,420
lose that bond

732
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,120
with them either.

733
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,860
- Grandma!
- Sweetheart!

734
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,580
Welcome back!

735
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,980
[Grandma of Xiguang]
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

736
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,620
I needed to prep the meal.

737
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,760
I called

738
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,160
Grandpa earlier.

739
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,360
He said you were home.

740
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,660
That old man

741
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,880
hasn't told me a thing.

742
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,820
He isn't even back yet.

743
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,000
He must've forgotten.

744
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,580
Are you going to the fields?

745
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,460
I'll join you.

746
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,200
Okay, let's go.

747
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,060
I've

748
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,340
opened up a new spot

749
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,700
for broccoli.

750
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,120
Don't you city folks love that stuff?

751
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,160
I'll save the best ones for you
when they're ready.

752
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,100
- Okay?
- Alright.

753
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,320
Park the car inside.

754
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,160
Okay.

755
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,320
Guang.

756
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,220
Here.

757
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:19,760
Let's go.

758
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,280
Come on.

759
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,520
Grandma, who's that guy?

760
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,140
That's Qian Fangping's father.

761
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,080
Homewreckers will get
what's coming to them.

762
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,080
That old scumbag

763
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,740
has been trouble since he was young,

764
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,860
always a total sleazebag.

765
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,560
Never did a day's work in the fields.

766
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,040
These days
he's just some wannabe fortune-teller,

767
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,840
still messing around
pretending to be all mystical.

768
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,640
He's absolute trash,
through and through,

769
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,320
always out there swindling people.

770
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,060
Your father is such a good-for-nothing.

771
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,040
That home-wrecker Qian

772
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,520
literally

773
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,820
tore our family apart.

774
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,280
I swear, your dad must be cursed
to have met her.

775
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,300
Guang, don't worry.

776
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,080
If she ever tries to marry your dad,

777
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,260
I will

778
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,180
lie down right at your dad's office door

779
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:12,940
and not let him leave.

780
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,920
Grandma,

781
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,700
when my parents were getting a divorce,

782
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,780
you tried that too.

783
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,480
I was just about to lie down,

784
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,700
and you pulled me back up.

785
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,540
Alright.

786
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,480
Let's go.

787
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,920
I'm not afraid of him anyway.
