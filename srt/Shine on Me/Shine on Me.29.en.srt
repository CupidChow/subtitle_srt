12
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,820
Mom.

13
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,200
Mom?

14
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,600
You're back.

15
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,600
That was fast.

16
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,700
You didn't tell my dad about that,
did you?

17
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,080
Please don't do this.

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,640
You don't need to worry about it.

19
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,780
Yusen and I both feel like

20
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,979
we should just let things
take their course.

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,020
Or just let Shengyuan handle it.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,820
Besides, Yusen is really planning

23
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,060
to go back to medicine

24
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,240
and won't be putting much heart

Wait a second.

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,500
I didn't make this decision

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,440
because of you,

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,000
and definitely not because of Lin.

30
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,120
So,

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,740
whatever Lin plans to do with his life

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,660
has nothing to do with me.

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,760
Xiguang,

34
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,079
I'm

35
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,400
doing this for myself.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,720
Here,

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,680
I made some snow fungus soup for you.

38
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,360
Let's sit down and talk.

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,280
Back when we were at Changbai Mountain,

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,640
you kept throwing

41
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,579
all those work questions at me.

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,400
Remember?

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,880
Yeah.

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,960
Back then, seeing you so serious

45
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,900
reminded me of how I used to be.

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,900
Later, when I was having tea
with Lin's mom,

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,560
and she asked what I'd been up to,

48
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,760
I told her

49
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,400
I was just living
a quiet, carefree life.

50
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,740
She said something

51
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,360
that really stuck with me.

52
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,860
What did Ms. Sheng say?

53
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,240
She said

54
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,640
I have a real head for business.

55
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,180
That said,

56
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,760
I can't help feeling it's a loss.

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,260
Back then, I always thought

58
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,820
you had sharper business instincts

59
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,200
and more talent

60
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,020
than your ex-husband.

61
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,700
Ms. Sheng is right.

62
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,000
So I started thinking

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,660
about what I've actually been doing

64
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,400
since the divorce.

65
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm out here sipping tea,
doing flower arrangements,

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,940
and hitting all the tourist spots.

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,860
But is that me?

68
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,640
Not even close.

69
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,680
So why would I do that?

70
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,640
Then one day,

71
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,400
it finally clicked.

72
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:35,900
I was

73
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,420
trying to prove I was "wifey material".

74
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,480
"Wifey material"?

75
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,000
I've never told anyone this,

76
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,920
but right after the divorce,

77
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,300
I actually had regrets.

78
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,260
After all,

79
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,020
we were together for 20 years.

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,780
Of course there were feelings,

81
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,880
and a sense of leaning on each other.

82
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,320
For a while, I even wondered

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,420
if I'd given up too easily.

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,540
Luckily, I got through that phase

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,560
pretty quickly,

86
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,980
because deep down, I knew

87
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,420
that the more it hurt,

88
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,060
the more decisively I had to cut ties.

89
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,400
Otherwise,

90
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,460
I'd just end up becoming numb

91
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,800
and losing myself entirely.

92
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,399
Back then,

93
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,240
besides my internal struggle,

94
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,720
there were so many rumors flying around

95
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,200
about our divorce.

96
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,180
Do you remember two years ago,

97
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,800
when you went to Ms. Yu's banquet

98
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,240
and got into that huge fight

99
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,880
with Mr. Xu?

100
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,760
I remember.

101
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,280
He was spreading lies, saying

102
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,900
you and Dad were power tripping

103
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,860
at the company

104
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,560
and fighting over who was the real boss.

105
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,659
He even claimed
you wanted to get back together

106
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,659
but Dad said no.

107
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,600
Those stories

108
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,420
were everywhere back then.

109
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,120
Eventually,

110
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,659
everyone just assumed

111
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,340
your dad cheated

112
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,540
because I was

113
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,980
too aggressive

114
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,900
and driven,

115
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,640
like I had to outshine him.

116
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,520
I felt so wronged.

117
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,800
I was just dedicated to my work.

118
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,640
I wasn't plotting

119
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,260
to take his place.

120
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,140
So after the divorce,

121
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,780
I forced myself

122
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,560
to stop everything.

123
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
Subconsciously, I felt like

124
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,760
I had to prove

125
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,140
that I didn't care

126
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,740
about power

127
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,720
or fame,

128
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,580
and that I wasn't ambitious at all.

129
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,620
So

130
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,080
I did the whole tea, flowers,

131
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,060
and travel thing.

132
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:20,760
There's

133
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,260
nothing wrong with those things,

134
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,840
but my reasons were all wrong.

135
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,640
I was actually trying to prove

136
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,380
I was a selfless,

137
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,760
devoted woman.

138
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,120
Like, "See?

139
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,380
You all got me wrong."

140
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,720
It felt like I'd stepped

141
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,740
into an invisible trap.

142
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,220
I knew something was off,

143
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,480
but I couldn't put my finger
on the problem.

144
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,100
Until you kept throwing

145
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,480
all those questions at me

146
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,460
when we were at Changbai Mountain.

147
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,600
That's when it finally came to me.

148
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,340
My daughter

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,900
is out there proving her worth,

150
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,480
while I'm stuck

151
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,420
trying to prove
I was such "wifey material."

152
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,420
And here I was,

153
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,340
priding myself
on being so rational and decisive.

154
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,140
Yet, without even realizing it,

155
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,020
I let a few nasty rumors

156
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,540
stifle who I am to this point.

157
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,720
What a waste of time.

158
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,600
I'm sorry, Mom.

159
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,280
I had no idea.

160
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,480
But you can't blame yourself

161
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,500
for feeling that way.

162
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,420
It was all that gossip around you

163
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,340
that got to your head.

164
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,540
Besides, I've always thought

165
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,780
you were one

166
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,480
of the most incredible women
of our time.

167
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,480
I'm not even close.

168
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,920
When people talk about Yuancheng,

169
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,360
99% of them

170
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,620
still think of your dad,

171
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,480
not me.

172
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,700
I chose

173
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,880
to stay in his shadow

174
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,420
and let him take all the credit.

175
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,960
That's not being incredible.

176
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,900
Truly remarkable people

177
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,680
have the guts
to break through the constraints

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,659
of their time and environment.

179
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,740
I didn't have those.

180
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,400
That's okay.

181
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,660
Who says

182
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,980
you're not allowed to take a detour?

183
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,700
Mom,

184
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,140
you've figured it out now.

185
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,140
From now on, you can do
whatever you want.

186
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,520
I really have moved past it

187
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,680
for a while now.

188
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,880
I've even started looking into

189
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,620
a few different industries.

190
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,520
Honestly, I hadn't thought

191
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,060
about selling my shares
in Yuancheng before.

192
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,260
When your dad first brought it up,

193
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,900
I was furious.

194
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,180
But then I thought about it,

195
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,840
and it felt like a new path

196
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,720
was opening up right in front of me.

197
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,420
It was such a relief.

198
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,520
Why should I

199
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,300
cling to those shares

200
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,159
and just wait for some dividends?

201
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,680
If I sell while the price is high

202
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,540
and have more cash on hand,

203
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,900
I can get into any business I want.

204
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,659
Why stay tied down to him?

205
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,760
Just so I can be introduced

206
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,860
as "Ms. Jiang from the Yuancheng Group"?

207
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,180
Xiguang,

208
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,240
that's why

209
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,220
I finally decided

210
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,440
to sell the shares.

211
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,120
I've spent so many years
in the background.

212
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,360
I'm almost 50 now,

213
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,640
and I want to give it one more shot

214
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,740
to prove what I can do.

215
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,360
No.

216
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,460
It's not even about proving anything.

217
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,740
I just want

218
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,940
to get things done.

219
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,520
Xiguang,

220
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,720
do you get it?

221
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,740
I do.

222
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,460
I've known since I was a kid.

223
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,960
My mom has always been amazing,

224
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,720
totally one of a kind.

225
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,740
I still remember

226
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,220
once in middle school when you
and Dad were away on a business trip

227
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,160
and left me with my grandparents.

228
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,500
A neighbor saw me and said,

229
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,600
"Did your daughter pawn her kid off

230
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,919
on you two again?

231
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,220
Such a deadbeat mom.

232
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,980
She's so money-hungry
and won't even parent her own child."

233
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,600
Grandma was so upset.

234
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,760
But Grandpa just said to him calmly,

235
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,040
"My daughter is like a cloud

236
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,380
aiming to fly high,

237
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,580
not the cloud idling away.

238
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,060
Like you'd know."
[*"Yun" in "Jiang Yun" means clouds]

239
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,320
You never told me that.

240
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,460
Your grandparents

241
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,500
never mentioned it to me either.

242
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,500
They told me not to say anything.

243
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,020
That's just how they are.

244
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,920
They never praised me for good grades,

245
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,220
but an extra dish would just appear
on the table the next day.

246
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,060
And every time you came to pick me up,

247
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,900
Grandma would go out of her way

248
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,940
to buy a ton of groceries.

249
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,500
That's enough talking for us.

250
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,540
Come on,

251
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,900

252
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,620
Mom,

253
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,700
are you

254
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,260
really planning

255
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,720
to buy the shares in Shuangyuan?

256
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,640
I am.

257
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,340
I'm very optimistic

258
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,740
about where this industry is heading.

259
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,040
Does that mean

260
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,200
I can't

261
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,540
slack off anymore?

262
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,660
Don't sweat it.

263
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,780

pretty low, haven't you?

to be healthy and happy too.

Oh, by the way,

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,000
how did you

281
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,160
get back so fast?

282
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,600
Did Lin drive you?

283
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,640
Yeah.

284
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,060
I asked him to just drop me
at the train station,

285
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,280
but he said he was worried.

286
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,560
Once we got here, I told him to come up,

287
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,660
but he said it wouldn't be right

288
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,940
and he'd wait downstairs

289
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,120
until he knew I was settled
before heading back.

290
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,360
So he's still downstairs right now?

291
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,720
Why didn't you say so sooner?

292
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,360

00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,300
Yeah.

380
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,700
I've actually been handling

381
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,900
the shareholder transfer paperwork.

382
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,840
Wow, so tight-lipped.

383
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,100
You didn't even breathe a word to us.

384
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,200
I just didn't really have the chance.

385
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,300
It would've been weird
to just bring it up out of nowhere.

386
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,560
Oh man.

387
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,180
So Mr. Lin really was born
with a silver spoon

388
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,820
and now he's essentially

389
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,100
our big boss.

390
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,040
Come to think of it,

391
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,620
one of my dreams just came true.

392
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,400
My bestie

393
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,680
marrying a CEO
who's rich, handsome, and a total alpha,

394
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,340
while I totally

395
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,319
ride her coattails
and act like I own the place.

396
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,980
I have a question.

397
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,020
If it's a dream,

398
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,000
why isn't it you

399
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,460
marrying the CEO?

400
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,040
Because

401
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,280
there's only one of me.

402
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:15,900
But I can have

403
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,800
lots of besties.

404
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,380
Which one

405
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,060
do you think has better odds?

406
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,420
Fair point.

407
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,380
Come on.

408
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,260
Let's toast.

409
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,819
To one of Yin Jie's dreams

410
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,980
coming true.

411
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,220
Actually,

412
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,200
skip the rich CEO.

413
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,980
I can help you

414
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,640
ride my coattails.

415
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,360
At least when we're having fun.

416
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,000
How so?

417
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,920
Qiqi is in Finance, so you should know.

418
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,540
Besides the Shengyuan shares

419
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,800
going to Yusen,

420
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,180
the shares that used to belong

421
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,500
to Yuancheng

422
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,360
were also transferred

423
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,320
to a lady named Jiang Yun.

424
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,020
Yeah.

425
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,220
That's my mom.

426
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,980
So

427
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,380
forget about the bestie's boyfriend.

428
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,600
You can just count on your bestie.

429
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
You're right.

430
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,300
Who needs a man?

431
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,600
My eyes are finally open.

432
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,440
Cheers.

433
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,940
So, this is why you've ditched me

434
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,980
for two days straight

435
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,200
after having hot pot?

436
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,920
Yeah.

437
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,500
I felt bad.

438
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,100
After keeping them in the dark
for so long,

439
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,140
I had to make it up to them,

440
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,620
right?

441
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,980
But it feels like

442
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm the one being sacrificed here.

443
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,000
No way.

444
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,460
I spent the whole day

445
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,580
with you.

446
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,820
Plus, I'm going with you

447
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,720
to Shanghai tomorrow
for that academic salon.

448
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,780
Aren't I being super thoughtful

449
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,560
and devoted?

450
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,180
I already made plans with Xiaofeng.

451
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,740
While you're meeting the professor,

452
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,660
I'll go hang out with her.

453
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,260
You can pick me up when you're done.

454
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,540
I've got it.

455
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,980
You want to do it again?

456
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,820
Not today.

457
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,320
Let's go find those stray cats.

458
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,640
Strays?

459
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
When I first got here,

460
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,260
I saw a mama cat

461
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,420
wandering around

462
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,000
with three kittens.

463
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,500
All of them have these big, round eyes.

464
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,240
So cute.

465
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,060
Let's go say hi.

466
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,900
Big, round eyes?

467
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,400
Doesn't that sound just like you?

468
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,680
Maybe they are

469
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,920
my long-lost sisters.

470
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,740
If we're visiting your "sisters",

471
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,220
shouldn't we bring a gift?

472
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,580
But we don't have any cat food.

473
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,900
Forget it. We're family,

474
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,660
and we don't stand on ceremony.

475
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,000
We'll just go introduce ourselves
and get on their good side.

476
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,260
Ms. Chen,

477
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,580
what are we having today?

478
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,180
Hot pot.

479
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,260
Did you guys find the cats?

480
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,160
We did.

481
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,640
But as soon as Yusen got close,

482
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
they bolted.

483
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,820
All I got to see
was their fuzzy little butts.

484
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,440
Are you hungry?

485
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,280
Want a piece of corn to tide you over?

486
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,160
It'll be ready in a sec.

487
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:10,820
Yes, please.

488
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,760
Thanks.

489
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,400
Mr. Lin suddenly said

490
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,860
he wanted to have hot pot at home.

491
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,820
So I put all this together.

492
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,680
Take a look.

493
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,140
Anything else you need to add?

494
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,240
This is plenty.

495
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,880
He said he wanted hot pot at home?

496
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,580
Yeah.

497
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,120
He mentioned it out of the blue

498
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,960
when he got home from work
three days ago.

499
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,720
We've never done it before.

500
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,180
I even went to the supermarket

501
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,980
to buy a pot.

502
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,800
Your college classmate.

503
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,160
Siliang?

504
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,760
Why would she be calling me?

505
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,760
Siliang.

506
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,700
Hey, Xiguang.

507
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,880
I just heard from Xiaofeng

508
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,080
that you're coming to Shanghai tomorrow.

509
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,100
So you're coming to town
just to see Xiaofeng

510
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,160
and not me, huh?

511
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,360
[Xiaofeng: Oops.]

512
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,240
I totally slipped up.

513
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,920
My friend

514
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,120
is going to a salon
in Shanghai tomorrow.

515
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,180
It happens
to be right near Xiaofeng's school.

516
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,520
Since I've got nothing better to do,

517
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
I asked her to keep me company.

518
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,780
"Nothing better to do", right?

519
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,140
Perfect.

520
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,820
It's my birthday tomorrow night,

521
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,700
and I'm treating everyone to dinner.

522
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,340
You have to come.

523
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,380
Come on.

524
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,340
You're already in the neighborhood.

525
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,480
Rong can't make it,

526
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,300
so if you don't show up,

527
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,240
my birthday dinner

528
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,760
is going to be way too quiet.

529
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,820
Okay.

530
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,460
What time is the party?

531
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,220
And where?

532
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,400
I'll text you

533
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,460
the time and place in a bit.

534
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,280
See you tomorrow.

535
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,780
I'm gonna go let the others know.

536
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:44,940
Okay.

537
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,000
So

538
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,380
are you going

539
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,560
to a college friend's birthday party
tomorrow?

540
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,040
I wasn't really planning on it,

541
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
but since you're attending

542
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,560
the academic salon anyway...

543
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,140
So you're coming to keep me company

544
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,900
and just happening to go to the party?

545
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,900
Exactly.

546
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,920
So, tomorrow,

547
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,260
we'll do our own thing.

548
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,600
But you have to text me

549
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,500
whenever you're free.

550
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,020
At least once an hour.

551
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,240
Send me pictures

552
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,040
of the salon

553
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,720
and what you're eating.

554
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,660
And you have to pick me up
when you're done.

555
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,360
That's a lot of demands.

556
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,180
Is that a problem?

557
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,520
I'm only going to Shanghai

558
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,400
because of you.

559
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,440
The least you can do
is give me five-star service.

560
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,620
You got it.

561
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,760
I'm at your beck and call.

562
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:37,720
Exactly.

563
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,940
[Huaya Bank]

564
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:39,940
Exactly.

565
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,440
Did you get a chance...

566
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,860
Justin.

567
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,820
to look over the investment proposal
I gave you?

568
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,940
Let's go over today's meeting agenda.

569
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,780
Right, we've sent over

570
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,460
all the key focus areas,

571
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,440
including the market analysis

572
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,060
and the opportunity assessment.

573
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,320
Coffee's here.

574
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:50,800
Let's go.

575
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,820
Everyone envies us
for making the big money.

576
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,340
Thanks.

577
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,040
But they have no idea
we're still grinding like crazy

578
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,540
on the weekends.

579
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,120
Don't even have time to date.

580
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,120
Kevin,

581
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,160
can you handle caffeine now?

582
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,860
Better not.

583
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,720
I ordered a milk for myself.

584
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,360
My last relationship ended

585
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,840
because I was too busy.

586
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,280
So

587
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,420
I suggest dating someone
in the same industry.

588
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,840
Everyone's in the same boat,

589
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,900
so they understand the grind.

590
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,240
Chris,

591
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,100
any plans for your birthday tomorrow?

592
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,440
It's Chris's birthday tomorrow?

593
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,860
Sweet. I could really use a party.

594
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,780
Not me, I'm wiped out.

595
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm planning on sleeping
all day tomorrow.

596
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,300
Then what should we do?

597
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,320
How about tomorrow night,

598
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,460
we find a place

599
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:37,960
to grab dinner?

600
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,620
It could also be

601
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,580
a welcome-back dinner for Kevin.

602
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,700
Sure.

603
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,620
Sounds good.

604
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,160
I'm down.

605
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,540
Zhuang, you coming?

606
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,640
I already gave you a nod.

607
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,900
Of course I'm in.

608
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,260
Alright then,

609
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,420
let's get to it.

610
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,200
Okay, let's go.

611
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,900
The sooner we wrap up,
the sooner we can head out.

612
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,000
Hey, Zhuo Hui.

613
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,900
Zhuang Xu,

614
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,860
are you free tomorrow night?

615
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,200
It's Siliang's birthday.

616
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,840
I've invited a few old classmates,

617
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,220
so let's all grab dinner.

618
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,680
What a coincidence.

619
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,060
My colleague's birthday
is also tomorrow.

620
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,580
I just agreed to go.

621
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,160
Fine.

622
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,900
I'll let Siliang know.

623
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,100
You're something else, man.

624
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,800
Forgetting old friends
the moment someone new comes along.

625
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,400
It's your girlfriend's birthday.

626
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,240
You're the only one

627
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,120
who matters to her.

628
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,120
If it were your birthday,

629
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,160
I'd definitely clear my schedule.

630
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,520
Fair enough.

631
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,840
The real world really changes people.

632
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,460
Even Mr. Cool

633
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,580
knows

634
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,420
how to smooth-talk now.

635
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,820
I guess

636
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,380
I don't have to worry

637
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,600
about your love life anymore.

638
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,440
Oh shut it.

639
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,120
I'm done with you. Hanging up.

640
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,140
Only Zhuang Xu can't make it.

641
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,040
Said his colleague's birthday

642
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,560
is tomorrow

643
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,260
and he already committed.

644
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,560
It's probably better
if he doesn't show up.

645
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,960
I invited Xiguang.

646
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,840
If he were there,

647
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,100
Xiguang might feel awkward.

648
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,480
You sure do care a lot

649
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,500
about Nie Xiguang's feelings.

650
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,820
Back in college,

651
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,480
you guys

652
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,740
weren't even that close.

653
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,460
I'm gonna pack up some stuff

654
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,380
and head over to my uncle's.

655
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,160
Anyway, I should get going.

656
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,760
Bye.

657
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,520
Xiguang,

658
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,680
let me

659
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,300
treat you to dinner.

660
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,960
Are you treating me to dinner,

661
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,300
or just offering me up as mosquito bait?

662
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,440
Did you bring me here
just to feed the mosquitoes?

663
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,580
Nie Xiguang,

664
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,960
do you think

665
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,140
I'm some two-faced fake?

666
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,440
Like I'm just a petty gossip?

667
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,360
You've had too much.

668
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,300
Fine. Let's just blame it on the booze.

669
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,860
You have no idea

670
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,380
everyone's always talking about you.

671
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,820
You're not even from around here,

672
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,800
yet you live off-campus.

673
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,960
Word started getting around

674
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,280
from your high school classmates

675
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,960
about your family.

676
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,480
And they came to ask us.

677
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,640
What were we supposed to know?

678
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,040
You never said a word.

679
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,540
And then there was

680
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,340
your overbearing way of pursuing him.

681
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,600
Overbearing?

682
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,800
I was

683
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,560
just being direct.

684
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,440
Or would you prefer "making a scene"?

685
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,560
Let me finish.

686
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,880
Fine.

687
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,240
I was just scared

688
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,620
so I wanted to be loud

689
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,760
to give myself a little more courage.

690
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,460
Go on.

691
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,120
And when

692
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,180
Zhuang Xu's mom got sick,

693
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,460
you just

694
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,620
dropped all that cash.

695
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,160
Xiguang, you know,

696
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,860
I was actually terrified back then.

697
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,760
Seeing how you could just

698
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,160
pull out tens of thousands

699
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,700
without even asking your parents,

700
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,940
I realized

701
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,860
how different

702
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,200
our worlds really are.

703
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,860
Later, when we went

704
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,000
to the bank to withdraw the money,

705
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,240
it was packed that day.

706
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,420
The ticket machine was broken,

707
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,960
and there were long lines
at the windows.

708
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,540
But as soon as you walked in,

709
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,360
the floor manager

710
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,220
rushed over to greet you.

711
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,540
And you were whisked

712
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,680
straight into the VIP lounge

713
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,320
without having to wait a single second.

714
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,300
Zhuang Xu

715
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,620
was in desperate need of that money.

716
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,900
It's normal for a floor manager

717
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,120
to ask their customers

718
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,080
what they need.

719
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,360
Besides,

720
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,820
that window

721
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,500
was a VIP window.

722
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,500
Right.

723
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,080
A VIP window.

724
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,400
You make it sound so natural.

725
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,120
Actually, that day,

726
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,920
even without a VIP card,

727
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,860
I think if we had told
the people in line

728
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,120
that someone was in the hospital

729
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,340
waiting for surgery money,

730
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,640
they would've let us go first.

731
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,040
Forget it.

732
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,380
Why am I even arguing with someone

733
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,300
who's wasted?

734
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,060
Siliang,

735
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,120
do you like Zhuang Xu?

736
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,220
Yes.

737
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,600
I do.

738
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,520
Who could resist someone

739
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,120
like Zhuang Xu?

740
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,300
He's got the looks and the brains.

741
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,620
But his family is such a heavy burden.

742
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
His mother is seriously ill
and his brother is still young.

743
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,280
I had to be careful.

744
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,820
Why do you think Rong kept him

745
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,000
on the hook before?

746
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,580
Was it really because of some "pride"

747
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,920
or seeing who would make the first move?

748
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,320
If

749
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,340
Zhuang Xu's family wasn't such a mess,

750
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,080
you think she wouldn't have jumped
all over him?

751
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,800
Now she's stopped playing games,

752
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:36,880
but...

753
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,380
And

754
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,480
even if I didn't care about his family,

755
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,840

834
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,400
I did.

Professor Xi

836

that you should head back to China,

838
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,800

And she dragged me along with her.

00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,480

843
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,720
it's only fair.

893
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,620
I ran into Bu Siyuan,
an academician from the CAS.

894
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,720
He told me

895
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,800
China was about to launch
a brain initiative,

896
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,300
including brain-computer interfaces.

897
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,120
He gave us a warm invitation

898
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:21,960
to come to China,

899
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,020
and I figured the time was right.

900
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,780
If I didn't come back now,

901
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,420
I'd really be over the hill.

902
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,200
That last part isn't true at all.

903
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,960
Even at ninety,

904
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,560
you'll still be active

905

in the lab.

906
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,060
You're right,

907
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,900
but Elio doesn't like hearing
that kind of talk.

908
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,560
He's always trying to talk me

909
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,420
into early retirement.

910
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,940

Me nudging you

914
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,540
to retire is just a little trick

915
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,580
to get your attention.

916
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,660
Oh,

917
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,280
you and your various "little tricks."

918
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,720
You even used my name

919
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,940
to trick Yusen into a blind date.

920
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,060
It got so bad that it was a struggle

921
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,080
just to get Yusen to come over

922
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,280
to our place for dinner after that.

923
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,620
So that blind date

924
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,820
was your idea all along, Elio?

925
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,940
Vincent,

926
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,440
you've got the looks,

927
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,740
but you're never dating.

928
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,680
That's just not right.

929
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,420
Zesheng told me

930
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,500
Chinese people are very reserved.

931
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,520
Several of my Chinese colleagues

932
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,660
found their partners
through blind dates,

933
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,560
so I thought
maybe it would work for you too.

934
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,980
Plus, there was a lady

935
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,820
who really had a thing for you.

936
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,320
Well, you should have told Yusen.

937
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,180
And I'm sure the lady

938
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,860
would have wanted Yusen
to be in the loop too,

939
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,380
right?

940
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,160
I realized that later.

00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,820
My girlfriend

946
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,340
is actually pretty upset
about this whole thing.

947
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,800
Vincent,

948
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,500
you're finally in a relationship.

949
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,300
I am.

950
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,500
I'm really curious.

951
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,320
What's

952
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,400
she like?

953
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,780
She's

954
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,440
incredibly smart, vibrant,

955
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,440
and has such a strong spirit.

956
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,620
That's wonderful.

957
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,680
A girl like that

958
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,760
is perfect for you.

959
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,320
Yeah,

960
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,740
I'm really lucky

961
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,780
to have found her.

962
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,840
Still,

963
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,660
I don't get why she's so hung up

964
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,620
on that blind date.

965
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,340
You and that lady

966
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,720
never even had a "next time."

967
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,780
We should grab dinner sometime,

968
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,380
and I can explain everything to her.

969
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,900
Elio,

970
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,540
we aren't the only ones

971
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,160
with these little romantic tricks.

972
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,680
Alright, that's so sweet.

973
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,560
Yusen,

974
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
since I've been back,

975
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,400
I've reached out to a few people

976
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,820
and heard about what happened to you,

977
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,660
but the details were all a bit fuzzy.

978
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,600
I want to know

979
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,300
what actually happened,

980
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,220
if that's okay?

981
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:02,960
Of course.

982
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,360
A car accident left me

983
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,140
with an injured left hand,

984
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,440
and I can no longer
perform precision surgeries.

985
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,100
So, I had to walk away
from clinical practice

986
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,860
and left the medical world
for two years.

987
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,680
Back then,

988
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,620
I was bitter and felt like

989
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,400
the world was against me.

990
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,240
But time and the people I love

991
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,680
healed those wounds.

992
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,200
A while ago,

993
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,320
I was skiing at Changbai Mountain

994
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,880
and came across

995
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,040
a patient
with an acute brain hemorrhage.

996
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,540
I helped him,

997
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,400
and in doing so,

998
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,400
I helped myself.

999
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,640
I finally made up my mind

1000
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,700
to return

1001
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,360
to the field I love.

1002
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,460
Oh my goodness.

1003
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,620
I had no idea you went through

1004
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,380
such a tragedy.

1005
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,040
I am so sorry.

1006
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,580
We truly didn't know until today.

1007
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,520
It's okay.

1008
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,840
It's all in the past now.

1009
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,000
Have a seat.

1010
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,860
But

1011
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,020
it still sounds

1012
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,620
so intense.

1013
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,660
Even though I know you're okay now,

1014
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,100
my heart was still...

1015
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,000
pulling by a thread.

1016
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,980
It's "hanging by a thread"!

1017
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,280
Okay.

1018
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,220
Your Chinese idioms

1019
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,820
are pretty brutal.

1020
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,680
Having my heart in my throat

1021
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,580
is bad enough,

1022
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,980
and now you're telling me
it's hanging by a thread?

1023
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,200
Elio's take on idioms

1024
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,860
is as unique as ever.

1025
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,820
For a foreigner,

1026
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,160
his Chinese is actually quite good.

1027
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,160
Thanks, honey.

1028
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,240
Yusen,

1029
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,380
let me be blunt.

1030
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,180
I admire your mind

1031
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,280
and your brilliance.

1032
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,920
I know you have plenty of options,

1033
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:48,980
but I'm sincerely

1034
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,200
inviting you

1035
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,660
to join my team.

1036
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,160
Back when you were a student,

1037
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,660
you were in the brain-computer interface

1038
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,480
interest group.

1039
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,860
You even took a bunch of

1040
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,800
extra bioengineering courses

1041
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,080
for it.

1042
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,100
But in the end,

1043
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,280
clinical practice "stole" you away.

1044
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,780
I get it, of course.

1045
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,080
Surgery

1046
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,160
is a high-level art,

1047
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,560
the ultimate synergy
between the brain and the hands.

1048
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,000
It's hard for any young person
to pass up that challenge.

1049
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,100
But

1050
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,840
if

1051
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,820
your hands can no longer keep pace

1052
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,760
with your brilliant mind,

1053
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,220
then maybe

1054
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,760
life is steering you

1055
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
toward a different path

1056
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,880
to save patients.

1057
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,700
It's still early.

1058
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,540
Let's go

1059
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,140
[Yusen]
to karaoke?

1060
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,040
I'm down.

1061
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,440
It's kind of a drag
to just head home now anyway.

1062
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,120
Sure, singing burns calories at least.

1063
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,320
Xiguang, how about you?

1064
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,580
I'm in.

1065
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,360
The only thing is I have to
head back to Suzhou tonight.

1066
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,200
So I'll need to head out a bit early.

1067
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,980
No problem.

1068
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,600
There's a karaoke place right nearby.

1069
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,700
It's only about a ten-minute walk.

1070
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,740
Let me call and check.

1071
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,780
You need a bathroom break?

1072
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,700
I'm good.

1073
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,220
Bathroom?

1074
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,980
Hi, do you have any private rooms left?

1075
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,720
Great, we'll be there in a bit.

1076
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,180
Do you have any with a pool table?

1077
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,500
Okay.

1078
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,420
We'll book that one then.

1079
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,100
Got a craving for pool again, have you?

1080
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,500
Oh, by the way,

1081
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,380
why didn't Zhuang Xu show up today?

1082
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,220
He had a dinner thing.

1083
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:10,980
Bad timing, they overlapped.

1084
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,000
The dinner should be over by now, right?

1085
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,240
Let me give him a buzz.

1086
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,600
I am so stuffed.

1087
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,600
What took you so long in the restroom?

1088
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,440
I'm freezing my butt off.

1089
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,220
Yeah.

1090
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,500
What is with this weather?

1091
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,500
I thought I could finally

1092
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,820
put my winter clothes away.

1093
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,240
Then the temperature just plummeted
over the weekend.

1094
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,920
That's a late spring cold snap.

1095
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,300
So

1096
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,840
that's it for today?

1097
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,160
No after-party?

1098
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,460
Hello?

1099
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,480
Zhuang Xu.

1100
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,980
What are you up to?

1101
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,620
You're missing out on the get-together.

1102
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,080
The timing was just off.

1103
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,840
It happens to be my colleague's birthday
today too.

1104
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,660
Well, you must be done eating by now.

1105
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,280
We've finished up here

1106
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,180
and we're planning to hit karaoke.

1107
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,200
You coming?

1108
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,020
I'll pass.

1109
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,200
We're not finished here yet.

1110
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,280
Alright, that's a shame.

1111
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,680
It's rare to get everyone together
like this since graduation.

1112
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,700
You're the only one missing.

1113
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,040
Even Nie Xiguang

1114
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,960
