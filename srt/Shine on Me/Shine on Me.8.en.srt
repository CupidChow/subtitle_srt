194

195

It's safer to keep her here
for observation.

196

with more urgent needs,

197

198
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,440

199

240

this thermos?

241
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,800
I could have just ordered

242

243
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,720
It's not ours.

244
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,359
We only brought some fruit

245

and this congee.

246
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,900
We ran into Mr. Lin downstairs.

247
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,880
He was just standing there,
lost in thought.

248

He asked us to bring this up to you.

250

Xiguang,

252
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,319
you're in a private room.

253
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,580
I don't think basic insurance

254

255

What are you worried about?

256
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,240
Mr. Lin already settled
the bill last night.

257
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,640
But honestly,
it's the least he could do.

258
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,720
If his friend
hadn't been screaming like that,

259
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,800
you wouldn't have been
startled and fallen.

260
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,940
How do you know she was his friend

261
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,320
and not his girlfriend?

262
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,900
You didn't see

263
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,500
how harsh Mr. Lin was with her.

264
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,600
It was actually pretty scary.

265
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,500
The girl was terrified

266
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,260
when Xiguang fell,

267
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,080
but if she were his girlfriend,

268
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,980
he would've comforted her, right?

269
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,540
Instead, he completely ignored her.

270

00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,060
going to say

381
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,340
"I'm afraid of your tears"?

382
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,300
I don't usually cry anyway.

383
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,060
Dr. Lin.

384
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,960
Thought you went home.

385
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,740
What are you doing back here?

386
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,480
No sleep all night

387
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,240
and still going strong?

388
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,520
You're really

389
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,500
the legendary machine

390
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,120
of our med school.

391
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,700
A back-to-back shift

392
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,620
like mine

393
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,620
should've been yours.

394
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,400
Come on,

395
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,940
let me introduce you all,

396
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,000
my junior from both college

397
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,760
and grad school abroad,

398
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,640
Lin Yusen,

399
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,600
Dr. Lin.

400
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,760
I know you, Dr. Lin.

401
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,920
I've read your paper

402
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,200
on brainstem tumors.

403
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,480
Too bad

404
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,240
when I was there

405
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,320
for my fellowship,

406
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,080
I heard you'd already resigned.

407
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,680
So, Dr. Lin, where are you

408
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,440
stationed these days?

409
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,200
I'm actually not a doctor anymore.

410
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,200
What? Why?

411
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,280
Everyone has their own path.

412
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,280
Okay.

413
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,580
We can catch up later.

414
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,280
Nie Xiguang, right?

415
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,360
I'm Dr. Fang,

416
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,720
your attending physician.

417
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,440
Is your head still hurting?

418
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,620
A little bit.

419
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,100
It's like

420
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,760
a throbbing pain.

421
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,920
Where exactly?

422
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,860
That's normal.

423
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,100
After all, you fell
from the second floor.

424
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,020
It's impossible to come away from that

425
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,640
completely unscathed.

426
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,780
It'll take time to recover.

427
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,640
Don't rush it.

428
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,480
Okay.

429
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,880
Judging by your scans,

430
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,160
there's nothing serious.

431
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,280
However,

432
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,200
it's best to stay in the hospital
for observation for a bit longer.

433
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,580
Get some good rest.

434
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,340
I'll come by

435
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,440
another time.

436
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,220
Perfect chance for some alone time,

437
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,280
and you just walked out?

438
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,800
I had no reason to stay.

439
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,120
Are you serious?

440
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,300
You're never gonna
get the girl like that.

441
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,680
Guess I'm gonna

442
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,860
play wingman for you.

443
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,540
By the way,

444
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,920
I actually have a surgery coming up.

445
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,520
It's right up your alley.

446
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,780
Mr. Lin.

447
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,960
You don't have to bring me breakfast.

448
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,520
I actually have something on the way.

449
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,460
It was just an afterthought.

450
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,500
Your attending physician

451
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
is an old classmate of mine.

452
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,740
He has a surgery coming up

453
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,480
and it's right up my alley.

454
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,740
So he asked me

455
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,940
to consult on the surgical plan.

456
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,340
Don't you have to work?

457
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,560
Yesterday, I worked until 3 AM

458
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
and now I'm on my annual leave.

459
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,460
Three point zero
by two point seven centimeters.

460
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,080
It is in a tricky spot.

461
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,540
It's pressing against the brainstem.

462
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,440
Given the size and location,

463
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,320
I'd still recommend a craniotomy.

464
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,220
It offers a better success rate.

465
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,480
The patient

466
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,580
is leaning toward Gamma Knife.

467
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,460
I remember

468
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,500
you have a patient

469
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,020
with a similar tumor profile?

470
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,540
That one was even riskier.

471
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,480
I've seen the charts for that case.

472
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,940
Severe facial nerve

473
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,100
adhesion.

474
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,820
Yet somehow, you saved the hearing.

475
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,740
And no facial paralysis either.

476
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,260
That was incredible work.

477
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,660
There was

478
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,340
minor facial numbness post-op,

479
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,760
but it cleared up

480
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,260
within two weeks.

481
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,520
Dr. Lin, your preservation rate
is insane.

482
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,480
I've only done a few cases.

483
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,140
Not enough for a real statistic.

484
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,540
I'd say luck played a big part.

485
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,300
He really does

486
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,380
love being a doctor.

487
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,380
That's pure skill.

488
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,640
With more surgeries,

489
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,000
that rate

490
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,960
will only go up.

491
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,720
Dr. Qin

492
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,820
is being so clueless.

493
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,780
He knows Lin quit,

494
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,060
but didn't even check why.

495
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,380
How could he say that?

496
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,600
[Just]

497
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,620
"Just?"

498
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,780
Just about time for dinner.

499
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,240
How about we all

500
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:43,960
grab a bite?

501
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,180
We've been slammed

502
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,360
with so many tasks lately.

503
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,740
Dinner time.

504
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,940
Our patient...

505
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,020
Join us too.

506
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,340
Me too?

507
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,140
Yeah.

508
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,100
Since we kind of took over your room,

509
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,820
consider this our payback.

510
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,500
What kind of patient

511
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,060
ends up having every meal

512
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,040
with their doctors?

513
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,500
So, you're saying

514
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,860
every meal you eat

515
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,060
is either brought by Mr. Lin,

516
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,300
or you're eating

517
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,340
with him,

518
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,160
Dr. Fang, and others?

519
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,020
Ms. Chen said

520
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,880
she makes the food for Mr. Lin.

521
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,580
He's here for business anyway,

522
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,400
so he just had Ms. Chen
make an extra portion for me.

523
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,560
Does that

524
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,060
even sound logical to you?

525
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,180
No. That's exactly why

526
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,800
I asked you over.

527
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,500
Xiguang,

528
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,280
don't you think

529
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,720
Mr. Lin

530
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,540
might actually be into you?

531
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,060
Seriously?

532
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,960
Try using your head.

533
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,240
If that were the case,

534
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,600
his emotional wiring

535
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,020
would be completely out of whack.

536
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,300
How does someone flip a switch

537
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,560
from "giving me a hard time"

538
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,440
to "having feelings for me"
just like that?

539
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,740
So,

540
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,660
it must be that he's actually

541
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,260
discussing some complex surgery

542
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
with the other doctors.

543
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,140
Plus, he probably feels

544
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,380
somewhat responsible

545
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,460
for my fall.

546
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,820
Besides, it's not like

547
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,720
he's the one delivering the food.

548
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,860
Ms. Chen brings it over,

549
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,620
and he just goes downstairs

550
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,420
and picks it up,

551
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,940
checks on me for a second,

552
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,460
and leaves right after.

553
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,080
If he stays...

554
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,680
it's only to talk shop

555
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,180
or trade hospital gossip

556
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,720
with the doctors.

557
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,100
In this room?

558
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,340
Can you even understand
what they're saying?

559
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,440
That's why I asked you

560
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
to bring my game console.

561
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,600
Mr. Lin's idea of annual leave

562
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,380
is truly out of this world.

563
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:14,219
Is he some kind of workaholic?

564
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,639
It's one thing to pull crazy overtime

565
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,420
at the office,

566
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,659
but spending his time off in a hospital?

567
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,520
Dr. Fang said

568
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,860
he's always been so hardcore.

569
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,139
Even back in med school,

570
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,060
he was a total machine.

571
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,679
He was even more of it
once he started at the hospital.

572
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,580
He'd spend a dozen-odd hours in surgery

573

and not even break a sweat.

Your attending physician

575
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,880
has shared quite a lot of gossip

576

the way Mr. Lin treats you

594

is a far cry from how he used to.

when I cry?

603
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Or is it more like

604

the "damsel in distress" look?

605
