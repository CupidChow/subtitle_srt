194
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,360
we could consider a capital increase,

195
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,860
which would dilute their shares.

196
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,940
And what about today's deal?

197
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,180
About today,

198
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,600
if your aim

199
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,540
is just to support
the younger generation,

200
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,780
doing a bit of charity.

201
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,180
It's fine.

202
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,500
But from a purely business perspective,

203
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,180
I don't see

204
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,220
anything that benefits Shengyuan.

205
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,420
State your reasons.

206
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,740
Wuxi does have strong potential,

207
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,580
but the market lacks real momentum.

208
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,320
And Wuxi's resettlement housing

209
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,200
is relatively high in quality,

210
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,700
which makes commercial housing

211
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,660
clear its inventory more slowly

212
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
than in other cities.

213
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,400
That's a real disadvantage

214
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,600
for investors trying to recover funds.

215
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,700
Of course,

216
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,520
Shengyuan can still profit from it.

217
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,400
Just as Mr. Sheng Bokai

218
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,180
said before,

219
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,120
real estate

220
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,660
is full of golden opportunities.

221
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,620
But some are big, and some are small.

222
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,140
Whichever one you pick up

223
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,160
comes with a cost.

224
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,660
And the piece Yuancheng tossed out

225
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,800
is just too small.

226
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,860
Yuancheng

227
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,980
isn't short of big opportunities either.

228
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,220
Just last year,

229
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,039
they made a big splash

230
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,039
by securing a plot in Nanjing.

231
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,620
The expected profit

232
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,820
and cash recovery speed

233
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,919
far outstrip this project.

234
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,419
Yet they kept it to themselves.

235
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,100
Working long-term with a partner

236
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,500
that shows so little sincerity

237
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,260
is just a drain on energy

238
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,520
and brand influence,

239
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,520
while only fueling their own growth.

240
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,580
What's with your nephew today?

241
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,560
He usually

242
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,120
keeps a low profile,

243
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,240
but now he's suddenly so sharp.

244
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,100
The Yuancheng project

245
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,320
is pretty much a nonstarter

246
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,160
for our group,

247
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,560
but it doesn't really get

248
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,500
in Mr. Lin's way.

249
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,320
I think there's something off about it.

250
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,580

252
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,340
with Mr. Lin.

253
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,460
I'll give

254
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,220
Nie Chengyuan a call

255
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,400
and find out

256

is enough

260
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560

00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,480
we'll send

383
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,800
the time and location to you shortly

384
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,460
by text message.

385
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,680
Alright, thank you.

386
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,900
So even without my parents' help,

387
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,500
I can land a job

388
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,380
on my own.

389
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,120
Xiguang,

390
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,440
[Siliang]
come over to Ximo Pavilion.

391
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,140
Something's come up.

392
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,620
Boss,

393
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,520
Siliang called you

394
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,440
to Ximo Pavilion too?

395
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,460
Yeah.

396
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,200
You too?

397
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,520
I asked her what it was about,
but she wouldn't say.

398
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,020
Acting all mysterious.

399
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,340
So

400
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,680
I was right.

401
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:41,940
What?

402
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,040
Look at the time.

403
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
It's almost five.

404
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,860
Exactly.

405
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,860
At this hour,
it's gotta be a dinner gathering.

406
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,460
Maybe she's got

407
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,240
an offer

408
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,720
from some big company

409
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,660
and wants to surprise us.

410
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,780
Ximo Pavilion is close to the west gate.

411
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,020
Could she be treating us
to that boiled fish

412
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,000
with pickled mustard greens
by the entrance?

413
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,080
Feng's going to be furious.

414
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,140
She's been in Shanghai the past few days
meeting her advisor,

415
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,500
then went back home for a bit,

416
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,220
and has already missed
several big dinners.

417
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,940
Let's

418
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,740
give her a call tonight

419
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,400
and tell her how delicious it is,

420
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,560
so she can feel included.

421
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,520
It's not like she's not coming back.

422
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,060
Careful. She might kill you
when she came back.

423
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,220
Why'd you call everyone

424
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,260
to meet here?

425
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,360
Really for boiled fish
with pickled mustard greens?

426
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,580
Zhuang Xu, you're here, too.

427
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,980
Where's Xiang Qun?

428
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,000
Why are you all staring at me like that?

429
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:38,900
Nie Xiguang.

430
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,120
What?

431
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,680
You're really asking me that?

432
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,560
This is way too weird.

433
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,960
After what you did,

434
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,740
don't you feel any guilt at all?

435
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,540
What did I do?

436
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,780
Rong,

437
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,360
chill.

438
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,380
We haven't even got the full story yet.

439
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,580
Xiguang,

440
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,560
did you get a call

441
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,980
from Shengyuan

442
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,200
about the interview for Rong

443
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,400
on Monday afternoon?

444
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,940
Of course not.

445
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,280
You still won't admit it?

446
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,140
Nie Xiguang,

447
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,480
I can't believe

448
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,380
you'd do something like this.

449
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,420
Or maybe

450
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,240
she just forgot?

451
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,940
Xigua was still asleep

452
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,360
when we left that day.

453
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,940
Maybe she picked it up

454
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,920
and went straight back to sleep,

455
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,140
and when she woke up,

456
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,100
she just forgot to tell you.

457
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,080
Are you suspecting me

458
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,640
of answering your interview call

459
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,880
and not telling you?

460
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,360
You must be mistaken.

461
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,140
I never received

462
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,400
any interview calls for you.

463
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,480
Why bother denying it?

464
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,740
Too bad your clever schemes backfired.

465
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,960
If it hadn't been for Zhuang Xu

466
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,100
calling his senior

467
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,980
to ask,

468
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,580
you really might have

469
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,500
gotten away with it.

470
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,280
Siliang,

471
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,400
can you walk us

472
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,560
through the whole thing?

473
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,100
Rong never got

474
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,440
the interview call.

475
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,200
So Zhuang Xu asked

476
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,780
his senior

477
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,160
who works in HR at Shengyuan.

478
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,700
She said they sent out

479
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,660
a unified notice

480
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,780
right after work started
on Monday afternoon,

481
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,859
and Rong was on the interview list.

482
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,540
Since her phone was stolen,

483
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,440
the company

484
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,900
could only call our dorm.

485
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,099
That afternoon,

486
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,740
Rong, Fen,

487
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,020
Feng and I

488
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,460
went out together.

489
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,460
You were the only one
sleeping in the dorm.

490
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,839
Boss went out of town for an interview

491
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,460
and came back Tuesday.

492
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,880
I was with Rong and Fen

493
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,100
all afternoon.

494
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,760
Feng went to the train station.

495
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:32,980
So

496
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,400
think carefully.

497
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,620
Did you take the call back then

498
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,760
and just forget?

499
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,860
I'm absolutely certain I didn't.

500
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,960
Actually, not long after you all left,

501
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,020
I went straight to the library.

502
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,940
So I never received

503
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,620
any call at all.

504
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,340
You're really washing your hands of it.

505
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,220
Maybe Shengyuan

506
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,440
never even called.

507
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,920
Or maybe they missed it,

508
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,400
or dialed but no one picked up,

509
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,580
and then forgot

510
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,700
to call again.

511
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,420
I knew you'd say that.

512
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,260
Luckily, his senior

513
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,160
went the extra mile

514
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,700
and asked the person
in charge of notifications.

515
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,360
The staff, afraid of being accused,

516
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,300
pulled up the call records.

517
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,880
It was made at 2:30 PM,

518
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,920
and lasted almost a minute.

519
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,800
He said

520
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,100
the person who answered promised

521
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,320
to pass the message along,

522
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,820
so they didn't

523
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,720
call again.

524
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,640
But who could have imagined

525
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,360
you could be so malicious?

526
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,120
No matter what they say,

527
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,200
the fact is I never got

528
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,160
any calls.

529
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,100
Besides,

530
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,000
why would I do that?

531
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,920
No reason?

532
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,920
Don't you like Zhuang Xu?

533
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,020
Shengyuan is so close to Huaya.

534
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,140
You don't want me and Zhuang Xu

535
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,720
to be together, do you?

536
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,140
That's why you...

537
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,480
Rong.

538
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,700
Maybe it really is
just a misunderstanding.

539
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,200
Anyway, you've got

540
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,400
another interview now.

541
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,040
Let it go.

542
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,920
Don't make everyone

543
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,420
upset.

544
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,280
Yeah.

545
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,000
I feel like something

546
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,240
went wrong in all this.

547
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,560
The matter can be left behind.

548
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,800
But look at her.

549
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,900
Has she shown

550
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,440
even a hint of regret

551
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,640
or the slightest apology?

552
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,980
I just can't swallow it.

553
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,620
Ye Rong,

554
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,240
you're seriously underestimating me.

555
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,240
If I really wanted to stop you

556
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,180
from getting the interview,

557
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,440
do you think Shengyuan

558
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,680
would've called you at all?

559
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,300
Who do you think you are?

560
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,680
Nowadays,

561
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,720
it's all about strength.

562
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,260
Wanna give it a try?

563
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,840
Hello?

564
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,660
Is this Manager Li?

565
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,860
This is Nie Xiguang.

566
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:14,900
Sorry.

567
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,200
Sorry...

568
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,620
We're from...

569
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,760
The number you dialed does not exist.

570
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,520
Please check it and redial.

571
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:20,960
Sorry,

572
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,620

Monday afternoon,

761
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,140
we went out together.

762
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,140
Xiguang was asleep at the time.

763
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,320
You remember that, right?

764
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,920
Yeah.

765
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,660
What's wrong?

766
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,240
That afternoon, around 2 PM,

767
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,320
Shengyuan called Rong,

768
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,960
asking her to come for an interview.

769
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,640
Xiguang picked up the call.

770
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,580
Maybe she forgot

771
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,280
to tell Rong,

772
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,000
almost making her miss something

773
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,880
that could change her life.

774
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

775
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,840
Why blame Xigua?

776
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,080
I was the one who answered that call.

777
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,900
And they said

778
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,300
they'd call Rong again themselves.

779
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,640
They never told me to pass it on.

780
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:48,600
[Feng]

781
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,460
Hello?

782
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,580
Thank you, ma'am,

783
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,660
and thanks to all my classmates

784
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,720
for joining the meal today.

785
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,980
I hope everyone enjoys themselves.

786
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,760
I'll raise my cup of tea

787
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,580
to toast you all.

788
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,440
No,

789
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,240
please,

790
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,080
don't bother standing up.

791
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,040
Let's just keep it casual.

792
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
I invited everyone here

793
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,720
for dinner today

794
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,300
mainly to say thanks for all the care

795
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,460
you've given me these past few years.

796
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,700
You've really made

797
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,800
my college life a happy one.

798
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,700
But there's also something

799
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,760
I want to set straight.

800
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,520
I just want

801
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,720
to make it clear,

802
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,040
so I can finish my college years

803
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,320
feeling happy

804
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,520
and free of regrets.

805
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,060
Recently, you may have heard

806
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,640
my dorm mate, Ye Rong,

807
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,700
missed her interview

808
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,500
with Shanghai Shengyuan
because she lost her phone.

809
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,300
There's been talk

810
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,140
that when Shengyuan called our dorm,

811
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,500
Nie Xiguang

812
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,260
answered,

813
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,320
but didn't pass on the message,

814
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,700
which led to her missing it.

815
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,740
I need to make a correction.

816
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,600
I was the one who answered that call.

817
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,680
It was her?

818
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,060
It was last Monday afternoon.

819
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,040
I went out with Rong, Siliang

820
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,280
and Fen.

821
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,800
They had errands to run,

822
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,840
and I went to Shanghai.

823
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,500
When I got to the train station,

824
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,220
I realized I'd forgotten my ID card,

825
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,740
so I went back to the dorm to get it.

826
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,180
Since I was in a hurry,

827
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,340
I took a taxi.

828
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,840
I kept the receipt

829
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,020
in my wallet.

830
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,920
Shengyuan's call

831
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,860
came at 2:30 PM.

832
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,880
By a little after 2:40 PM,

833
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,940
I got in the taxi at the north gate.

834
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
You can check the timing.

835
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,020
It's true.

836
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,580
If this isn't enough,

837
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,540
I've got more evidence.

838
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,960
The traffic jam made me late.

839
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,240
Here's your gift for making it ashore.

840
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:35,880
Thank you.

841
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,460
That day,

842
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,420
after Fen and Feng left,

843
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,640
I got up soon after

844
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,440
and went to the library.

845
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,740
When I arrived,

846
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,380
I first returned the book I'd borrowed.

847
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,140
So the library

848
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,720
has my return record and timestamp.

849
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,060
I took a photo of it.

850
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,140
The system is right there.

851
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,020
Anyone can check it anytime.

852
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,860
If you still don't believe me,

853
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,640
the dorm office and library

854
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,460
have surveillance footage.

855
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,060
I'm just a student,

856
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,080
so I can't check it myself.

857
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,540
If necessary, we can request it
through the school,

858
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,040
and I'm sure it can be reviewed.

859
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,400
No need.

860
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,360
I trust you.

861
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,800
Now it seems

862
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,920
this was all a misunderstanding.

863
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,300
It wasn't Nie Xiguang

864
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,560
but Feng, who forgot to tell Ye Rong.

865
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,800
This is the second thing

866
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,500
I want to clear up.

867
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,080
I didn't forget.

868
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,960
I remember very clearly

869
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,840
that the staff at Shengyuan told me

870
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,180
they would notify Rong later.

871
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,740
But I don't know why,

872
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,160
when Rong and Zhuang Xu called them,

873
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,440
they suddenly changed their story.

874
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,720
And

875
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,840
I have no way

876
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,500
to prove this part.

877
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,060
I can.

878
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,460
I went to an interview at Shengyuan,

879
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,400
so I have the phone number

880
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,620
of their HR manager.

881
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,640
Of course,

882
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
not the senior

883
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,220
Rong and Zhuang Xu

884
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,660
spoke to on the phone.

885
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,640
I asked the HR manager

886
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,380
to help me investigate.

887
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,160
He was very helpful,

888
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,220
and after looking into it, he told me

889
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,680
that the staff

890
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,920
in charge of interview notices

891
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,800
forgot to notify Ye Rong
the second time.

892
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,160
But when the senior asked about it,

893
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,080
that employee was afraid
of taking responsibility

894
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,940
and lied.

895
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,360
Here is the recording

896
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,200
of my conversation with Mr. Li,

897
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,520
along with the employee's apology.

898
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,880
I recorded it

899
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,780
with their consent.

900
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,020
Xigua,

901
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,100
I'm touched by how much
you've done for me.

902
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,900
You stood up bravely

903
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
for my innocence,

904
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,860
so of course

905
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,940
I'll fight for yours too.

906
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,800
And one more thing,

907
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,600
I want to make it clear.

908
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,179
After all that's happened,

909
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,980
I find Shengyuan completely unreliable,

910
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,159
and utterly undeserving of me.

911
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,239
So I've decided

912
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,659
I won't be joining them.

913
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,680
Xiguang.

914
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:13,960
I'm sorry

915
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,380
for not saying anything that day

916
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,260
to defend you.

917
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,860
I owe you an apology.

918
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,660
Me too, Xiguang.

919
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,740
I really thought you had just forgotten.

920
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,400
It's fine.

921
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,060
My head

922
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,680
was all foggy that day.

923
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,960
Can't blame you for that.

924
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,580
But Boss.

925
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,760
Why did you suddenly...

926
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,860
start clapping during dinner?

927
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,080
It was so awkward.

928
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,340
I almost couldn't breathe.

929
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,720
I have no idea.

930
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,340
You were really...

931
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,020
I don't know how to describe it.

932
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,920
After four years as classmates,

933
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,340
I always thought you were

934
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,220
laid-back, a "go-with-the-flow" type.

935
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,080
Never imagined

936
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,140
you'd be like this.

937
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,840
You were absolutely dazzling, seriously.

938
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,320
You practically stole the whole show!

939
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,420
This really isn't Boss's fault.

940
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,140
I was stunned too.

941
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,660
This just shows

942
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,380
you don't really know me.

943
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,960
In the crunch,

944
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,080
I can

945
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,140
own the spotlight.

946
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,660
[Chang:]
Here they come.

947
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,460
[Heard the drama just flipped around?]
The gossip's already started.

948
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,720
[Nie Xiguang didn't hide

that Xigua was wronged.

959

Well, then the treat wasn't in vain.

960
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,320
Why didn't you let me pay?

961
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,540
Come on.

962
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,420
I got into grad school.

963
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,700
Of course I had to treat.

964
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,400
I just invited a few extra folks

965
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,060
as messengers.

966
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,300
There's no way I'd make you pay.

967
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,740
You've had enough bad luck already.

Of course I did.

976
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,480
I told her

977

that this dinner

978
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,000
was meant to clear up
the misunderstanding.

979
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,280
She chose not to come.

980
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,500
Honestly,

981
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,420

00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,340
But after I explained it

985
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,300
to a few classmates,

986
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,540
within a couple of days,
people started saying

987
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,280
I was brown-nosing Xigua

988
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,280
and taking the blame for her.

989
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,020
I was furious!

990
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:33,760
Isn't that an insult

991
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,740
to my character?

992
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,140
Really?

993
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,460
Seriously, that's ridiculous.

994

Luckily, it's all cleared up now,

995
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,680
otherwise I'd still be stewing over it.

996

Just one month left,

997
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,720
and we'll be graduating.

998
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,420
Pulling something like this
right before graduation

999
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,000
is way too awkward.

1001

1003
