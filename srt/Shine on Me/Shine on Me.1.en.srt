00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,580
and lots of room to grow.

381
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,080
I'd planned on choosing Shanghai
all along.

382
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,760
It's just

383
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,880
the job offers

384
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,440

385

386
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,920
Next week there's a big job fair

387
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,980
at the International Exhibition Center.

388

Are you guys going?

389
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,480
I heard a lot of companies from Shanghai

390
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,060

391
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,220
I'm definitely going.

392
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,180

What about you, Xigua?

394

Xiguang's family is so well-off.

395
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Getting into a company in Shanghai

396
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,700
should be a breeze, right?

397
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,000
Not at all.

398
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,400

400
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,240
Yeah.

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,120
Which company is it?

402
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,080
The CPA firm

403
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,240
I just interned at.

404
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,660
Did your family set it up for you?

405
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,200
Lucky you.

406
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,360
Sometimes I really envy you.

407
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,180
Everything's taken care of

408
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,100

409
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,360
and you don't have to
worry about a thing.

410
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,760
The CPA firm's pretty exhausting, too.

411
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,620
When it gets busy,

412
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,220
overtime can drag on until 3:00 AM.

413
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:05,780
And when you first start out,

414
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,960
the pay isn't even that high.

415
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,619
That's 320 in total.

416

If you're not satisfied,

428
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,300
you could always look for one yourself.

429
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,820
What's the point of being picky on a job

430
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,940

No...

get a job yourself

438
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,440
instead of staying in Wuxi,

439
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,560

440
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,260
Don't you think that's pathetic?

674

Nie Chengyuan is a heartless scumbag.

675
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,100

no household registration,

677
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,060
not even a proper job,

678
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,360
and Qian Fangping dumped him.

679
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,700
Your mom liked how he looked
and what he could do.

680
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,640
She genuinely thought
he was a solid guy.

681
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,740
And look how that turned out.

682
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,400
The moment he tasted success,

683
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,080
he turned his back on your mom.

684
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,460
Qian Fangping's husband

685
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,240
wasn't even cold,

686
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,560
she cried on his shoulder,

687
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,340
faked sick,

688
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,780
and he just lost all sense of decency.

689
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,200
He even took in her daughter,

690
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,040
never thinking it looked bad.

691
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,140
He even put on an act, saying,

692
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,740
"I'm only helping an old friend."

693
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,700

in front of the kids?

695
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:48,760
And

696
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,940

697
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,740

698
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,320
Back then we were broke,

699
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,120
and I had to drop out,

700
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,960

701
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,260
both with degrees.

702
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:01,980
But

703
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,260
why can't I say that?

704
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,280

705
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,620

into the real world.

707
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,300
They deserve the truth.

708
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,760
Treating them like babies

709
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,760
and keeping them in the dark

710
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,400
is what really messes them up.

711
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,580
Makes sense.

712
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,940
You should give them a few pointers.

713
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,460
Well,

714
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,020

719
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,200
you can go back to your room.

720
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,860
First you tell us to eat more,

721
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,420
now you're rushing us out.

722
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,300

723
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,420
Come on, Xiguang, let's go to bed.

724
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,040

Nie Chengyuan

730

is still Xiguang's dad.

731
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:46,980
It'd cut her deep

732
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,140
to hear that.

733
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,700
Besides,

734
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,480
before he got sick,

735
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,560
didn't he hold her

736
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,780

742
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,460

743

and wouldn't crawl back to the dorm
till afternoon.

744
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,560
So, how was Confucius Temple yesterday?

745
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,100
Any fun?

746
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,340
It was okay.

747
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,200
We snacked as we walked,

748
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,080
which just made me feel even fuller.

749
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,660

750
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,400

751
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,520
The print shop
by the north gate is a rip-off.

752
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,880
One résumé cost me

753
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,240
three bowls of beef noodles.

754
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,980
You've already gotten into grad school.

755
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,280
Why bother making a job résumé?

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,660
I can send one in for you.

946
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,560
No need.

947
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,140
She only wants to apply
to companies in Shanghai.

948
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,640
Still won't admit it, huh?

949
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,060
Alright, just give me the résumé.

950
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,700
Mr. Lin.

951
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,040
This is Mr. Lin

952
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,320
from our Business Development team.

953
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,520
Our company takes

954
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,920
grad recruitment really seriously.

955
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,920
Every major city has a manager

956
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,540
on site.

957
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,620
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lin.

958
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,740
Hello.

959
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,840
This isn't

960
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,260
your résumé, is it?

961
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,780
It's my classmate's.

962
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,820
This is my junior
from Jiangning University,

963
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,260
a top student at the Business School.

964
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,680
Too bad Huaya Bank

965
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,920
snatched him up.

966
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,500
He's just putting in a résumé
for his classmate.

967
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,840
Huaya.

968
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,500
Really impressive.

969
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,280
But

970
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,420
why isn't she here?

971
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,160
Too crowded earlier.

972
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,040
She twisted her ankle
and couldn't make it.

973
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,180
Why submit her résumé to Shengyuan?

974
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,660
Because it's close to Huaya?

975
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,780
Of course not.

976
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,740
Shengyuan

977
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,160
is a top-notch company in every way.

978
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,240
Everyone dreams of working there.

979
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,090
[Nie Xiguang]

980
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,100
I'll take her résumé for now.

981
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,840
But whether she gets an interview

982
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,280
isn't really up to me.

983
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,080
I know.

984
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,220
Thanks, Senior.

985
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,620
Boss, how's it going?

986
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,400
Did you finish submitting for Xiguang?

987
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,080
Saw a few companies left,

988
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,780
so I handed in her résumés.

989
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,660
Which ones?

990
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,960
Just some random ones.

991
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,160
Can't remember the names.

992
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,500
Thanks.

993
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,560
Why didn't you say earlier

994
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,100
that you know someone
in Shengyuan's hiring?

995
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,940
You don't need
to pull any strings, do you?

996
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,380
Let's go.

997
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,520
I'm exhausted. Let's head back.

998
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,940
Are Zhuang Xu and Rong

999
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,120
at it again?

1000
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,520
I don't think so.

1001
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,820
Did he just

1002
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,120
deliberately try to piss Rong off?

1003
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:09,760
Really?

1004

1005
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,320
Wait a sec.

1006
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
My phone's gone.

1007
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,120
Did Rong get a new phone?

1008
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,540
Seems her family gave her an earful.

1009
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,940
Come on,

1010
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,620
it's not like she meant to lose it.

1011
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,340
It's been missing for days.

1012
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,000
What if it messes up her interview?

1013
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,720
Don't worry.

1014
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,860
Her résumé lists her email

1015
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,760
and the dorm line.

1016
00:40:59,420 --> 00:40:59,860
Boss.

1017
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,840
When will you ever remember

1018
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,820
to take your phone to bed?

1019
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,680
It's a call from Shanghai.

1020
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,120
Thanks. Boss.

1021
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,320
Hello?

1022
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,700
Okay.

1023
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,280
Just a moment.

1024
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,740
The interview time.

1025
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,240
The location.

1026
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,320
Thanks.

Xigua.

1028
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,000
Did you get the interview notice?

1029
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,640
Which company is it?

1030
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,040
Shengyuan.

1031
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,400
Wow, impressive. It's a big company.

1032
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,860
Isn't this the one

1033
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,900
Zhuang Xu helped you apply to?

1034
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,000
Rong, did you send in your résumé too?

1035
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,720
Big companies get flooded
with applications,

1036
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,140
so they run interviews in batches.

1037
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,740
Maybe since Xiguang's résumé

1038
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,680
was the last in,

1039
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,420
landed on the top of the pile

1040
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,520
and got picked first.

1041
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,900
If you ask me,

1042
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,040
Zhuang Xu deserves some credit too.

1043
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,780
Rong, don't worry.

1044
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,280
The notice will come any minute.

1045
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,540
Yes.

1046
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,620
That's the point.

1047
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,860
Rong, you've got more certificates

1048
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,060
than Xigua by far.

1049
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,700
You'll definitely get an interview too.

1050
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,060
You...

1051
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,600
Skipping the nine-to-five

1052
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,420
and staying in school a few more years
was the right call.

1053
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,100
Your EQ is beyond saving.

what you said is true,

1063
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,680
it seriously pissed me off.

1064
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,940

1065
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,360
