I'm off to the kindergarten.

212
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,040
So your daughter

213
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,400

214

Are we going to

273

pick up Mommy?

274
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:25,401
Yes, Xingheng.

Okay.

Let's go.

283
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,661
Dad, I won't eat.

284
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,401
I want to see Mom sooner.

285
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,800
She is still on the plane.

286
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,221
I can't really make

287
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,320
the plane fly faster.

288
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:46,881
Plus, if she

finds out that

290
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:48,340
we don't eat,

291
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,260
I'll lose points.

292
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:50,921
Thanks to you,

293
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:51,941
I have very few

294
00:17:51,941 --> 00:17:52,461
points left.

295
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,280
I never told on you.

296
00:17:58,496 --> 00:17:59,800
(Sunshine Kindergarten)
Two days ago, you told Mommy

297
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,800
that I didn't

298
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,641
braid your hair.

299
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:02,860
I lost five points.

300
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,201
This morning, you told Mommy

301
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:07,921
I watched the rocket launch
instead of watching cartoons with you.

302
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,060
I lost another five points.

303
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:10,901
Daddy's points are all gone.

304
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:11,481
Xingheng.

305
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,080
Mom is strict.

306
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,120
My teacher only deducts
one point each time.

307
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:19,560
So we need to behave

308
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,860
and eat, okay?

309
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,141
Okay.

310
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,860
I will tell Mommy

311
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:26,221
that you're the best

312
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,520
and ask for your points back.

313
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,201
Thank you.

314
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,100
Let me check again.

315
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,741
Now Mommy won't

316
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:48,201
find anything to criticize.

317
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,481

00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:38,600
don't go back with Mommy and Daddy.

353
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:40,780
Stay with Auntie
in Shanghai for a few days.

354
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,760
Did you bring chocolate?

355
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,280
Of course, I did.

356
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,320

357

358
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,780
I'll finish what Mommy brought first,

359

In current clinical trials,

378
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,681
higher-density electrodes

379
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,860
already help the blind

380
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:25,260
perceive the three primary colors.

381
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,461
Not only us,

382
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:28,360
but many other research teams

383
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,401
are working on it.

384
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,540
That's great.

385
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,421
I'm grateful to be born in this era.

386
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,221
And I need to

387
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:36,241
report something.

388
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,040
While in Saudi Arabia,

389
00:21:38,221 --> 00:21:39,320
your wife kept searching

390
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,421
for your news,

391
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:42,040
replaying each piece

392
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,300
on loop.

393
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,221
Got a problem?

394
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,780
I was keeping up with cutting-edge tech.

395
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:49,856
What a coincidence.

396
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,481
I also played the news about

397
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,280
you guys'

398
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,241
BIPV project

399
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,921
in the Middle East on loop.

400
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:00,141
You can drop the "you guys" part.

401
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,540
I know it wasn't about me.

402
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,981
I knew you'd

403
00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:09,620
come to pick up Xiguang.

404
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:11,001
I also called someone

405
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:12,120
to pick me up.

406
00:22:12,421 --> 00:22:13,580
Where is he?

407
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,280
Sheng Xingle.

408
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:22,580
I am back.

409
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,600
Where are you?

410
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,568
Mommy will cook for you.

411
00:22:25,568 --> 00:22:27,120
- What?
- You can't find fault, huh?

412
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:28,421
Ten more minutes?

413
00:22:29,152 --> 00:22:30,560
You're done for, Sheng Xingle.

414
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:31,820
Your esports team

415
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:33,141
won't get another penny

416
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:34,780
from me this year.

417
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:39,901
Once Xingle is here,

418
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,080
let's have dinner.

419
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:42,100
Forget it.

420
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:44,181
You're going back to Suzhou.

421
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,020
Besides, absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

422
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,941
I don't want to be a third wheel.

423
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:51,421
Where is your car?

424
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,360
At P2.

425
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:54,721
Different floor.

426
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,441
Here's your baby.

427
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,941
Daddy braided your hair?

428
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:03,901
What is it?

429
00:23:06,912 --> 00:23:08,100
Xingheng.

430
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:09,681
Take one for now.

431
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,320
I'll give you the other one

432
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,719
when you come to my house.

433
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:16,064
Say thank you.

434
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,344
Thank you, Auntie.

435
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,392
You're welcome.

436
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
Take care.

437
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,380
The company car is here.

438
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,920
Take the company car back.

439
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,900
Got it, Boss. Don't worry.

440
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:31,940
We know the way.

441
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,680
It's been a long trip.

442
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:34,680
Stay home

443
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,880
for the next few days.

444
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:36,920
Come back on Monday.

445
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:37,839
Paid holiday.

446
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:39,700
You're the best.

447
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,220
Let's go.

448
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,839
Stop being a third wheel.

449
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,799
- Here.
- Thanks.

450
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,480
We're off now.

451
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:47,420
Take care.

452
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,539
Okay, let's go.

453
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,940
Let's go home.

454
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:51,807
Let's go.

455
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,400
Off we go.

456
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,799
You used

457
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,579
four hair clips?

458
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,259
What's wrong?

459
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,480
You should use six.

460
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,720
The more, the better?

461
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,900
Points for you.

462
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,871
Okay.

463
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,640
Off we go.

464
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,400
I saw her before boarding.

465
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,519
Right in front of us.

466
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,099
I thought you'd

467
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:21,900
say hello.

468
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:24,980
No need.

469
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,759
I remember years ago,

470
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,539
when you, Kevin, and I

471
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,180
left Hua Ya to start our own venture.

472
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,420
After securing

473
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,099
our first FOF,

474
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,940
we celebrated.

475
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,279
And you got drunk

476
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:42,480
and told me your story with her.

477
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,519
Just that once.

478
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,319
But I remember it clearly.

479
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,259
You said you wanted

480
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:50,799
to tell her you were sorry.

481
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:53,940
Not disturbing her

482
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,440
is the best apology now.

483
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:00,119
Success forgives the intrusion.

484
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,591
Chris,

485
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,500
she's not like that.

486
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:09,559
This is human nature.

487
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,220
She can be an exception.

488
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,259
You struggled

489
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:15,299
the whole trip?

490
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,059
No.

491
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,119
I actually slept

492
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:23,740
on the plane.

493
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,579
Soundly.

494
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,339
I dreamed about the past.

495
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,259
But seriously,

496
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,579
you haven't seen her

497
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,920
all these years?

498
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:41,920
That's weird.

499
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,339
Didn't you alumni get married?

500
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:44,859
You didn't run into her?

501
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,140
Maybe

502
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,039
it's taken back.

503
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,059
What do you mean?

504
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,920
Why didn't you wait for me?

505
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,200
My suitcase

506
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,259
came out just now.

507
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:02,539
What's wrong?

508
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:04,160
Oh.

509
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:05,839
Isn't he

510
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,119
my never-met

511
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,880
life-saver?

512
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,839
You still remember him after a decade.

513
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:11,960
Come on.

514
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,460
He didn't

515
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,859
let me thank him in person,

516
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,160
but at least

517
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,079
I remember his name.

518
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,380
Besides,

519
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,700
he's now China's

520
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,759
preeminent figure

521
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,144
in brain-computer interface

522
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,900
and brain science research.

523
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:25,740
I work in investment.

524
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,079
Of course,

525
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:29,059
I would know him.

526
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,240
My life-saver

527
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,960
truly stands tall.

528
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:35,059
Impressive.

529
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,079
Is that his wife?

530
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:42,539
Why does it look

531
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,859
a bit familiar?

532
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:48,359
But I can't recall.

533
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,460
Because you had amnesia.

534
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:52,063
Let's go.

535
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,240
I lost my memory at Changbai Mountains.

536
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,279
That was a decade ago.

537
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:02,299
How did I know her?

538
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,299
You did see her there.

539
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,619
Seriously?

540
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,480
I remember now.

541
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,039
She's the head of Guang Yu.

542
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,619
That explains it.

543
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,779
She's married to Dr. Lin?

544
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:18,160
How did that happen?

545
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,740
They kept it a secret.

546
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:20,880
No one knows

547
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,519
they're married.

548
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:23,400
They're impressive.

549
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
When I first met her

550
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,220
at Changbai Mountains,

551
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:26,859
I only

552
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,339
found her pretty.

553
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
But now,

554
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,539
she's become

555
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:32,720
a big name in new energy.

556
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:33,343
Chris,

557
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,019
you're amazing too.

558
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,119
Of course.

559
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,680
I'm a partner at Sequence Quant,

560
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:38,440
after all.

561
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,539
Alright,

562
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:40,579
excellent Ms. Chris,

563
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,619
what's for dinner?

564
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,920
I'm dying for Chinese food.

565
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,619
You guys go ahead.

566
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,539
I need to comfort

567
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:49,359
my poor boyfriend

568
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,420
who got stood up

569
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,299
twice.

570
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:54,339
Traitor.

571
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:16,832

♪You're not coming back♪

578
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,799
Three pieces a day.

579
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,160
You can only have one a day
if you eat it daily.

580
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,359
And brush your teeth.

581
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,240
But Mom bought so much.

582
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,460
It'll go bad if I eat too slowly.

583
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:03,779
I promise it won't go bad.

584
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:05,184
Or I'll pay for it.

585
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,359
Mommy.

586
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,119
Even though I bought it,

587
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,240
I'm only responsible for buying it.

588
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,460
Daddy distributes it.

589
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,660
And you eat it.

590
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,119
Our roles are clear, right?

591
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,000
One piece a day is too little.

592
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,119
I can't even taste the flavor.

593
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:27,743
Sweetie.

594
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,779
Well...

595
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,200
Mommy needs to brush her teeth

596
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,400
and put on a face mask.

597
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,660
So, discuss it with Dad.

598
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:36,460
Dad,

599
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,619
I want three pieces.

600
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:41,740
That is too much.

601
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,259
Your teeth will go bad.

602
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,140
I won't be friends with you.

603
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,000
Then,

604
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,039
how about two pieces per day?

605
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,819
- Okay.
- We...

606
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:50,359
Okay.

607
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,940
Pinky promise then.

608
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,319
Okay, sealed.

609
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,099
Okay, it's settled then.

610
00:29:58,859 --> 00:29:59,359
Sleep.

611
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:00,607
Come on.

612
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,980
She's asleep?

613
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:45,940
Yeah.

614
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:48,359
We bargained for ages

615
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:49,900
and agreed on two pieces a day.

616
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,160
She agreed to sleep.

617
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,140
You sure ran off quickly,

618
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,980
leaving me to deal with her.

619
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,819
I'm too soft-hearted.

620
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,200
An important task like

621
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,019
distributing snacks

622
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,279
shall be entrusted

623
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:03,839
to the nutrition expert,

624
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,700
Dr. Lin.

625
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:09,559
A kiss as a reward.

626
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:12,920
Is the reward

627
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,980
just symbolic?

628
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,420
I'll take her to her room.

Tired?

640
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,740
Just a little.

641
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,539
But I slept a bit

642
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,480
on the plane.

643
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,359
And now,

644
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,440
I'm a bit too awake.

645
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,579
So...

646
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,640
So...

647
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,980
I think I can

648
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,980

657

You've realized that vision.

658
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,740

Swordfish wontons.

665
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,920
Your mom had someone

666
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,099
deliver

667
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:23,119
some wontons yesterday.

668
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,139
Mom is busier

669
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,880
than any of us now.

670
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,500
She's always traveling all over,

671
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:29,300
never around.

672
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,760
I remember that

673
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,119
you encouraged her

674
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,380
to go around in her sixties.

675
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:37,980
Because she's much happier

676
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,559
when she's busy.

677
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,159
She does look

678
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,880
more energetic.

679
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:44,863
I'll cook them.

680
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,599
Okay.

681
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,780
In a few minutes,

682
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,900
Xingheng will wake up too.

683
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:01,340
Did you say something

684
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:03,340
before bed last night?

685
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:06,579
Something about realizing a vision?

686
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:07,699
Yeah.

687
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,039
Congratulations

688
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,659
on selling your products

689
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,420
to the Middle East

690
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,440
and building BIPV power systems

691
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:16,239
in the deserts of the Oil Kingdom.

692
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,800
(What else did I say?)

693
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,039
You also said

694
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,599
that you'd sell the products

695
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:24,760
to the Middle East

696
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,420
and build massive BIPV power systems

697
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:29,400
in the deserts of the Oil Kingdom.

698
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,920
All "Made in China".

699
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,039
When did I

700
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,059
say those things?

701
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:36,340
You said in a previous meeting

702
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,360
not to limit our focus
to the markets of Europe and America,

703
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,380
but also pay attention

704
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,179
to Asian,

705
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:43,099
Latin American, and African countries.

706
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,480
So I thought about it.

707
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,199
As you always talk
about the Northwest strategy,

708
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,400
the Middle East is also full of deserts

709
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,559
with intense sunlight,
perfect for such projects.

710
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,699
I found a pattern

711
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:55,039
and generalized.

712
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:55,800
I attributed

713
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,960
such wise words

714
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,820
to you.

715
00:35:58,019 --> 00:35:59,079
Aren't you pleased?

716
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,099
You still remember that nonsense

717
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:05,980
so long ago?

718
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,599
Of course, I remember what my wife says.

719
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,880
What if you quiz me?

720
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,360
Don't talk nonsense.

721
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,719
Have I ever quizzed you?

722
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,940
You made it.

723
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,659
So it wasn't nonsense.

724
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:23,579
Young Miss Nie

725
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,139
was ambitious

726
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,159
and insightful.

727
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,059
And you too.

728
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,360
You made it, Dr. Lin.

729
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,179
(Medical education)

730
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,360
reaches far beyond the clinic

731
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,880
and the operating room.

732
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:45,239
I can do many things.

733
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,500
There is always

734
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,260
a different path.

735
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,380
There are things to do.

736
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,519
My hand is ruined.

737
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,059
Without it,

738
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,059
I am useless?

739
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:02,460
My knowledge

740
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,400
is the most valuable.

741
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:11,800
Mom, Dad, good morning.

742
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,159
Is there anything to eat? I'm hungry.

743
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,679
You got up by yourself.

744
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,000
You're amazing.

745
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,019
Look.

746
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,920
Daddy is making wontons.

747
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,619
The ones that Grandma sent.

748
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,559
Almost ready.

749
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,460
I want the kind Great-Grandma makes.

750
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,980
With fried eggs in the soup.

751
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,460
Okay, Mommy will make eggs.

752
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,159
Go to Daddy.

753
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,215
Come on.

754
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:36,019
How many do you want?

755
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:36,703
One?

756
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,739
One and a half.

757
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:38,847
Okay.

758
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:39,880
How many for you?

759
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,179
Two.

760
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,739
Then I'll have one and a half too.

761
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,179
Xingheng.

762
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,440
What does that add up to?

763
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:50,639
Five.

764
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,260
You are so smart.

765
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:54,800
So clever.

766
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:56,991
Come on.

767
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,000
Daddy, your name has

768
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,619
five "woods" in it.

769
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,280
You even figured that out?

770
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,400
It does have a lot of "woods".

771
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,579
She's improved so much.

772
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:07,280
She can

773
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,360
write all our names

774
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,280
very beautifully.

775
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,360
Really?

776
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,960
Mommy's name is really hard to write.

777
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:14,659
Really, I can write it.

778
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,440
Let me show you.

779
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:17,400
Okay.

780
00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:52,096
(Nie Xiguang, Lin Yusen)

781
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,335
Yusen,

782
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,639
do you remember

783
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,219
that when we

784
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,000
first started dating,

785
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,960
you sent me a WeChat message,

786
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,900
saying your name lacked sunlight

787
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,016
with too much "wood"

788
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:23,900
and asked me to bring you light?

789
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,199
Did I?

790
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:32,119
Yes, you did.

791
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:33,760
Don't play dumb.

792
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,780
