193
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,480
What happened?

194
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,100
Yusen ran into a patient

195
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,280
with a head injury.

196
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,140
He couldn't just leave it,
so he's taking him to the hospital.

197
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,660
Even though

198
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,000
he can't operate anymore,

199
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,020
he still has the heart of a healer.

200
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,520
Isn't that

201
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,820
what makes it all the more painful?

202
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,840

205
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,020
I came across a skier

206
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,180
with a head injury.

207
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,240
Possible intracranial bleed.

what's your name?

211
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,040
It's Lin.

212
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,720
I've only been transferred here
for a month.

213
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,620
It's Chinese New Year,

214
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,020
and I'm the only one on call
for the ambulance.

215
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,620
Never thought I'd run into
something this serious.

216
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,360
It's a good thing

217
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,100
we have a pro like you here.

218
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,620
The ski patrol said

219
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,900
you're a neurosurgeon?

220
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,660
I am.

221
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,240
So, where do you practice?

222
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,600
Shanghai.

223
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,300
I was at Songshan before.

224
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,100
No kidding! That's impressive.

225
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,520
This is great news.

226
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,160
Our hospital only just opened
its neurosurgery department

227
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,080
last year.

228
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,920
Having you here
really puts my mind at ease.

229
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,280
I've been away from the hospital

230
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,940

231
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,160
I'm not sure how much help I'll be.

232
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,260
No way.

233
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,280
Why is that?

234
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,660
Neurosurgery

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,440

236
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,500
of the surgical world.

237

238
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,620

Sorry. Force of habit.

266
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,480
We'll know more

267
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,260
once the CT scan results

No, just stepping out for some air.

Hello, Dr. Lin.

My name is Lei Wei.

296
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,460
I'm a straight shooter,

297
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,320
so I'll get to the point.

298
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,420
Dr. Liu from the ski resort said

299
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,620
you were a neurosurgeon

300
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,600
at Songshan Hospital.

301
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,440
Two years ago,

302
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,400
I did a fellowship

303
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,400
at Songshan for over a year.

304
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,540
How come I never ran into you?

305
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,700
When exactly were you there?

306
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,600
May before last.

307
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,940
I'd already resigned

308
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,560
due to a hand injury that April.

309
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
A hand injury?

310
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,860
Now that you mention it,

311
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,040
that rings a bell.

312
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,300
Please, Dr. Lin, have a seat.

313
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,160
Mr. Liao used to talk

314
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,300
about a surgeon

315
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,760
in neurosurgery

316
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,100
who was incredibly gifted

317
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,080
and had performed

318
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,820
dozens of solo surgeries
at such a young age.

319
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,120
He was poised to become a giant
in the field,

320
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,020
only to have his hands ruined

321
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,860
in a car accident.

322
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,220
Was that you?

323
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,780
Mr. Liao Pingfeng?

324
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,320
I believe he was talking about me.

325
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,720
What a crying shame.

326
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,900
You mean that Mr. Lin
we met back at Shengyuan?

327
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,300
What made you bring him up
all of a sudden?

328
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,360
He was shipped off

329
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,940
to Suzhou Shuangyuan Photovoltaics.

330
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,900
The one you did that research on.

331
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,580
I'm guessing he got pushed out
at Shengyuan.

332
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,600
Word is, he used to be

333
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,400
a very promising neurosurgeon.

334
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,260
What a waste.

335
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,460
Being a doctor is such a sweet gig.

336
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,280
It's thanks to you

337
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,380
that we got the patient here in time.

338
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,320
Once the CT results

339
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,140
are in,

340
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,340
if he's stable enough,

341
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,760
we plan to transfer him

342
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,980
to the municipal hospital.

343
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,000
They have

344
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,380
more expertise over there.

345
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,460
After all, we're just

346
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,220
a county hospital.

347
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,920
We're near the ski resort,

348
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,420
so our orthopedics department
is actually quite strong.

349
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,620
Our neurosurgery department

350
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,140
is only equipped

351
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,280
for emergencies.

352
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,200
That's the right call.

353
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,540
Whatever's best for the patient.

354
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,640
A few years back,

355
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,100
we had

356
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,980
an accident here.

357
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,060
A car wreck.

358
00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,980
A severe head trauma.

359
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,580
When they reached
the municipal hospital,

360
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,320
it was too late.

361
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,600
I thought to myself,

362
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,020
if only we had neurosurgery here,

363
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,900
even for basic emergency procedures,

364
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,960
maybe that patient

365
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,780
would have survived.

366
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,040
That's the reason

367
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,780
I went to Songshan for a fellowship

368
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,020
for over a year.

369
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,140
I'm getting on in years.

370
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,300
Dr. Lin,

371
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,260
do you think I'm overreaching?

372
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,200
Of course not.

373
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,260
Medicine is a field

374
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,120
that requires

375
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,480
constant mastery.

376
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,480
Hello?

377
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,680
Mr. Lei,

378
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,280
Medical Affairs has contacted
the municipal hospital.

379
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,460
They said there was

380
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:34,900
a massive pile-up downtown

381
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,240

Oh no.

385
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,100
It's not that we can't do
the surgery here.

386
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,620
I...

387
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,340
I'm just worried our lack of experience

388
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,280
might compromise
the patient's prognosis.

389
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,540
Mr. Lei,

390
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,180
the CT results

391
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,680
are in.

392
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,060
Dr. Lin, please take a look as well.

393
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,920
It doesn't matter whether they can

394
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,700
take him anymore.

395
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,620
The hemorrhage is over 70cc.

396
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,520
There's no time for a transfer.

397
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,440
Surgery is mandatory.

398
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,180
Yes.

399
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,119
We're backed into a corner.

400
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,720
Without immediate surgery,

401
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,500
even if he pulls through,

402
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,680
the long-term outlook is grim.

403
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,040
Is the family here?

404
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,300
I'm his colleague.

405
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,319
I can't reach his family

406
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,260
at the moment.

407
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,200
Then have Medical Affairs sign off

408
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,099

409
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,819
Everyone, get ready, now.

410
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,720
A hematoma evacuation
is a routine procedure.

411
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Mr. Lei, don't be too worried.

412
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:27,579
I know.

413
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,860
During my fellowship at Songshan,

414
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,920
I performed a few myself,

415
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,800
and they went well.

416
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,920
But that environment

417
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,180
makes you feel secure.

418
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,260
Performing it on my own turf

419
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,740
just makes me extra on edge.

420
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,700
Mr. Lei,

421
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,120
the Director said he couldn't reach you.

422
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,700
He'll be joining you

423
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,400
for the surgery shortly.

424
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,460
Alright.

425
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,320
Dr. Lin,

426
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,660
I have a huge favor to ask.

427
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,960
Go ahead.

428
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,400
I'd like you to stay and provide backup.

429
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,420
I will do everything I can

430
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,360
to save him.

431
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,120
But if anything unexpected

432
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,280
happens during the procedure,

433
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,560
I'd like to rely on your expertise

434
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,360
for guidance.

435
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,340
This might involve

436
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,760
some personal risk for you.

Sharp dissection required throughout.

of the tentorial resection

569
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,380
and only caught a glimpse.

570
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,220
The patient had a suspected brain bleed,

571
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,260
so he wasn't treated here.

572
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,480
Yeah, they called 120
up on the mountain.

573
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,600
An ambulance took him

574
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,560
straight to the county hospital.

575
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,080
Did he leave any information?

576
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,400
It was critical.

577
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,500
Our staff

578
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,480
accompanied him to the hospital.

579
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,740
So we don't have any records.

580
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,340
Are you a relative?

581
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,440
I can't reach my friend,

582
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,340
so I came to check.

583
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,160
What did the injured person look like?

584
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,560
He was quite tall,

585
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,020
wearing a black ski suit.

586
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Like I said, I only caught a glimpse

587
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,680
before I had to
attend to other patients.

588
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,800
Their skis are still here, though.

589
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,840
Wait, which hospital

590
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,740
was he taken to?

591
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,120
Tianchi County People's Hospital.

592
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,620
Maybe it wasn't Lin who got hurt.

593
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,080
There were

594
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,080
so many pairs of skis over there.

595
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,800
He might've dropped

596
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,720
his phone somewhere,

597
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,040
and that's why
we can't get ahold of him.

598
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:03,880
Right.

599
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,840
I'll call my mom.

600

603
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,800
Could you give her

604
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,740

605
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,820

Don't worry.

608
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm sure Lin is fine.

609

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,280
someone got hurt on the black runs

661
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,100
and was brought here.

662
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,560
And we just couldn't get through to you.

663

Wait, why are you in scrubs?

that's the silver lining in all of this.

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,140
and feared the worst for him,

756
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,400
so he accompanied them to the hospital.

757
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,860
I see.

758
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,020
Mom.

759
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,080
Do you know exactly when Ms. Sheng

760
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,360
found out about this?

761
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,480
I didn't ask.

762
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,760
But

763
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,540
she said she's been

764
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,040
at the hot springs
getting a massage all afternoon,

765
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,660
which is why she missed my calls.

766
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,160
Then she must have known

767
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,960
before she went to the spa.

768
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,320
Is something wrong?

769
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,080
Nothing.

770
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,380
Jiang Rui and I

771
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,420
will be back a bit later.

772
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,940
Let's go wait outside.

773
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,239
They went outside to wait for you.

774
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,460
Okay. Thanks.

775
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,040
Dr. Lin.

776
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,120
Dr. Lin, wait.

777
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,699
I've got

778
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,600
Mr. Liao on the line.

779
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,040
Why don't you say a few words to him?

780
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:41,980
Okay.

781
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,520
Here.

782
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:49,719
Mr. Liao.

783
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:50,920
This wasn't

784
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,780
how I expected to hear from you.

785
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:54,960
Yusen,

786
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,480
my offer is still on the table.

787
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,680
I believe

788
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,760
it's what your teacher
would have wanted.

789
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,420
Are you sure you won't reconsider?

790
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,840
Look,

791
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,960
there's still so much you can offer.

792
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,920
Just because you can no longer operate

793
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,540
doesn't mean
you have to leave the hospital.

794
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,400
You still have the experience

795
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,500
and knowledge.

796
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,420
You can't let

797
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,980
all those years of training go to waste.

798
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,820
If I can't perform surgery,

799
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,240
then I'm

800
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,600
just replaceable.

801
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,280
[Tianchi County People's Hospital]

802
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,040
Lin, finally, you're out.

803
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,860
I don't know why, but Xiguang

804
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,840
insisted on waiting out
here in the cold.

805
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,160
Let's find somewhere

806
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,720
to eat.

807
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,520
I'm starving.

808
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,640
I'm craving the snow hut hot pot.

809
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:20,920
Okay.

810
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,880
There's a hot pot place
right across the street.

811
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,240
Let's head over and talk there.

812
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,300
Fine by me. As long as it's warm.

813
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,880
Wait a second.

814
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,020
I have something to ask you.

815
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,820
It took Jiang Rui and me
about 50 minutes

816
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,720
to get here by cab.

817
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,400
An ambulance would be faster.

818
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,620
Let's say 30 minutes, tops.

819
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,020
That means in all that time,

820
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,080
even while you were helping the patient,

821
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,840
you still had a moment

822
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,780
to leave me a message on WeChat,

823
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,980
didn't you?

824
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,240
Then why couldn't you

825
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,960
send me

826
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,860
a quick text?

827
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Even if my phone was off,

828
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:56,940
I would've seen it

829
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,080
the moment I turned it back on.

830
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,180
I'm sorry.

831
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,380
I've been running around looking for you

832
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,340
like a complete idiot.

833
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,520
I didn't think
you'd come looking for me.

834
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,660
Why wouldn't you?

835
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,600
What's the point of an apology?

836
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,360
When it really mattered,

837
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,680
I didn't even cross your mind.

838
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,700
And you claim to like me?

839
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,200
I don't think

840
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,120
you like me at all.

841
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,380
You knew I'd be worried,

842
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,540
and yet you didn't even bother to text.

843
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:19,860
No, wait.

844
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,600
You didn't even think
I'd be worried about you.

845
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,600
Lin, you're dead meat.

846
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,740
It's my first time seeing Xiguang

847
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,440
this angry.

848
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,280
This time, I'm telling the truth.
