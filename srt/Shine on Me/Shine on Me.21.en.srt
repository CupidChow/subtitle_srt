Xiguang is so hopeless.

190
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,540
But

191
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,040
you were definitely a bit much today,

192
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
and there are things
you could've done better.

193
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,840
I'm adding it all to your tab.

194
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,700
I'll do my best

195
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,000
to make sure this is the last time
I end up on it.

196
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,220
"Do your best"?

197
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,660
I promise.

198
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,640
That's more like it.

199
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,780
But there's one thing on your tab

200
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,760
we can settle right now.

201
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,040
What's that?

202
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,020
Wait a sec.

203
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,840
Jiang Rui,

204
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,820
come on down!
Let's go grab some hot pot.

205
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,340
Is there even a restaurant open now?

206
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,100
Yeah,

207
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,540
I called ahead to check.

208
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,220
Alright, I'll be down in a sec.

209
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,260
I guess I'm just as hopeless.

210
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,860
You're back.

211
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,200
How's the patient?

212
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,580
Is everything okay?

213
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,800
Earlier, Xiguang's mom called and...

214
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,040
What's wrong?

215
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,400
Mom,

216
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,200
something bad

217
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,520
happened to me a while back.

218
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,660
What happened?

219
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,720
You can tell me.

220
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,000
Later on,

221
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,920
I convinced myself to let it go.

222
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,560
And I thought I had.

223
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,099
But these past few months,

224
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,099
I've felt so conflicted.

225
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,520
I kept telling myself to move on

226
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,200
and just follow my instincts,

227
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,460
to let her in,

228
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,339
to get closer to her.

229
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,620
But every now and then,

230
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,580
in the middle of the night,

231
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,140
I'd start questioning myself:

232
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,840
"How can you forget that so easily?"

233
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,800
But today,

234
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,840
everything changed.

235
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,900
Lin Yusen!

236
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,720
I don't think

237
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,920
I'll ever have to suffer
through that again.

238
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,540
I finally feel whole.

239
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,920
I'm not quite sure

240
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,800
what you're talking about,

241
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,040
but I'm happy for you.

242
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,540
And I think there might have been
some misunderstandings.

243
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,160
When our friends

244
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,040
were playing messenger for us,

245
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,160
maybe things
didn't get passed along quite right.

246
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,060
I was avoiding it before,

247
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,240
so I never asked.

248
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,200
But I think

249
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:40,940
I need to find out

250
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,780
exactly what happened.

251
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,060
Vincent.

252
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,260
I didn't expect you to...

253
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,740
Happy...

254
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,460
Chinese New Year.

255
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,380
Jiaqi,

256
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,420
where are you right now?

257
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,260
Is it a good time to talk?

258
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,140
Yeah...

259
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm abroad with some friends.

260
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,260
We're out at sea.

261
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,740
Forget it.

262
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,340
Just let me know when you're back.

263
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,180
I'll swing by and see you.

264
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,380
I have something to ask you.

265
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,560
Urgent?

266
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,040
Important?

267
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,220
It's okay.

268
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,320
It's not that pressing.

269
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,840
And it's not that big of a deal anymore.

270
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,340
We were supposed to be having
a great time on this trip.

271
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,340
I never imagined
things would end up like this.

272
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,520
Kevin is in the ICU now,

273
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,940
and there's nothing we can do.

274
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,180
HR said

275
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,960
they'll go into the office tomorrow
to pull his files

276
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,280
and get in touch with his parents.

277
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,100
I have Kevin's phone with me.

278
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,340
If his parents call,

279
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,680
I can pick up and let them know.

280
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,900
But

281
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,760
I remember them
being out of the country.

282
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,320
I doubt they'll be able

283
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,200
to make it back anytime soon.

284
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,340
You guys should head back

285
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:20,940
to Shanghai tomorrow as planned.

286
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,240
There's no point in everyone

287
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,800
staying here.

288
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,540
I'll stay behind to look after him.

289
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,040
You're staying here alone?

290
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,320
Yeah.

291
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,540
I've already cleared it

292
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,700
with my family and Mr. Song.

293
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,500
I'll wait until Kevin's parents arrive.

294
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,140
Plus, I can help

295
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,860
with the legwork

296
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,300
for his transfer back to Shanghai.

297
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,800
Are you sure?

298
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,400
It doesn't feel right for us
to just leave.

299
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,040
Kevin is in the ICU,

300
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,300
so there's no point in us staying here.

301
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,460
Plus, the company needs

302
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,140
someone back at the office.

303
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,620
I've got experience

304
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,660
looking after patients.

305
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,140
This trip to Changbai Mountain

306
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,920
was my idea anyway,

307
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,280
so it's only right that I do a bit more.

308
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,220
It's settled then.

309
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,760
You guys head back to Shanghai tomorrow,

310
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,440
and I'll pack my things
and move into the town.

311
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,140
Let's finish up and get back.

312
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,700
Can you take Kevin's suitcase back

313
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,600
with you tomorrow?

314
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,220
I'll take these to the hospital.

315
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,080
I'm going to go back now

316
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,680
and pack my own things.

317
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,940
Dang it, Mia.

318
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,360
I think I'm really falling for him.

319
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
Please,
like it wasn't incredibly obvious?

320
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,160
No, this is different.

321
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,160
Before today,

322
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,960
it was just about his looks

323
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,560
and how capable he is.

324
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,820
But now,

325
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,080
I've seen

326
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,940
he's genuinely kind,

327
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,280
and he actually steps up.

328
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,560
I know in this day and age,

329
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,380
calling someone "kind" sounds
a little cheesy.

330
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,640
But I still feel like

331
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,760
it's the rarest thing
you can find in a person.

She's got her boyfriend with her.

And he's hot.

But

343
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
I don't think they look like a couple.

344
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,200
Look at other couples.

345
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,440
They're all hand-in-hand,

346
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,940
like they're literally attached

00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,460
He looks so slick out there.

351
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,040
Seems like a total pro.

352
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,820
Chasing who?

353
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,060
The one chasing your student's cousin.

have an umbrella?

That looks so good.

365
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,420
I found those in the fridge

366
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,420
and figured I'd whip something up.

367
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,040
Well,

368
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,160
if the fridge
magically refills itself every day,

369
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,260
would you keep "whipping something up"

370
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,920
like this?

371
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,000
Yes.

372
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,820
Eating hotel food all the time isn't...

373
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,440
It's not right for me
to just tag along and eat your food.

374

on your face. Let me see.

about my stomach issues?

395
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,420

a few days ago at breakfast,

Why the sudden change of heart?

441
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,450
Well, that's because I hadn't seen Lin

560
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,790
at Changbai Mountain.

561
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:58,270
♪The storyline written by fate♪

562
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,930
It's okay.

563
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,590
You're taking the creator back with you.

564
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,710
♪Just you and me♪

565
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,210
♪Just you and me♪

566
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,730
I heard you were with your mom.

567
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,270
How is she doing?

568
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,730
She looks great.

569
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,810
Though she keeps complaining

570
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,650
about putting on weight.

571
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,070
A little extra weight is good for her.

572
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,330
She used to be way too thin.

573
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,790
She was always obsessed

574
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,150
with staying a size zero.

575
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,570
That's just not healthy.

576
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,270
I told her the same thing.

577
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,770
But she's not happy about it.

578
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,190
She's fixated

579
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,250
on losing it.

580
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,230
Well, you need to be firm with her.

581
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,230
I have zero control over her.

582
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,310
That's true.

583
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,930
With that temper of hers,

584
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,490
no one can tell her what to do.

585
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,290
Yusen,

586
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,830
you're getting back to work

587
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:17,790
in Suzhou tomorrow,

588
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,930
so I won't keep you any longer.

589
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,930
Come have dinner with me

590
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,330
whenever you're free.

591
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,110
And don't forget

592
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,310
the banquet next month.

593
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,090
I won't.

594
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,890
Grandpa, Mr. Li,

595
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,570
I'll head out now.

596
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,130
Alright.

597
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,230
Drive safe.

598
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,810
I've dug into it.

599
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,990
The leak came from Bokai's wife's side.

600
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,870
Her relatives in Changbai Mountain

601
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,590
ran into Weiai,

602
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,450
and they made sure
the news got back to you.

603
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,670
I figured as much.

604
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,170
After all these years,

605
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,510
they still haven't learned a thing,
have they?

606
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,670
Always relying
on the same old cheap tricks.

607
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,070
Weiai has been away for so long,

608
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,310
yet they're still so threatened by her

609
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,170
that they come to me to stir the pot.

610
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,590
I bet they're hoping

611
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,010
Weiai won't get a single penny
after I kick the bucket.

612
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,170
Maybe

613
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,090
they just wanted you to know

614
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,730
that Weiai is doing okay.

615
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,550
Do you actually believe that?

616
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,310
Honestly, I've lost track
of how long it's been

617
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,770
since I last saw her.

618
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,550
In the blink of an eye,

619
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,470
Yusen's all grown up.

620
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,090
How could she be so heartless

621
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,310
to her dad

622
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,510
and her son?

623
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,110
In Weiai's heart,

624
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,330
the one she blames most

625
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,250
is probably herself.

626
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:58,790
If she truly hated you,

627
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,610
she wouldn't have let Yusen

628
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,410
stay in touch with you all these years.

629
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,230
I need a moment to myself.

630
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,150
You got quite worked up a few days ago,

631
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,290
and your heart started acting up.

632
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,350
It would be best

633
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,190
if you went back inside now.

634
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,890
And about the banquet early next month,

635
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,010
do you think

636
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,830
we should keep the guest list small?

637
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,150
I'm worried it might be

638
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:27,990
too much of a strain on you.

639
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,530
It's fine.

640
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,590
Let's stick to the plan.

641
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,070
I know

642
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,310
my own limits.

643
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,150
Are you still going

644
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,170
with Xingjie for the banquet?

645
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,310
Sometimes,

646
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,370
it's only when you're at the top

647
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,870
that you can see people's true colors.

648
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,010
When someone thinks they've already won,

649
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,670
how they act then

650
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,050
is who they really are.

651
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,170
Was it you who told Dad

652
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,270
about Weiai coming back?

653
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,810
That was so unnecessary.

654
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,790
Dad's already decided to groom Xingjie

655
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,730
as his successor.

656
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,050
Why are you still messing around

657
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:24,550
with these little tricks?

658
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,390
Did you honestly think
you could keep it from him?

659
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,410
If you had been more capable,

660
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,530
I wouldn't have had to

661
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,410
resort to these little tricks

662
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,190
20 years ago.

663
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,050
A woman only resorts to scheming

664
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,650
when her man is useless.

665
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,090
Unbelievable.

666
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,690
Where are you going?

667
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,390
Chinese New Year isn't even over yet,

668
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,390
and you already can't sit still?

669
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,910
Nie Chengyuan is in Shanghai.

670
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,190
I'm going to see him.

671
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,170
Why the long face?

672
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,130
Don't get me started. Just family drama.

673
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,690
I heard your dad

674
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,610
has been keeping Xingjie
by his side lately,

675
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,350
showing him the ropes personally.

676
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,070
I thought you'd be

677
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,650
on cloud nine right now.

678
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,350
It was supposed to be a done deal,

679
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,730
but Yao Shu just had to

680
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,350
stir the pot.

681
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,430
I called her out on it,

682
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,550
and now she's giving me attitude.

683
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,310
If it weren't for the fact
that her brothers

684
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,090
are still somewhat useful...

685
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:26,830
What about you?

686
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,810
Chinese New Year is barely over.

687
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,870
What brings you to Shanghai?

688
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,270
Got bored of Wuxi,

689
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,350
so I brought the ladies here
for a change of pace.

690
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,690
They're shopping at the mall.

691
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,910
I didn't have the patience
to follow them around.

692
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,290
Still with that first love of yours?

693
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,610
At your age,

694
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:45,510
you're still acting this clingy?

695
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,730
You're not planning to bring her

696
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,850
to my dad's birthday banquet, are you?

697
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,670
I'm not that foolish.

698
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,010
That's good.

699
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,510
Otherwise,
Yao Shu will start nagging again

700
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,370
about me hanging out
with a bad influence.

701
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,190
She didn't complain
when I was helping you

702
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,890
make money.

703
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,090
Now that she's the mother of the heir,

704
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,250
she's really high and mighty, isn't she?

705
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,330
I don't get it.

706
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,410
She and Jiang Yun

707
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,470
aren't really close either.

708
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,170
I heard they're inviting a lot of people

709
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,090
to the banquet.

710
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,830
Your dad usually keeps a low profile.

711
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,510
Why all the fanfare?

712
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,890
Is he planning to announce Xingjie

713
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:23,410
as the successor?
