00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,820
Actually,

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,320
we've already met each other's parents.

195
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,520
What?

196
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,820
[Meijingsu Plum Cakes]
You met the parents already?

197
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,980
I'm gonna go grab some plum cakes.

198
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,200
Careful.

199
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,600
Sorry.

200
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,200
My bad.

201
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,860
Hey, you still on the line?

202
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:23,940
Alright.

203
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,780
Gotta go.

204
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,500
I'm taking her to get some plum cakes.

205
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,500
Wait, don't hang up.

206
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,480
She's right there with you, isn't she?

207
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,880
I can't take this anymore.

208
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,840
Hand the phone to Nie.

209
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,940
I need to have a word with her.

210
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,340
What do you want to say?

211
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,620
Your character is a bit questionable,
to be honest.

212
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,940
Zip it.

213
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,640
Just hurry up.

214
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,800
Shengyi wants to talk to you.

215
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,860
Hello?

216
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,920
Shengyi.

217
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
Hey, Nie.

218
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,460
You really need to keep him in check.

219
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,520
I'm stuck here pulling overtime,

220
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,000
while he's out there rubbing it
in my face in broad daylight.

221
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,320
What, was he supposed to wait
until it got dark?

222
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,520
Wow,

223
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,640
taking Yusen's side

224
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,180
and ganging up
on a poor lonely guy like me?

225
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,640
That's not it.

226
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,860
But

227
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,540
didn't you practically beg me

228
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,360
to get with him last time?

229
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,660
Well, that's different.

230
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,840
It's one thing to worry
about him being single.

231
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,960
It's another thing to have him

232
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,060
get a girlfriend

233
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,760
before you do.

234
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,340
Seriously, Nie,

235
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,880
I think

236
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,960
you should reconsider.

237
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,600
Look how smug he is.

238
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,080
He's totally basking in it right now.

239
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,840
Since when did this even become a thing?

240
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,600
Is it too late to get a refund on him?

241
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,240
Shengyi,

242
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,260
he snatched the phone away

243
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,200
and heard everything.

244
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,540
Whatever beef you guys have,

245
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,440
settle it yourselves.

246
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,460
If you have to,

247
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,340
just have a showdown back in Suzhou.

248
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,600
I'm off to buy some plum cakes.

249
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,680
Ma'am,

250
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,720
two plum cakes, please.

251
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,020
Which flavors would you like?

252
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,860
Since when are there so many flavors?

253
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,900
Shengyi.

254
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,220
What's up?

255
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,840
Given you've always been on the bench,

256
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,180
I'm just worried your total lack
of experience

257
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,020
is gonna blow up in her face,

258
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,760
so I told Nie to think twice.

259
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,680
What's so wrong with that?

260
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,460
You'd better be.

261
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,400
You bet.

262
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,140
Anyway, when are we grabbing dinner?

263
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,720
I actually happen to be free
tomorrow night.

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,020
Tomorrow's no good.

265
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,840
I'm heading to Soochow University
for a lecture.

266
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Fine, just hit me up when you're free.

267
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,540
Not too soon, hopefully.

268
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,180
I really don't want to grab dinner

269
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,880
with you guys when the lovey-dovey vibes

270
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,160
are at their peak.

271
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,160
It'll totally kill my appetite.

272
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,220
Dr. Fang,

273
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,000
the family from bed 56
is looking for you.

274
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,740
Alright,

275
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,720
flex received.

276
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,840
Gotta go.

277
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,020
Pay up.

278
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,260
I got four.

279
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,080
That'll be 32 yuan total.

280
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,920
Okay.

281
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,020
Here you go.

282
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,780
Aren't you gonna

283
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,200
call Ms. Sheng too?

284
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,920
No rush.

285
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,420
I'm not really the flashy type.

286
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,220
Really?

287
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,400
Just kidding.

288
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,380
I'm dying

289
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,380
to brag.

290
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,180
But it's just still early in Switzerland

291
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
and my mom isn't even up yet.

292
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,860
Here you go.

293
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,360
- Thanks.
- Appreciate it.

294
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,040
Come back soon if you like it.

295
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,500
I'll split them so we each get half.

296
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,520
That way we can sample every flavor.

297
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,900
Honestly, no need to go through
all that trouble.

298
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,660
If you take a bite and don't feel it,

299
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,480
just pass it to me.

300
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,960
Alright then.

301
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,720
What kind of lecture
are you going to tomorrow?

302
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,460
Soochow University is hosting

303
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,140
a New Energy Seminar Week.

304
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,700
Mr. Hua recommended it.

305
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,900
I'll send you the info.

306
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,600
[Clean Energy Development]
There are two sessions

307
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,200
[New Energy Tech Forum]
on PV in the afternoon

308
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,400
and evening.

309
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,340
I want to catch both.

310
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm coming with you.

311
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,280
Well, obviously.

312
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,560
You're gonna be my personal chauffeur.

313
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,220
What flavor do you want
for the second one?

314
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,800
Let's go with this one.

315
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,100
Oh, I just remembered

316
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,220
there's someone else
I have to break the news to.

317
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,360
Who?

318
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:53,880
Hold on.

319
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,960
Here, finish this for me.

320
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,800
I finally found

321
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,200
my "Real Estate Scenery."

322
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,180
Jiang Rui.

323
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,580
If I don't tell him now,

324
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,380
he'll have a total meltdown

325
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,520
when he finds out through the grapevine.

326
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,600
Sounds intense.

327
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,960
Better keep him in the loop then.

328
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,780
But

329
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,640
what's the deal
with "Real Estate Scenery"?

330
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,860
It's nothing special.

331
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,760
Just an inside joke

332
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,320
from when Jiang Rui and I

333
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,260
were traveling

334
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,960
through Europe.

335
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
And...

336
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,760
something just clicked for me.

337
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,040
What is it?

338
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,640
Well,

339
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,180
in the past few days,

340
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,640
we've seen so much beautiful scenery.

341
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,040
But no matter how beautiful it is,

342
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,360
we only get a glimpse
before we have to leave.

343
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,100
I have to

344
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,540
say goodbye

345
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,960
without looking back,

346
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,640
because

347
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,340
it doesn't belong to me.

348
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,480
Look at you, getting all poetic.

349
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,780
What's the rush?

350
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,680
We're still young.

351
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,780
Someday, we'll have our own

352
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,620
"Real Estate Scenery."

353
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,660
What the heck?

354
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,520
"Real Estate Scenery"?

355
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,320
Yeah.

356
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,580
A view with your name

357
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,400
written all over it.

358
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,960
But haven't you already found it?

359
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,680
Lin Yusen, meaning
the island and forest literally.

360
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,800
Nothing's more immovable than that.

361
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,980
Truly, I found it a long time ago.

362
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,700
But just now,

363
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,620
I finally wrote my name on it.

364
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,080
[Wuxi New District]

365
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,440
I'll drop you off at the station today,

366
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,040
and then tomorrow afternoon,

367
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,480
pick me up at Suzhou Railway Station.

368
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,680
Sound like a plan?

369
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,740
Perfect.

370
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,340
Then get off,

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,340
or you're going to miss your train.

372
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,140
Wait.

What?

A goodbye handshake?

376
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,980
Not exactly.

377
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,619
Then what?

378
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,240
Didn't you tell Jiang Rui

00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,380
I thought the PV industry

566
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,200
was in a slump.

567
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,440
But look at this crowd.

568
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,380
We barely found a spot.

569
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,980
It's recruiting season.

570
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,660
I'm sure everyone wants to hear

571
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,260
if there's still any hope
left for the industry.

572
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,220
It looks like

573
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,520
it's not just students
from our school here,

574
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,860
but plenty of working professionals too.

575
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,840
Honored faculty

576
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,780
and students,

577
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,000
good afternoon.

578
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,780
[PhD Supervisor, Deputy Director]
It's a pleasure to welcome you all

579
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,630
[of the International Center]
to today's lecture

580
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,600
[for Renewable Energy Research]
by Professor Lu Shuanghang.

581
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,880
[Council Member]
The Professor likes to keep it brief,

582
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,440
[of the China Renewable Energy Society]
so we'll keep the introductions short.

583
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,300
Please join me

584
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,680
in welcoming Professor Lu.

585
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,600
Hi everyone,

586
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm Lu Shuanghang.

587
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,260
The topic of my lecture today

588
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,580
is "The Dilemmas and Solutions
of China's Photovoltaic Industry."

589
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,840
[The Dilemmas and Solutions
of China's Photovoltaic Industry]

590
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,140
I'm sure you're all familiar

591
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,220
with this subject,

592
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,080
and so am I.

593
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,500
In fact, I gave a lecture
on this very topic a few years back,

594
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,460
and I suspect

595
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,260
I'll still be giving it

596
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,240
several years from now.

597
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,460
That's because the history
of China's PV industry

598
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,340
is a cycle

599
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,620
of hitting rock bottom,

600
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,440
breaking through,

601
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,320
and then surging to new heights.

602
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,700
But the challenges we face

603
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,880
at each stage

604
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,700
are different.

605
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,640
The last time I spoke on this

606
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,340
during an industry crisis,

607
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,340
my heart was heavy.

608
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,500
Why?

609
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,000
Because back then,

610
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,360
China's PV industry

611
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,460
claimed to be number one in the world,

612
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,660
but technologically,

613
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,780
we weren't.

614
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,780
Our products

615
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,480
covered the globe primarily

616
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,400
because of

617
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,640
cheap labor.

618
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,480
There was a phrase

619
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,320
used to describe China's PV back then:

620
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,080
"Three Ends Abroad."

621
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,640
Does anyone know

622
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,040
what those "three ends" were?

623
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,420
Raw materials, technology, and market.

624
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,840
You, please.

625
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,060
Raw materials, technology,

626
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,220
and then market access and pricing.

627
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,400
Spot on.

628
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,980
Please, have a seat.

629
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
Back then, all three

630
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,140
were in the hands of foreigners.

631
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,240
To put it bluntly,

632
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,460
we were completely at their mercy

633
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,120
from start to finish.

634
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,920
We were just working for them.

635
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,840
So by that logic,

636
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,580
our plant

637
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,600
is still just "working for them".

638
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,920
Shengyuan and Yuancheng's original goal

639
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,500
was just to grab some quick profits

640
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,660
during the PV boom,

641
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,680
with no intention of digging deep.

642
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,960
If we want real, long-term growth,

643
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,140
we have to integrate

644
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,400
the entire upstream
and downstream supply chain.

645
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,760
Since 2006,

646
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,980
from raw materials
to every single component

647
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,580
and accessory,

648
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,060
we've achieved domestic production

649
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,220
step by step,

650
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,140
and made our PV industry

651
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,680
number one in the world.

652
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,180
For two years running,

653

"Possessing a treasure invites trouble."

[Headline News]
In 2012,

664
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,660
trade frictions continue to escalate.

665
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,540
The U.S. DOC

666
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,320
recently announced

667
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,700
the imposition

668
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,480
of high AD/CVD

249.96%.

675
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,740
Meanwhile,

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,740
the EC

677
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,980
has also launched an AD investigation

678
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,820
into Chinese PV products.

679
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,920
The case involves

680
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,500
as much as €21 billion,

681
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,520
making it

682
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,780
the largest AD/CVD case in history.

683
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,580
They can't choke us with technology

684
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,680
or materials anymore,

685
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,540
so they resort to trade barriers

686
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,760
and market squeezing,

687
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,600
trying to strangle

00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,420
China's PV industry.

689
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,980
It's an old trick.

690
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,200
We've seen it before,

691
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,980
and we'll see it again.

692
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,480
But they've forgotten one thing:

693
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,660
this is China.

694
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,160
We have a vast territory

695
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
and diverse landscapes.

696
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,540
China itself

697
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,280
is a massive market.

698
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,900
And that brings me to the core

699
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,740
of today's lecture:

700
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,280
Solutions.

701
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,600
The key lies right here.

702
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,380
In the Northwest.

703
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,140
Northwest China

704
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,800
has abundant solar resources

705
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,400
and vast, sparsely populated land.

706
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,480
With transmission costs

707
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,780
so high,

708
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,080
wind and solar power

709
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,080
become the ultimate solution.

710

The lecture is wrapping up.

711
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,160
We have time

712
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,500
for one last question.

713
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,160
Yes, the young man in blue shirt
in the third row.

714
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,260
Please.

715
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,660
Professor Lu,

716
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,260
many people online claim

717
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,280
that China's PV industry

718
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,520
is only number one

719
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,340
because

720
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,920
PV's technology
isn't actually that advanced.

721
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,920
What's your take on that?

722
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,520
I've seen those comments too.

723
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,080
And

724
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,540
I've also seen

725
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,580
a very sharp rebuttal:

726
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,580
"If other countries have a technology

727
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,280
and we don't,

728
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,820
it's called the 'Crown Jewel'
of industry.

729
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,680
But if we're number one

730
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,960
and others can't keep up,

731
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,600
they call it 'low-tech'

732
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,260
and 'worthless'."

733
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,260
It's a great comeback,

734
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,740
but reading it

735
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,200
didn't make me feel better.

736
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,680
It made me feel ashamed instead.

737
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,980
Some people lack confidence

738
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,160
because of the gap

739
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,480
between us
and the cutting edge of science.

740
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,140
That gap wasn't formed overnight,

741
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,360
and it won't be closed
in the blink of an eye.

742
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,680
But we,

743
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,840
as researchers,

744
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,620
need to move faster.

745
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,540
Right now,

746
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,720
we're still too slow.

747
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,100
- No!
- Not really!

748
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,780
But that's okay.

749
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,500
The sun

750
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,220
is fair.

751
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,300
It shines on everyone,

752
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,660
and it will never let down

753
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,820
a nation or a people
who pour their sweat and soul

754
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,940
into the earth beneath it.

755
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,360
There's another lecture

756
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,380
at 7:30 PM

757
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,120
on PERC cell technology.

758
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,219
Want to go?

759
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,100
Definitely.

760
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,340
Working on the "Liuguang Garden" lately

761
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,100
has taught me a lot

762
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,480
about cell tech.

763
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,639
I want to hear
what the top experts have to say.

764
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,100
By the way,

765
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,300
I finally told everyone

766
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,080
the PV Garden

767
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,159
is called "Liuguang Garden".

768
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,440
You're just telling them now?

769
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,159
Well, you sure know
how to keep a secret.

770
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,460
I was a little embarrassed.

771
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,420
I didn't expect them
to actually take it the right way.

772
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,219
Mr. Hua said

773
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,719
it's a great name.

774
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,179
He said our goal

775
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,460
is to catch and keep

776
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,440
as much light as possible.

777
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,540
Mr. Hua is being too modest.

778
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,100
My goal is

779
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,980
to keep all the light.

780
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,620
Well,

781
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,400
then you'd better break
the theoretical limit

782
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
of photoelectric conversion efficiency
first.

783
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,980
Miss Nie,

784
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,240
you have definitely been
doing your homework.

785
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,340
You bet I have.

786
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:09,880
PERC

787
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,920
is the most efficient cell technology

788
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,760
on the market.

789
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,620
My trip to the Northwest

790
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,820
really moved me.

791
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,400
Now that I'm back, I'm going to focus on

792
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,020
pushing PERC cells

793
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,700
into mass production.

794
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,200
I might have to fight you
for Mr. Hua's time.

795
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,440
He would be thrilled.

796
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,560
I bet

797
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,620
he's in the lab right now.

798
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
His whole team

799
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,920
are absolute research junkies.

800
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,220
Let's go grab a bite first.

801
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,620
How about
the Soochow University cafeteria?

802
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,560
Sure.

803
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,820
Shengyi mentioned

804
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,800
that back in the day, the second
you walked into the cafeteria,

805
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,880
you'd have the whole place swooning.

806
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,180
I'm gonna see

807
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,040
if you've still got it.

808
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,540
Those days are long gone.

809
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,540
No returns if I'm not what you expected.

810
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,800
After all,

811
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,880
he's the one who talked me up.

812
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,280
I'll think about it.

813
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,340
Oh, and one soup, please.

814
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,160
Wait, what's the deal?

815
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,560
Why such a huge serving of ribs today?

816
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,300
Is it because she thinks he's cute

817
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,140
and gave him extra?

818
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,380
I doubt it.

819
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,660
He looks like a professor.

820
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,980
That's probably why he got more.

821
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,700
I'll buy you dinner, sure.

822
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,980
But it won't buy you

823
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,040
a passing grade.

824
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,340
See?

825
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,500
Told you.

826
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,460
And he's the type of professor

827
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,640
who shows no mercy.

828
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,920
Even though you bought me these ribs,

829
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,420
I am definitely

830
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
not taking your class

831
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,600
next semester, Professor Lin.

832
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
Not even for two pieces of ribs.

833
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,280
Forget it.

834
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
I mean, if you fail,

835
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,320
you'll have to retake it anyway,

836
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,860
so I'd still end up stuck with you.

837
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,380
I could just drop the credits

838
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,280
and take something else.

839
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,900
Since when can you
just drop credits like that?

840
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,520
Since you decided to just up
and become my professor.

841
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,520
Point taken.

842
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,120
I'm really glad I came today.

843
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,500
Even though I've been reading up
a lot lately,

844
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,920
hearing a lecture

845
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,840
feels totally different.

846
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,760
I used to be

847
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,220
pretty diligent,

848
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,940
but I basically just did

849
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
whatever my boss

850
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,680
told me to do.

851
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,900
I rarely cared about the big picture

852
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,140
or the "why" behind it all.

853
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,580
But since I started working

854
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,500
on Liuguang Garden,

855
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,760
everything changed.

856
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,160
I had to actually learn

857
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,440
and wrap my head around the logic,

858
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,820
the whole tech side

859
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,220
of the PV system.

860
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,120
And

861
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,400
after Professor Lu's lecture today,

862
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,920
I feel like I understand
the whole industry

863
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,680
so much better.

864
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,440
It's like

865
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,960
everything just clicked.

866
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,100
I'm rambling a bit,

867
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,880
but do you get

868
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,520
what I mean?

869
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,500
It's like

870
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,420
I finally

871
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,940
found my place.

872
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,680
I know where I stand

873
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,520
and what I'm actually doing,

874
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,000
instead of just being a gear
in a machine,

875
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,120
taking orders

876
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,920
and checking off boxes.

877
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,340
I get it.

878
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,100
So, technically,

879
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,380
I should get some credit for that?

880
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,340
I wouldn't say that.

881
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,380
There's a certain kind of peace
in just coasting, you know?

882
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,680
I've just traded

883
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,980
the joy of coasting

884
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,540
for a different kind of happiness.

885
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,980
So I'd say you're just breaking even.

886
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,080
Man, it's tough trying
to get a compliment

887
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,560
out of my girlfriend.

888
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,660
Here, have a meatball as a reward.

889
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,660
And you know,

890
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,560
even though things look pretty rough

891
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,980
for the PV industry right now,

892
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,100
I felt pretty good

893
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,500
after the lecture.

894
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,520
About what?

895
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,660
The takeaway from Professor Lu's lecture

896
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,000
was pretty simple:

897
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,220
upgrade the tech
and head back to the Northwest.

898
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,340
Our company

899
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,640
has been doing exactly that.

900
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,880
So I'm happy

901
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,680
because it means

902
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,560
we're on the right track.

903
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,900
I went out to the Northwest

904
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,940
for a field study the other day,

905
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,720
and it really hit home.

906
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,560
PV needs the Northwest,

907
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,600
and vice versa.

908
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,140
The new energy sector

909
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,160
is a huge strategic priority.

910
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,020
There's no way our government
would just give up on it.

911
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,740
We just need to stick close
to the national strategy

912
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,860
and not fall behind.

913
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,400
[Shuangyuan Photovoltaic]

914
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,440
Mr. Lin came back from his trip

915
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,760
and brought souvenirs

916
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,720
for everyone in our department.

917
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,800
I was touched,

918
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,360
but he gave us

919
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,360
Wuxi A Fu figurines.

920
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,160
What's that supposed to mean?

921
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,780
Is this some new way

922
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,140
of going public with your relationship?

923
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,940
Xiguang,

924
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,180
you and Mr. Lin...

925
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:14,700
Yeah.

926
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,540
We're a thing now.

927
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,080
Keep it down.
