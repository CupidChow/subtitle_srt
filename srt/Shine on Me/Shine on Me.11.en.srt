I nodded off.

201
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:10,900
Let's go.

202
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,340
Was I asleep for long?

203
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,460
Fifty minutes.

204
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,440
Why were you timing it?

205
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,540
So, how'd it end?

206
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,080
Did

207
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,900
the heroine get rescued?

208
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,740
Who took her?

209
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,640
The hero's father.

210
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,840
No way. Why?

211
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,960
He was running

212
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,060
illegal drug trials,

213
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,440
and she stumbled upon it.

214
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,200
Then...

215
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,720
Wow, your boyfriend's a pro

216
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,680
at multitasking.

217
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,660
He nailed

218
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,440
every detail.

219
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,160
She said you were multitasking.

220
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,040
You didn't doze off either, did you?

221
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,120
It's almost 1 AM.

222
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,700
Let's skip the city view tonight

223
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,680
and just get some rest.

224
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,900
We've got a wedding to catch tomorrow.

225
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,360
Fine.

226
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,020
If you're beat,

227
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,920
just head back.

228
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,620
So Shengyi was just talking big.

229
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,640
He said you could pull an all-nighter
in surgery

230
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,500
and still be raring to go.

231
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,100
Follow me.

232
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,900
Thanks.

233
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,000
No problem.

234
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,980
Actions speak louder than words.

235
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,180
Lin Yusen,

236
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,080
how old are you?

237
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,280
Nie Xiguang,

238
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,920
you clearly don't know enough

239
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,880
about your boss.

240
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,800
Do you work for me,

241
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,900
or am I reporting to you actually?

242
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,840
You flip between roles way too easily.

243
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,860
I like this position.

244
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,280
I get to boss you around

245
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,040
while I'm still on your payroll.

246
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,980
That's more like slavery.

247
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:08,940
Come on, spill.

248
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,780
How old are you?

249
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,380
Twenty-eight.

250
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,880
Twenty-eight.

251
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,880
Twenty...

252
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,180
That's impossible.

253
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,840
You

254
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,260
have a PhD, right?

255
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,540
You finished a doctorate

256
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,300
and practiced medicine.

257
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,280
The math just doesn't add up.

258
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,960
I mean, you look young, obviously.

259
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,720
Well, thank you.

260
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,800
I started school early.

261
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,740
So

262
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,780
I got my degree a bit ahead of schedule.

263
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,000
Then

264
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,380
why did Shengyi call you

265
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,080
the legendary machine
of your med school?

266
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,320
Nie Xiguang,

267
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,060
do you seriously think it's okay

268
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,540
to ask me that right to my face?

269
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,580
Maybe you should

270
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,960
ask Shengyi yourself,

271
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,120
now that

272
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,980
you've exchanged numbers.

273
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,460
Just how much did he trash-talk me?

274
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,640
It's like he spilled

275
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,200
all my dirty laundry to you.

276
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,580
Relax.

277
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,020
He didn't mention

278
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,880
your dating history

279
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,700
or any of that gossip.

280
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,720
What dating history?

281
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,740
Med school was a grind,

282
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,000
and so was being a surgeon.

283
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,560
I didn't exactly have a window

284
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,080
for dating.

285
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,300
What about your admirers?

286
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,820
With your looks and pedigree,

287
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,940
there must have been a line
out the door.

288
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,720

That's plenty for now.

564
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,080
Eating too much isn't good for you.

565
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,280
Okay.

566
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
New car?

567
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,720
I don't think I've seen this one before.

568
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,180
A gift from my grandfather.

569
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,580
It's just been sitting in the garage.

570
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,300
But since your standards are so high,

571
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,360
and I can't quite meet them,

572
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,260
I had to try a different approach.

573
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,060
What standards of mine?

574
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,420
You don't remember?

575
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,000
"To look sharper."

576
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,620
You can't look any sharper,

577
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,100
so...

578
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,360
Mr. Lin,

579
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,600
you're such a narcissist.

580
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,560
Anyway,

581
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,120
glad I could entertain you.

582
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,140
Get in.

583
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,140
Actually, you...

584
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,580
What?

585
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
You do look sharper.

586
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,180
Then it was worth it,

587
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,020
after trying on so many ties.

588
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,540
Hop in, Miss Nie.

589
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,280
It's my pleasure to be your chauffeur.

590
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,380
Thank you.

591
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,300
[We're Married]

592
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,060
You go on ahead.

593
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,020
I'll find a spot.

594
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,040
I'll come with you.

595
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,020
That's okay.

596
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,200
Just get out here.

597
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,640
Alright then.

598
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:49,920
Gotta go.

599
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,300
Xigua!

600
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,700
Boss.

601
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,260
What's this supposed to mean?

602
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,660
You trying to outshine me
on my wedding day?

603
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,960
And what was your boyfriend driving?

604
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,120
It looked insane.

605
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,880
Boss, it's your wedding.

606
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,160
Chill out.

607
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,880
It's your big day.

608
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,080
I had to pull out all the stops.

609
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,780
Thanks.

610
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,180
Thanks.

611
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:09,940
I've got this.

612
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,320
Blame Xiang Qun for this.

613
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,720
He said

614
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,380
back around graduation,

615
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,680
when they were drinking in the dorm,

616
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,180
Zhuang Xu got wasted and said

617
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,420
he had no idea

618
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,240
how many years he'd have to grind

619
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,060
just to afford a wedding.

620
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,860
He was sure he'd be the last
to get married.

621
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,460
So he promised he'd be there
as the groomsman.

622
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,240
As for my side of things,

623
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,020
Rong's been so hands-on this time.

624
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,360
Xigua.

625
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,120
Go easy on her.

626
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,320
Congrats.

627
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,320
Thanks.

628
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,780
Wait, you brought a gift too?

629
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,040
I said

630
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,020
you should just enjoy the feast.

631
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,900
We basically sent them double.

632
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,640
No.

633
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,700
Shouldn't the gift come from me?

634
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,920
But that is way too generous.

635
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,100
Where's my knife?

636
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,040
I need something

637
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,440
to cut through
all this mushy lovey-dovey stuff.

638
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:06,940
His gift

639
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,980
has nothing to do with me.

640
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,800
This one is from me.

641
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,000
Boss,

642
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,680
be happy, okay?

643
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,700
Xigua.

644
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,780
Hold on tight

645
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,980
to your happiness.

646
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,460
Don't be silly.

647
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,760
I will.

648
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,000
Xigua!

649
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,840
Xiguang, hurry up.

650
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,420
Hello.

651
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,500
You sit next to her.

652
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,660
I feel like she's about

653
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,440
to put me under interrogation.

654
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,480
I can

655
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,920
grill your boyfriend too, you know?

656
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,660
Well, let's see what you've got.

657
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,460
Just make something up.

658
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,900
But don't go overboard.

659
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,760
I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up.

660
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,780
What's the angle here?

661
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,060
Like...

662
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,240
Was it you chasing me,

663
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,580
or the other way around?

664
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,800
How long has it been?

665
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,920
We should sync up on the basics.

666
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,700
Do we really need to get that specific?

667
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,060
What are you

668
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,600
whispering about?

669
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,620
You guys see each other every day,

670
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,100
and you still have to murmur

671
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,040
to each other in front of us?

672
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,260
We are not.

673
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,300
Food's here.

674
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,640
Sweet.

675
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,840
At least we won't have to watch this

676
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,500
on an empty stomach.

677
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,740
Boss surely knows the drill.

678
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,720
Is no one sitting next to me?

679
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,640
The food is already being served.

680
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,580
These seats

681
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,020
are for the bridesmaid and groomsman.

682
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,140
There's no room at the head table.

683
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,380
I doubt they'll even have time

684
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,140
to grab a bite anyway.

685
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,760
So it's just the eight of us then.

686
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,520
More food for us.

687
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,199
Typical. Always about the food.

688
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,639
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

689
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,659
The ceremony is about to begin.

690
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,380
Please join me
in a warm round of applause

691
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,820
to welcome

692
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:30,719
the newlyweds.

693
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,380
College romance is simple yet timeless.

694
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,900
Our bride and groom

695
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,420
both attended the prestigious

696
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,460
Jiangning University.

697
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,780
They met

698
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,480
through mutual friends

699
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:48,400
and shared

700
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,219
a beautiful journey together.

701
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,239
Now, six months after graduation,

702
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,340
the deep bond they share

703
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,080
has led them to make

704
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,800
a lifelong vow to one another,

705
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
and step into

706
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,420
this next great chapter

707
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,360
of their lives

708
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,380
together.

709
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,280
Let's hear it

710
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,140
for their unwavering love.

711
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,120
They must be

712
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,220
overwhelmed with joy,

713
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,340
but there are

714
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,600
four people

715
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,600
even more moved,

716
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,500
their

717
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,260
parents.

718
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,660
And to our proud parents,

719
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,260
would you please stand

720
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,760
and say hello

721
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,520
to everyone?

722
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,340
Xiguang,

723
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,360
relax.

724
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,380
Where did you even

725
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,260
find this giant hunk of fat?

726
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,740
So focused?

727
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,700
Just grabbed whatever.

728
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,220
Gee, thanks.

729
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,220
I'll help myself.

730
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:22,840
Rong.

731
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,580
Shouldn't you be with the bride?

732
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,720
Boss told me to take a break

733
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,400
and get some food.

734
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,340
Her relatives are taking over for now.

735
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,460
You'd better dig in,

736
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,640
or there'll be nothing left.

737
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,560
I thought you were on a diet.

738
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,860
Piling it high, are you?

739
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,260
Wedding calories don't count.

740
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,880
Your name sounded so familiar

741
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,860
when I heard it yesterday.

742
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,100
And then you mentioned
you're from Shengyuan.

743
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,340
It only just clicked

744
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,980
that you're

745
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,040
our chairman's

746
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,000
grandson.

747
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,460
You work at Shengyuan?

748
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,120
I'm the assistant
to Mr. Sheng in Marketing.

749
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,480
Xingjie?

750
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,320
So you're working under him.

751
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,560
Xigua,

752
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,300
is your boyfriend's family
actually that powerful?

753
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,000
Too bad I never

754
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,080
ran into you at HQ.

755
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,700
I'd only just joined the company

756
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,960
when I heard you

757
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,720
were assigned

758
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,580
to a subsidiary.

759
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,180
So you ended up in Suzhou.

760
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,620
And in the same company as you, Xiguang.

761
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,060
By the way, Xiguang,

762
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,360
why did you decide

763
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,400
to work in Suzhou?

764
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,320
I mean, Suzhou is doing great,

765
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,880
but it still doesn't compare

766
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,280
to Shanghai for opportunities.

767
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,380
Actually, I quite like Suzhou.

768
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,560
The office there

769
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,200
is a joint venture
between my family and Shengyuan.

770
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,780
It's just more laid-back.

771
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,840
Sure, Shanghai has
plenty of opportunities,

772
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,920
but the ones you mention

773
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,760
aren't really useful to me.

774
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,520
Oh right,

775
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,140
my family knows the Shengs quite well.

776
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,580
Rong, since you're working at Shengyuan,

777
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,560
if you run into any problems,

778
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,300
you can always come to me.

779
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,260
Don't be shy about it.

780
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,520
The bond we shared in college

781
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,260
is truly rare and valuable.

782
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,660
If there's any way I can help,

783
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,540
I definitely will.

784
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:24,900
Come on, dig in.

785
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,320
They're coming over to toast us.

786
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,040
Xiang Qun looks pretty sharp today.

787
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Was I being too cocky?

788
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,480
What are you laughing at?

789
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,560
It's funny

790
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,720
watching someone

791
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,180
putting on a big show,

792
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,260
while the real heavy hitter next to me

793
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,960
only throws out a soft nudge,

794
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,460
just enough

795
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,900
to keep people in line.

796
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,400
The food here is pretty good.

797
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,840
Really worth the price.

798
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,860
They even serve lobster.

799
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,500
Xiguang,

800
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,160
did you come over

801
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,440
from Suzhou this morning?

802
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:05,940
No.

803
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,340
It got

804
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,300
too late last night,
so I didn't go back.

805
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,260
Wait, did I hear that right?

806
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,440
You didn't go back to Suzhou last night?

807
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,100
Don't tell me you stayed in Shanghai.

808
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,380
So where did you stay?

809
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,560
Mr. Lin must have a house

810
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,980
in Shanghai.

811
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,980
My place

812
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,360
is close to Xiguang's hotel,

813
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,480
so I can swing by and pick her up.

814
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,520
I see.

815
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,340
Hey, you came over too?

816
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,340
Shouldn't you be with Boss,

817
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,540
doing the rounds?

818
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,220
Well,

819
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,840
their relatives
can really hold their liquor.

820
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,780
Guess they don't need
Zhuang Xu for that.

821
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,280
Besides,

822
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,200
he doesn't seem like

823
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,480
much of a drinker

824
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,940
anyway.

825
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
He can drink way more now

826
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,240
than back in college.

827
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,280
Finance sure makes you better
at holding your liquor.

828
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,060
Oh right,

829
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,760
he told me yesterday

830
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,700
that he actually switched
from Huaya's Loans

831
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,640
to Investment Banking.

832
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,520
Seriously?

833
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,880
Even Huaya's regular departments

834
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,680
are tough to get into,

835
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,140
let alone Investment Banking.

836
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,200
Zhuang Xu, that's incredible.

837
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,020
Yeah,

838
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,620
you only graduated six months ago,

839
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,040
and you're moving up

840
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,100
the ladder already?

841
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,120
Just luck, I guess.

842
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,840
You really kept that under wraps.

843
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,500
A move that big,
and you didn't tell us a thing?

844
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,160
Rong,

845
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,320
how come you didn't tell me?

846
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,760
You guys really know
how to play it cool.

847
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,920
"Luck" is such an understatement.

848
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,620
You've got the ability and the drive.

849
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,860
Of course you'd make it.

850
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,660
In Investment Banking,

851
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,920
your salary must've doubled already.

852
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,060
I heard the year-end bonus
is well into six figures.

853
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,580
At this pace,

854
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,460
in just a few years,

855
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,760
a million‑plus salary
wouldn't be surprising.

856
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,080
It's really nothing.

857
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
So you and Xigua

858
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,180
are a bit of a workplace thing.

859
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,220
Since you're her boss,

860
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:20,800
you must have a background

861
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,760
much like the rest of us.

862
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,920
An MBA, I assume?

863
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,400
Actually, no.

864
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,340
I was a med student.

865
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:29,820
What?

866
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,740
That's quite a jump.

867
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,280
So why aren't you practicing?

868
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,220
Cut it out. You're interrogating him.

869
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,940
Xigua,

870
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,100
you're so protective.

871
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,380
Geez, can't I even ask a question?

872
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,080
I never knew

873
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,280
you were the jealous type.

874
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,940
I just don't get it.

875
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,760
Why go to med school

876
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,540
if you're not going to practice?

877
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,000
What's so strange about that?

878
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,800
Haven't you seen a versatile talent?

879
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,140
She's just not used to

880
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,400
this much shameless bragging.

881
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,300
It's okay.

882
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,960
This fish soup is really good.

883
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,720
Have you tried it?

884
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,080
Not yet.

885
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,280
Thanks.

886
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,120
Go on, have a taste.

887
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,140
Thanks everyone for being here.

888
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:44,880
Here you are.

889
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,560
- Boss.
- Boss.

890
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,540
As we're friends,

891
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,980
I'm not doing the rounds, okay?

892
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,340
Oh, knock it off.

893
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,940
We know you're

894
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,820
a lightweight.

895
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,080
Let's all raise our glasses.

896
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,000
Congrats.

897
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,720
- Alright.
- Congrats.

898
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,260
- Congrats.
- Congrats.
