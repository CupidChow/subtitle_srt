00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,990
[Episode 22]

12
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,680
I heard your dad

13
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,600
has been keeping Xingjie
by his side lately,

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,560
showing him the ropes personally.

15
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,140
I thought you'd be

16
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,820
on cloud nine right now.

17
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,520
It was supposed to be a done deal,

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,640
but Yao Shu just had to

19
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
stir the pot.

20
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,180
I heard they're inviting a lot of people

21
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,280
to the banquet.

22
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,700
Your dad usually keeps a low profile.

23
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,479
Why all the fanfare?

24
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,960
Is he planning to announce Xingjie

25
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,539
as the successor?

26
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,460
Pretty much.

27
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,820
This whole ordeal
is finally coming to an end.

28
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,900
Last year, I was completely overwhelmed.

29
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,260
My dad called for a surprise audit,

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,760
digging up every old record
in the books.

31
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,640
From top to bottom,

32
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,000
everyone was living in fear.

33
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,520
I mentioned Mo Dong

34
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,480
to you, right?

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,660
He's been over at Shuangyuan for years,

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,060
but still got dragged into this.

37
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,780
In the end, he was sent
straight behind bars.

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,600
With all this going on,

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,680
I couldn't stick my neck out for him.

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,960
That's a good thing.

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,660
Your dad's anti-corruption crackdown

42
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,440
will give Xingjie a clean slate

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,060
when he takes over.

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,620
Even our own people are behind bars now.

45
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,160
Let's drop it.

46
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,800
What's your real plan

47
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,160
for Shuangyuan?

48
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,340
The funds for the Phase II expansion
still haven't come through.

49
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,300
You're in my dad's bad books

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,420
because of this.

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,480
I'm the only one
holding the line for you.

52
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,480
Cash flow has been

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,800
incredibly tight.

54
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,120
I just need
a little more breathing room.

55
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,620
Didn't that new Deputy GM

What's so funny?

62
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,200
Seems

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,160
you have no idea
who the new Deputy GM is.

64
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,340
Who is it?

65
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,160
My nephew.

66
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,300

67
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,020
He went to Shuangyuan?

68
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,120
He's been there since October.

69
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,300
You really haven't been paying attention
to Shuangyuan, have you?

70
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,120
I don't keep track

71
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,760
of personnel changes at that level.

72
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,340
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,140
What's

74
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,880
with the sudden overreaction?

75
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,260
He requested the transfer
to Suzhou himself.

76
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,500
Isn't it a good thing

77
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,640
he's finally out of the HQ?

78
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,920
He requested it himself?

79
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,280
What exactly is the deal

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,480
between you and my nephew?

81
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,980
I asked you last time,
but you wouldn't say.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,560
Don't keep me in the dark.

83
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,360
What kind of "deal"
could I possibly have

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,579
with a greenhorn like him?

85
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,380
Our deals

86
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,920
keep falling through because of him.

87
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,360
He has finally caught my attention,
that's all.

88
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,420
Come on, let's drink.

Shengyuan sent a Deputy GM over

91
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,080
to Shuangyuan a while ago.

92
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,720
I didn't pay much attention to
who it was.

93
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,659
Check his background,

94
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,659
both professional

95
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:41,780

96
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,920
personal.

97
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,340
See if he's got any dirt on him.

98
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,280
Got it, Mr. Nie.

99
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,159
I'll check

100
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,920
after the holidays.

101
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,440
Don't wait.

102
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,560
Do it now.

103
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,440

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,840
Skip the dinner
and head straight back to Wuxi.

108
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,580
Hello, Mr. Nie.

109
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,920
I was just going to ask

110
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,920
if you wanted to eat at home.

111
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,140
You've eaten out so much
over the holidays.

112
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,380
A simple home-cooked meal
is the most comforting.

113
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,920
I'll make you a bowl of noodles

114
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,280
with a fried egg

115
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,580
and some greens.

116
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,540
But you can't just lie down

117
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,900
the moment you get home.

118
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,240
I bought you

119
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,680
a ton of clothes and shoes,

120
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,580
and you're going to try them all on.

121
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,200
It's not like they don't have

122
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,140
these brands in Wuxi.

123
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,060
Why go through the trouble

124
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,080
of buying them in Shanghai?

125
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,420
Wuxi doesn't have nearly
as much variety as Shanghai.

126
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,520
I wanted to pick out the best for you.

127
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,640
Once Chinese New Year is over,

128
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,400
you'll be busy with endless meetings

129
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,480
and banquets.

130
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,260
You're attending

131
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,680
Old Mr. Sheng's
birthday banquet later, right?

132
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,640
Shanghai people
are all about status and style.

133
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,260
We have to wear

134
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,580
the latest collections.

135
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,520
Oh, by the way,

136
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Nianyuan bought you

137
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,300
a gift

138
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,300
with the money she earned herself.

139
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,020
Money she earned herself?

140
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,860
Yeah.

141
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,180
She's been learning about investment

142
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,520
and business from a friend

143
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,460
and made a bit of a return.

144
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,520
She's been wanting to thank you.

145
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,600
She says spending more time with you

146
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,700
was a real eye-opener

147
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
and she's picked up a few things.

148
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,320
Which friend?

149
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,300
What kind of business?

150
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,360
A friend in Suzhou.

151
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,020
Her family owns a factory,

152
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,300
and she opened a boutique.

153
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,060
I put tens of thousands
into her boutique,

154
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,260
and now I'm getting
a monthly payout of a few grand.

155
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,140
It's fine for a girl
to run a little shop.

156
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,640
But small businesses

157
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,100
don't make money easily,

158
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,920
so don't throw it away.

159
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,180
I have everything I need.

160
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,240
If it weren't

161
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,300
for your connections, Mr. Nie,

162
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,320
I never would've met these people.

163
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,740
So of course

164
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,740
I need to thank you.

165
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,420
It's her way of showing thanks,

166
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,580
so stop turning her down.

167
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,580
We picked out

168
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,080
these cufflinks together.

169
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,280
You must wear them
in the birthday banquet.

170
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,020
From Nianyuan's example,

171
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,760
I've realized

172
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,100
just how much

173
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,140
networking

174
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,520
really matters.

175
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,640
People who aren't

176
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,760
on your level

177
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,920
simply don't get

178
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,700
these kinds of opportunities.

179
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,300
Chengyuan,

180
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,680
if you get the chance,

181
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,000
take Nianyuan under your wing more often

182
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,320
so she can broaden her horizons

183
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,940
and make more connections.

184
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,300
What?

185
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,640
Nianyuan wants to go to Old Sheng's

186
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,800
birthday banquet with me?

187
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,380
I don't.

188
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,900
I was just thinking out loud.

189
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,520
Don't read too much into it.

190
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,640
You've always been

191
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,480
calculating since childhood.

192
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,200
But

193
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,200
thanks to that,

194
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,300
otherwise,

195
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,420
how would you have made such a fortune?

196
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,419
With all this stuff you bought me,

197
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,299
did you use up the money

198
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,679
I sent you last time?

199
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,300
It doesn't matter.

200
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,700
I don't have much to spend it on anyway.

201
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,080
I'll send you some more.

202
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,140
Give some to Nianyuan, too.

203
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,460
It's embarrassing

204
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,100
to invest just a few thousand

205
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,420
in her friend's shop.

206
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,240
Looks cheap and makes me lose face.

207
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,600
You're right.

208
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,040
Nianyuan is a good girl.

209
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,960
She wouldn't dare

210
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,080
to use your name for clout out there.

211
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,360
Happy Chinese New Year.

212
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,860
Sorry I'm late.

213
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,000
Happy Chinese New Year.

214
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,020
I went to Changbai Mountain

215
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,860
over the holidays

216
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,920
and brought back

217
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,240
some local snacks for everyone.

218
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,540
You went all the way there

219
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,040
for the holidays?

220
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,100
I went with my family.

221
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,680
Was it fun?

222
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,680
Fun, but freezing.

223
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,260
It was
minus 20-something degrees Celsius.

224
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,360
So, Nie,

225
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,520
what's Mr. Lin's take

226
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,300
on the proposal?

227
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,360
I sent him both options

228
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,360
before the holidays,

229
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,420
along with a pros and cons list.

230
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,020
He's all

231
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,480
for taking on the challenge

232
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
and building

233
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,080
a flagship BIPV project.

234
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,160
Mr. Lin certainly has vision.

235
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,040
However,

236
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,720
our initial designs

237
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,840
were just for preliminary estimates

238
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,900
and are still quite rough.

239
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,860
We need

240
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,080
to finalize

241
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,920
the main architectural plans first.

242
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,340
Mr. Hua, can your team

243
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,340
sync with us

244
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
and provide

245
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,960
the PV solution?

246
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,080
We need it

247
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,280
to finalize a precise budget.

248
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,300
The budget...

249
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,260
What if the final numbers

250
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
are a bit higher?

251
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,360
The boss won't get cold feet,

252
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,540
will he?

253
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,020
Mr. Lin

254
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,160
isn't that faint-hearted.

255
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Plus, I'll be working

256
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,720
with you all

257
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,900
to keep costs

258
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,920
within a reasonable range.

259
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,700
That's a relief.

260
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,140
Don't worry.

261
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,780
Mr. Lin is a visionary.

262
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,040
He sees the huge potential

263
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,920
for BIPV

264
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,860
and won't be deterred

265
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,400
by a few hurdles.

266
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,480
He said

267
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,780
that even if we don't know

268
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,360
when the market will truly take off,

269
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,260
tech breakthroughs

270
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,540
don't happen overnight.

271
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,100
Regardless of where the future lies,

272
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,420
we should just dive in

273
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,480
and start figuring it out.

274
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,600
What else did I say?

275
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,800
You also said

276
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,460
that we'd sell our products

277
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,540
to the Middle East,

278
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,360
and that we'd build
massive BIPV projects

279
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,100
across the deserts of the oil kingdoms

280
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,640
and they'd all be "Made in China."

281
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,140
When on earth

282
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,200
did I say any of that?

283
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
You said in a meeting once

284
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,800
that we shouldn't just limit
our focus to Europe and the US.

285
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,360
We need to look at the growing demand

286
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,040
in Asia, Latin America,

287
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,660
and Africa.

288
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,220
So I figured,

289
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,580
since you guys are always talking

290
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,720
about a "Northwest Strategy,"

291
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,200
and the Middle East is full of deserts

292
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,900
and intense sunlight,

293
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,220
it's the perfect fit for this project.

294
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,360
I'm just connecting the dots

295
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,760
and summarizing.

296
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,340
Aren't you glad

297
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
I'm giving you credit

298
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,660
for such visionary words?

299
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,360
That's called selling a pipe dream.

300
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,600
I call it boosting morale

301
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,860
and getting the team fired up.

302
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,760
Over the holidays,

303
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,780
I consulted my mom

304
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
about some funding issues.

305
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,540
She gave me

306
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,340
a few ideas

307
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,780
I want to look into.

308
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,400
Would you mind putting in a word

309
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,280
with the heads of Logistics,

310
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,520
Procurement, and Finance for me,

311
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,100
Mr. Lin?

312
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,660
Sure.

313
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,200
I'll talk to them in a bit.

314
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,920
No.

315
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
Do it now.

316
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,160
You are a procrastinator.

317
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,220
You said you'd lend me those books,

318
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,400
and I still haven't seen them.

319
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,220
The books were in Shanghai.

320
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,580
I just brought them back.

321
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,020
Fine. I'll call them now.

322
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,780
Hello, Ms. Chen?

323
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,460
Regarding the PV garden in the plant...

324
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,340
Hi, Mr. Tong?

325
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,040
Hello, Mr. Wu?

326
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,540
Mission accomplished.

327
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,160
See?

328
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,340
Why wait?

329
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,540
It only took a couple minutes.

330
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,960
Thanks, Boss.

331
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,520
I'll get to work then.

332
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,480
You don't have to see me out.

333
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,540
Look outside.

334
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,140
Don't you know
there's a department heads' meeting

335
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,340
this afternoon?

336
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,860
They weren't all in the same room

337
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
when they picked up, were they?

338
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,860
I wouldn't know that.

339
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,020
Phew. Lucky me.

340
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,700
Today

341
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,460
marks our first work day
of the new year.

342
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,520
First off, Happy Chinese New Year
to everyone.

343
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,900
That's another year under our belts.

344
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,220
The past year

345
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,360
hasn't been easy for any of us.

346
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,040
But fortunately,

347
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,640
Shuangyuan is still standing.

348
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,960
We're still pushing forward
against the wind.

349
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,720
The progress

350
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,480
of our Phase II plant

351
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,700
has been even smoother than expected.

352
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,580
Mr. Ding,

353
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,840
we should be ready

354
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,100
for the final inspection
by the end of March, right?

355
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:52,780
Yes.

356
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,300
The civil engineering
is in the finishing stages.

357
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,460
We'll be entering the inspection process
very soon.

358
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,140
We just confirmed

359
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,340
with the equipment suppliers

360
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,540
this morning.

361
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,860
Everything will be delivered
on schedule.

362
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,300
If all goes well,

363
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,960
after the line commissioning,

364
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,600
the new facility

365
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,100
will be in production by May.

366
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,420
Everyone, stay confident.

367
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,900
The domestic market,

368
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,480
especially the power station projects
in Northwest China,

369
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,780
remains

370
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,020
our primary focus.

371
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,160
Furthermore,

372
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,340
we must stay committed

373
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,540
to our brand strategy.

374
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,080
Couldn't you just have brought the books

375
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,040
to the office?

376
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,100
And you had to make me
come all the way here?

377
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,900
I brought a ton of books back.

378
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,280
Why not take your pick?

379
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,640
Maybe I should set

380
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,540
a ground rule:

381
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,160
you can only borrow two at a time.

382
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,960
Finish those, then come back for more.

383
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,040
Fine, I'll just go
to the Suzhou Library then.

384
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,760
They aren't as stingy as you.

385
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,400
Wow, you bought a lot of books.

386
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,100
I actually bought way more,

387
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,720
but the quality was all over the place.

388
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,720
These are just the ones
that made the cut.

Oh, you even have memoirs
from those PV entrepreneurs.

393
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,220
Well, they're bound
to be a bit sugar-coated,

394
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,300
but these guys are the winners

395
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,220

396

Seeing where they are now

401
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,300

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,400
to chew on.

403
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,220
Let me move these to the table.

404
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,220
The floor is freezing.

405

No, don't.

406
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,780
The floor heating is on, it's fine.

407
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,020
I like sitting on the floor anyway.

It's cozy.

Take your time.

I'm going to check on the food.

411

Ms. Chen isn't back
from the holiday yet.

You know, the Suzhou Library

416
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,020
probably caps you
at five books at a time too.

417
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,660
Keep it up

418
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,340

Why do you always have

435
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,720
a bowl of soybeans
sitting in your study?

436
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,220
I noticed it the last time

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,020
I was here.

The vastness of the universe?
The mystery of existence?

Those are for my rehab.

Is that rehab too?

447
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,280
You mean

like this?

449
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,540
Yes.

I heard rehab is supposed
to be incredibly painful.

It doesn't hurt now.

452
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,660
It did at first, though.

Sometimes,

454
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,060
it would even make my eyes water.

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,000
or this one?

565
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,920
The hotpot spot
has a really high rating.

566
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,860
[Yin Jie]
But Yuhua can't handle spicy food,

567
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,000
and she's even from Chengdu.

568
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,080
Ridiculous.

569
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,000
This Cantonese place
has great reviews, too.

570
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,140
The vibe is nice,

571
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,300
and we can walk around a bit
after we finish.

572
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,380
Yuhua and I are leaning
toward Cantonese.

573
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,360
[Dad]

574
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,580
I'm downstairs at your office.

575
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,600
How's work been lately?

576
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,040
It's fine.

577
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,680
Why didn't you

578
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,560
ever tell me

579
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,780
that your boss is Lin Yusen,

580
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,700
and

581
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,460
that he plucked you out of Finance

582
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,900
just to keep you by his side?

583
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,020
You never asked.

584
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,920
I was so swamped last year.

585
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,060
This totally slipped my radar.

586
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,760
I only heard about it a few days ago.

587
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,340
I also heard

588
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,160
some unpleasant rumors.

589
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,400
Are they true?

590
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,780
Don't you think

591
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,000
your question

592
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,820
is completely out of left field?

593
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,460
What "unpleasant rumors"?

594
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,840
Why don't you be specific?

595
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,520
[Lin: Dinner's set for 6 PM.
Picking you up at 5:30 PM?]

596
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,760
Is this "Lin"

597
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,100
Lin Yusen?

598
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,060
You're having dinner with him tonight?

599
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,700
Are you two

600
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,420
actually a thing now?

601
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,000
This isn't happening.

602
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,900
Break it off with him, right now.

603
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,360
I'm transferring you

604
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,080
to another company immediately.

605
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,280
First off, keep your hands

606
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,860
off my phone.

607
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,100
Who I'm with

608
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,060
is my business.

609
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,480
And I'm not big
on being told what to do.

610
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,780
What do you mean "your business"?

611
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,600
You're my daughter.

612
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,720
My only daughter.

613
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,660
Mom has legal custody of me.

614
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,260
I know you're mad at me.

615
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,740
But you're my daughter.

616
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,100
Do you really think
I'd ever try to hurt you?

617
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,580
You're young and naive.

618
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,220
You don't realize
how cutthroat people can be.

619
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,160
Do you have any idea

620
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,680
how many people
are eyeing your inheritance?

621
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,040
What's that supposed to mean?

622
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,060
That anyone who likes me

623
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,480
is only after my money?

624
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,800
That's not what I meant.

625
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,920
But it pays to be cautious.

626
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,820
You're overthinking it.

627
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,500
Lin Yusen isn't like that.

628
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,000
Besides, he's already loaded.

629
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,000
He's loaded?

630
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,940
Since when?

631
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,260
He's just Sheng Xianmin's grandson

632
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,520
without inheritance rights.

633
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,220
He used to be

634
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,940
a renowned surgeon.

635
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,600
And now, he's a top executive

636
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,440
at the very least.

637
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,020
So what if he doesn't have
inheritance rights?

638
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,820
He has more than enough.

639
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,000
Lin Yusen isn't the type to be driven

640
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,820
by blind ambition.

641
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,540
Not ambitious?

642
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,000
Trust me, there isn't a single person

643
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,760
in that Sheng family

644
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
who isn't a shark.

645
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,940
Some just lack the talent,

646
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,420
and others just lack the luck.

647
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,180
Lin Yusen didn't have the luck,

648
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,440
but you do.

649
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,400
Since he joined Shengyuan,

650
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,320
you wouldn't believe how many times

651
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,340
he tried to cross me.

652
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,560
Even at his age, he managed

653
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,860
to make things difficult for me.

654
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:36,700
Xiguang,

655
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,640
you're no match for him.

656
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,200
He'll play you like a fiddle,

657
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,360
and you'll thank him for it.

658
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,820
I've been in this game for years.

659
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,040
Do you really think my judgment is off?

660
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,160
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing

661
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,240
with a stone-cold heart.

662
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,240
You aren't even

663
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,620
in the same league as him.

664
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
You think he's actually content

665
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,440
just rotting away in Suzhou?

666
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,460
He's playing the long game,

667
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,400
just biding his time.

668
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,060
And now he's using you

669
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,640
as a stepping stone.

670
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,260
That's on me. I dropped the ball.

671
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,760
I knew

672
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,160
he had left Shengyuan HQ,

673
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,800
but I didn't bother
to keep tabs on him after that.

674
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:07,940
Wait,

675
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:08,960
Xiguang,

676
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,260
he's coming straight for you!

677
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,300
Cut it out.

678
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,520
Basically, your whole point

679
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,820
is that he's not into me,

680
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,940
but your money, right?

681
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,720
Are you trying to trash
Lin Yusen's reputation,

682
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
or are you just insulting me?

683
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,200
But

684
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,520
if he really is with me

685
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,980
because of your fortune,

686
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,160
doesn't that make us

687
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,920
even more "unbreakable"

688
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,220
rather than if he just liked my looks

689
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,140
or my personality?

690
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,320
After all, in your world, Cash is King,

691
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,620
forever and ever.

692
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Look, there's something
I wasn't going to say.

693
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
I didn't want to hurt you.

694
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,020
He used to

695
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,100
go after Nianyuan.

696
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,660
Two years ago,

697
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,800
around this time.

698
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,440
You were

699
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,560
at Ms. Yu's party too,

700
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,540
but you threw a tantrum and left early,

701
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,680
remember?

702
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,840
He was with Sheng Xianmin.

703
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,000
After the party,

704
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,280
he told people

705
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,040
he was interested in Nianyuan.

706
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,700
When Nianyuan found out,

707
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,820
she invited him to Wuxi
to enjoy the plum blossoms.

708
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,040
And he ended up in that car crash

709
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,320
on his way there.

710
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,020
If Nianyuan

711
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,260
hadn't told me herself,

712
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,900
I never would have known.

713
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,880
Xiguang,

714
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,160
do you see it now?

715
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,920
He's just chasing whatever benefits

716
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,340
our family can give him.

717
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,460
Ma Nianyuan

718
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,660
is just a girl

719
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,340
from the family I'm close with.

720
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,340
And even then, he was all over her.

721
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,780
Imagine what he'll do for you.

722
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,540
You're my flesh and blood.

723
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,120
I don't believe that.

724
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,280
Miss, we've arrived.

725
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:32,780
Miss?

726
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,220
We're here.

727
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,900
Here you go. Thanks.

728
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,440
Didn't I say I'd pick you guys up?

729
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,000
Why'd you come all this way on your own?

730
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,700
Don't tell me you're here early
to check out the restaurant?

731
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,440
The restaurant
might not even be open yet,

732
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,260
but we can head over

733
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,140
and walk around the area.

734
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,940
Lin Yusen,

735
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,420
there's something I need to ask you.

736
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,520
What is it?

737
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,340
I just met

738
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
with my dad.

739
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,840
He said you...

740
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:56,820
Mr. Nie?

741
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,460
He's in Suzhou?

742
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,700
What did he say about me?

743
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,720
Do you know Ma Nianyuan?

744
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,180
Who is that?

745
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,660
So you really don't know her.

746
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,900
But

747
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,320
why would Dad tell a lie

748
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,480
that's so easily exposed?

749
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:24,800
By that same logic,

750
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,260
Lin Yusen wouldn't bother

751
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,020
with a useless deception either.

752
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,180
Something's not adding up.

753
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,700
Mr. Nie said

754
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,560
I knew her?

755
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,640
Well, that's strange.

756
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,680
It is.

757
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,280
You've heard the stories

758
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,220
about my dad, right?

759
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,140
You mean...?

760
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,800
I've heard a thing or two.

761
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,400
Well,

762
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,600
Ma Nianyuan

763
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,320
is essentially my father's goddaughter.

764
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,680
Dad said

765
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,420
you two met two winters ago

766
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,900
at Ms. Yu's banquet.

767
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,540
And then, she invited you

768
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,540
to Wuxi to enjoy the plum blossoms.

769
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,920
What did you say?

770
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,780
So, the person who asked me
to Wuxi wasn't you?

771
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,440
How could it have been me?

772
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,820
I didn't even know you

773
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,840
back then.

774
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,060
Two years ago,

775
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,720
in January.

776
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,020
We met

777
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,860
at Ms. Yu's banquet.

778
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,920
I went with my grandpa.

779
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,660
Think carefully.

780
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,740
Do you really have
no memory of it at all?

781
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,340
Did we?

782
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,159
So that's how it was.

783
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,020
Are you back in the country?

784
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,080
Where are you now?

785
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,620
I'm heading there right now.

786
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,280
Come with me.

787
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,740
Where to?

788
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,640
Songjiang.

789
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,560
Come out.

790
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:33,940
Vincent.

791
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,820
You should've told me you were coming.

792
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,340
I would've rolled out the red carpet.

793
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,780
Shao Jiaqi?

794
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,700
Nie Xiguang?

795
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,580
What are you doing here

796
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,300
with Yusen?

797
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,420
Shao Jiaqi.

798
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,080
Two years ago,

799
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,660
right before my car accident,

800
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,000
did you call

801
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,820
and ask me

802
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,180
to go to Wuxi?

803
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,060
Why are you bringing this up again?

804
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,780
It was all my fault.

805
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,460
I know.

806
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,840
Now, I want you to repeat

807
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,420
exactly what you said to me

808
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,820
on the phone that day.

809
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,120
My goodness,

810
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,400
buddy, give me a break.

811
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,560
I already said I was sorry.

812
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,460
If I'd known that woman

813
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,120
had such low class,

814
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,260
I never would've set you up.

815
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,400
I've already cut ties with her.

816
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:14,860
I told her

817
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,560
you were in a car accident,

818
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,220
and she didn't even bother
to check on you.

819
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,760
That's enough.

820
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,620
Just repeat what you said,

821
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,280
word for word.

822
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,120
How am I supposed to remember?

823
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,580
Fine.

824
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,220
I'll say it.

825
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,400
You just confirm if I've got it right.

826
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,120
That day,

827
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,820
I had just finished a major surgery.

828
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,220
You called and said:

829
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,780
"Come to Wuxi.

830
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,540
I'll introduce a girl to you."

831
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,280
And I said:

832
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,420
"You still have the mood for that?

833
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,800
Thanks, but no need."

834
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,600
Is that how it went?

835
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,100
Yusen, your memory is incredible.

836
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,380
That's exactly how it went.

837
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,120
It's not my memory.

838
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,440
After the accident,

839
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,240
as I lay in that hospital bed,
unable to move,

840
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,160
I replayed those words in my head
like a thousand times.

841
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,120
Then you said:

842
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,950
"Last week you came

843
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,800
to my mom's party.

844
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,600
That beauty fell for you at first sight.

845
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,440
I ran into her today.

846
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,300
She brought you up

847
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,160
and invited you to Wuxi
to enjoy the plum blossoms.

848
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,880
She's stunning.

849
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,400
Trust me.

850
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,060
Nie Chengyuan's daughter."

851
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,080
Right.

852
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,340
I'd just returned the country back then.

853
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,160
That woman acted
all pathetic and helpless,

854
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,460
so she totally misled me.

855
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,220
I actually thought

856
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,080
she was Mr. Nie's illegitimate daughter.

857
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:48,880
I only found out

858
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,620
the truth recently.

859
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,080
And I've been debating

860
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,320
whether to bring it up to you again.

861
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,280
My goodness.

862
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,380
How did you two even end up together?

863
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,720
Wait, you didn't actually think
the one inviting you

864
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,480
was Nie Xiguang, did you?

865
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,040
Wait,

866
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:11,880
did you take it out

867
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,620
on her?

868
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,160
Let me take you home.

869
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,540
[To Yin Jie: Sorry, I have to
cancel dinner tonight.]

870
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,440
[What? What's wrong?]

871
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,420
[Sorry, please let Yuhua know too.]

872
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,720
[No worries.
Just make it up another day.]

873
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,940
[Alright.]

874
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,140
Sorry

875
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,600
for what I did to you.

876
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,360
It's okay.

877
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,220
I think

878
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,460
I need some time alone.

879
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,680
