00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,860
still invite him to their banquet?

189
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,120
If you hadn't been held up by work

190
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,920
and couldn't make it back,

191
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,640
wouldn't you two
have run into each other?

192
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,920
Because

193
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,420
besides being my friend,

194
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,180
she's first and foremost
a business leader.

195
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,180
She did ask for my opinion,

196
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,540
but that kind of gesture

197
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,660
is really just for show.

198
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,260
I get it.

199
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,680
Don't sigh.

200
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,059
Real kindred spirits

201
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,120
are few and far between.

202
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,320
You can't expect too much

203
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
from others.

204
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,940
Fine.

205
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,400
Then when I get there,

206
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,740
I'm going to make sure everyone knows

207
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,059
I'm here representing

208
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,980
my mom, Jiang Yun.

209
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,080
Otherwise, they'll think

210
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,980
we're intimidated or something.

211
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,900
Thank you.

212
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,520
Enjoy the party, you guys.

213
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,680
Sure thing.

214
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,060
- Ms. Yu.
- Xiguang.

215
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,160
Mr. Shao.

216
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,340
Long time no see.

217
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,440
My mom got held up with something.

218
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,020
She won't be back until tomorrow.

219
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,600
She asked me to pass along
her apologies.

220
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,200
So I'm here on her behalf

221
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,380
to say huge congratulations to you.

222
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,180
I hope your business

223
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,160
really takes off.

224
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,360
And Ms. Yu, stay as gorgeous
as you are today, forever.

225
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, Xiguang, you always know

226
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,440
exactly what to say.

227
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,260
Your mom already called me.

228
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,220
We've agreed

229
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,440
to catch up later on.

230
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,340
You better show up for that, too.

231
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,620
For sure.

232
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,920
I'll never say no to a food invite.

233
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,700
Hello.

234
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,340
Ms. Yu, don't let me keep you.

235
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,120
I can't just leave you here
all by yourself.

236
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,820
Jiaqi?

237
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,680
That brat.

238
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,800
Turn your back for a second
and he's gone.

239
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
It's been a while
since you saw him, right?

240
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,780
He's back from the U.S.

241
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,920
I'll

242
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,420
have him keep you company.

243
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,300
Don't worry about it, Ms. Yu.

244
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,520
Go take care of your other guests.

245
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,820
I can totally manage on my own.

246
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,520
Alright then.

247
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,420
Have a great time.

248
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,220
Make it big.

249
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,440
Mission accomplished.

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,180
Just another half hour,

251
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,960
then I'm good to go, right?

252
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,940
This is so boring.

253
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,920
I'd much rather be back home

254
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,260
gaming with Jiang Rui.

255
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,660
Ms. Yu sure has a lot of pull.

256
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,720
Even the chairman of Shengyuan

257
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,860
brought his grandson

258
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,280
along.

259
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,080
Well, it's a 20th-anniversary bash,

260
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,320
so they were bound to go all out.

261
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,180
Though, the only reason

262
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,060
they snagged Mr. Sheng

263
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,880
was by riding the coattails
of that Yangtze River Delta

264
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,220
Entrepreneur Summit happening in Wuxi.

265
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,800
Mr. Gu.

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,740
I'm going to go say hi to Ms. Yu.

267
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,920
Ms. Yu.

268
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,160
Mr. Nie from Yuancheng is here.

269
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,680
Wishing you great success
with the business.

270
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,460
Who's that next to him?

271
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,300
Her?

272
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,760
I actually know who that is.

273
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,500
I ran into them at dinner over

274
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,580
at the Lihu Hotel once.

275
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,840
Mr. Nie said she's

276
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,420
the daughter of a "good friend."

277
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,920
Mr. Zhang, you're being way too subtle.

278
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,240
What "Good friend"? Please.

279
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,940
It's his you-know-who.

280
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,500
It's an open secret

281
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,260
in the Wuxi business circle by now.

282
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,360
Ten to one, she's

283
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,900
Mr. Nie's love child.

284
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,200
Why else would he be so devoted to her,

285
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
even flaunting her
at a banquet like this?

286
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,840
I noticed Jiang Yun isn't here today.

287
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,960
I guess that's why

288
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,660
he finally had the guts
to bring the girl along.

289
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,280
Guts?

290
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,260
Since when does Mr. Nie

291
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,440
have to worry
about what Jiang Yun thinks?

292
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,920
Ms. Jiang Yun

293
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,800
is decent enough

294
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,420
in her career,

295
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,140
but as a wife?

296
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,480
She's a total failure.

297
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,220
What matters most for a woman?

298
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,940
Being gentle and supportive,

299
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,460
and keeping the home front solid

300
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,760
so her husband doesn't have to worry.

301
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,420
And things will just fall into place.

302
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,280
But

303
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
she always had to be the alpha.

304
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,700
Word is, she wouldn't even give

305
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,260
Mr. Nie any face at the office.

306
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,180
She had no idea
who wore the pants in that family.

307
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,180
And look at her now.

308
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,460
It all blew up in her face.

309
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,680
She just paved the way
for someone else to reap the rewards.

310
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,080
I heard

311
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,120
she regretted it
the second the divorce went through.

312
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,600
She tried to crawl back to Mr. Nie,

313
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,920
but he wasn't having it.

314
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,660
She's probably at home
eating her heart out right now.

315
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,080
She wouldn't dare show her face here

316
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,400
just to be humiliated.

317
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,440
Besides,

318
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,900
once you're out, you're out.

319
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,580
I bet

320
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,880
Ms. Yu didn't even put her
on the guest list.

321
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,780
You guys go ahead.

322
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,460
I'm gonna go say
a quick hello to Mr. Nie.

323
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,520
- Go right ahead.
- Please.

324
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,280
Mr. Nie,

325
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,080
long time no see. Hope you've been well.

326
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,480
Hello.

327
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,220
And you are...?

328
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,700
I guess big shots like you
have short memories.

329
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,640
Xu Dafeng.

330
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,700
My firm handles

331
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,580
interior materials.

332
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,720
I had the honor

333
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,260
of chatting with you briefly
at the last investment fair.

334
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,080
Mr. Nie,

335
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,140
it is truly an honor

336
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,960
to see you again.

337
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,300
The commercial properties

338
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,020
developed by Yuancheng

339
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,100
are legendary for their quality.

340
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,540
If there's ever anything
I can do for you,

341
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,120
please don't hesitate to ask.

342
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,000
I'd be more than happy
to be of service in the future.

343
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,760
Of service?

344
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,100
I don't think that'll be necessary.

345
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,700
Xiguang?

346
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,180
You are here too.

347
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,720
How come you didn't give me a heads-up?

348
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,840
I'm here representing my mom,

349
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,540
so I don't exactly owe you
an explanation.

350
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,260
You...

351
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,340
I've clearly made things

352
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,340
too easy for her.

353
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,940
I apologize for the scene, everyone.

354
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,420
Chairman
of Wuxi Dafeng Decorative Materials,

355
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,780
Xu Dafeng.

356
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,600
Hearing you greet my father just now

357
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,340
was how I realized

358
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,160
you two weren't actually acquainted.

359
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,940
I was sitting right there

360
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,920
and couldn't help
but overhear you holding forth,

361
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,140
so I honestly thought

362
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,640
you were some old friend of my father's

363
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,300
who had our family
and Yuancheng's business

364
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,140
all figured out.

365
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,800
What's going on here?

366
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,340
Miss Nie, you've got it all wrong.

367
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,580
Mr. Nie,

368
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,880
this is all a misunderstanding.

369
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,440
Whether it's a misunderstanding
you know best yourself

370
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,040
but a whole crowd just heard you,

to talk big and then back down.

their time spinning stories

Until I spotted you.

at someone back then.

407

The whole room was fixated on you.

408

I heard people around me
calling you arrogant,

409

410

426
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,540
Just then, Jiaqi introduced me

427

428

During that time,

I lay in my hospital bed
with my eyes bandaged up,

462
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,720

You have no idea

571
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,120
how freezing it is at the exit.

572
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,800
I was bundled up in this coat
and still shivering my head off.

573
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,580
So, I just bought a ticket

574
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,080
to get into the waiting area.

575
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,060
At least there's heat in here.

576
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,720
And since I'd already had
my ticket checked,

577
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,680
I figured I might as well come down
to the platform.

578
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,060
I mean, what if the train couldn't leave

579
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,540
just because they were
missing one ticket?

580
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,560
True.

581
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,840
Since Miss Nie is so important,

582
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,580
I'm sure the train wouldn't have dared
to leave without you.

583
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,980
Didn't I say nine?

584
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,200

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,220

There isn't even a train at nine.

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,980
Why did you lie to me?

592
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,780
I bet he'd say he just didn't want me

Taihu Lake is a total no-go
in this cold.

653
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,280
Or we could check out
the Lingshan Buddhist Palace.

654
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,280
At least the ceiling

655
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,180
is stunning.

656
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,200
Or maybe Three Kingdoms City
or Water Margin City?

657
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,640
Then there's Yuantouzhu and all that.

658
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,780

659
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,100
you'd take me to see the plum blossoms.

660
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,380
Alright then.

661
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,040
To the Mei Flower Garden it is.

662
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,680
Tickets are the cheapest there anyway.

663
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,540
Thanks for saving me some money.

664
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,400

665
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,180
It's not that I don't trust
your driving.

666
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,480
Actually,

667
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,260
I really don't.

668
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,340
Come on, let's go

669
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,080
before all the blossoms wither away.

670
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,680
How did we end up by Taihu Lake?

671
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,340
You missed a turn back there.

672
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,860
The sign said to stay in the left lane,

673
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,120
but you stayed in the middle.

674
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,400
Why didn't you say something sooner?

675
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,000
I figured a discredited driver like me

676
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,160
had no right to give directions.

677
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,880
Besides, I just assumed

678
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,260
that as a local,

679
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,040
you were taking some secret shortcut.

680
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,960
Don't look back.

681
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,860
This is actually a good spot.

682
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,800
What?

683
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,900
Look over there.

684
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,680
So...

685
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,060
you really thought

686
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,460
the person who invited you

687
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,520
to see the plum blossoms two years ago

688
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,540
was me?

689
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,400
That's why you treated me like that

690
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,120
when I first joined the company.

691
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:30,920
Yes.

692
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,000
Then later on, why did you...?

693
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,500
I mean, deep down, you believed

694
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,300
I abandoned you
when you had the accident.

695
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,880
I couldn't help myself.

696
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,900
I kept coming up with excuses

697
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,700
to convince myself.

698
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,220
Maybe Jiaqi didn't make himself clear.

699
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,580
Maybe

700
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,020
you were too young

701
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,020
to face

702
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,100
something so heavy,

703
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,100
so you just blocked it out.

704
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,020
There are medical cases
where people do that.

705
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,180
Or maybe

706
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,520
you just didn't know

707
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,420
my Chinese name...

708
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,540
since Jiaqi introduced me

709
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,340
as Vincent.

710
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,060
And maybe you just...

711
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,360
forgot what I looked like.

712
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,600
So you never connected me

713
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,520
with the person

714
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,020
from two years ago.

715
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,660
I found so many reasons...

716
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,140
and every single one...

717
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,140
was full of holes.

718
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,460
But I forced myself

719
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,680
to believe every one of them.

720
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,540
Because if I didn't...

721
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,260
how could I have let myself

722
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,180
pursue you again?

723
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,860
I'm not touched at all.

724
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,260
You didn't even ask me

725
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,600
and just pinned the whole thing on me.

726
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,820
Am I really that kind of person?

727
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,560
No, you're not.

728
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,300
But Xiguang...

729
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,540
I never imagined...

730
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,300
it could be anyone else

731
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,440
but you.

732
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,360
From the very beginning...

733
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,840
it never crossed my mind
that it wasn't you.

734
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,380
I'm so sorry.

735
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:50,820
If my dad hadn't accidentally

736
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,620
let it slip...

737
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,940
were you planning

738
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,159
on keeping me in the dark forever?

739
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,680
Actually, when I left Changbai Mountain,

740
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,200
I intended to talk to Shao Jiaqi

741
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,080
to clear things up.

742
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,380
But even then, I only thought...

743
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,840
that maybe he had

744
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,760
miscommunicated something

745
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,980
between us.

746
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,160
I didn't expect your dad to show up...

747
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,260
before I even had a chance to ask.

748
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,000
Why did you go...

749
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,780
so far away...

750
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,180
for so long?

751
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,560
How was I supposed to face you?

752
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,380
I lived my life believing

753
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,240
that because of you,

754
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,740
I'd never be able
to pick up a scalpel again.

755
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,980
I finally made peace

756
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,840
with that...

757
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,660
only to find out...

758
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,220
it was all

759
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,120
because of a stranger.

760
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,940
Because of a lie.

761
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,700
I don't even know

762
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,020
how to process that.

763
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,040
My life...

764
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,760
is nothing but a joke.

765
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,960
Xiguang.

766
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,860
When did you first meet him?

767
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,860
Winter vacation, junior year.

768
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,160
After that banquet,

769
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,860
when I went back to Nanjing.

770
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
So, it was even later than me.

771
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,800
These past few days...

772
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,640
I keep thinking

773
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,680
about what you said.

774
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,960
What did I say?

775
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,480
After New Year's Day,

776
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,460
when we had dinner

777
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,720
with Shengyi on Guanqian Street,

778
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,400
you said

779
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,440
you wished you had met me first.

780
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,380
But now,

781
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:26,960
I wish I had

782
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,200
met you later.

783
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,380
Then I wouldn't feel this resentment.

784
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,320
I wouldn't keep thinking about how...

785
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,300
if it weren't

786
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:37,880
for this cruel twist of fate,

787
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,000
we would have been together
a long time ago.

788
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,380
But...

789
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,600
it turns out I met you first.

790
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,500

but

not just on a whim...

802
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,680
and not out of some misplaced guilt
you feel.

803
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,320
It's not an impulse.

804
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,640
And it's not guilt, either.

805
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,180
It's just a normal office romance

806
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,260
that had a bit of a hiccup

807

Shouldn't that wrong turn
get you benched?

827
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,900
Since when was that a rule?

828
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,000
Since the last time
we were at the arcade.

829
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,080
Fair enough.

830
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,980
Then later on,

831
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm gonna give you
the wrong directions on purpose.

832
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,220
Hey, I just sat back and did nothing.

833
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,120
I didn't give you bad directions.

834
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,700
Don't make it sound worse than it was.

835
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,760
Oh, I'm definitely charging you

836
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,260
interest on that one.

837
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,260
So,

838
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,600
where are we headed next?

839
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,900
Are we still going
to the Mei Flower Garden?

840
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,320
No need.

841
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,420
From now on,

842
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,680

843
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,540
