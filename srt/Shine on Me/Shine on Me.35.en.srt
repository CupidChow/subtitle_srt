=Shine on Me=
(Based on Gu Man's novel 'Shine on Me')

10
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,124
=Episode 35=

11
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:43,151
Ms. Qian,

12
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:44,412
it's midyear.

13
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:45,672
Your property fee is overdue.

14
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,151
What does that have to do with me?

15
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:48,612
Go to whoever is necessary.

16
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:57,351
Gong?

17
00:01:58,172 --> 00:01:59,392
Why are you calling?

18
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,272
Did Chengyuan ask you to call me?

19
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,091
How is he?

20
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,351
Is he coming over now?

21
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:06,532
There's good news.

22
00:02:06,532 --> 00:02:07,791
The swindlers have been caught.

23
00:02:07,912 --> 00:02:09,452
But they've spent all the money.

24
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:09,971
Ms. Qian,

25
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,512
Mr. Nie was sick and hospitalized.

26
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:13,852
He's still recuperating.

27
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:15,512
I'll tell him the news.

28
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,612
But later he probably can't

29
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:18,832
take care of you anymore.

30
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:20,062
Don't contact him anymore.

31
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:21,072
He thinks

32
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:22,232
the house you live in now

33
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:23,952
isn't well-located.

34
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:27,012
I'm calling to tell you

35
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:28,862
that I'll take potential buyers
over soon.

36
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:31,031
I hope you empty it soon.

37
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:32,214
It's the best for all.

38
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:34,492
What?

39
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:37,332
Is he trying

40
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:38,691
to kick me out?

41
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:40,631
I can't accept that.

42
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:41,992
It won't be that easy.

43
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:42,691
Is Nie Chengyuan

44
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:43,452
at the company now?

45
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:44,371
I'll go see him now.

46
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:46,336
When Mr. Nie doesn't want to see you,

47
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:47,471
making a scene is futile.

48
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:48,792
If you make it ugly,

49
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:50,871
what you took before will be gone too.

50
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:51,552
Ms. Qian,

51
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:52,852
please think twice.

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,792
Think twice?

53
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,332
Nonsense!

54
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:00,952
Wanting me gone so easily?

55
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:02,072
No way.

56
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:05,191
The owner is eager to sell.

57
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,772
Buying this house
will be a good decision.

58
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,392
Its interior decoration

59
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:10,211
and location

60
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:11,112
are excellent.

61
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:11,631
The decor

62
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:12,191
might not be

63
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,012
the style I like.

64
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:16,172
Mr. Gong?

65
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:18,232
Hello.

66
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:18,832
Hello.

67
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:19,931
They're the buyers.

68
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:20,792
Hello.

69
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,751
The garden area looks quite spacious.

70
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,431
Is the house vacant now?

71
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:25,471
Currently...

72
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:27,272
I saw you from upstairs.

73
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:28,512
So I hurried down.

74
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:29,151
Hurry.

75
00:03:30,332 --> 00:03:30,832
Come on in.

76
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:31,811
- Someone's here?
- Let's go.

77
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:34,311
I've taken photos.

78
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:34,971
Please.

79
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:36,431
Come in quickly. Let's go.

80
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:44,471
Feel free to look around.

81
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:45,651
Feel at home.

82
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,095
I thought the house was empty.

83
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:49,992
Are you the owner?

84
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:52,552
Ms. Qian is the tenant.

85
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:56,651
Yes.

86
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:58,072
I'm the tenant.

87
00:03:58,512 --> 00:03:59,371
Not the owner.

88
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:00,672
However.

89
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:01,672
I've lived here

90
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:02,792
for several years now.

91
00:04:03,272 --> 00:04:04,591
If you want to know the details,

92
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:06,211
ask me. I know best.

93
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:08,172
So you're moving out?

94
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:09,012
Yes.

95
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:11,772
Actually,

96
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:14,832
I've grown attached to this place.

97
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:17,371
Hadn't

98
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:19,992
my husband

99
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,112
gotten sick here and died,

100
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:24,451
I wouldn't move out.

101
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:26,492
Someone died in this house?

102
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:28,732
What's wrong with you?

103
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:30,691
I warned you repeatedly

104
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:32,472
to investigate it thoroughly

105
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,451
to avoid such things.

106
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:35,212
A-And you've recommended me
such a house?

107
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:35,871
Aren't you

108
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:37,131
wasting my time?

109
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,532
We've already

110
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:39,811
made careful inquiries.

111
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:41,212
Mr. Gong,

112
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,951
what is going on here?

113
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:44,751
No one has died in this house.

114
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:47,511
Ms. Qian,

115
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:48,871
stop such nonsense.

116
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:49,912
Or you'll be

117
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:51,011
held legally liable.

118
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,672
I misspoke.

119
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:56,532
My husband didn't die here.

120
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:58,912
He got sick here

121
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:00,852
and died outside.

122
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:05,052
What kind of place did they even find?

123
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,352
Mr. Gong,

124
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:12,891
this isn't how you sell a house.

125
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:28,652
Ms. Qian,

126
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:30,612
Mr. Nie has been

127
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:32,292
more than fair to you.

128
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:33,592
Why did you do that?

129
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:34,751
At the right price,

130
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:36,412
selling this place is only

131
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:37,672
a matter of time.

132
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:38,912
Your little tricks will

133
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:40,511
only cause me some trouble.

134
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,212
They'll achieve nothing.

135
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:53,931
Mom,

136
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:55,092
what do we do?

137
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:57,371
Do we really have to move?

138
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:03,472
I doubt we'll stay here much longer.

139
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:06,511
Nie Chengyuan is truly heartless.

140
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:08,732
He ignores past feelings entirely.

141
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:11,571
That's just how men are.

142
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,011
Back then,

143
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,131
if he had met someone better off first,

144
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:16,811
he might

145
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,011
have dumped me faster than I dumped him.

146
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:22,511
Quick, pack up all our clothes, bags,

147
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:23,571
and everything else.

148
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:26,852
We'll reclaim the old place
we rented out and move in.

149
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:31,852
Anyway,

150
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,571
I've enjoyed these years.

151
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:36,112
I didn't lose.

152
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:42,691
How can you say that?

153
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,112
I was living perfectly fine before.

154
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:48,431
With our own place,

155
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:50,391
I could have found a stable job

156
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,648
and married a suitable husband.

157
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:52,571
But you

158
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,271
changed my life completely.

159
00:06:55,871 --> 00:06:57,131
You brought me here

160
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:58,571
and showed me all of this.

161
00:06:59,052 --> 00:06:59,852
And you said

162
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,011
you want us to go back?

163
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:02,391
How can I go back?

164
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:05,412
Do you know the strange looks

165
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:08,412
I get every day because of you?

166
00:07:09,652 --> 00:07:11,371
Everyone here looks down upon me.

167
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:13,912
But what could I do?

168
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,191
When I knew nothing,

169
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,391
you dragged me here.

170
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,311
I always comforted myself

171
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,871
that things would get better,

172
00:07:21,852 --> 00:07:23,792
and I'd have a bright and shiny future.

173
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,732
But suddenly, it's all gone.

174
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:31,811
It's like a dream.

175
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:34,352
Moving back to our hometown?

176
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:37,931
How will the old neighbors see me?

177
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:39,311
How will they laugh at me?

178
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,571
My life had just begun,

179
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:45,472
and you've ruined it.

180
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:46,571
Nianyuan.

181
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:48,131
Don't call me that name.

182
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,492
It makes me sick.

183
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,092
Mom,

184
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:57,431
you only ever think about yourself.

185
00:07:58,131 --> 00:07:59,592
You're so selfish.

186
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:20,712
If it weren't for you losing money

187
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,631
and dragging me down,

188
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:24,331
I'd still be living

189
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:25,912
a comfortable life now.

190
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:27,520
How dare you...

191
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:29,751
How dare you blame me?

192
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:31,571
I...

193
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:34,592
I won't give you a single cent
from now on.

194
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:49,592
Rong.

195
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:51,871
Siliang.

196
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:52,771
It's a weekday.

197
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:54,031
What brings you here?

198
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:55,212
Here on business?

199
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:56,832
Miss, what would you like?

200
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:58,212
A latte.

201
00:08:58,712 --> 00:08:59,271
Please wait.

202
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:02,092
I came to say goodbye.

203
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:04,952
Goodbye?

204
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:07,812
Where are you going?

205
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:09,312
Shenzhen.

206
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:11,391
My flight is tonight.

207
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:13,852
After packing my bags,

208
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:15,072
I realized I had some time.

209
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:17,440
Your place is on my way to the airport.

210
00:09:17,972 --> 00:09:18,891
So I came to see you.

211
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:20,832
Actually,

212
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:22,251
I planned to tell no one.

213
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:26,671
So you're

214
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:29,011
sent by the company?

215
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:31,511
No.

216
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:33,472
I got a new job.

217
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:36,291
Why the sudden

218
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:37,891
job change?

219
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:40,131
Sheng Yuan

220
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,291
is such a great company.

221
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:43,312
Many want in but can't.

222
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:46,732
I remember

223
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:48,371
I mentioned it last time.

224
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:49,712
I was working

225
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:50,891
with my boss on a project.

226
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:52,871
Right.

227
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:54,291
I only found out later

228
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:56,572
that one of the competitors

229
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,371
was Nie Xiguang's relative.

230
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,791
So my boss

231
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:02,271
asked me to approach Nie Xiguang

232
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:03,171
for information.

233
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,232
You didn't go, did you?

234
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:08,832
Of course not.

235
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:11,072
How could I possibly

236
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:12,791
lower my head?

237
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:14,751
Yeah.

238
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:17,212
You wouldn't.

239
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:22,891
Last week, the bid was opened.

240
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:25,171
My boss lost to them.

241
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:27,832
Lost to Xiguang's relative?

242
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:31,592
So your boss took it out on you?

243
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:34,212
Is that why you quit?

244
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:36,391
He took it out on everyone.

245
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:39,612
He didn't fire me, though.

246
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:41,832
What reason could he have?

247
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:43,492
If he had fired me,

248
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:44,288
it might be better.

249
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:46,171
I could've gotten severance.

250
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:48,612
I quit on my own choice.

251
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:51,232
He wasn't the kind of

252
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:53,232
capable, decisive boss I imagined.

253
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:55,332
I don't need to stick around.

254
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:57,151
Besides,

255
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:58,592
everyone knows

256
00:10:58,732 --> 00:10:59,791
his time is up.

257
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,171
Staying under him

258
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:04,171
offers me no room for advancement.

259
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,031
Well, getting a new job

260
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:09,592
does sound pretty good then.

261
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:12,852
But why go all the way to Shenzhen?

262
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:14,271
Couldn't you find a new job

263
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:14,952
in Shanghai?

264
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:21,651
I want a new environment.

265
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:04,251
When I graduated from university,

266
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:07,072
I always felt

267
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:09,051
we'd all stay the same as before.

268
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,572
But actually,

269
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:16,511
even in the same city,

270
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:20,452
we've drifted apart.

271
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:22,692
And now,

272
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:25,651
you're going even further away.

273
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:33,031
Did you say goodbye

274
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:35,511
to Zhuang Xu?

275
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:40,472
It feels like we said goodbye

276
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:43,031
a long time ago.

277
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,572
During senior year job hunting,

278
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,492
I truly believed

279
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:57,992
Nie Xiguang didn't tell me

280
00:12:57,992 --> 00:12:59,131
about my interview call.

281
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:01,352
At that time,

282
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,791
I was both angry and excited.

283
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,171
I felt like

284
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,411
I'd finally caught her mistake.

285
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:11,671
I couldn't wait to tell everyone.

286
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:16,031
Zhuang Xu said

287
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,732
he was never what I cared about,

288
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:23,151
and he was just a tool

289
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:24,452
I used to feel superior.

290
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:25,791
Maybe I am just

291
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,531
a tool to you.

292
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:29,612
You use me to feel superior.

293
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:32,932
I was never the reason

294
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:35,754
she became your imaginary rival.

295
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:38,511
How could he say that?

296
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:42,072
Looking back later,

297
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,232
maybe

298
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:46,112
what he said was right.

299
00:13:47,812 --> 00:13:48,671
Maybe

300
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:50,912
he was never the reason

301
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,051
I cared about Nie Xiguang.

302
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:56,592
I've been trapped

303
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:57,712
in my own past.

304
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:12,592
Siliang invited Feng and me to dinner.

305
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,031
Then I found out about that.

306
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:15,312
Why did Rong insist

307
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,411
on going to Shenzhen?

308
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:17,852
Aren't there plenty

309
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:18,992
of opportunities here?

310
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:22,712
Her suddenly leaving
without saying goodbye

311
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,312
really left me feeling pretty sad.

312
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:29,852
Well,

313
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,871
I might not feel very sad

314
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:34,011
about her departure.

315
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:37,531
But it feels like

316
00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:40,031
the university days

317
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:43,531
have suddenly become truly distant.

318
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:44,972
Yeah.

319
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,011
Be it good or bad,

320
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,312
only memories are left behind now.

321
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,151
Everyone has their own choices.

322
00:15:55,732 --> 00:15:56,751
Wherever she is,

323
00:15:57,612 --> 00:15:58,531
she will do just fine.

324
00:15:59,051 --> 00:15:59,751
True.

325
00:16:00,312 --> 00:16:01,511
I won't worry about her then.

326
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,712
(I'm downstairs at your dorm.)

327
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:14,871
Head, I can't talk anymore.

328
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,092
I'm going out for dinner.

329
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:18,332
With your super handsome boyfriend?

330
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:20,832
Right.

331
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:23,712
And my family.

332
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:24,871
Cheers!

333
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:26,391
Come on, cheers!

334
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,692
We've won
that big project from Feng Teng.

335
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,511
Sit down and eat.

336
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:34,992
Yun,

337
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:37,271
you missed the celebration dinner

338
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:37,771
in Nanjing.

339
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:39,151
It was such a pity.

340
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:41,411
We partied until late at night.

341
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:43,212
I had unmovable plans

342
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:43,932
that day.

343
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:44,671
My bad.

344
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:45,791
A drink for me.

345
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:48,791
It's fine.

346
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,572
Now, it is our family celebration.

347
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:51,712
For such happy news,

348
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:52,871
don't we have to celebrate

349
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:53,692
multiple times?

350
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:55,112
Yes. Count me in.

351
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:57,452
Another one for me.

352
00:16:58,391 --> 00:16:59,492
I'm a simple person.

353
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:01,151
I'm thrilled that you

354
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,051
snatched that project

355
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:03,332
from Yuan Cheng.

356
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:04,811
Mom, Xiguang, you're amazing.

357
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:05,851
I toast to you.

358
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:06,912
What about me?

359
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:08,472
You didn't contribute.

360
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,111
You know everything,

361
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:10,972
you brat.

362
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:12,912
All you know is to butter up your mom

363
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:13,712
and Xiguang.

364
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:15,652
Dad, aren't you used to it yet?

365
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:16,652
Deep down,

366
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:17,652
you're not convinced?

367
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:18,591
No.

368
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:19,811
Not at all.

369
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:21,291
Your mom

370
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:22,472
is utterly wise.

371
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:23,892
I am completely convinced.

372
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:24,831
Y-You...

373
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:26,048
Stop trying to sow discord

374
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:27,291
to profit from it.

375
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:28,531
Come on.

376
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:29,611
Another round.

377
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:31,672
- Come on.
- Come on.

378
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:37,692
That's all for the first happy thing.

379
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,432
Now let's talk about something else.

380
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:40,892
Xiguang, Lin,

381
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:42,652
I didn't have time

382
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:43,851
to ask more back then.

383
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,791
What's this about you
buying an apartment?

384
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:51,571
Buying an apartment?

385
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:53,712
Yeah.

386
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:56,271
While we were
at the bid opening meeting,

387
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:57,212
they actually

388
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,051
went and bought an apartment.

389
00:17:59,331 --> 00:17:59,992
No way, Xiguang.

390
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:01,212
Are you getting married?

391
00:18:01,472 --> 00:18:02,611
Don't shout nonsense.

392
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:04,224
Xiguang and I

393
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:05,376
bought a place together.

394
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:06,720
Soon,

395
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,936
I'll be working at Songjiang's

396
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:09,376
Brain Science Research Center.

397
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,732
So we bought a place

398
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:12,091
close to both Xiguang's work

399
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:12,912
and mine.

400
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:14,152
Isn't that just for marriage?

401
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:15,992
That's the long-term goal.

402
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,751
For now, it's to avoid
a long-distance relationship.

403
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:20,851
Lin,

404
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:23,291
you don't seem rushed at all.

405
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:25,672
I am anxious,

406
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,571
but with a peaceful heart,

407
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,692
I'm not so frantic.

408
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,732
Besides, Xiguang is still young.

409
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:32,251
She just graduated.

410
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:36,611
Which developer built this place?

411
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:38,692
Let me see the floor plan.

412
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:39,831
I love seeing those.

413
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:42,932
A local developer in Suzhou.

414
00:18:43,392 --> 00:18:44,640
The next few photos are too.

415
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:49,751
It's still in Suzhou?

416
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:52,331
That's not close to your workplace.

417
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:53,172
It's fine.

418
00:18:53,392 --> 00:18:54,771
About a fifty-minute drive.

419
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:57,851
It seems closer to Xiguang's workplace.

420
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:01,311
Lin,

421
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:03,051
do you plan to commute

422
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:04,632
between Suzhou and Shanghai daily?

423
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,048
Yes, Ms. Jiang.

424
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:10,812
Won't you find that tiring?

425
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:13,412
Won't you feel like
you're sacrificing too much?

426
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:15,294
Driving from Songjiang to Lujiazui

427
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,251
or to my grandparents' place

428
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:19,452
could take longer

429
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:20,692
than getting to Suzhou

430
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,311
in rush hour.

431
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:22,712
So,

432
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:24,192
it really can't be called hardship

433
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:24,831
or sacrifice.

434
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:25,872
Furthermore,

435
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:27,331
seeing Xiguang every day

436
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:28,511
is my own need.

437
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:30,051
It's not sacrifice.

438
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,091
That line is perfect.

439
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,152
I need to write it down.

440
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:37,472
I can tell that
to my future girlfriend's parents.

441
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:38,051
Jiang Rui,

442
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:39,972
you haven't secretly

443
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:41,132
been dating someone

444
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:42,511
at university, have you?

445
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:44,152
No.

446
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:44,652
But if I do,

447
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:45,591
I'll tell everyone.

448
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:46,551
Alright then.

449
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:48,912
Next semester's allowance
stays the same.

450
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:49,632
No increase.

451
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:50,591
What?

452
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:52,551
You can't be that unfair.

453
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,152
How can it

454
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:54,492
be tied to my dating status?

455
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:55,791
I need an extra two hundred.

456
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,652
My current allowance

457
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,091
can't keep up with my

458
00:19:58,111 --> 00:19:59,672
growing need for cultural enrichment.

459
00:20:00,152 --> 00:20:01,152
Be specific.

460
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,432
Like occasionally playing games.

461
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:06,892
Not one cent more.

462
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:12,452
By the way,

463
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:13,251
Xiguang,

464
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:15,492
how did your dad react?

465
00:20:15,992 --> 00:20:17,872
Dad sent me a WeChat message,

466
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:19,111
saying, "Congrats."

467
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,031
How did you reply?

468
00:20:21,632 --> 00:20:23,571
At first, I thought,

469
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,132
since I only played

470
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:26,152
a small part,

471
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,552
I probably shouldn't boast.

472
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:28,892
But since he

473
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:29,831
congratulated me,

474
00:20:29,972 --> 00:20:32,031
I just said, "You are most gracious."

475
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:34,571
What about Lin's grandpa?

476
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:36,251
Did he say anything?

477
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:37,920
Before dinner,

478
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,136
I got a call from Grandpa.

479
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:41,056
He said he'll come see me
in Suzhou soon.

480
00:20:42,212 --> 00:20:44,152
Is he coming to Suzhou
to give you a hard time?

481
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:45,551
I'll face him with you.

482
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:47,168
It didn't sound like it.

483
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:48,172
But

484
00:20:48,392 --> 00:20:50,291
if he really is coming to lecture me,

485
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,270
I'll bring you along.

486
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:00,632
Thank you.

487
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:03,200
We'll weather the storm together.

488
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:15,331
With the recent announcing
of many supportive policies,

489
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:17,811
especially the six-point measures,

490
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:19,872
the prospects for the PV industry

491
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:21,091
have become very clear.

492
00:21:22,051 --> 00:21:23,311
At this moment,

493
00:21:23,311 --> 00:21:24,011
by introducing

494
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:26,051
new products
with technological advantages,

495
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,031
you will definitely capture

496
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:29,851
a larger market share in the future.

497
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:33,791
You've managed Shuangyuan very well.

498
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:36,611
I joined later.

499
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:37,851
If the company

500
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:39,271
can later secure orders

501
00:21:39,872 --> 00:21:40,652
and stabilize,

502
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:42,952
it's mainly because of your support

503
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:44,132
and Mr. Zhang's

504
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:45,652
and the employees' persistence.

505
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:49,172
No need to be overly modest.

506
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:52,591
Last time, didn't you ask me

507
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:53,664
about the name change?

508
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:54,771
Why isn't it changed yet?

509
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,591
Xiguang and I discussed it

510
00:21:59,311 --> 00:22:01,571
and decided
to secure a few orders first.

511
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:05,912
You two are thorough.

512
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:08,152
What's the new name?

513
00:22:08,472 --> 00:22:09,071
Guang Yu?

514
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:10,251
Yes.

515
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:15,492
A little game between the young couple,

516
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:18,172
but it sounds better than Shuangyuan

517
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:20,412
and is more fitting for a PV company.

518
00:22:23,432 --> 00:22:23,932
Grandpa,

519
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:27,551
besides that,

520
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,831
there's one more thing

521
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:30,208
I want to ask for your opinion on.

522
00:22:30,831 --> 00:22:31,571
What is it?

523
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:34,272
I want to establish

524
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:36,132
a fifteen percent ESOP pool

525
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:39,392
to motivate the company's
technical and managerial staff.

526
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:41,591
In the future,

527
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,051
I'll focus on medical research,

528
00:22:43,872 --> 00:22:44,851
and Xiguang will step up

529
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:46,672
in running the company.

530
00:22:47,952 --> 00:22:48,531
Therefore,

531
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:50,880
I plan for the equity incentive

532
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,212
to come solely from my shares.

533
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:53,872
No pro-rata dilution for others.

534
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:57,024
It's similar to the renaming matter.

535
00:22:58,091 --> 00:22:59,872
Since the shares are all yours now,

536
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,132
you make the decisions entirely.

537
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:04,652
However,

538
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:07,192
you must think it through.

539
00:23:07,732 --> 00:23:08,831
The company bylaws

540
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:10,271
clearly state

541
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:12,176
that decision-making power

542
00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:14,392
is absolutely tied

543
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:16,872
to shareholding percentage.

544
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:18,851
By doing this,

545
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:20,652
you effectively lose the ability

546
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:22,811
to compete with the Nie girl

547
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:25,511
for control of the company.

548
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:27,051
I understand.

549
00:23:27,912 --> 00:23:28,511
Thank you.

550
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:30,732
Regarding this,

551
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:32,791
has the Nie girl agreed?

552
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:34,560
I haven't mentioned it to her.

553
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:37,872
I wanted your opinion first.

554
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:41,031
You asked my opinion on renaming

555
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:43,571
and setting up the ESOP.

556
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:45,531
Then tell me.

557
00:23:46,531 --> 00:23:47,692
When you helped

558
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:50,452
the Nie girl's relatives

559
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:52,712
snatch the project

560
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:54,212
from Sheng Yuan's hands,

561
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:56,412
why didn't you ask

562
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:57,271
for my opinion then?

563
00:23:58,232 --> 00:23:59,091
About that matter,

564
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:01,571
how will you explain it to me?

565
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:05,192
Grandpa,

566
00:24:06,336 --> 00:24:07,648
the PV industry is struggling.

567
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:08,732
Opportunities are rare.

568
00:24:09,392 --> 00:24:10,972
We must seize any sliver of hope.

569
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:14,051
If Xingjie had approached me first,

570
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,892
we'd have supported him fully too.

571
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:20,591
Is that the truth?

572
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:23,232
Half and half.

573
00:24:25,392 --> 00:24:25,892
Well then,

574
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:28,912
what's the false part?

575
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:32,492
Xingjie wouldn't come to me.

576
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:34,611
So it was just empty talk.

577
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,032
And the true part?

578
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:38,412
If he did come to me,

579
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:41,392
how could we turn down business?

580
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:44,551
But we'd do it grudgingly

581
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:46,611
for the money's sake.

582
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:53,212
Look at you.

583
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:57,412
You've always been a smart kid.

584
00:24:59,692 --> 00:25:01,152
You and your cleverness.

585
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:04,432
If only Xingjie

586
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:09,111
had half your intelligence
and composure,

587
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:12,492
Sheng Yuan's future

588
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,232
could be entrusted to him.

589
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,692
The Feng Teng project

590
00:25:18,932 --> 00:25:20,571
is an assessment for him.

591
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:22,212
What I care about

592
00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:24,271
isn't just the outcome this time.

593
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:27,271
More importantly,

594
00:25:28,412 --> 00:25:29,932
I want to see the approach he takes

595
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,872
and the character he displays

596
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:35,531
in the process.

597
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:42,132
You're in good health.

598
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:43,632
The succession

599
00:25:43,912 --> 00:25:44,851
isn't urgent right now.

600
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:46,571
However,

601
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:48,551
I have an idea,

602
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:50,412
but I'm hesitant to share it.

603
00:25:51,271 --> 00:25:52,392
Speak freely.

604
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:55,692
Actually, I've wanted to suggest

605
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:56,992
grooming Xingxiu.

606
00:25:58,351 --> 00:25:59,031
Xingxiu?

607
00:26:01,888 --> 00:26:03,271
Both Xingle and Xingxiu are smart.

608
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:06,412
But Xingle has a flighty personality

609
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,232
and resists constraints.

610
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,291
Xingxiu is steady and reserved.

611
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,392
As a successor candidate,

612
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:15,912
Xingxiu might be more suitable.

613
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:41,311
Why isn't he back yet?

614
00:26:52,031 --> 00:26:53,432
When did you get back?

615
00:26:53,432 --> 00:26:54,511
Why didn't you tell me?

616
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:57,372
(Shuangyuan Photovoltaic)

617
00:26:57,372 --> 00:26:57,932
How did it go?

618
00:26:58,331 --> 00:26:59,331
Your grandpa has left?

619
00:26:59,692 --> 00:27:00,632
Did he scold you?

620
00:27:05,472 --> 00:27:09,392
I did say I'd go with you,

621
00:27:09,452 --> 00:27:10,892
but work came up.

622
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:14,672
The equipment is arriving in a few days.

623
00:27:14,672 --> 00:27:16,331
There's a lot to confirm.

624
00:27:19,331 --> 00:27:21,031
So you prioritize work now?

625
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:23,331
What will happen in the future?

626
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:27,152
Drop the act.

627
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:31,892
Actually, work wasn't the main point.

628
00:27:32,932 --> 00:27:34,011
I thought about it.

629
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:35,511
It was better for you two

630
00:27:35,652 --> 00:27:36,271
to talk alone.

631
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:40,392
Thank you for being so considerate.

632
00:27:41,492 --> 00:27:42,271
You're welcome.

633
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:43,291
Don't be too touched.

634
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:46,172
So did your grandpa scold you?

635
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:47,492
No.

636
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,672
I even made a request.

637
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:51,051
What request?

638
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:53,132
I invited Grandpa to officiate

639
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:53,952
at the company's

640
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:55,392
renaming and unveiling ceremony.

641
00:27:57,432 --> 00:27:58,511
Impressive.

642
00:27:59,031 --> 00:27:59,732
No big deal.

643
00:28:01,952 --> 00:28:03,071
Let's go. Time to clock out.

644
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:04,932
You stood me up today.

645
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:06,091
Treat me to dinner.

646
00:28:06,712 --> 00:28:07,212
Sure.

647
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:08,064
To the cafeteria.

648
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,271
I'll talk a bit of work

649
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:10,551
over dinner with Mr. Hua.

650
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:12,831
Forget it.

651
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:14,232
I just remembered

652
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:15,904
(Shuangyuan Photovoltaic)
I have some unfinished work.

653
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:18,551
No way.

654
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:19,791
Let's go.

655
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:21,291
Mr. Lin,

656
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:23,351
you haven't resigned yet.

657
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,172
And even if you do,
you're a shareholder.

658
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,492
How can you slack off?

659
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:28,811
Right now, the industry is booming.

660
00:28:28,851 --> 00:28:30,751
We need to race against time

661
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,031
to seize the initiative.

662
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,192
Let me see.

663
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:44,111
Xiguang,

664
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:45,692
you wouldn't

665
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:47,172
be a secret workaholic, would you?

666
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:48,732
Of course not.

667
00:28:58,152 --> 00:28:59,172
The kiss says you're not.

668
00:29:02,692 --> 00:29:03,611
When did you become

669
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:04,791
so childish?

670
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:16,172
The person I'm kissing hasn't changed.

671
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,071
So sure?

672
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:21,291
How about

673
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:22,872
you try kissing me again?

674
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,132
Still the same.

675
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:36,932
Xiguang,

676
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:39,751
I've wanted to confirm

677
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:42,111
something with you.

678
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:43,632
What?

679
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:45,672
Are you really interested in management

680
00:29:46,311 --> 00:29:47,672
and the PV industry?

681
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,811
Don't force yourself

682
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,611
for others.

683
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:53,351
Why would you worry about that?

684
00:29:54,912 --> 00:29:55,932
Of course it's because

685
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:57,212
I'm genuinely interested.

686
00:29:58,412 --> 00:30:00,412
But I still

687
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:01,892
don't have any grand ambitions.

688
00:30:01,892 --> 00:30:02,692
For example,

689
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:04,511
I don't plan on turning Guang Yu

690
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:06,251
into some giant corporation
in the future.

691
00:30:06,632 --> 00:30:08,271
I just want to do the best I can

692
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,972
with every task at hand.

693
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:12,892
Also,

694
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,271
after helping Aunt
secure that project last time,

695
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:16,132
I discovered

696
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:18,811
that I enjoy the feeling of winning.

697
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:22,732
I noticed that ages ago.

698
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:24,051
When?

699
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,031
Back at Changbai Mountains skiing.

700
00:30:27,932 --> 00:30:29,732
You had only been learning for two days

701
00:30:29,732 --> 00:30:30,816
but were in a hurry

702
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:32,096
to run off and practice alone.

703
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:34,311
You tried to secretly
become a master skier

704
00:30:34,492 --> 00:30:35,412
without me.

705
00:30:35,972 --> 00:30:36,912
That counts?

706
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:38,152
Of course it does.

707
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:40,172
We see the big in the small.

708
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:43,452
Let's go,

709
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:44,732

Meeting in the cafeteria.

711
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:49,732
Once we

712
00:30:49,888 --> 00:30:51,104
get through this busy period,

713
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:52,448
I'll slack off for half a month.

714
00:30:52,448 --> 00:30:53,031
No,

715
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:54,152
a whole month.

716
00:30:55,972 --> 00:30:56,652
How?

717
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:58,331
By using up all my accumulated

718
00:30:58,432 --> 00:30:59,071
vacation days,

719
00:30:59,071 --> 00:31:00,051
lying around every day,

going out, spacing out,

721
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,000
reading novels, and watching dramas.

722
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:05,251
With me?

723
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:06,851
Absolutely.

724
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:08,932
When I'm lying down watching TV,

725
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:10,892
I need someone to bring me snacks.

726
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:15,172
I'd rather be your pillow.

727
00:31:16,531 --> 00:31:18,331
A pillow that fetches snacks?

728
00:31:19,351 --> 00:31:19,851
Deal.

729

Of course you should unveil it.
