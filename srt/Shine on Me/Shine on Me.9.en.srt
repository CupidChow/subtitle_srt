00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,600
for these past few days, right?

193
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,580
Miss Nie,

194
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,820
since when did an owner

195
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,760
start pinching pennies like this?

196
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,720
Please, it's not like

197
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,060
you don't draw a salary yourself.

198
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,300
I'm just an employee,

199
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,300
of course I get paid.

200
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,040
I...

201
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,940
Fine, forget the overtime pay.

202
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,520
Can you just help me beat Level 5?

203
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,520
I'm totally stuck.

204
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,240
Okay.

205
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,680
You're not gonna do it now?

206
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,220
Don't let the simple controls fool you.

207
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,680
It's actually way harder

208
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,240
than the last game.

209
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,260
It's a real brain burner.

210
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,400
Come on, just do it.

211
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,440
I really can't get past it.

212
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,980
Wow, you're amazing.

213
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,700
Nie Xiguang,

214
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,900
have you noticed that you...

215
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,360
What?

216
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,040
You're almost ready to be discharged.

217
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,260
Mom,

218
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,280
I'm coming home tonight.

219
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,880
And I'm really craving
some pork rib soup.

220
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,760
Can't you go one day
without putting in an order

221
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,120
before you even step through the door?

222
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,260
Anyway, what's the occasion?

223
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,680
I got hurt.

224
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,600
What?

225
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,780
What happened? Is it serious?

226
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,520
It's fine, don't worry.

227
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,200
I'm much better.

228
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,880
I just

229
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,400
missed a step downstairs

230
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,760
and ended up twisting my ankle.

231
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,820
You're

232
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,760
a grown-up now.

233
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,840
Can't you be more careful

234
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,060
when you're taking the stairs?

235
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,120
Do you need the driver

236
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,380
to go to Suzhou and pick you up?

237
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,360
No need.

238
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,160
I'll just take the train

239
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,180
and then grab a cab home.

240
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,900
Gotta go.

241
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,700
Alright.

242
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,220
See you soon.

243
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,320
I once treated a patient

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,120
who fell off the top of a truck.

245
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,980
He landed right on a rock.

246
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,280
Skull fracture.

247
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,460
Intracranial hematoma.

248
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,480
Ruptured spleen.

249
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,540
He spent a month

250
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,160
in the ICU

251
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,060
before he was out of the woods.

252
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,600
He fell from a height

253
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,080
even lower than where you were.

254
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,580
Wait,

255
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,240
why the sudden

256
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,800
horror story?

257
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,460
Stop giving the people

258
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,480
who care about you a reason to worry.

259
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,300
I get it.

260
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,800
I promise it won't happen again.

261
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,260
Um...

262
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,840
Thanks for everything.

263
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,420
And tell Ms. Chen, thanks
for the delicious food.

264
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,880
She mentioned

265
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,100
that she really liked

266
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,440
the gift you got her.

267
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,760
I had Yin Jie

268
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,800
pick it up for me.

269
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,880
I'm glad she likes it.

270
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,100
Nie Xiguang,

271
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,800
you really struggle

272
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,500
with finding the key issue.

273
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,020
What's

274
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,520
the key...?

275
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,860
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

276
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,800
Mr. Lin,

277
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,180
can you help me

278
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,160
get rid of these?

279
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,460
My mom can't see any of this.

280
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,820
Where did this rain come from?

281
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,760
Aren't we going the wrong way?

282
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:17,920
It's coming down.

283
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
I'm taking you straight back to Wuxi.

284
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,600
I can just go to the station

285
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,660
and catch a train myself.

286
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,780
Where do you live?

287
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,620
Put the address in the GPS.

288
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,220
Your phone's locked.

289
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,740
Hang on.

290
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,520
There.

291
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,880
You wear glasses for driving?

292
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,620
Ever since the accident,

293
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,060
my eyesight was also damaged.

294
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,860
The rain makes it worse.

295
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,760
So, that crash

296
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,800
must have been pretty bad.

297
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,820
Mm.

298
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
You know,

299
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,280
you're actually pretty incredible.

300
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,220
How so?

301
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,040
Since you joined us,

302
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,180
morale at the office
has been through the roof.

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,740
It seems like

304
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,440
you're just a natural
at everything you do.

305
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,260
What's so funny?

306
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,360
I just got a compliment

307
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,180
from my future boss.

308
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,880
Am I not allowed to be happy about it?

309
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,940
I am not your future boss.

310
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,100
You never know.

311
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,300
Thanks.

312
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,240
I'm heading back, then.

313
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,240
Thanks again.

314
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,440
Drive safe

315
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,420
on your way back.

316
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,180
[Shuangyuan Photovoltaic]

317
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,780
Xiguang,

318
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,620
welcome back.

319
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,940
Sorry about that.

320
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,580
I hate that you guys
had to pick up my slack.

321
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,320
Don't worry about it.
It's not like you had a choice.

322
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,580
You're finally here, Xiguang.

323
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,940
You've filled right back out.

324
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,040
You must've gained at least 2.5 kg.

325
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,340
Your face looks so much firmer.

326
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,060
You're just being jealous.

327
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,280
Who wouldn't be?

328
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,780
While you were out there living it up,

329
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
my workload

330
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,720
literally doubled.

331
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,400
See?

332
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,280
Now you know

333
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,580
just how important I am.

334
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,400
Yeah, absolutely.

335
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,560
I promise

336
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,840
I'll never forget my key again.

337
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,160
Seriously, Yin Jie

338
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,200
is never going to live down

339
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,400
that "lost key" story.

340
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,280
Don't even start, Mr. Wang.

341
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,920
Last week, when I was
dropping off documents

342
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,840
for Mr. Wu in Finance,

343
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,720
he looked me dead in the eye

344
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,840
before I left and said, totally serious,

345
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,160
"Don't forget your key next time."

346
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,200
Just kill me.

347
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,060
You have no right to complain.

348
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,380
Nie really paid the price

349
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:50,960
for your mess-up.

350
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,080
Not really.

351
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,620
Nie,

352
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,140
you're all better now, right?

353
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,920
Yeah.

354
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,140
Actually, the whole department

355
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,380
wanted to drop by and see you,

356
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,540
but Mr. Lin said

357
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,800
you needed peace and quiet,

358
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,260
and a big crowd would be too much,

359
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,340
so we all stayed away.

360
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,260
Hope you don't mind.

361
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,660
Not at all.

362
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,040
Alright, morning meeting

363
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,720
in ten minutes.

364
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,040
Mr. Lin will be there.

365
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,980
- Okay.
- Got it.

366
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,900
Morning, everyone.

367
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,900
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Lin.

368
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,540
First of all,

369
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,060
let's welcome our colleague, Nie,

370
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,080
back to the team after her recovery.

371
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,080
Health comes first.

372
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:31,960
Nie,

373
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,420
you've got to be more careful next time.

374
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,360
Roger that.

375
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
I'm back and better than ever.

376
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,620
Don't hold back, bosses.

377
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,760
I'm ready for whatever you need.

378
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,160
I'll take you up on that.

379
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,160
The main focus

380
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,960
for Administration this week

381
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,180
is the quarterly review,

382
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,540
the annual summary,

383
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,560
and coming up

384
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,760
with a plan for the year-end party.

385
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,680
Lastly,

386
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,260
there's one more important thing.

387
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,360
I've been hearing some talk lately

388
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,520
that our department has bad "Feng Shui."

389
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,540
Feng Shui?

390
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,780
Who's talking such nonsense?

391
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,520
How come I haven't heard anything?

392
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,820
Who's spreading these rumors?

393
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,200
Even reached Mr. Lin's ears.

394
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,220
I'll check it out.

395
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,740
But seriously, what era is this?

396
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,460
People actually still believe in
that superstition?

397
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,020
Exactly.

398
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,660
But since I got hurt last month,

399
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,840
and then this month,

400
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,540
another colleague

401
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,240
"jumped off the building."

402
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,260
It's only natural

403
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,660
that people are starting to wonder.

404
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,420
So, I'm planning

405
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,820
a department dinner

406
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,760
this week

407
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
to shake off the bad luck.

408
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,840
This dinner

409
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,040
won't be on the company's tab.

410
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,260
Nie Xiguang and I

411
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,400
will be splitting the bill.

412
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Wait, why do I have to pay too?

413
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,780
Well, wasn't it the two of us

414
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,000
getting hurt in a row

415
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,680
that started the rumors
in the first place?

416
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,840
Does that make sense?

417
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,600
Don't make it sound

418
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,160
like we're having some illicit affair,

419
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,640
okay?

420
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,100
Expensive or not?

421
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,460
Do you think the place Mr. Lin picked

422
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,260
is gonna be super expensive?

423
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,420
Based on my reading of the stars,

424
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,940
you're definitely the type
who lives paycheck to paycheck.

425
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,180
Want me to lend you some?

426
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,860
Oh, so since you're reading the stars,

427
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,780
why don't you calculate this for me:

428
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,180
What happens if I "forget" my wallet

429
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,520
and leave Mr. Lin

430
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,060
to foot the whole bill?

431
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,760
I don't even need the stars for that.

432
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,880
I can feel it in my gut:

433
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,280
You'll be pulling
some serious overtime the next day.

434
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,320
Big time.

435
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,720
But honestly, don't sweat it.

436
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,380
With Mr. Lin's style

437
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,380
and integrity,

438
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,420
it's all talk.

439
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,280
He won't actually make you pay.

440
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,300
Note this:

441
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,140
Even if he will,

442
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,060
it won't be anywhere too pricey.

443
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,100
Forget I said that.

444
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,260
Aren't you guys coming up?

445
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,360
Okay.

446
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,740
I get it now.

447
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,380
The fancier the place,
the safer you are.

448
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,220
If it were just some hole-in-the-wall,

449
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,100
he might actually go Dutch.

450
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,420
But for a place this fancy,

451
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,660
there's no way Mr. Lin

452
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,400
would let you pick up the tab.

453
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,080

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,480
is a joint venture subsidiary

571
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,460
between Rimang Energy

572
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,720
and an offshore fund,

573
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,660
Devon Solar Fund.

574
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,160
Shortly after Rimang Energy

575
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,660
issued the domestic guarantee,

576
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,480
Devon

577
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,480
provided

578
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,180
a 300 million dollar

579
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,460
offshore bond counter-guarantee for it.

580
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,220
This effectively hedged

581
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,260
Rimang Energy's risk exposure.

582
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,380
Therefore, I believe

583
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,780
investing in Rimang Energy

584
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,540
carries controllable risk

585
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,380
with substantial returns.

586
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,620
Thanks, Chris.

587
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,840
Does anyone else

588
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,740
have anything to add?

589
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,240
Alright then.

590
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,420
Meeting adjourned.

591
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,580
[Huaya Bank]

592
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,220
Here are

593
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,060
the industry analysis reports

594
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,240
you asked for the other day,

595
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,240
covering what our competitors
have been up to

596
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,160
over the last two years.

597
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,240
Besides,

598
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,440
I've also put together
a five-year summary

599
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:14,840
of other...

600
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,360
Zhuang Xu,

601
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,640
what's your take

602
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,400
on the Rimang Energy investment proposal

603
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,000
brought up during the meeting?

604
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,140
Well, even though the AD/CVD policies

605
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,700
hit the PV industry harder than ever,

606
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,720
renewables is still a solid sector.

607
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,360
There are definitely good plays
to be made.

608
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,600
I'm sure

609
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,080
Risk Management

610
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,740
has provided

611
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,660
a very thorough background,

612
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,680
but since this involves
cross-border guarantees,

613
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,180
I'd still suggest we be extra careful

614
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,900
with the due diligence.

615
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,840
Okay,

616
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,000
I'll keep that in mind.

617
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,220
You can head back to work now.

618
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,360
The boss asked Risk Management

619
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,540
to conduct a second round

620
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,740
of overseas due diligence and an audit

621
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,420
on that Rimang Energy project.

622
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,180
I heard.

623
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,940
I mean, that guy

624
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,700
was in the boss's office

625
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,480
for quite a while this afternoon.

626
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,960
Honestly, I'm speechless.

627
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
Rimang Energy is listed
on the US stock market,

628
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,880
and with Devon's counter-guarantee,

629
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,700
its financial security

630
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,860
is beyond question.

631
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,140
A re-audit

632
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,980
just means

633
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,020
pushing back the acquisition timeline.

634
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,420
With a target this good,

635
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,140
other investment firms

636
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,080
could snatch it from under us

637
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,860
at any second.

638
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,140
His whole routine

639
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,660
is just pure paranoia

640
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,380
and making trouble out of nothing.

641
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,000
Forget it.

642
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,100
You can't be too cautious.

643
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,860
True.

644
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,720
But I really can't stand people

645
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,940
who won't say things to your face,

646
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,860
then sneak off to the boss

647
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,700
behind your back.

648
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,600
Maybe you're reading too much into it?

649
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,980
You didn't actually hear anything.

650
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,660
Besides, Zhuang

651
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,580
doesn't seem like that kind of person.

652
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,640
Why?

653
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,140
What, based on his looks?

654
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,000
Min,

655
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,060
don't judge a book by its cover.

656
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:34,680
Well,

657
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,200
he is incredibly handsome.

658
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,070
[Huaya Bank]

659
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,360
Hello?

660
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,200
Xiang Qun.

661
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,500
Really?

662
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,600
A wedding on the 2nd?

663
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,820
Congratulations, man.

664
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,100
You haven't forgotten
what you promised me

665
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,820
back in the dorms, have you?

666
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,260
You're not going
to be "too busy" for me, are you?

667
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,460
Of course not.

668
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,740
I'll definitely be there.

669
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,020
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

670
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,960
Keep at it

671
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,900
and win Siliang over as soon as you can.

672
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,860
That would be amazing.

673
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,780
We're all old friends here.

674
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,220
Am I not trying hard enough?

675
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,200
Maybe I'm just not her type.

676
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,220
Enough about me.

677
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,220
I hope you and Zhang Zhen
get married soon.

678
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,580
Yeah,

679
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,280
I will marry Zhen.

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,200
Marry her!

Zhuang Xu,

682
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,960
you have to be my best man.

683
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,200
I knew you were biased

684
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,040
toward Zhuang Xu.

685
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,060
You have to pick the eye candy
for the best man.

686
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,280
Sure.

687
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,620
I'll probably be the last one
to get married anyway.

688
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,880
I can be the best man

689
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,440
for all of you.

690
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,460
No way.

691
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,800
You're such a catch.

692
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,520
You could get married
in a heartbeat if you wanted to.

693
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,320
Exactly.

694
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,760
But what do I have

695
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,560
to offer her right now?

696
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,840
If I'd known "making peace" with him

697
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,040
meant working overtime every single day,

698
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,500
I might have just stayed "enemies."

699
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,720
Mr. Lin,

700
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,000
aren't you leaving yet?

701
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,400
Well, I'm heading out then.

702
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,760
Wait.

703
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,220
Mr. Lin,

704
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,020
I have a question.

705
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,840
Go ahead.

706
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,920
Why do you always make me stay late?

707
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,840
There are so many others you could ask.

708
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,040
Nie Xiguang,

709
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,940
your family

710
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:25,639
owns 49%

711
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,960
of this company.

712
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,900
Nearly half the profits

713
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,040
go straight into your pockets.

714
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,179
So?

715
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,100
So, making other people work late

716
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,960
makes me feel guilty,

717
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,460
like I'm exploiting

718
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,179
the working class.

719
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,139
But I don't feel bad

720
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,679
about making you stay, not one bit.

721
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:43,920
And one more thing,

722
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,179
Nie Xiguang,

723
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,639
when we're off the clock,

724
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,580
can you stop calling me Mr. Lin?

725
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,620
Why?

726
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,400
It makes me

727
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,120
feel like

728
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,980
I'm still working for you...

729
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,520
Lin Yusen.

730
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,960
Bye.

731
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,340
Nie Xiguang.

732
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,460
Come back.

733
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,720
What is it?

734
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,020
Did you

735
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,180
put that A Fu figurine

736
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,100
on my desk

737
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,020
this morning?

738
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,360
Yeah.

739
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Someone told me
I should "find the key issue."

740
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,900
While I was waiting at the station

741
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,000
on my way back to Suzhou,

742
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,780
the idea just hit me.

743
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,260
So I picked this up
right then and there.

744
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,580
Fifteen yuan. Don't mention it.

745
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,300
By the way,

746
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,540
that's actually meant for your car,

747
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,880
not to be left sitting on your desk.

748
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,580
Wishing it keeps you safe on the road.

749
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,440
You bought it back then?

750
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,040
Why give it to me just now?

751
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,080
Well, I've been busy

752
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,900
nursing the wounds

753
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,480
that fancy dinner left on my wallet.

754
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,180
Was the trauma that deep?

755
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,320
If you'd given it to me sooner,

756
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,600
maybe

757
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,980
I wouldn't have "forgotten" my wallet.

758
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,080
It's a private formula.

759
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:24,980
Care to try it?

760
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,540
What is it?

761
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,040
Herbal ointment for scars.

762
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,560
Got it from a friend.

763
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,260
It's

764
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,060
for fading those marks

765
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,120
from your accident.

766
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,440
It really works.

767
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,320
Thanks.

768
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,180
But it's really no big deal.

769
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,820
The marks will fade.

770
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,220
Maybe so.

771
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,300
But I'm worried

772
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,940
you'll use that as an excuse
to reject me.

773
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,640
Reject you for what?

774

[Wedding Invitation]

775
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,760
This is an invitation

776
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,840
to Mr. Lin's friend's wedding.

777
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,680
Wait, isn't this from the girl

778
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,220
whose screaming
made you fall off the balcony?

779
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,220
Yep.

780
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,180
He said

781
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,940
his friend

782
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,740
was just passing through Suzhou

783
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,680
to drop off the invite.

784
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,460
She saw me climbing the balcony

785
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,300
and it scared the life out of her.

786
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,020
Apparently, she has
a major fear of heights.

787
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,100
Mr. Lin said

788
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,020
she's been feeling guilty about it,

789
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,140
so she invited me

790
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,220
to her wedding.

791
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,380
It's in Shanghai on New Year's Day.

792
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,080
Should I go?

793
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,520
Of course you should.

794
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,440
Why pass up a free meal?

795
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,880
Wait, you don't have to
give a cash gift, do you?

796
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,340
Probably not.

797
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,180
But that's not the point.

798
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
How is that not the point?

799
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,740
Check out the names on the invite.

800
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,580
Your name is written

801
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,760
right next to Mr. Lin's.

802
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,080
That means you're off the hook.

803
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,080
You count as a "plus one."

804
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,900
But,

805
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,180
your name looks like

806
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,240
it was added later.

807
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,040
Well, obviously.

808
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,340
She didn't even know me before.

809
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,760
The handwriting is a bit awkward.

810
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,880
Maybe the invites

811
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,800
were all written by someone
with nice handwriting,

812
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,460
and the bride added

813
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,960
your name herself, I guess.

814
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,980
Perhaps.

815
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,620
It's not like

816
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,780
Mr. Lin added it himself.

817
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,440
His handwriting

818
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,420
is way better than this.

819
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,300
What are you even thinking?

820
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,380
Why would he trick me
into going to a wedding?

821
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,240
True.

822
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,960
Anyway, it's a free ride,

823
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,700
so you're definitely going.

824

Dress to impress.

825
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,540
The mission is simple:

Eat, drink, and be merry, all for free.

Calm down.

Seriously, Yin Jie,

829
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,800
why are you more excited than Xiguang?

00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,400
I've been watching their story unfold

831
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,420
from day one.

832
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:52,880
Don't you get it?

833
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,060
Now Xiguang and Mr. Lin

834
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,480
are going to a wedding together.

835
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,720
You know what they call that?

836
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,160
"Affection blooming
in the face of adversity."

837
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,540
Xiguang,

838
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,020

00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,480
that "jumping off" a balcony
is what it takes

to change his mind about you,

841
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,060
you should've jumped ages ago.

842
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,680
I...

843
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,920
If I told you that jumping
from the second floor

844
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
would get you a promotion,

845
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,020
would you do it?

846
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,400
How big of a promotion?

847
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,120
I'll have to give that some thought.

851
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,780
the sudden call?

852
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,600
Listen to you.

853
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,000

out of the blue

855
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,700

00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,340
Well,

858
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,980
since we last talked.

859
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,400
Fair enough.

860
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,340
So, what kind of "bonding"
are we talking about?

861
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,880
What else could it be?

The reason I've been MIA lately

863
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,440
