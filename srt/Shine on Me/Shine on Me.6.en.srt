[Episode 6]

12
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,060
Mr. Lin.

13
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll head back

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,560
and touch base with Mr. Ba
at Shengyuan Finance.

15
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,920
Mr. Lin.

16
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,150
Do you

17
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,039
have a moment?

18
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,090
Shut the door.

19
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,090
What's the matter?

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,870
I wonder how he'd look

21
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,970
in a white lab coat.

22
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,020
Here's the thing.

23
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,430
I've noticed

24
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,300
a clear breach of company regulations.

25
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,250
If we don't

26
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,410
fix this,

27
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,800
it's going to seriously undermine

28
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,000
our credibility.

29
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,750
Be more specific.

30
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,240
Yin Jie, Yuhua, and I joined
way before the new hire did.

31
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,130
But Logistics went ahead
and gave the Building 1 dorm

32
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,000
to him.

33
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,930
You came to me

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,740
just for this?

35
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,020
Yeah.

36
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:22,800
Mr. Tong,

37
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,630
come to my office.

38
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,460
I'm so sorry.

39
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,780
This was a complete oversight
on our part.

40
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,620
We were only looking
at the new application forms

41
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,560
and completely overlooked the staff

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,460
who joined earlier.

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,470
It's fine.

44
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,000
I just hope

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,240
you can get this sorted out
as soon as possible.

46
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,579
Well...

47
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,680
he's moved in.

48
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,690
We'll have to talk to him first.

49
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,250
It might be...

50
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,300
Your oversight

51
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,740
did indeed cause trouble for others.

52
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,340
An apology is in order,

53
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,020
and you should make
the proper arrangements.

54
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,970
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,360
But I just ran into Mr. Mo

56
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,370
on my way here.

57
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,180
What does Mr. Mo have to do with this?

58
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,269
Mr. Mo.

59
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,480
I see.

60
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,620
But someone

61
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,300
has brought this to my attention.

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,010
If we don't handle this properly,

63
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,420
I'm afraid it won't sit well
with the team.

64
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,190
Of course,

65
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,430
we'll stick strictly to company policy.

66
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,390
This was

67
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,860
a massive oversight by Logistics.

68
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,330
It's got nothing to do with you.

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm sure the others

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,120
won't hold it against you.

71
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,800
I'll go talk

72
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,220
to him right away

73
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,690
and get the dorms sorted out.

74
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,690
There's just one thing, though.

75
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,800
We only have one room available,

76
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,040
with only two beds.

77
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,510
But there are three of you.

78
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,920
How should we split it?

79
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,890
The other two will move there.

80
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,250
Understood, Mr. Lin.

81
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,160
I'll go handle the arrangements now.

82
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,220
Miss Nie,

83
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,390
got any issues

84
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,060
with the way I handled that?

85
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:28,950
Not at all.

86
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,160
I figured as much.

87
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,300
Since you're so set on

88
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,130
playing the "commoner,"

89
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,870
I'm sure you won't mind

90
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,870
a bit of a downgrade
in living standards.

91
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,000
I finally figured out

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,510
why he's always giving me a hard time.

93
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,070
Why is it that every cute guy

94
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,270
I meet

95
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,570
just has to make my life miserable?

96
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,130
Isn't that a good thing?

97
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,040
If a knockout
were giving me a hard time,

98
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,420
I'd be thrilled.

99
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,300
Jiang Rui.

100
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,980
Didn't you ask him

101
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,120
how he found out who you really are?

102
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,620
Of course I did.

103
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,130
But you really think he'd just

104
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:08,930
play along and tell me?

105
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,890
It's not really

106
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,770
that much of a surprise.

107
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,450
He was transferred

108
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,130
from HQ, after all.

109
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,010
It's only natural

110
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,890
he'd know you were here.

111
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,540
It's just his attitude
that's so annoying.

112
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,450
Xiguang.

113
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,100
He's a surgeon

114
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,130
who made DM

115
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,510
in just one year.

116
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,510
Doesn't that strike you

117
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,300
as odd?

118
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,680
I've thought about it.

119
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,130
But it's not like

120
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,300
it has anything to do with me.

121
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,220
No.

122
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,130
Maybe it's got nothing to do with you,

123
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,000
but what about your dad?

124
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,240
I heard

125
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,190
the infighting at Shengyuan

126
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,190
has been pretty bad
these last few years.

127
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,270
The old man

128
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,190
is about to name his successor,

129
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,070
and he's got a lot of sons.

130
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:38,920
Your dad

131
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,540
is close with his eldest,

132
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,060
Sheng Bokai.

133
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,000
We don't know

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,060
whose side your boss's on,

135
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,370
but he's definitely not

136
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,120
in Sheng Bokai's camp.

137
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,620
So, I've been thinking

138
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,310
you're just caught in the crossfire.

139
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,659
No way.

140
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,159
I just don't get the feeling

141
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,010
that he's the type

142
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,540
to take out his frustrations on others

143
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,560
just because of some power struggle.

144
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,950
He's got this aura about him,

145
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,600
like he's completely

146
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,740
above all that.

147
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,360
He used to be a doctor, right?

148
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,750
He seems like the kind

149
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,890
who's far too principled
to ever take a bribe.

150
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,180
Seriously, Xiguang?

151
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,800
After how he treated you,

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,310
you're still saying he's a good guy?

153
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,860
Sounds like you're catching feelings,

154
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,390
Xiguang.

155
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,010
That's a completely separate issue.

156
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,930
Jiang Rui.

157
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,660
Shanghai isn't far from Suzhou.

158
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,860
It's only ten minutes away
by high-speed rail.

159
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,120
Don't be surprised if I show up
at your school to "visit".

160
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:30,950
Alright,

161
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,560
I'm done messing with you.

162
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,100
I'll stop.

163
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,430
But you're right.

164
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,120
Those people play dirty.

165
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,100
If he really wanted
to make your life miserable,

166
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,620
he wouldn't make it this obvious.

167
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,430
He's way too smart for that.

168
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,130
Are you calling me stupid?

169
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,010
Of course not.

170
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,540
But in that case,

171
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,240
I think there's only

172
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,070
one possibility left.

173
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,310
Did you do something bad

174
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,220
that gave him

175
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,180
a really bad impression?

176
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,070
No way.

177
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,750
I...

178
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,190
Tell me everything.

179
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,750
In your dreams.

180
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,300
I'm hanging up.

181
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,370
Why are you guys just sitting there?

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,010
Get your stuff together
and move into the new dorm.

183
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,289
Dorm Management called

184
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,530
right before they clocked out.

185
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,890
They said the room in Building 1

186
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,289
have been cleared and cleaned.

187
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,620
Talk about efficiency.

188
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,010
Only Mr. Lin could pull that off.

189
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,980
Xiguang,

190
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,750
we can't take the room.

191
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,390
I feel terrible already

192
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,440
for not backing you up

193
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,370
when you went to see Mr. Lin today.

194
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,410
You were the one who stepped up,

195
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,120
but we're the ones getting the perks.

196
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,370
It just doesn't feel right.

197
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,620
Going to see Mr. Lin was my own choice.

198
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,050
It's totally normal

199
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,000
that you didn't react in time.

200
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:12,890
Besides, Mr. Lin

201
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,860
works me to the bone every day.

202
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,500
I just wanted to make him

203
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,600
do some actual work for once.

204
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,650
It's not on you.

205
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,100
Plus, the final decision
on who gets Building 1

206
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,620
was based on who joined first.

207
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,820
If I moved in,

208
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,770
it wouldn't be fair.

209
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,220
But I...

210
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,000
No buts.

211
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,580
Come on.

212
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,700
I'll help you pack.

213
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,940
Let's get over there

214

[Huaya Bank]

216
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,530
Mr. Ba,

217
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,290
why are you calling me at this hour?

218
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,600
Don't tell me you're
pulling overtime like I am.

219
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,890
Go ahead, I'm listening.

220
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:53,940
Okay.

221
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,460
Mr. Ba,

222
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,010
is this coming

223
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,980
from Mr. Sheng Bokai himself?

224
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,130
Don't worry about the details.

225
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,630
I just want to make sure

226
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,220
I don't mess this up.

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
Actually, the problem
is if you do it too well.

228
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,010
With the PV market as it is,

229
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,500
it'd be unfair

230
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,370
to ask for a real favor.

231
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,290
We definitely don't want

232
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,100
to make things difficult for you.

233
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,130
But our subsidiary

234
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,170
is practically begging us.

235
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,050
We have to at least look like

236
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,860
we're doing something.

237
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,130
I get it.

238
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,220
That's easy then.

239
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,940
I'll just send someone over
to go through the motions.

240
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,320
Mr. Song,
you're a real straight-shooter.

241
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,410
Some other time,

242
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,860
when Mr. Sheng is available,

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,770
let's grab a drink together.

244
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,480

00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,170
over in Suzhou

called

253
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,340

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,050
I'll get on it right away.

265
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,010
and even a washing machine.

00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,720
Let's get settled. It's getting late.

267
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,840
I'll give the washer
a good scrub tomorrow

268
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,580
and disinfect it.

269
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,270
Xiguang,

270
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,010
you should do your laundry here

271
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,910
from now on.

272
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,870
You bet.

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,030
I'm still a bit worried, Xiguang.

274
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,240
Are you sure Mr. Lin
won't hold this against you?

275
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,130
Even if he does,

276
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,010
it won't be over something like this.

277
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,000

I've already put Finance
in touch with him.

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,270
Where are we?

567
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,180
Ping'an Temple.

568
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,270
She

569
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,740
must be carsick

570
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,290
and needs to get some fresh air.

571
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,200
Well,

572
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,480
thank you for the ride, Mr. Lin.

573
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,000
Thanks, Mr. Lin.

574
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,460
Bye, Mr. Lin.

575
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,220
Mr. Lin is actually such a nice guy.

576
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,850
I thought he'd drop us off

577
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,900
the second we hit Shanghai

578
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,750
and make us call a cab.

579
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,680
He probably just saw Xiguang

580
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,220
sleeping like a log

581
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,940
and felt bad kicking us out.

582
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,550
That was such a missed opportunity.

583
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,720
It's the weekend.

584
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,700
Couldn't you have just said a few words

585
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,720
to smooth things over?

586
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,400
I don't need to suck up to him.

587
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,680
Why are you being so stubborn?

588
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,420
Hey, don't argue in front of the temple.

589
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,790
Let's just go in.

590
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,050
Who's arguing?

591
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,290
Whoever picks a fight is a loser.

592
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,530
You're the loser.

593
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,960
I'm not going in.

594
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,220
Wait, what? We're already here.

595
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,350
I made a decision.

596
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,700
I'll only pray to the Buddha
back in my hometown.

597
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,110
I've got to remain faithful.

598
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,750
So, I'm not going in. Period.

599
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,660
Fine, I'll go in with you,

600
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,070
since we're already here.

601
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,290
But from now on,

602
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,570
whenever Yin Jie and I get into it,

603
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,240
you have to back me up.

604
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,680
For sure.

605
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,880

the rest of the inventory.

610

Why?

611

I've already mapped out our day.

627
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,180
First, a stroll along the Bund,

628
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,590
then straight to City God Temple

629
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,660
for xiaolongbao, salted vegetable rice,
and pork bone soup.

630
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,640
The ultimate Shanghai experience.

631
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:33,810
Let's move.

How about we just head
to City God Temple

634
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,070
for some xiaolongbao?

635
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,530
I'm down.

City God Temple is way closer,

642
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,680

going on right now.

no matter which side you're on.

753
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,050
If the water is too clear,
there will be no fish.

754
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,010
Tightening the leash too much

755
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,710
will only end up

756
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,010
crushing their morale.

757
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,130
I grew up watching you

758
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,030
run the show.

759
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,570
I understand the rules of the game.

760
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,000
But from what I've seen,

761
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,780
it's clear this is having some blowback

762
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,630
inside the company.

763
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,380
Before 2009,

764
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,460
Shuangyuan's PV glass supplier

765
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,030
was always

766
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,760
Qicai Glass,

767
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,630
an Aiyue Group subsidiary.

768
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,500
But after 2009,

769
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,730
Procurement switched to imports.

770
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,300
They're more expensive

771
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,440
and have shorter payment terms,

772
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,000
yet in terms of quality,

773
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,280
there's no real difference.

774
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,940
If it were just about price

775
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,860
and terms,

776
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,690
I'd stay quiet

777
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,610
just to keep the peace.

778
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,400
[Purchase and Sale Agreement]

779
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,360
But Aiyue and Shengyuan

780
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,000
are old partners.

781
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,510
For Procurement

782
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,760
to risk a partnership like that

783
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,050
over some measly kickbacks,

784
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,530
it's just bush league.

785
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,300
Aiyue Group? Since 2009?

786
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,260
Exactly.

787
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,530
Qicai Glass

788
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,570
is a pet project

789
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,610
for the Aiyue chairman's grandson.

790
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,210
You probably noticed

791
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,730
that starting in 2009,

792
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,030
Aiyue suddenly

793
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,300
went cold on us.

794
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,300
This is quite the paper trail

795
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,340
you've put together.

796
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,440
You've just been transferred to Suzhou,

797
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,980
and you're already hunting for heads.

798
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,170
Tell me.

799
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,530
What else

800
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,650
did you find on this person?

801
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,670
Nothing gets past you, does it?

802
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,360
He called me unprofessional

803
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,550
in front of the staff.

804
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,510
Said I can't lead.

805
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,000
Don't I have any pride?

806
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,440
So you just want to pull the rug out

807
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,090
from under him?

808
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,340
Immature.

809
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,260
You've got to learn
to play the long game.

810
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,420
I'll

811
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:15,940
handle this.

812
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,550
You stay out of it.

813
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,400
Thanks, Grandpa.

[Shengyuan Group]

815
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,570
Dig up some dirt on him

816
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,170
from his time at Shengyuan.

817
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,630
Don't tie Shuangyuan

818
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,570
to the grounds for the investigation.

819
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,380
You're still

820
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,000
shielding Yusen.

821
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,000
Or Bokai

822
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,010
would get the wrong idea.

823
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,940
Why else

824
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,650
would he come to me?

825
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,960
With all the dirt he's got,

826
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,130
he could've finished the job himself.

827
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,670
Not necessarily.

828
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,150
He holds you in such high regard

829
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,590
and would never act
without checking with you first.

830
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,360
He's

831
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,130
thorough, sharp,

832
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,480
a natural-born player.

833
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,130
Such a pity.

834
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:12,630
Seriously,

835
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,920
I'm

836
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,630
at capacity.

837
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,440
So

838
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,400
where to next?

839
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,480
There's a café right nearby.

840
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,690
Their afternoon tea is famous.

841
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,840
Want to head over and hang out?

842
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:28,840
Please, no.

843
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,650
I'm begging you.

844
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,960
Can we please do something else?

845
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,630
But their cakes are amazing.

846
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,380
Especially the strawberry mille-feuille.

847
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:43,690
No way.

848
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,170
I'm full up to my neck.

849
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,460
But my knees really hurt.

850
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,190
I can't walk another step.

851
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,000
Stop being such a brat.

852
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,570
Even though Xiguang started this,

853
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,090
Yin Jie,

854
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,940
you have zero self-control.

855
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,150
Weren't you supposed to be on a diet?

856
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,690
All those days of starving yourself
went down the drain.

857
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
That's exactly

858
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,500
why I'm like this.

859
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,690
Do you have any idea

860
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,840
what it's like to stare

861
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,280
at your favorite food

862
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,230
and not be allowed

863
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,920
to touch it?

864
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,550
The more you suppress the urge,

865
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,050
the harder

866
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,070
it is to control.

867
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,480
Then you'll just snap.

868
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,420
The more you hold it in,
the harder it is to resist.

869
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,130
If I just hadn't seen the food at all,

870
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:55,800
I would've been fine.

871
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,820
You people who've never dieted

872
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,880
wouldn't understand.

873
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,210
The more you hold it in,

874
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,480
the harder it is to resist?

875
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,670
Exactly.

876
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,780
So, a sudden impulse isn't something

877
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,590
to be ashamed of.

878
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,760
It doesn't mean you're weak,

879
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,630
right?

880
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,840
Of course not.

881
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,980
It's just a buffer.

882
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,440
A way of taking things slow.

883
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:24,710
Thank you.

884
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,480
For what?

885
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:27,920
I think my love handles

886
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,690
should be the one thanking you.

887
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:33,730
Xiguang,

888
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,570
you've been staring out there forever.

889
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,570
See any hot guys?

890
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,500
I haven't seen a single one.

891
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,630
I've been watching that building

892
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,610
across the street,

893
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,510
but it's just security guards

894
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,610
going in and out.

895
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,230
I've been meaning to ask,

896
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,070
it's Saturday, right?

897
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,820
Hot guys don't work on Saturdays.

898
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,210
Oh, right.

899
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,320
It is Saturday.

900
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,550
If it weren't Saturday,

901
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,960
how would we have time
to come to Shanghai?

902
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,570
All this overtime
has turned my brain into mush.

903
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,050
Xiguang really led us
on a wild goose chase.

904
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,300
Xiguang,

905
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,960
just admit it.

906
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,070
You're a total foodie.

907
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,710
You just came here for the food.

908
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,710
I'm sorry.

909
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,730
What are you apologizing for?

910
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,210
I'm having a blast

911
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,280
eating all this.

912
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,630
Let's keep going.

913
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,480
Anyway, the calories are already in.

914
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,280
