Coming from a humble background,

right after junior high.

Uncle was a college student back then.

He joined a design institute
the moment he graduated.

18
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,420

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,460
After the meeting,

193
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,720
we can take you all

194
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,740
on a tour of our plant

195
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,100
to see

196
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,500
our PV cell products.

197
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,620
That would be perfect.

198
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
This afternoon, we're planning

199
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,160
to head out
to the Intelligent Digital Center site

200
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,040
for another survey.

201
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,940
Would you guys be interested
in joining us?

202
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,820
I'd actually love to go

203
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,480
and get a feel

204
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,360
for the geography

205
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,280
and lighting conditions over there.

206
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,340
But

207
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,580
I

208
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,080
have a meeting
with the equipment manufacturers

209
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,200
and can't get away.

210
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,900
In that case, Mr. Lin, Nie,

211
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,480
you should go along.

212
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,040
- Okay.
- Alright.

213
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,440
Our company

214
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,040
has a good deal of experience.

215
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,140
It's crucial

216
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,900
to distinguish

217
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,360
between BIPV

218
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,040
and BAPV.

219
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,720
We have some expertise in that area.

220
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:54,700
Okay.

221
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,800
I'll take everyone to the plant

222
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,320
since I was heading back anyway.

223
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,740
I've been there before,

224
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,780
so I'll skip it today.

225
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,060
I need to discuss some things

226
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,220
with Mr. Zhang, Mr. Lin, and Nie.

227
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,120
Give me a shout
when you're done with the tour.

228
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,120
We'll meet downstairs

229
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,240
and head to the site together.

230
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,260
Okay. Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Hua.

231
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,700
This way, please.

232
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,600
Please

233
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,220
come to my office.

234
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,640
Alright.

235
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,080
This is this year's
Shifeng Longjing Tea.

236
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,060
Ms. Shen, give it a try.

237
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,520
Okay.

238
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,860
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

239
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:24,980
Excellent tea.

240
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,460
Ever since Lin got here,

241
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,140
I've finally been able to sit back
and actually enjoy my tea.

242
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,880
It's just a pity
he has to leave so soon.

243
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:36,960
Fortunately,

244
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,380
Nie is very capable

245
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,380
and has stepped up to the plate.

246
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,380
I can still

247
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,560
sneak in a little downtime

248
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,360
here and there.

249
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,000
I heard from Lin earlier

250
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,700
that you were planning to go to the US

251
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,640
for a family reunion.

252
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,980
But now it sounds

253
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,780
like you're ready to put in
another ten years?

254
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,840
There's some good news

255
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,659
I haven't told you yet.

256
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,400
Mr. Zhang has decided

257
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,800
to postpone his retirement.

258
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,180
That's great.

259
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,260
Someone as energetic as Mr. Zhang

260
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,260
shouldn't be thinking
about retirement just yet.

261
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,180
Lin,

262
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,420
how did you manage to convince him?

263
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,700
It wasn't me.

264
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,460
Don't even get me started.

265
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,840
My wife kept nagging me to go to the US.

266
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,280
After Chinese New Year,
she lost her patience

267
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,540
and went ahead without me.

268
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,840
Then last month,

269
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,460
she came back in a huff.

270
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,840
She said our son's family

271
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,140
didn't make her feel welcome at all,

272
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,460
and she's never going back.

273
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,280
She told me I can do whatever I want.

274
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,380
I thought to myself,

275
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,980
"Well, isn't that just perfect?"

276
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,160
At my age,

277
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,539
who wants to go all the way to America
and deal with all that?

278
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,580
It's much more comfortable
staying right here.

279
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,080
Everything is familiar,
and you can't beat the food.

280
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,140
Exactly.

281
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,620
My son has been in the US
for over a decade,

282
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,700
and he only visits once every few years.

283
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
How can we ever be as close

284
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,600
as we used to be?

285
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,480
In the end,

286
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,380
you're just raising them to let them go.

287
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,220
Let's not talk about it.

288
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,460
The government

289
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,700
did an in-depth survey

290
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,980
of the PV industry.

291
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,020
I believe

292
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,000
our hard times are almost over.

293
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,420
The company is ready to take off,

294
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,620
and I'm not ready

295
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,780
to leave just yet.

296
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:05,980
Besides,

297
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,300
even if I were to retire,

298
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,840
I'd want to mentor Nie

299
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,400
until she can

300
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,080
hold her own.

301
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,780
Then I'll have to be a slow learner

302
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,140
so you can teach me
for a few more years.

303
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,600
I have two main points.

304
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,460
First,

305
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,760
Yuancheng and Shengyuan

306
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,740
are also among the bidders

307
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,840
for the Intelligent Digital Center.

308
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,120
If you get involved with us,

309
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,480
would there be

310
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,320
any conflict of interest?

311
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,940
Not for me.

312
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,340
I actually feel more fired up.

313
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,740
From what I know,

314
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,020
Grandpa put Xingjie

315
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,420
in charge of this project.

316
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,380
Nothing makes me happier
than giving him a hard time.

317
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,800
Thanks for giving me the chance, Aunt.

318
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,860
I figured you wouldn't mind,

319
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,520
but

320
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,720
I had to give you a heads-up anyway.

321
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,280
Second,

322
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,700
Fengteng isn't doing
a general contract for this bid.

323
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,320
The design and engineering bids

324
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,220
are handled separately.

325
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,140
We're bidding for the design.

326
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,640
Even if we win,

327
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,220
it won't be up to us

328
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,540
whether they use your PV products.

329
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,520
Of course,

330
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,500
during the bidding phase,

331
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,840
we will pay

332
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,900
the associated PV design fees.

333
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,040
And if we win the bid,

334
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,800
we'll do our best
to fight for Shuangyuan.

335
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,780
That's fine, Aunt.

336
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,060
The concept

337
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,740
of BIPV

338
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,060
is still in its infancy.

339
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,460
Being able

340
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,180
to make an appearance

341
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,940
at such a large-scale bidding event

342
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,920
is already very significant

343
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,060
for us.

344
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,960
If Chengrui wins the bid,

345
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
no matter who ends up

346
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,560
doing the engineering part,

347
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,980
it's good news

348
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,680
for the PV industry.

349
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,820
Very well.

350
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,400
That shows real vision, Nie.

351
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,760
Don't worry, Aunt.

352
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,060
If Chengrui wins the design bid,

353
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,220
we're confident

354
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,540
we can win the engineering bid
for the PV section too.

355
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,580
Okay.

356
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,280
It's beautiful here.

357
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,920
Aunt,

358
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,200
aren't site inspections

359
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,740
usually organized by the client?

360
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,240
Yeah, they are.

361
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,960
We've been here once already.

362
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,860
But Fengteng is a private firm,

363
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,720
so they're not as strict.

364
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,660
They allow bidders

365
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,600
to come back
for their own follow-up inspections.

366
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,380
We're just here to take another look

367
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,200
and gather some extra data.

368
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,920
Let's talk while we walk.

369
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,480
Okay.

370
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,380
Durand's design

371
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,560
is truly magnificent.

372
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,240
I have total confidence

373
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,680
that we'll win the bid hands down.

374
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,220
Your design

375
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,320
is truly magnificent.

376
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,300
I have total confidence

377
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,020
that we'll win the bid hands down.

378
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,420
Let's hope so.

379
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,200
It's always been a dream of mine

380
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,160
to leave my mark

381
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,260
on a beautiful land like China.

382
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,500
Let's hope so.

383
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,160
It's always been a dream of mine

384
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,380
to leave my mark

385
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,180
on a beautiful land like China.

386
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,140
Our joint work

387
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,720
will be standing here very soon.

388
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,540
Our joint work

389
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,420
will be standing here very soon.

390
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:43,880
Sir,

391
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,720
that man walking toward us

392
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,540
looks like Mr. Lin.

393
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,340
Which Mr. Lin?

394
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,980
What is he doing here?

395
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,700
Every time I run into him,
it's nothing but trouble.

396
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,420
The woman in the blue suit

397
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,240
is Ms. Shen from Nanjing Chengrui
Architectural Design Studio.

398
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,060
She's one of our competitors
this time around.

399
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,760
A tiny outfit like Chengrui

400
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,380
doesn't even belong
in the same league as us.

401
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,400
I have no idea what strings they pulled

402
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,760
just to make it

403
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,680
past the pre-qualification round.

404
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,520
What bad luck.

405
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,900
Small world, isn't it?

406
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,320
Yusen,

407
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,260
what brings you here?

408
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,280
I brought my design team to Suzhou

409
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,380
for another site visit.

410
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,500
I was actually just wondering

411
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,920
if I should hit you up for a free meal.

412
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,280
Xingjie,

413
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,660
you're in Suzhou

414
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,880
and you didn't even give me a heads-up?

415
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,060
I should've at least played
the good host.

416
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,980
Well, I figured you had your hands full.

417
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:48,800
Besides,

418
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,200
I heard you've handed everything

419
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,880
at Shuangyuan over to Miss Nie.

420
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
You lucky dog.

421
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,540
From now on, you can relax a bit.

422
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,100
You bet.

423
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,160
Isn't this Ms. Shen from Chengrui?

424
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,240
My apologies.

425
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,120
I was so caught up
catching up with Yusen

426
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,820
that I didn't even see you there.

427
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,880
Sheng Xingjie.

428
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,700
Nice to meet you.

429
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:11,880
Hello.

430
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,740
Mr. Sheng,

431
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,300
you are always the center of attention.

432
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,300
So young and accomplished.

433
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,560
You're far too kind, Ms. Shen.

434
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,320
Ms. Shen,

435
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,860
how do you two happen to be together?

436
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,560
Ms. Shen is Xiguang's aunt.

437
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,860
Since she's in Suzhou,

438
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm going to make sure
she's well taken care of.

439
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,340
Look at my memory.

440
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,580
I completely blanked on that.

441
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,980
Well, since she's so close to Miss Nie,

442
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,680
it makes sense you'd be running around

443
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,200
playing the devoted assistant.

444
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,140
Gotta keep her happy, right?

445
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,320
Exactly. I'm just playing tour guide
for the day.

446
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:47,800
By the way,

447
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,180
Ye Rong,

448
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,380
I heard you and Miss Nie
were classmates?

449
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes, Mr. Xingjie.

450
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,840
You should really

451
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,300
take a page out of Miss Nie's book.

452
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,260
Look at her.

453
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,100
She is about

454
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,180
to take the reins of an entire company.

455
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,680
Even her boyfriend
gets to enjoy the perks.

456
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,760
Mr. Sheng, I really can't take
that kind of credit.

457
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,040
I'm not running the company.

458
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,460
Even if that is

459
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,580
the plan eventually.

460
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,320
But for now,

461
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,220
I'm mostly just leaning

462
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,640
on my family's shadow.

463
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,360
I still need to work on my character

464
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,200
and put in the hard work.

465
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,820
I need some real achievements of my own

466
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,240
before I can really hold my head high.

467
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,400
Right now, I wouldn't dream of

468
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,220
showing off

469
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,240
or popping the champagne early.

470
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,500
Xingjie,

471
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,840
Xiguang has always been modest
and low-key.

472
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,560
See?

473
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,720
You've praised her so much

474
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,560
that you're making her blush.

475
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,540
You've always been sharp-tongued,

476
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,220
even when you were a kid.

477
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,680
But we're adults now.

478
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,680
You should probably start
thinking about your future.

479
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,240
I'd rather not.

480
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,340
I've already had

481
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,760
30 years of pure fun, haven't I?

482
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,020
I didn't realize you had

483
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,780
such a knack
for getting under people's skin.

484
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,940
You've known that for ages, haven't you?

485
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,240
And Mr. Nie used to "compliment" me
on it, remember?

486
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,960
True, but I think

487
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,360
that's the first time
I've seen it in action.

488
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,480
Impressive.

489
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,980
Right back at you.

490
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,860
You're pretty good yourself.

491
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,060
Right?

492
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,420
I was pretty snarky too, wasn't I?

493
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,180
Incredibly so.

494
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,220
Alright, you two.

495
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,620
Quite the double act.

496
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,340
Both of you are impressive.

497
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,520
Your uncle mentioned him to me

498
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,500
after that banquet,

499
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,460
but I didn't quite believe him.

500
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,240
He's from a prestigious family,
after all.

501
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,480
I never expected

502
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,080
the future head of the Sheng family

503
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,060
to be like this.

504
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,480
That remains to be seen.

505
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,540
The crown is still up for grabs.

506
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,840
Lin, do you want to...?

507
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,240
Not really.

508
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,140
I've got other things on my plate

509
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,880
and don't have time for Shengyuan.

510
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,080
Very well.

511
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,480
Spoken like someone with real ambition.

512
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,980
You were sharp

513
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,460
to keep quiet about our partnership

514
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,280
back there.

515
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,980
Of course not.

516
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,780
In our company, nobody
except the core team

517
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,000
will know a thing

518
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,900
until the bids are opened.

519
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,900
I thought we were out of luck

520
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,540
bumping into Sheng Xingjie

521
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,640
like that.

522
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,880
But he didn't seem

523
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,680
to suspect

524
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,580
a thing.

525
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,200
He just thinks I'm playing up

526
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,080
to my girlfriend's aunt.

527
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,060
I guess my reputation
as a devoted boyfriend

528
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,880
is pretty solid

529
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,120
and quite impressive, wouldn't you say?

530
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,640
You never miss a single chance

531
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,560
to brag about yourself, do you?

532
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,740
A firm the size of Chengrui

533
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,900
actually trying to compete with us?

534
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,620
They're punching way above their weight.

535
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,800
Still, Lin Yusen always seems

536
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,580
to get in my way.

537
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,020
I have to keep an eye on him.

538
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,440
Ye Rong,

539
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,520
since you and Nie Xiguang
were classmates,

540
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,600
find a chance to feel her out.

541
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,760
See if they've got any tricks

542
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,520
up their sleeves.

543
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,260
Will do.

544
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,400
[Huaya Bank]

545
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:09,420
Zhuang.

546
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,099
Man, you look

547
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,859
like a mess.

548
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,420
Is it because of those rumors?

549
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,900
Don't worry, nobody's buying it.

550
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,760
What rumors?

551
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,380
Well.

552
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,060
I have no idea

553
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,380
who started this,

554
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,560
but word is going around

555
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,300
that your team went
to Changbai Mountain for vacation

556
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,480
and you and Kevin

557
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,040
got into a huge fight over Chris.

558
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,660
Supposedly Kevin fell off the mountain

559
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,500
and ended up with a brain hemorrhage,

560
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,740
so you were forced to stay behind

561
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,740
and look after him for days.

562
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,900
Seriously, don't sweat it.

563
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,920
No one is taking this seriously.

564
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,120
The whole story

565
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,340
makes no sense.

566
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,060
If you actually laid a hand on him,

567
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,540
who would be crazy enough
to leave you there

568
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,200
to take care of him?

569
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,740
But honestly,

570
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,120
everyone's pretty impressed by you.

571
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,660
What?

572
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,440
Impressed that you know
how to work an opportunity.

573
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,280
I only found out

574
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,500
because of this whole mess.

575
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,620
Turns out

576
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,080
Kevin's uncle

577
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,340
is that guy.

578
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,840
Since you looked after Kevin

579
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,620
while he was hurt,

580
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,600
he's bound to return the favor.

581
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,160
Zhuang,

582
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,060
I've gotta say,

583
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,900
you're a total dark horse.

584
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,020
I didn't realize your intel
was even better than mine.

585
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,280
I really need

586
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,140
to pick up more from you.

587
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,260
Keeping your head down and working hard

588
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,460
is nothing compared to knowing
how to seize the right moment.

589
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,720
No wonder Mr. Song

590
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,980
only took you to Investment Banking.

591
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,720
We joined Huaya

592
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,400
at the same time.

593
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,620
So when you make it big,

594
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,600
don't forget about me.

595
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,300
These rumors are ridiculous,

596
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,500
but they've spread like wildfire.

597
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,960
Even the higher-ups
are asking me about it.

598
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,620
After all, you know Kevin's

599
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,700
family background

600
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,740
and who his uncle is.

601
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,680
I had no idea.

602
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,300
Anyway, I already tried

603
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,140
to clear things up for you.

604
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,840
But they don't buy it.

605
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,720
This is a small circle
and word travels fast.

606
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,480
It's casting a poor light

607
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,840
on you and the bank.

608
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,980
Look, I know it's all nonsense.

609
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,680
But you should think

610
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,620
about why these rumors started

611
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,580
in the first place.

612
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,500
Why are they targeting you?

613
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,000
Is there something wrong

614
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,400
with how you interact

615
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,140
with your colleagues

616
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,160
to make them think

617
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,440
you didn't get

618
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,820
this opportunity

619
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,760
through sheer talent

620
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,460
but by playing

621
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,520
the social game?

622
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,140
Alright,

623
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,080
you're a smart guy.

624
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,220
I'll leave it at that.

625
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,220
Well,

626
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,320
what are you still standing here for?

627
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,380
I don't want people to think

628
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,300
I'm giving you special treatment.

629
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,460
Get back to work.

630
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,440
Thank you, Mr. Song.

631
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,060
It's important for young people

632
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,060
to focus on the work at hand.

633
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,540
Keep your intentions pure.

634
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,900
That's the only real way to succeed.

635
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,700
Zhuang.

636
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm so sorry.

637
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,920
I took a fall

638
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,120
and you had to spend
all those days taking care of me,

639
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,940
and now you're getting
dragged into these rumors.

640
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,040
That's...

641
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,480
It's fine.

642
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,640
It was an accident.

643
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,080
You're not going
to start avoiding me, are you?

644
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,640
I mean,

645
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,880
I'm a victim

646
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,580
of these rumors too.

647
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,540
I got in here

648
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,720
on my own merit,

649
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,580
but now everyone says
it's because of my relatives.

650
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,800
It's so annoying.

651
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,260
If you distance yourself
from me because of this,

652
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,600
I'll feel so wronged.

653
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:52,940
It's not that serious.

654
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,280
We'll just prove ourselves

655
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,260
through our work.

656
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,040
You're right.

657
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,540
Let's do this together.

658
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,280
Kevin, when you get home,

659
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,720
take a photo of that accident report

660
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,380
from Changbai Mountain

661
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,200
and post it on your Moment.

662
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,020
At least it'll prove

663
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,540
you didn't get hurt

664
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,000
because you were duking it out

665
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,460
with Zhuang Xu over me.

666
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,780
That's so ridiculous.

667
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,360
Where did this

668
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,560
even start?

669
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's been so long.

670
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,100
Who knows?

671
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,520
It's probably been circulating
for a while

672
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,180
and we're just now hearing about it.

673
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,480
Zhuang is sharp

674
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,520
and capable.

675
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,320
I think

676
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,800
someone's been gunning for him
for a long time.

677
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,700
Most people
don't actually believe the rumors

678
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,880
because they're just so ridiculous.

679
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,340
But they still get a kick

680
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,600
out of whispering behind our back.

681
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
They always make sure to add

682
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,580
a "we know it's fake" at the end.

683
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,300
It's like they're using it
as a legal disclaimer.

684
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,140
That's the worst part about these rumors

685
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,620
because you can't even debunk them.

686
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,880
It's disgusting.

687
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,460
They're

688
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,700
making me out
to be this total femme fatale wreck.

689
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,000
Forget it.

690
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,340
Try to look on the bright side.

691
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,100
At least they're saying
you're being fought over.

692
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,760
If they said you were
throwing yourself at the guys,

693
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,120
that would be even nastier

694
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,560
and way harder to live down.

695
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,860
It's hard to just look
on the bright side, okay?

696
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,800
Once people start looking at you
through a certain lens,

697
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,900
they never stop.

698
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,300
It's bound to

699
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,520
tank my professional reputation.

700
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:03,980
This rumor is going

701
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,260
to follow me forever.

702
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,140
Thinking about it

703
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,380
just makes me
feel so frustrated and powerless.

704
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,620
I just heard Zhuang Xu...

705
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,640
What's the deal with him?

706
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,200
I thought he was in Investment Banking.

707
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,820
Hold on.

708
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,420
It's the same old story.

709
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:24,880
He...

710
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,640
I'll tell you all about it in a bit.

711
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,340
Okay.

712
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,080
I see how it is now.

713
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,520
The more above it all
they act on the surface,

714
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,680
the more they're buttering people up
behind the scenes.

715
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,680
Exactly.

716
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,200
How else do you think

717
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,020
he got into Investment Banking so fast?

718
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,460
And here you guys were,

719
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,620
singing his praises earlier.

720
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,720
Honestly,

721
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,740
there's no shame in being a brown-noser

722
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,740
or using your connections.

723
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,520
But acting like it was

724
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,000
all your own hard work?

725
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,640
That's really obnoxious.

726
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,900
That's the worst part about these rumors

727
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,200
because you can't even debunk them.

728
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,460
It's disgusting.

729
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,180
They're

730
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,340
making me out
to be this total femme fatale wreck.

731
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,720
Forget it.

732
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,000
Try to look on the bright side.

733
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,820
At least they're saying
you're being fought over.

734
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,440
If they said you were
throwing yourself at the guys,

735
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,920
that would be even nastier

736
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,180
and way harder to live down.

737
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,600
Once people start looking at you
through a certain lens,

738
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,640
they never stop.

739
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,640
This rumor is going

740
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,880
to follow me forever.

741
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,820
Thinking about it

742
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,940
just makes me
feel so frustrated and powerless.

743
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,220
♪I'm still lost in yesterday♪

744
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,460
No matter what they say,

745
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,560
the fact is I never got

746
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,460
any calls.

747
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,480
Besides,

748
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,340
why would I do that?

749
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,320

Xu,

772
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,780
what brings you

773
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,380
to our campus today?

774
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,760
I was so surprised when I got your call.

775
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,820
I was hoping to grab a bite with you.

776
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,260
Are you free?

777
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,520
Yeah, sure.

778
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,940
Ms. Nie, you're here.

779
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,180
Mr. Bao,

780
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,580
there's no need to be so formal,
is there?

781
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,280
Nie,

782
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,360
don't hold out on us.

783
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,520
We've heard

784
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,520
that you're

785
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,620
the daughter of the major shareholder
at Shuangyuan.

786
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,080
No wonder

787
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,160
Mr. Lin put you

788
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,140
in charge of the project.

789
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,960
Mr. Bao, you're way too blunt.

790
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,140
Can't it just be that Mr. Lin
has an eye for talent

791
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,120
and saw some potential in me?

792
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,600
Oh, definitely.

793
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,880
I've worked on enough projects

794
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,200
to meet plenty of silver-spooners,

795
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,980
but you and Mr. Lin are top-tier

796
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,920
when it comes to both skill
and character.

797
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:30,980
You're hardworking,

798
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,100
though you're definitely not the type
to get the short end of the stick.

799
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,120
Well, it's not like
you're losing out either.

800
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,160
A win-win situation

801
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,340
is the only way to make things last.

802
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,380
Fair point.

803
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,280
So, what brings you by?

804
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,840
Just checking on the progress.

805
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,380
Don't worry.

806
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm on top of it every single day.

807
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,400
As long as

808
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,740
those new PV panels

809
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,420
arrive on time,

810
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,640
we'll

811
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,640
hit our deadline.

812
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,320
Mr. Bao, come take a look at this.

813
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:53,780
Coming.

814
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:54,980
Nie,

815
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:55,940
I'll head over.

816
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,660
Sure, go ahead.

817
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,360
How do you manage to bolt so fast
the second work ends?

818
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,700
Ms. Nie is inspecting

819
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,080
the Liuguang Garden site.

820
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,600
She is working very hard,
as you can see.

821
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,000
Since when did you become Ms. Nie?

822
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,560
I don't recall

823
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,960
the board of directors
signing off on that.

824
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,600
Mr. Lin, you're a lost cause.

825
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,100
You've already picked up

826
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,400
those corporate airs.

827
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
I've actually picked up

828
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,900
the habit of having hot pot at home.

829
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,620
Come over tonight

830
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,920
for some.

831
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,040
I'd love to.

832
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,820
I'll pick you up at the site.

833
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,620
That was fast.

834
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,380
Jiang Rui.

835
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,880
It's you.

836
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,560
What brought this on

837
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,580
all of a sudden?

838
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:25,720
Why?

839
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,880
Who were you expecting?

840
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,140
Lin?

841
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,220
Well, yeah.

842
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,960
We were just about

843
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,220
to go grab hot pot.

844
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,580
Xiguang, there's something

845
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,700
I need

846
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,800
to tell you.

847
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,240
Go ahead.

848
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,280
A few days ago,

849
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,820
Xu suddenly asked me out to dinner.

850
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,820
It was so weird.

851
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,140
I thought

852
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,120
he had something important to say,

853
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,960
but he just sat there drinking

854
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,840
in silence.

855
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,220
When we left,

856
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,380
he insisted on walking me back
to my dorm

857
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,120
even though I told him

858
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,640
not to.

859
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,260
Then, right as we got to the dorms,

860
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,400
he suddenly started asking

861
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,620
about our study trip to Europe.

862
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,120
Xiguang,

863
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,600
do you think

864
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,720
he regretted it?

865
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,060
Don't worry about what he thinks.

866
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,440
It doesn't matter anymore.

867
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,820
I know,

868
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,120
I just...

869
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,620
Actually, there's something

870
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,540
I wanted to tell you

871
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,520
during Chinese New Year.

872
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,200
But after seeing how cold Xu was

873
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,520
at Changbai Mountain,

874
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,240
I kept quiet.

875
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,040
Before we went there,

876
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,440
Ms. Zhang mentioned

877
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,840
that Xu went to my place

878
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,800
looking for you
over the summer vacation.

879
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,040
She told him

880
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,280
you and I had gone abroad to study.

881
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,760
She specifically used
the words "study abroad."

882
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,220
I double-checked with her several times.

883
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,280
Xiguang,

884
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,800
remember?

885
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,260
We left

886
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,240
in such a rush

887
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,580
that your international roaming

888
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,280
wasn't set up,

889
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,840
so you were out of reach.

890
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,240
And even if he had called me,

891
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,380
I probably would've had
my phone off anyway

892
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,380
because of the time difference.

893
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,080
He

894
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,280
might have just been unable to reach us.

895
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,300
Xiguang,

896
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,960
I can't help but wonder

897
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,820
if things would be different

898
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,320
if it weren't for me.

899
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,780
Jiang Rui.

900
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,580
Thank you for dragging me out
on that trip.

901
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,960
I think

902
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,280
I'm much happier now.

903
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,460
Really?

904
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,100
I didn't mean anything by it.

905
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,600
I think

906
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,520
Lin is a better match for you, too.

907
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,460
But

908
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,360
since you used to...

909
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,100
I just want you to be

910
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,580
with the person you love most,

911
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,840
without any what-ifs in your heart.

912
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,880
I understand.

913
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,560
♪You are the sun in my life♪

Him going to Nanjing for me

919
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,720
doesn't really change anything.

920
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,340
To me,

921
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,320
some feelings

922
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,380
are like the lights
in a stranger's window.

923
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,700
When they flicker on or fade away

924
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
is completely beyond my grasp,

925
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,900
and impossible to predict;

926
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,860
but there is a kind of love

927
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,280
that is like a constant sun.

928
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,920
Even with your eyes closed,

929
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,400
even in the deepest dark,

930
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,760
you can still feel its warmth.

931
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,420
You can feel

932
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,760
it enveloping you.

933
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,360
The love I felt back then

934
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,020
was real.

935
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,220
And the fact that it has vanished

936
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,680
is also real.

937
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,880
I never thought

938
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,980
I would move on so fast.

939
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,640
But that shouldn't be surprising, right?

940
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,480
A love that never finds

941
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,680
an equal echo is fragile and brittle

942
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,180
compared to a love

943
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,840
that is mutual.

944
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:10,200
♪You came and filled the room
with light♪

945
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,500

00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,080

Lamb rolls.

950
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,160
Beef rolls.

951
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,740
Tripe.

952
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,100
Oh, they have ice cream.

953
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,220
This is so cute.

954
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,240
This one?

955
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,760
Wait, this tub is massive.

956
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,240
It's literally bigger than my face.

957
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,800
No way.

958
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,660
This is going straight to my hips.

959
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,540
Let's go.

960
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,700
Let's go grab

961
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,740
some frozen tofu and spam.

962
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,880
The lobster looks pretty good.

963
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:38,940
Should we get one?

964
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,880
Ms. Chen is out today.

965
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,360
Do you even know how to prep it?

966
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,420
Please, it's a walk

967
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,100
in the park.

968
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,140
Then let's get two.

969
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,300
I can polish off

970
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,440
a lobster by myself.

971
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,500
Two is fine.

972
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,000
But you have to promise:

973
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,780
don't try to shove
your leftovers onto me.

974
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,280
I swear.

975
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,280
Alright.

976
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,180
Excuse me.

977
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,580
Could we get two lobsters, please?

978
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,020
We'll take those two that are fighting.

979
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,040
That should be about it.

980
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,840
Let's go grab some seasoning.

981
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,719
I need to use the restroom.

982
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,060
Go ahead and get the seasoning first,

983
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,679
and grab our go-to drinks too.

984
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,940
Got it.

985
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,260
You handle the prep,

986
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,780
and I'll take care of the broth
and the dipping sauces.

987
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:57,660
Works for me.

988
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,180
Easy on the sugar in mine.

989
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,760
I know.

990
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,420
I thought you said
you knew how to do this.

991
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,680
Turns out, lobsters
are a whole different ball game.

992
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,500
Hang on.

993
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,240
I'm trying to figure out

994
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,380
how this thing is put together.

995
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,980
Have you figured it out yet?

996
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,200
Maybe you could look it up for me?

997
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,780
I'll use your phone.

998
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,560
Mine's in my bag.

999
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,280
Let me find a tutorial for you.

1000
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,160
Check this out.

1001
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:13,680
Okay, I've got it.

1002
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,560
Yusen.

1003
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,460
You know

1004
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,400
that something happened

1005
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,980
back in Shanghai on Sunday,

1006
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,460
don't you?

1007
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,900
The moment you came to me,

1008
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,240
I already had a hunch.

1009
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,640
Then why didn't you ask me back then?

1010
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,920
Because you already came to me.

1011
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,160
And then

1012
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,900
you threw yourself into my arms.

1013
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,720
I'm gonna go grab some more books
from your study.

1014
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,240
I've already finished
the ones I took last time.

1015
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,220
Sure.

1016
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,180
Good luck.

1017
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,100
The last piece is yours.

1018
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,040
Didn't you say

1019
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,300
you could finish a whole one
by yourself?

1020
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,300
I did eat a whole one.

1021
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,580
The shells are right there.

1022
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,340
Count them if you don't believe me.

1023
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,840
Let me piece them back together.

1024
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,280
You're actually doing it?

1025
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,720
Just eat it already.

1026
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,800
Come on, eat up.

1027
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,920
I have to head back early today.

1028
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,760
You're giving me a ride.

1029
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,460
I forgot my books.

1030
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,100
Can you go to the study
and grab them for me?

1031
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,380
I packed them and left them on the desk.

1032
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,100
Sure thing.

1033
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,380
Nie Xiguang.

1034
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:12,760
Yes.

1035
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,620
You swapped my soybeans

1036
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,860
for red ones.

1037
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,800
Yeah.

1038
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,180
Found them at the store.

1039
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,080

1040
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,400

1041
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,180

1042
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,460
