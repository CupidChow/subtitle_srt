A giant radish.

Whoa, it's huge.

Isn't it gorgeous?

Back in the day,

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
I wouldn't take a cent from your mother.

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,920
But now, your grandpa and I

19
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,800
are hounding your dad for every last bit

20

Grandma,

00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,900
you and Grandpa should buy
whatever you need.

I've got plenty of money, okay?

27
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,060
We've got food
and a roof over our heads.

Is it gonna make it?

It's fine.

37
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,740
The leaves are brittle

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,340
you get some more too.

190
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,540
These are all fresh from the patch.

191
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,480
Take them to your mom.

192
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,900
If it's too much,
just give some to your friends.

193
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,820
Okay.

194
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,740
Remember

195
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,580
what I told you?

196
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,360
What was it?

197
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,740
Keeping a sharp eye out
for the right one.

198
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,080
Take your time.

199
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,540
If you're not sure about someone,

200
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,340
bring him home
and let me give him the once-over.

201
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,060
Got it.

202
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,620
I'm heading out now.

203
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,220
Bye, Grandpa.

204
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,880
Alright.

205
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,920
Drive safe.

206
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,280
I will.

207
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,640
I'll come see you guys again soon.

208
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

209
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,100
Take care.

210
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,600
Alright.

211
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,060
Tomorrow at work, I'll see him again.

212
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,140
Xiguang.

213
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,960
Xiguang.

214
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,180
Xiguang.

215
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,160
Xiguang.

216
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,920
You look so out of it today.

217
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,180
Did you stay up late last night?

218
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,340
Not really.

219
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,200
Maybe it's just the cold.

220
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,300
Yeah.

221
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,880
It snowed again last night.

222
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,000
Good thing we've got heating
in the office.

223
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,600
Everyone, hurry.

224
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,460
Come on.

225
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,080
Grab your weapons.

226
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,040
Coming through.

227
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,400
Another heavy snow last night.

228
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,920
If we don't clear the way,

229
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,800
everything's going to be
at a standstill.

230
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,760
Plus, it's a safety hazard.

231
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,560
As per usual,

232
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,480
each department is responsible
for their own zone.

233
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,960
Mr. Lin will be joining us shortly.

234
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,340
I appreciate your help, everyone.

235
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,160
- Okay.
- Got it.

236
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,920
Grab your tools.

237
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,340
- Okay.
- Got it.

238
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,900
And let's go.

239
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,440
- Okay.
- Got it.

240
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,080
We've been assigned

241
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,460
a precision job,

242
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,580
clearing the snow

243
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,560
off the rooftop PV panels.

244
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,480
Mr. Zhang.

245
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,100
Mr. Lin.

246
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,140
You are up here already?

247
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,380
I got here early

248
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,760
and dragged Mr. Lin along with me.

249
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,000
Let's get to work.

250
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,740
But Mr. Zhang, you...

251
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,280
Wang,

252
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,380
what's that supposed to mean?

253
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,140
You think I'm too old for this?

254
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,260
I've been doing this

255
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,500
every year.

256
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,500
Your Mr. Lin doesn't have

257
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,860
half the experience I do.

258
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,300
That's for sure.

259
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,260
Mr. Zhang shared

260
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
some of his best tips.

261
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,960
Careful on your feet, Mr. Zhang.

262
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:40,760
Got it.

263
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,240
Alright everyone, let's get to it.

264
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,780
Go ahead and stake out your zones.

265
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,800
- Got it.
- Okay.

266
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,040
Careful.

267
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,740
Xiguang,

268
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,860
let's start over here.

269
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,500
The snow up here seems

270
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,560
a bit thinner than it is on the ground.

271
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,860
Is it because PV panels

272
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,820
get hot enough

273
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,700
to melt the snow?

274
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,540
Actually, it's because the tech team

275
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,800
cleared them over the New Year break.

276
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,500
You have to stay on top

277
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,300
of the snow removal.

278
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,460
Otherwise, if it ices over,

279
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,560
it could actually

280
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,300
damage the panels.

281
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,900
Got it.

282
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,280
Take it easy, guys.

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Watch the surface

284
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,500
and don't scuff it up.

285
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,180
Alright.

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,320
Are these panels scratched?

287
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,420
I hope I don't have to pay for this.

288
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,900
First, make sure

289
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,040
you're both okay.

290
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,280
I'm fine.

291
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Thanks for checking on us, Mr. Lin.

292
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm fine too.

293
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,560
Let's divvy up the work.

294
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,760
You guys sweep the areas nearby.

295
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,520
Leave the hard-to-reach spots for me.

296
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,760
Got it.

297
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,220
Xiguang,

298
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,860
you're way too efficient.

299
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,060
What's the rush?
Are you pushed by ghosts?

300
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,060
Come on, you guys

301
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,260
bundle up a bit more.

302
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,880
Don't just choose fashion

303
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,760
over function.

304
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:09,940
I'll take it from here.

305
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,820
Thanks.

306
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,280
No sign

307
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,040
of the other teams yet.

308
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,340
We're leading the pack.

309
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,460
Grab some hot water, everyone,

310
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,100
and warm up a bit.

311
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,740
Mr. Lin wants us to huddle up in a bit.

312
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,580
I've reviewed the plan
for the year-end party.

313
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,940
Let's tweak the agenda a bit.

314
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,100
Cut back on the formal speeches,

315
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,340
and focus more
on the fun and relaxing parts.

316
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,880
Copy that.

317
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,000
We'll

318
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,020
fine-tune it later.

319
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,940
It's a tough year for everyone.

320
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,520
Our competitors are dropping like flies.

321
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,500
Do we need

322
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,480
to slash the prize budget?

323
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,940
Let's stick with what we had last year.

324
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,480
Also,

325
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,960
besides the tangible gifts,

326
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,680
let's throw in

327
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,660
some creative incentives,

328
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,960
like,

329
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,620
a week of paid leave, for instance.

330
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,540
I'm down for that.

331
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,260
Great.

332
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,280
That'll do.

333
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,500
Awesome.

334
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,000
Everyone's gonna love it.

335
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,200
We need to start sourcing
the tangible prizes.

336
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,560
Yin Jie and Nie,
you'll be in charge of that.

337
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,520
Just follow last year's lead.

338
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,600
We also need to lock in

339
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,580
the venue for the party ASAP.

340
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,400
Besides our usual partner hotels,

341
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,780
let's explore other options too.

342
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,160
See if you can find a better deal.

343
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,960
And make sure to take plenty of photos.

344
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,560
Okay.

345
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,740
And

346
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,740
one more thing.

347
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,120
We can swap out

348
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,400
the catering contractor.

349
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,220
That food was garbage.

350
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,620
Finally, we're done with them.

351
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,560
The last time I ate there,
I got an upset stomach.

352
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:35,940
Exactly.

353
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,880
It's long overdue.

354
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,360
Okay.

355
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,920
Good riddance.

356
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,400
Tell me about it.

357
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,180
Alright,

358
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,700
that's all for today.

359
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,640
Back to work, everyone.

360
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:51,980
Let's go.

361
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,500
Mr. Lin,

362
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,100
there's something
I need to go over with you.

363
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,040
Look,

364
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,320
do we still need

365
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,940
to tweak this?

366
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,680
The budget looks perfect.

367
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,320
No need to change anything.

368
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,040
I'll drop it off
for your sign-off shortly.

369
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,140
Okay.

370
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,520
We're just doing the legwork.

371
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,160
Everything has to
go through the higher-ups.

372
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,600
But to be honest,

373
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,520
your pricing

374
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,960
just isn't competitive.

375
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,260
Our venue is fairly new,

376
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,260
and we're very easy to work with.

377
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,620
But,

378
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,780
you don't have much of a reputation yet.

379
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,720
This is our year-end party.

380
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,060
We need to make it fancy.

381
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,560
I totally fell for it.

382
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,700
I thought

383
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,860
this was a cushy gig,

384
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,040
just an excuse to stroll around.

385
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,840
But I didn't see this coming.

386
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,080
My legs are absolutely killing me,

387
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,320
and I've talked myself hoarse.

388
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,440
But you were so convincing back there.

389
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,660
Tell me about it.

390
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,240
I'm a natural-born negotiator.

391
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,340
I'm beat.

392
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,700
I'm gonna grab some drinks to recharge.

393
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,120
Thanks.

394
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,800
Thanks.

395
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,220
This is pretty good.

396
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,500
Xiguang.

397
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:16,980
What's wrong?

398
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,099
You've been acting a bit off
since you got back

399
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,119
from the New Year break.

400
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,540
Don't tell me you and Mr. Lin

401
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,579
had a falling out

402
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,980
at that wedding in Shanghai?

403
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,800
Not really.

404
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,380
So why give me all those files

405
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,060
over the last few days

406
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,020
and dump the sign-off on me?

407
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,740
Oh, and another thing.

408
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,960
What was with you

409
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,060
in the elevator the other day?

410
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,580
When Mr. Lin walked in,

411
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,200
you acted

412
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,180
like you were fascinated by your shoes.

413
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,800
Now that I think about it,

414
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,480
the snow shoveling was shady too.

415
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,680
You were blasting through it so fast

416
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,080
just to avoid facing Mr. Lin?

417
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,560
What are you doing?

418
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,420
That's a very suspicious look
you've got there.

419
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,360
How about I buy you dinner tonight?

420
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,020
We'll have squirrel-shaped mandarin fish
and Gordon Euryale seed.

421
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,680
Nice try, but don't dodge the question.

422
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,920
From your reactions,

423
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,380
you're not in trouble with him.

424
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,920
Are you...?

425
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:41,840
Nie,

426
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,660
you should treat me to dinner tonight.

427
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,340
I've got some major tea to spill.

428
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,200
That prick, Lin Yusen,

429
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,300
actually hung up on me.

430
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm telling on him.

431
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,940
Unbelievable.

432
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,020
I've helped him out so much.

433
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,400
Now that I need a hand,

434
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,140
he actually has the nerve
to hang up on me?

435
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,420
Well,

436
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,880
tit for tat then.

437
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,220
Nie,

438
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,440
you have to see him
for who he really is,

439
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,780
a wolf in sheep's clothing.

440
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,760
And how he stayed at the hospital

441
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,880
just to linger and talk surgery with us.

442
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,620
You know where I'm getting at, right?

443
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,140
He did

444
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,800
give us

445
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,160
a lot of helpful advice.

446
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,240
And

447
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,420
the whole eating together thing,

448
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,340
that was all his doing.

449
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,240
I'm sure you're aware.

450
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,580
Coaxing you into Lu Sha's wedding?

451
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,460
I'll spare you the lecture

452
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,760
on how bad that is.

453
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Yeah.

454
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,500
But Shengyi,

455
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,340
are you really here to spill the tea?

456
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,560
Nie, spending time with Yusen

457
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
is finally rubbing off on you.

458
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,480
Not bad.

459
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,840
I'm just

460
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,540
doing this for fun.

461
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,720
He's dragging our reputation

462
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,520
through the mud.

463
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,880
You get me, right?

464
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,440
So

465
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,580
he told you everything?

466
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,940
He's very reserved...

467
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,420
If he hadn't

468
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,780
needed my help,

469
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,020
he would've

470
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,980
kept me in the dark forever.

471
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,260
Look at him.

472
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,720
It speaks for itself.

473
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,940
I tried calling him,

474
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,240
but as soon as your name came up,

475
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,420
he just said he was busy

476
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,420
and shut me down.

477
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,420
It's obvious

478
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,240
his pride is too wounded to face us.

479
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,040
He actually values his "pride" so much?

480
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,940
Nie.

481
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,460
If someone like Yusen
doesn't make the cut,

482
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,540
who on earth are you looking for?

483
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,320
You don't get perks

484
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,340
without paying your dues.

485
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,520
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

486
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,980
What are you on about?

487
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,800
Nie,

488
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,840
I'm totally lost here.

489
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,020
This whole deep vibe.

490
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,960
You're becoming just like him.

491
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,840
Shengyi,

492
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,400
have some fish.

493
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,120
Fish as a muzzle?

494
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,560
Fine. I am starving anyway.

495
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,720
Two bowls did the trick. I'm stuffed.

496
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,600
Well...

497
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
I've got the night shift tonight,

498
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,620
so I won't be able
to give you a ride later.

499
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,540
I just texted Yusen.

500
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,500
When he gets here,

501
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,700
he'll give you a lift home.

502
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,340
Shengyi.

503
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,720
A bit on the nose, isn't it?

504
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,800
Really?

505
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,080
Sorry.

506
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,120
Surgery

507
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,040
is all about precision,

508
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,180
but outside the hospital,

509
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,620
we tend to just call a spade a spade.

510
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,800
You'll have to get used to it.

511
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,760
See?

512
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,100
In his prime,

513
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,680
he could stun the entire cafeteria

514
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,760
just by walking in with a lunchbox.

515
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,280
He might be older today,

516
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,320
but he hasn't lost his swagger one bit,

517
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,940
don't you think?

518
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,300
Nie, just think about it.

519
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,620
If you actually land him,

520
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,500
every single girl

521
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,920
from our med school days,

522
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,020
would be dying of envy

523
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,200
from miles away.

524
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,960
How epic would that be?

525
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:20,920
Aren't you pumped?

526
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,180
Doesn't that just feel amazing?

527
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,580
Shengyi,

528
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,120
knock it off.

529
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,340
I haven't had a chance to eat.

530
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,380
Would you be okay

531
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,940
with me finishing these off?

532
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,560
Since Nie is picking up the tab,

533
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,780
as long as she's okay with it,

534
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,040
then I'm cool with it.

535
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,860
Duty calls. Off to save lives.

536
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,340
I'll leave

537
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,240

538
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,120

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,120
Let me get this.

567
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,480
Here.

568
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,940
Take mine.

569
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,400
I was just messing with you before.

570
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,520
But since I've already

571
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,760
laid my cards on the table,

572
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,520
there's no way I'm letting you
pick up the tab.

573
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,640
Cars aren't allowed back here.

574
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,520
We'll have to walk a bit.

575
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,340
I had no idea

576
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,920
he was coming to see you today.

577
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,200
Don't take anything he said

578
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,400
to heart.

579
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,700
He said

580
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,880
Miss Lu

581
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,360
never invited me to the wedding.

582
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,600
So he went over my head

583
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,580
to tattle to you.

584
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,500
Is that true?

585
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,140
Yeah.

586
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,460
Since I hadn't made my move yet,

587
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,440
I had to rack my brains

588
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,340
just to create an opportunity.

589
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,700
I thought you'd be

590
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,300
at least a little shy about it.

591
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,260
After being that direct, though,

592
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,520
it feels a bit too late

593
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
to act embarrassed now.

594
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,940
I used to be

595
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,780
every bit as direct

596
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,540
as he is.

597
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,260
If I had met Lin Yusen first,

598
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,440
how would things have turned out?

599
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,900
Would I have fallen for him
at first sight?

600
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,720
With both of us
being so straight to the point,

601
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,800
would we have just clicked right away?

602
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,720
That probably would have been nice, too.

603
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,660
I wish I'd met you first.

604
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,840
Oh, shoot.

605
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,500
Did I just

606
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,320
say that out loud?

607
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,500
That might have been a bit much.

608
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,720
I hope he isn't mad.

609
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,460
Why do I always lose my cool

610
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,660
when I'm around him?

611
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,120
So,

612
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,460
what kind of favor
did Shengyi ask you for?

613
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,160
He's working on a paper

614
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,540
that overlaps

615
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,300
with my previous research.

616
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,560
He just wanted me

617
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,740
to run an eye over it.

618
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,920
He knew your situation

619
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,620
yet he still made you do all this.

620
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,260
I shouldn't have treated him to dinner.

621
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,300
Don't worry about it.

622
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,840
I'm over it now.

623
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,960
A year of being dramatic about my hands

624
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,340
is more than enough.

625
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,900
Why keep it up forever?

626
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,680
I've been doing

627
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,020
a lot of reflecting
over the past few days.

628
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,780
I acted on impulse

629
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,320
and caught you off guard.

630
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,600
No.

631
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,860
Really?

632
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,180
It's only been a few days,

633
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,780
but you've already got dark circles.

634
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,040
Xiguang.

635
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,700
I'm sorry.

636
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,600
I shouldn't have

637
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,880
sprung that on you

638
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,280
when you were unprepared.

639
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,900
If it caused you any distress,

640
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,900
I apologize.

641
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,860
That sounds

642
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,020
so familiar.

643
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,860
I'm sorry.

644
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,900
I honestly didn't realize

645
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,040
you and Rong had something going on.

646
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,180
Otherwise,

647
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,860
I wouldn't have confessed to you.

648
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,120
I hope

649
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,460
I didn't cause you any trouble.

650
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,660
Don't say that.

651
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,780
Don't say things like that.

652
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,460
Okay, I'll stop.

653
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,500
But,

654
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,700
what did I even say?

655
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,880
You're practically in tears now.

656
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,100
Such a crybaby.

657
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,940
Don't apologize.

658
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,280
Don't apologize for this.

659
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,400
Fine, I won't.

660
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,320
It's been painful

661
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,080
to watch you struggle
just to stay away from me.

662
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,780
I won't bring it up again.

663
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:23,920
I promise.

664
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,760
Please, stop avoiding me, okay?

665
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,580
It's exhausting for you,

666
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,840
and it's hard for me

667
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,560
to play along and let you hide.

668
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,120
You?

669
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,980
Playing along?

670
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,640
I thought

671
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,600
I was just being smart,

672
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,140
with maxed-out evasion stats.

673
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,260
How else?

674
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,960
I've been doing everything I can

675
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,000
to get out on site visits.

676
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
I'm fresh out of excuses

677
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,360
to leave the office

678
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,080
tomorrow.

679
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,240
So,

680
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,140
stop avoiding me,

681
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,420
okay?

682
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,280
I won't.

683
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:03,840
Really?

684
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,980
Then keep me company
while I work late tonight.

685
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:18,160
[Pingyi Tianhe Construction]

686
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,880
Are you

687
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,320
serious?

688
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,100
Yeah.

689
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,660
Why the midnight trip

690
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,580
to the Phase II plant site?

691
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,140
I want to get

692
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,300
a shareholder's opinion on something.

693
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,220
Don't go pinning labels on me.

694
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,260
I'm not.

695
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,260
Don't even think about making someone
as young and carefree as me

696
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,760
shoulder responsibilities
I never signed up for.

697
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,960
Look at you, being all cautious now.

698
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,520
I learned from the best, Mr. Lin.

699
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,760
What is it exactly?

700
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,440
Spit it out.

701
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,580
Check this out.

702
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,560
This is the general layout

703
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,360
for the Phase II plant,

704
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,720
and here's where we are right now.

705
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,900
This is

706
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,120
the designated PV-integrated parking

707
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,240
for the Phase II plant.

708
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,140
We're putting in a cafeteria over here

709
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,680
for the plant staff.

710
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,940
But that patch of land over there

711
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,480
is still up in the air.

712
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,700
Follow me.

713
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,780
Right here.

714
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,780
From where we stand,

715
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,960
straight to the far end.

716
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,280
Any suggestions?

717
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,740
That's a sudden question.

718
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,680
I'm drawing a blank right now.

719
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,720
But honestly, I've always felt

720
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,160
the site is a bit sterile.

721
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,400
Sterile?

722
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,500
Yeah.

723
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,100
We've got lawns and lots of green space

724
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,880
over by the offices and dorms,

725
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,920
but the plant itself

726
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,740
is looking a bit bare.

727
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,620
Maybe we could

728
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,400
green up this section a bit?

729
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,600
Why don't we do

730
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,940
a PV-powered eco-garden?

731
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,380
It'll be totally solar-powered,

732
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,660
with a nice lawn and some greenery,

733
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,060
and we can toss in
some outdoor furniture.

734
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,240
For the roof, we can use

735
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,480
those adjustable PV panels
which can tilt.

736
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,300
They'd provide some shade on sunny days,

737
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
and on cloudy days,
they can tilt open to let the light in.

738
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,240
And if it rains, they'll seal shut.

739
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,920
We could even add a little kiosk

740
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,540
for beverages and snacks.

741
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,700
It'd be a huge hit.

742
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,960
Look, the admin building

743
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,180
has a spot like this,

744
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,260
but the plant doesn't.

745
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,580
We should really set something up
over here, too,

746
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,040
so the workers have somewhere

747
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,160
to get some fresh air

748
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,800
during their breaks.

749
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,720
Splendid.

750
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,480
I agree.

751
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,140
Let's go with that then.

752
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,160
I, your shareholder, have made the call.

753
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,300
Mr. Lin, could you please

754
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,580
make this happen ASAP?

755
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,020
So,

756
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,860
should I have the staff

757
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,120
get on it right now,

758
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,320
or wait until tomorrow?

759
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,360
It's late, obviously...

760
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,780
Hold on.

761
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,960
What do you mean by now?

762
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,600
It means following your lead

763
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
and making it happen immediately.

764
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,080
Nie,

765
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,560
I'll let you handle the back-and-forth

766
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,980
with the different departments
to get things moving.

767
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,980
So you're just stepping back
and doing nothing?

768
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,040
Of course not.

769
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,560
I'm the one signing the papers.

770
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:58,840
That's it.

771
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,020
We're off the clock.

772
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,960
Let me give you a ride home.

773
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,679
One minute he's my subordinate,

774
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,900
the next he's my boss.

775
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,260
It's like he's hitting on me,

776
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,120
yet he keeps piling
all this work on my plate.

777
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,659
Make this a priority.

778
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,500
Mr. Ding.

779
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,739
You're Nie, right?

780
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,580
Mr. Lin filled me in

781
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,420
this morning

782
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,380
about the empty lot in B2.

783
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,940
We're putting in
a solar-powered garden, yeah?

784
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:56,719
Yes.

785
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,160
He asked me

786
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,720
to start pushing things forward for now.

787
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,300
Got it.

788
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:01,920
Wan,

789
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,180
let's set up a meeting

790
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:04,860
with Nie from Admin.

791
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,620
Oh, and check

792
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,540
with Mr. Hua from Tech

793
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,360
to see if he's free

794
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:08,980
to join us.

795
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:09,840
Sure thing.

796
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,480
[Master Plan:
Shuangyuan PV Plant Phase II Expansion]

797
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,580
Everything on B2

798
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,200
is right here.

799
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,800
We're looking at about 1.2 mu of land.

800
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,600
What's our main goal?

801
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,820
I just got this task

802
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,600
last night myself,

803
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,180
so my ideas are still pretty raw.

804
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,640
I'm looking to brainstorm
a bit with all of you.

805
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,420
The basic idea is

806
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,760
to create a small garden

807
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,540
where the staff

808
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,700
can hang out
during their lunch breaks.

809
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,440
It'll have a PV roof

810
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,960
that provides shade, keeps the rain out,
and generates its own power.

811
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,980
The site is seriously lacking
in green space right now,

812
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,820
so we're looking to liven it up.

813
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,320
So, does it need a main structure?

814
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,780
Yeah, we'll need one.

815
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,240
It doesn't have to be huge, though.

816
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,900
Maybe a footprint

817
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,800
of about 200 square meters?

818
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,900
We can make it two stories.

819
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,280
That shouldn't be a problem.

820
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,880
Wan, get this down.

821
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,440
Get in touch with the design firm

822
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,220
and ask for a few mock-ups,

823
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,280
budget included.

824
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,260
Copy that.

825
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,160
Mr. Ding.

826
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,740
Mr. Hua.

827
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,360
Take a seat.

828
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,540
We've discussed over the phone.

829
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,580
I'm sure Mr. Lin

830
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,280
has briefed you on this?

831
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:15,900
Yeah.

832
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,220
I just have one question:

833
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,780
are we going with BIPV

834
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,840
or BAPV?

835
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,000
[Pros and Cons of BIPV vs. BAPV]

836
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,300
So,

837
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,080
it's BAPV.

838
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,000
Just a standalone

839
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,040
rooftop PV system,

840
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,360
right?

841
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,700
Then why am I even here?

842
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,740
This is way too simple.

843
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,720
Ke,

844
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,240
link up with them.

845
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:50,940
Got it.

846
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,120
Looks like that new task from Mr. Lin

847
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,180
is quite the headache.

848
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,220
You've either been

849
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,760
running around like crazy
from office to office,

850
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,740
or you're glued to your chair,

851
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,480
buried in paperwork.

852
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,660
What's this?

853
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,540
You don't really get it either, do you?

854
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,120
Nope, not a clue.

855
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,120
Great.

856
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,080
At least I'm not
the only clueless one here.

857
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,320
Xiguang, look,

858
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,280
you can trash yourself all you want,

859
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,540
but leave me out of it.

860
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,520
Seriously, what is this thing?

861
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,580
I'm technically a part of this company,

862
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,620
and yet I've never even heard of it.

863
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,500
I'm still just scratching the surface,

864
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,200
but basically:

865
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,420
BAPV

866
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,940
is retrofitting buildings

867
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,320
with PV systems.

868
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,400
It's more of a standalone setup,

869
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,260
like what we have on our roof.

870
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,800
Then there's BIPV,

871
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,160
which is Building-Integrated Photovoltaics.

872
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,140
It's designed right into the building

873
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,820
from the start.

874
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,300
You use the PV panels
as actual building materials,

875
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,500
integrating them
into the roof, curtain walls,

876
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,440
or awnings.

877
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,500
It blends seamlessly with the structure,

878
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,040
making it more energy-efficient
and aesthetically pleasing.

879
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,700
Of course,
it's much more complex to build.

880
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,640
I see.

881
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,580
Who would have known

882
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,800
getting a small project off the ground

883
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,020
could be this complicated?

884
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,680
Procurement, Tech, Engineering,

885
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,440
Finance.

886
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,780
I have to deal
with every single department.

887
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,020
I'm mostly just winging it

888
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,800
and learning as I go.

889
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,260
Gee, I really walked straight
into a trap

890
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,400
I set for myself.

891
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,860
Yin Jie,

892
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,920
how is it that

893
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,560
I'm playing both sides of the deal?

894
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,620
Well,

895
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,260
even though I'm totally lost,

896
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,100
that sounds

897
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,980
incredibly deep.

898
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,420
Yes.

899
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,620
We all wear many hats.

900
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,140
Going from boss to subordinate

901
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,620
is a seamless flip.

902
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,200
Listen up, everyone.

903
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,780
I've got some great news
about the cafeteria

904
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,520
to share with you all.

905
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,200
Come here.

906
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,140
What is it?

907
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,700
The cafeteria.

908
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,600
The plan to switch contractors

909
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,580
is moving at lightning speed.

910
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,500
Word

911
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,320
from Logistics is

912
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,880
that after several rounds of vetting,

913
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,340
we're down

914
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,400
to the final three contenders.

915
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,760
Since their quotes are all pretty much
in the same ballpark,

916
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,040
Mr. Lin weighed in with a suggestion.

917
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,460
He said for a cafeteria,
we can't just look at the bottom line.

918
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,560
It's the taste that counts.

919
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,360
So the final call is to have two people

920
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,260
from each department

921
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,120
do a taste test and vote for the winner.

922
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,220
The food tasting

923
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,440
is happening tomorrow.

924
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,260
Awesome.

925
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,400
Who's the lucky one from our team?

926
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,560
Given that we're vetting this

927
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,500
for the entire staff,

928
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,360
naturally,
everyone's lining up for a spot.

929
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,520
Fair point.

930
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,680
But we've only got so many seats.

931
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,160
So, to be completely fair about it,

932
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,540
I've decided

933
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,500
we're going to draw straws.

934
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:34,760
Right.

935
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,840
That's as fair as it gets.

936
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,580
No one can argue with that.

937
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,520
- Yeah.
- Right.

938
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,740
Notice the slips

939
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,320
in the bag?

940
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,060
Two are marked.

941
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,320
If you pick one, you're representing

942
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:43,880
our department.

943
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,660
Wait, what does the slip say?

944
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,320
You'll see if you're lucky enough
to grab one.

945
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,020
Who wants to start?

946
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,600
Please let it be me.

947
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,000
Mr. Lin.

948
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,500
What's going on here?

949
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,720
Yeah, for the food tasting.

950
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,220
We're leaving it to chance
with a lucky draw.

951
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,640
Would you like to join us?

952
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,560
No way,

953
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,980
that's going to mess with the odds.

954
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,360
That's not what I meant.

955
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,560
So, what you're saying

956
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,280
is you'd love to have me join?

957
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,520
Of course.

958
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,320
Swapping out the cafeteria
was your call.

959
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,560
You deserve all the credit,
so it's only right that you're here.

960
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,380
Nie's right.

961
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,740
Let's add one more slip of paper.

962
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,560
So, who's going first?

963
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,220
Me.

964
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,780
I want to be the master
of my own destiny.

965
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,060
Sure thing, you're up.

966
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,240
Mr. Wang,

967
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,700
you must have given it
a pretty weak shake.

968
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,380
Now my fate is literally a blank slate.

969
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,520
Mr. Lin.

970
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,640
I'll go last.

971
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:49,580
Sure.

972
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,120
I'll go, then.

973
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:56,800
Alright.

974
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,860
Come on everyone.

975
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,220
Come on.

976
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,020
I'll pick one.

977
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,660
Let me get in on this too.

978
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,800
Nothing for me.

979
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,360
My turn.

980
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,780
Is it this one?

981
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,620
Foodie.

982
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,700
[Foodie]
Totally fits you.

983
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,220
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

984
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,760
That's the one.

985
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:14,880
Alright,

986
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,100
there's only one tasting slot left.

987
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,120
It's between Mr. Lin

988
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,960
and Nie.

989
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,360
The final face-off.

990
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,600
Who

991
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,040
is going to be the lucky foodie

992
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,060
of Administration?

993
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,420
Let's do it together.

994
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:32,820
Okay.

995
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,440
Foodie.

996
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:51,980
Shoot.

997
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,560
Seems Nie is the chosen one after all.
