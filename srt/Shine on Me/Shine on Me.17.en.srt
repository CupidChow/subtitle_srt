00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,980
I'm sure they sell everything
at the resort anyway.

192
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,380
Plus, there's always rentals.

193
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,159
Right, Mr. Hu?

194
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,000
You can just call me Hu.

195
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,179
The resort here

196
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,280
is fully equipped with everything.

197
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,280
You'll be able to get whatever you need.

198
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,480
Buying gear at the last minute
is such an amateur move.

199
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,340
But with the way you ski,

200
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,140
you're basically a scuttling crab.

201
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,300
Professional gear
would be a waste on you anyway.

202
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,600
Jiang Rui, you're dead.

203
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,740
Stop.

204
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,640
Jiang Rui.

205
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,360
You two, take it easy.

206
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,240
It's slippery out here.

207
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,160
Don't go breaking a bone

208
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,020
before we even hit the slopes.

209
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,420
He said I look like a scuttling crab.

210
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,480
I didn't even mention the fact

211
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,500
that he's "all gear and no idea."

212
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,660
What the heck?

213
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,140
Are you serious?

214
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,400
I just haven't skied for three years
because of high school.

215
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,840
I used to kill it on the slopes.

216
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,500
Just wait till I find my legs.

217
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,900
I'll be tearing up the black runs
in no time.

218
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,380
There's a saying:

219
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,380
"Bright child, dull adult."

220
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,080
Maybe now that you're older,

221
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,080
your body has just grown stiff.

222
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,800
Still younger than you, though.

223
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,440
They were so thick as thieves
just yesterday.

224
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,900
A few hours later,

225
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,340
they're already at it again.

226
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,380
That's just how it is when you're close.

227
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,940
Didn't you and Jiang Yun
always spar like that

228
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,720
when you were kids?

229
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,320
Him?

230
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,240
He never dared to talk back to me.

231
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,880
I shut him down every time.

232
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,400
Sounds like

233
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,060
Jiang Rui is showing more spine

234
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,060
than I did.

235
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,220
[Lin]
When I was chatting with my mom,

236
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,600
an idea popped into my head.

237
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,860
What is it?

238
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,420
We still haven't named

239
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
the PV garden.

240
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,900
How do you like

241
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,400
"Liuguang Garden"?

242
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,580
Focus on your conversation.

243
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,140
No shop talk.

244
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,680
Have you arrived
in Changbai Mountain yet?

245
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,080
Who are you chatting with?
You look suspiciously happy.

246
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,860
We literally just had a fight.

247
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
You're not checking my phone.

248
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,140
Who's fighting?

249
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,360
I even gave you the window seat.

250
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,160
There are
a dozen window seats here, okay?

251
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,780
Move over.

252
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,420
No.

253
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,940
Move.

254
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,480
Not happening.

255
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,980
Oh, my scarf and beanie!

256
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,540
Ugh, so annoying.

257
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,900
Actually, there's something

258
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,660
I forgot to tell you.

259
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,220
I learned a huge secret

260
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,780
while I was home.

261
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,180
But if you're gonna be like that,

262
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,980
I'm keeping it to myself.

263
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,700
As if I care.

264
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,200
You sure you don't want to hear it?

265
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,940
It's about you.

266
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,820
Fine, don't come crying to me later,
Nie Xiguang.

267
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,300
Every day you wait

268
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,160
is a day of happiness
you're missing out on.

269
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,220
We're here. This is the place.

270
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,720
Wow, it looks like something
straight out of a fairy tale.

271
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,580
Come on, hurry.

272
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,340
Thanks.

273
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,860
Our hotel

274
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,000
is divided into two sections,
the main hotel

275
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,720
and the villa area.

276
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,060
The villas are incredibly popular
this year

277
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,000
and were fully booked a long time ago.

278
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,120
The building...

279
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,340
- where we just checked in
- Watch your step.

280
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
is the main hotel.

281
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,000
That's where you'll need to go
for breakfast.

282
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,940
Do we have to walk over there

283
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,680
every morning?

284
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,280
Of course not. I'll be your shuttle.

285
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,020
Worst case,

286
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,140
I can just bring back some local treats.

287
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,200
- Honestly, just staying in
- Come on.

288
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,500
and having some tea

289
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,180
would be nice too.

290
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
I even saw some deer

291
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,400
on the drive over.

292
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,020
Really?

293
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,800
It's kind of a thing here at this hotel.

294
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,220
You don't even have to
leave the grounds to see them.

295
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,160
Come on.

296
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,120
Thank you.

297
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,740
Watch your step, everyone.

298
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,020
Careful.

299
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,860
Take a photo of me.

300
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,880
Hang on.

301
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,220
You can't even see
who it is in this shot.

302
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,620
Never mind that.

303
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,940
That's the whole point.

304
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,700
See?

305
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,060
Ugh, so tacky.

306
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,000
[Lin]

307
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,880
Xiguang, hurry up. It's freezing.

308
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,320
[- Expecting what? - Photos?]
Mystery photo incoming. Check it out.

309
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,240
She actually gave away her location.

310
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,340
Thanks.

311
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,740
What does that mean?

312
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,360
He's acting so sketchy.

313
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,400
Mrs. Jiang,

314
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,000
let's take a quick breather.

315
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,260
Later, I'll show you guys

316
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,000
around the resort's shopping street

317
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,780
and we'll grab some dinner.

318
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,740
Then we can sit down

319
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,540
and plan out

320
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,360
the rest of the trip.

321
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,800
We were supposed

322
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,520
to go to Tianchi Lake tomorrow.

323
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
But the main peak is closed

324
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,480
due to the weather.

325
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,240
We're still waiting for word

326
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,060
on when it'll reopen.

327
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,320
But the rest of our plans

328
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,860
are still a go.

329
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,300
I'm skipping the tourist spots tomorrow

330
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,340
and heading straight to the slopes.

331
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,860
No, you're going.

332
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:06,940
Wait,

333
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,260
why?

334
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,160
You can't

335
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,100
force me.

336
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,340
Because I'm the one

337
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,360
paying for this trip.

338
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,540
Listen up, everyone!

339
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,720
It's the frozen apocalypse,

340
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,240
and we are on the run!

341
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,620
The zombies

342
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,440
are right on our heels!

343
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,180
Jiang Rui,

344
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,800
what kind of weird novels

345
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,380
have you been reading lately?

346
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,760
How was it?

347
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,960
I can't do that again.

348
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,340
My heart is about
to jump out of my chest.

349
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,960
I thought you said
you didn't want to come?

350
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,500
You are having more fun than anyone.

351
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,020
I love this.

352
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,380
What do you say? One more time?

353
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,300
Or the off-roaders are fine too.

354
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,220
Hu!

355
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,200
What would you like, Madam?

356
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,380
Could we do something

357
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,280
less intense?

358
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,380
Not bad, right?

359
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,680
Move a bit this way. Yeah.

360
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,220
Perfect.

361
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,600
Does it look good from here?

362
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,320
It's okay.

363
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,560
Yeah, move over a bit.

364
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,540
Let's get the mountains in the shot.

365
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,340
The one footing the bill
calls the shots.

366
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,260
The one footing the bill
calls the shots.

367
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,940
The one footing the bill is your mom.

368
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,420
Take a picture with me.

369
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,560
Let's get one together.

370
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,480
Oh, come on, Mom.

371
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:46,880
No.

372
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,320
Forget it.

373
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,900
I'll just take a candid of you.

374
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,380
No, forget it.

375
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,920
Let's call it a day.

376
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,460
Let's head back and recharge.

377
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,200
[Changbai Mountain]
[Powder Snow Valley]

378
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,819
Let's hit the hot springs after dinner.

379
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,180
I've arranged everything.

380
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,480
Count me in.

381
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,200
My face is literally numb.

382
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,760
No, Nie Xiguang.

383
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,760
That's for middle-aged people.

384
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,400
Don't be so lame.

385
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,160
It's only 3 PM.

386
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,099
We're definitely going skiing.

387
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,800
Forget the hot springs.

388
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,240
We have to stay
until the night session is over.

389
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,560
Just go by yourself.

390
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,000
I haven't even bought any gear yet.

391
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,880
Let's go pick some out.

392
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,520
Jiang Rui!

393
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,060
Don't run off.

394
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,480
You're covering half, right?

395
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,940
I got it.

396
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,900
Quit harping on it.

397
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,780
This is why you should've packed

398
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,520
your own gear.

399
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,320
The selection here is meh.

400
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,340
I'll buy the outfit and pads,

401
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,520
and I'm renting the board.

402
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,240
Lugging it around is a pain.

403
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,740
You are pathetically lazy.

404
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,940
What?

405
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,820
I don't even know

406
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,080
what board fits me.

407
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,600
It's been forever

408
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,440
since I last skied.

409
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,760
Renting is just smarter.

410
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,820
Let's go.

411
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,280
[Vector]

412
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,340
Welcome.

413
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,620
Please, feel free to look around.

414
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,900
We have snowboards, skis,

415
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,700
and all the gear you'll need.

416
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,140
Great.

417
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,700
She's a skier.

418
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,780
We need a full set of gear,

419
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,380
everything except the skis.

420
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,820
Got it.

421
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,520
So cute.

422
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:07,900
Jiang Rui.

423
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,940
What are you doing here?

424
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,040
What are you doing here?

425
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,520
You look good in anything.

426
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,060
Do you have this in my size?

427
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,540
Yes, we do.

428
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,480
What about those boots?

429
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,800
Are they good for beginners?

430
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,140
With the flex on these,

431
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,480
they're perfect for beginners.

432
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,640
What's your size?

433
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,640
EU 37.

434
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,160
Okay.

435
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,540
Just a moment.

436
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,320
Thanks.

437
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,520
Rental clothes all look the same anyway.

438
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,300
If you didn't bring anything,

439
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,440
you should just buy a set at the store.

440
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,060
I brought

441
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,000
my full setup.

442
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,280
I brought mine too,

443
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,760
but I want to switch it up.

444
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,460
I need some advice.

445
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
Zhuang and I are total noobs.

446
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,040
We don't know jack.

447
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,520
Xu?

448
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,080
Zhuang,

449
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,340
is he a friend of yours?

450
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,600
Yeah.

451
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,220
He's a student I used to tutor.

452
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,660
You're here skiing, too?

453
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,020
Yeah, just on vacation.

454
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,560
We're here for a team-building trip.

455
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,520
What a coincidence.

456
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,480
I'm just here helping my cousin
pick out some gear.

457
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,360
Miss,

458
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,040
I've got your clothes ready.

459
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,960
You can try these on right over here.

460
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,540
I'll get you fitted for boots
once you're done with the clothes.

461
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:55,800
Okay.

462
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,040
Alright, let's try some on, too.

463
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,260
Right this way, please.

464
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,540
This one's good.

465
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:30,980
Zhuang.

466
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,580
Are you going to learn
snowboarding or skiing?

467
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,000
I'd recommend snowboarding.

468
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,300
Guys look so cool doing it.

469
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,600
I can give it a try.

470
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,300
Yeah, try it out.

471
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,640
No need to buy

472
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,980
a board and boots just yet.

473
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
Just get a face mask,

474
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,280
some snow clothes,
and you're good to go.

475
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,500
This one looks pretty good.

476
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:53,900
Try it on.

477
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,400
How come

478
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,560
Xu is here at Changbai Mountain, too?

479
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,940
Could it be that Zhuang Fei

480
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,680
saw my messages

481
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,620
in the group chat

482
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,380
and tipped him off?

483
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,400
No.

484
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,220
He said it was a team-building trip,

485
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,680
but still...

486
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,140
Come in.

487
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,100
Here.

488
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,120
I've wiped

489
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,060
and dried your boots.

490
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,720
Thanks.

491
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,320
By the way, Ms. Zhang,

492
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,140
I won't be home

493
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,020
for lunch tomorrow.

494
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,940
I'm hanging out
with two high school friends.

495
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,980
Wait, it just hit me.

496
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,500
Your friend's brother,

497
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,440
Mr. Zhuang,

498
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,820
who used to tutor you.

499
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,920
He came by

500
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,740
looking for you

501
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,040
while you and Xiguang
were studying abroad.

502
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,720
Xu?

503
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,140
What was he looking for?

504
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,200
No idea.

505
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,320
It was bucketing down that day.

506
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,520
I told him you were overseas studying,

507
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,780
and he just took off.

508
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Did he try calling you after?

509
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,160
Nope.

510
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,400
Maybe the time difference
messed things up and I missed it.

511
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,780
And Ms. Zhang,

512
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
we were on a study trip,

513
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,880
not studying abroad.

514
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,160
Why do you always get that mixed up?

515
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,520
I can't keep all that straight.

516
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,160
I'll do it myself.

517
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,340
Done.

518
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:01,980
Xiguang,

519
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,780
how do you like it?

520
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,160
Does it fit?

521
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,080
It's great.

522
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,220
I'll take the pink one.

523
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,360
Okay, I'll bag that up for you.

524
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,160
Okay. Thanks.

525
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,340
Let's go try on the boots now.

526
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,820
This way, please.

527
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,120
Gee, these ski boots

528
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,200
are total bricks.

529
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,040
You're gonna be walking

530
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,960
like a robot tomorrow.

531
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,640
Don't jinx me

532
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,820
before we even hit the slopes.

533
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,180
My bad.

534
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,740
These are actually pretty standard

535
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,800
for beginners.

536
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,140
If they're too soft or light,

537
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,200
you won't be able
to drive the skis properly.

538
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,140
Excuse me.

539
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,540
Could you help us get these clothes

540
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,560
in their sizes?

541
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,320
Just a moment.

542
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,400
I'm helping her with her boots.

543
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,660
I'm the only one in the shop today.

544
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,440
Sorry about the wait.

545
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,160
Go ahead.

546
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,980
I can try these on myself.

547
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,100
No worries, we can wait.

548
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,100
Thank you.

549
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,620
These feel pretty good.

550
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,300
I'll take these.

551
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,140
We've also picked out some other things.

552
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,000
Let's check them all out together.

553
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,560
Sure thing.

554
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,880
Thank you.

555
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,580
Xiguang, let me take those.

556
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,720
You can take this one.

557
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,060
Xu,

558
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,700
we're heading out now.

559
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,100
See you around.

560
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,380
Take care. Come back soon.

561
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,800
See which one you like.

562
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,260
The detail on this one is different,

563
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,220
right?

564
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,940
If you really don't

565
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,320
feel like skiing,

566
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,760
we could go

567
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,800
to the hot springs instead.

568
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,680
Why wouldn't we go?

569
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,080
We've already bought everything.

570
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,460
We'll go to the ski center,

571
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,140
drop off our gear, rent the boards,

572
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,980
and then head back for dinner.

573
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,320
After that, we'll hit the slopes.

574
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,480
I'm just afraid you're distracted

575
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
and might end up having an accident.

576
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,000
And besides,

577
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,160

582
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,780
You weren't even looking
where you were going just now.

583
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,540
I was just wondering

584
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,160

585
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,200

00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,000
I tried calling him twice,

753
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,640
but I couldn't get through.

754
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,660
Jiang Rui and Xiguang

755
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,720
have gone overseas for study.

756
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,840
Didn't they tell you?

757
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,700
♪You are the sun in my life♪

758
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:04,040
♪Yet I could not reach you
through the long night♪

759
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:11,420
♪I can only wait in silence♪

760
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,340
♪Hoping the dawn will break♪

761
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,000
That doesn't matter anymore.

762
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,700
So I don't need to tell
Xiguang about this,

763
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,220
right?

764
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,200
Is there even any point?

765
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,020
I see.

766
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,740
Goodbye, Mr. Zhuang.

767
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,940
What were you two talking about?

768
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,360
He just asked a few questions
about Zhuang Fei.

769
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,040
It's nothing.

770
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,700
It's getting really late.

771
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,720
Let's head back.

772
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:44,980
Let's go.

773
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,460
Alright.

774
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,740
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

775
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,380
Happy Chinese New Year.

776
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,760
What the heck?

777
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,280
I can't believe the karaoke bar is full.

778
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,320
It's Chinese New Year.
There are tourists everywhere.

779
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,300
Drinking in our room is just as good.

780
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,300
It's more chill anyway.

781
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,100
Right.

782
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,200
Otherwise, we'd be stuck

783
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,480
listening to Kevin hog the mic

784
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,540
and torture our ears.

785
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,580
Watch your mouth.

786
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:26,880
Maybe one day

787
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,940
I'll quit being a finance grunt

788
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,060
and make it big as a superstar.

789
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,520
Then, you won't even be able to get

790
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,160
an appointment with me.

791
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,600
Yeah, right.

792
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,560
I have so much dirt on you.

793
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,920
One word from me,

794
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,920
and you'll come crawling back

795
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,540
to treat me to dinner.

796
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,720
Stop talking trash.

797
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,460
I've got nothing to hide.

798
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,280
What dirt?

799
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,060
Seriously?

800
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:44,800
Last time

801
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,120
at the karaoke bar,

802
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,780
he got wasted

803
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,480
and told me everything.

804
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,160
And I recorded the whole thing.

805
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:51,960
Come on, cheers.

806
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,320
Seriously, Kevin,

807
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,140
I think Zhuang has a better shot

808
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,320
at debuting than you do.

809
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,880
We're in different leagues.

810
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,880
He's an idol,

811
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,860
but I'm a vocal legend.

812
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,680
But hey, Zhuang Xu,

813
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,020
what if we start a duo?

814
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,760
What should we call it?

815
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,280
The Huaya Duo.

816
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,300
Oh, brilliant.

817
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,300
Just hearing that name...

818
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,100
completely killed my vibe.

819
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,000
I don't even want to debut anymore.

820
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,980
The Huaya Duo.

821
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,320
Drinking straight is no fun.

822
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,260
Let's

823
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,719
spice things up with a game.

824
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,360
- Sure.
- I'm in.

825
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,679
Standard cards or Texas Hold'em?

826
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,340
Truth or Dare.

827
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,639
I need to get some dirt
on you guys, too.

828
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,080
That game is so played out.

829
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,520
Yeah, seriously.

830
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,380
We even know how many times

831
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,280
you've been rejected

832
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,219
since you were a kid.

833
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,000
But we've got

834
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,620
someone new to play with today.

835
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,340
So, you're coming for me.

836
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,500
How do you know

837
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,300
it'll even land on me?

838
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,600
There's always a chance.

839
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,040
Anyway, you guys have already dug up
all my secrets.

840
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,020
I've got nothing left to fear.

841
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,179
Alright, let's do it.

842
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:53,840
Start it up.

843
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,500
Come on.

844
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,520
Let's get started.

845
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,980
No need to explain the rules, right?

846
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,720
We're playing the mild version.

847
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,460
If you don't want to answer
or do the dare,

848
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,520
you just take a shot.

849
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,240
Okay.

850
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,660
Alright.

851
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,300
I'm the first one? Seriously?

852
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,080
Okay, I choose Truth. Shoot.

853
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,440
How many exes do you have?

854
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,100
Two.

855
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,040
Your questions are so lame.

856
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,700
I agree.

857
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,820
My turn to spin the bottle.

858
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,560
Truth.

859
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,240
Make it a hard one.

860
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,700
How many people have you dated?

861
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,080
Oh, so now the question
isn't lame anymore?

862
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:43,880
Yup!

863
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:47,760
None.

864
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,960
No way, I don't buy it.

865
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,380
Why?

866
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,480
That's another question.
Save it for next time.

867
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,780
Spin it.

868
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,840
Quick.

869
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,600
Come on.

870
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,980
Yeah.

871
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,680
Wait, how does this work?

872
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,660
Do I ask myself?

873
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,980
No, I still get to ask.

874
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,600
Let's see.

875
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,380
Why?

876
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,320
Is it because you got rejected

877
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,980
like Kevin?

878
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,960
Hold on, isn't that two questions?

879
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,580
Wow, you're such a cheapskate.

880
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,060
Okay, let me change it.

881
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,040
Is there someone you like?

882
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
I can choose to drink instead, right?

883
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
Now you're being no fun.

884
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:56,920
Yeah.

885
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:57,820
Zhuang.

886
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,660
Look at him.

887
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,740
He's totally wasted.

888
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,520
They were even trying
to outdrink each other.

889
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,680
Who's the bigger lightweight, seriously?

890
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,800
It's freezing.
What are you doing out here?

891
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,220
I've had too much.

892
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,560
It's so stuffy in there.
I was starting to feel dizzy.

893
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,840
Isn't that your student

894
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,660
and his cousin?

895
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,140
So they're staying at this hotel too.

896
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,820
Probably in the villa area.

897
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,380
It's beautiful over there.

898
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,700
Too bad they were all booked up

899
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,360
when we tried to reserve.

900
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,000
This place is nice too.

901
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,740
More convenient.

902
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,920
To be honest,
I felt a bit awkward today.

903
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,760
Why?

904
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,760
When we were at the slopes,

905
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,120
I thought

906
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,720
you weren't close
with your student's cousin.

907
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,940
So I asked her

908
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,040
to take a photo of us.

909
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,020
But seeing the two of you later,

910
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,000
I get the feeling

911
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,400
you two have a history.

912
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,440
I don't think

913
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,280
I've even spoken to her.

914
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,420
Call it a woman's intuition.

915
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,960
And besides, staying at this hotel

916
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,580
was your idea, wasn't it?

917
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,700
Did you know

918
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,480
they were staying here

919
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,380
and planned all this?

920
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,120
My brother

921
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,500
planned the trip.

922
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,880
I told you guys about it.

923
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,240
But then he caught a stomach bug,
so he couldn't make it.

924
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,560
I see.

925
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,700
But why have you been drinking like that

926
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,680
ever since you got back?

927
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,000
I can tell

928
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,400
you've been putting on a brave face,

929
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,920
even though you were

930
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,940
laughing and chatting along.

931
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,740
So you do have a history.

932
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,900
If you really like her,

933
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,480
just go for it.

934
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,920
What's the point of drinking alone
like this?

935
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,540
If I were you,

936
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,280
I'd just ask her out.

937
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,300
No.

938
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,240
When they walked past us just now,

939
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,700
I should have

940
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,320
just shouted out to them.

941
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,920
It's not what you think.

942
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,220
There's no history between us.

943
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,760
And

944
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,440
if memory serves,

945
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,640
she has a boyfriend.

946
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,680
Hey, Xu.

947
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,480
Is your stomach bug better?

948
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,780
It's better.

949
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,960
I went to Aunt's for dinner

950
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,000
with Mom today.

951
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,080
I'm completely fine now.

952
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,620
The timing couldn't have been worse,

953
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,380
making me miss out on Changbai Mountain.

954
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,820
You can always go some other time.

955
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,220
It's not like it's far.

956
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,580
My colleagues chose Changbai Mountain

957
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,500
because of me.

958
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,520
That's why I had to show up.

959
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,300
I know.

960
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,220
Xu,

961
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,140
are you having

962
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,880
a good time there?

963
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,020
Did you come across

964
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,840
anything interesting?

965
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,180
What could I possibly come across?

966
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,840
You know, just something fun,

967
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,560
or someone.

968
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,300
Zhuang Fei.

969
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
Did you know Jiang Rui

970
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,660
was coming to Changbai Mountain?

971
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:57,580
Xu,

972
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:58,740
I...

973
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,540
I just think

974
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,340
you should give yourself a chance.

975
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,680
Back in Shanghai,

976
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,300
that time you got drunk and...

977
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,820
Don't ever do something like this again.

978
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,200
I understand.

979
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:13,740
But

980
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,600
you've told me since we were kids

981
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,200
that if you want something,
you have to fight for it.

982
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,460
Fight for it?

983
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:26,940
How?

984
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,800
She already has a boyfriend.

985
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,040
So how am I supposed to fight for her?

986
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,740
Am I supposed to

987
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,980
steal her away?
