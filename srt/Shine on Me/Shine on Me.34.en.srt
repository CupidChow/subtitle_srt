00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:42,432
(Taihu High-end Medical Center)

12
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,919
Let's have a simple meal.

13
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,260
Lately,

14
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,699
you've been exhausted.

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,859
After dinner,

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,639
stay home for the night.

17
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,960
Don't return to Suzhou.

18
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,620
You too, Lin.

19
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,100
No more trips.

20
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,419
The guest room

21
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:06,320
is ready.

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,064
What?

23
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,560
I've already said it.

24
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:14,859
Need Xiguang's approval?

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,672
No,

26
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,239
I'm just a bit worried.

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,060
Thank you.

28
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:53,859
Dad,

29
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:55,239
does it hurt?

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,660
Let me blow on it for you.

31
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,600
Doesn't hurt.

32
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,088
Xiguang,

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,019
where's Mom?

34
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,720
Mom's downstairs on a call,

35
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,000
arguing with someone.

36
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,480
Arguing?

37
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:08,019
Do you know who?

38
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:09,239
No.

39
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,399
But Mom is really good at it.

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,079
Mom won the argument.

41
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:17,079
Who were you arguing?

42
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,940
I didn't.

43
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,699
I just spoke a bit louder.

44
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:22,579
Huang?

45
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,639
What's he stirring up now?

46
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,260
It's all settled.

47
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,699
Just focus on recovering.

48
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:28,660
Stop worrying.

49
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,976
Mom and Dad will pick up Xiguang.

50
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,199
I'll stay.

51
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,720
No need. I can manage alone.

52
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,799
This illness is work-induced.

53
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:36,980
Badge of over-exertion.

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,579
I'll take care of you.

55
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,128
What?

56
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:41,619
If not work-induced,

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,579
you won't?

58
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:45,079
Don't twist my words.

59
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,760
Lin,

60
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,460
come on in.

61
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,419
Make yourself at home.

62
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,480
No worries.

63
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,496
Okay, Ms. Jiang.

64
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:24,819
These

65
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,119
are Xiguang's uncle's slippers.

66
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,359
Wear them for now.

67
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,879
Later, I'll have Xiguang

68
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,200
buy some for your own use.

69
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:31,679
Thanks, Ms. Jiang.

70
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,439
I can bring my own.

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,080
In Wuxi,

72
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:43,299
we do sell slippers.

73
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,499
No need to bring yours.

74
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,160
The guest room is ready,

75
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,059
but the housekeeper isn't here.

76
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:51,059
You two need

77
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,040
to tidy up yourselves.

78
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,216
Xiguang,

79
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:53,980
help Lin

80
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,100
get the quilt and pillows.

81
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,379
I'm fine now.

82
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:19,460
Today,

83
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:21,600
I made a mistake.

84
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,540
What mistake?

85
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,739
Next time you go see your dad,

86
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,720
I'll go with you.

87
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,679
Even if you go with me,

88
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,759
there's nothing you can do.

89
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,319
At least, I can

90
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,259
take some heat.

91
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,900
Plus, Mr. Nie cares about face.

92
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,280
If I'm there,

93
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:49,439
he'll hold back.

94
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,540
Let him hold it in.

95
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,700
During dinner just now,

96
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,780
I was thinking

97
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,559
I might be a bit too much.

98
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,919
How come?

99
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,819
You just stated the truth.

100
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,179
Mr. Nie's mood was already bad.

101
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:18,780
If you hadn't explained,

102
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,759
for the police and rumors,

103
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,359
he'd be angrier inside.

104
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:23,780
That would be worse.

105
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:25,619
Not towards him,

106
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,600
but you.

107
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,368
Me?

108
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,900
My dad has always
had a bias against you.

109
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,160
But these days,

110
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:36,720
I've been

111
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,819
sending his medical records

112
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,419
to you for your opinion.

113
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,379
I never considered

114
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,239
your feelings.

115
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,900
It would be a problem

116
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,419
if you didn't.

117
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,460
Couples

118
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:50,688
should support

119
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,160
and rely on each other.

120
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,100
If you don't trust me

121
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,140
or rely on me

122
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,640
in my field,

123
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,119
I'd be disappointed.

124
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,799
Is that so?

125
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:02,859
Of course.

126
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,900
Actually, these days,

127
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
I've organized the plan

128
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,119
for the surgery.

129
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,559
Assuming I were performing the surgery,

130
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:12,580
how would I do it?

131
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:14,040
What position would I use?

132
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,119
Once Dr. Schneider arrives,

133
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,179
we can go see him together

134
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:20,140
and hear his surgical plan.

135
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:25,999
Thank you.

136
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:28,900
If you insist on saying thanks,

137
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,840
I'll accept it.

138
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,600
But

139
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
help me solve a practical

140
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:35,379
problem first.

141
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,312
What?

142
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,580
Your bedsheet design

143
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,379
is illogical.

144
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,259
No matter how I turn it,

145
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:42,319
it seems short.

146
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,700
Really?

147
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,419
You hold that end. Let me see.

148
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,824
Let me check.

149
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:00,700
It really is!

150
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,540
How was the sheet

151
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,439
designed?

152
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:04,840
Why is it square?

153
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:06,840
This should be at the headboard.

154
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,900
No, this side should be the head.

155
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,239
I just noticed it has lace

156
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,200
on three sides.

157
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,200
Really!

158
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,580
Listen to me.

159
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,619
Just do this.

160
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,919
See?

161
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:17,679
Seems correct now.

162
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,759
My observational skills

163
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,739
are sharp, right?

164
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,379
This is the kitchen.

165
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:29,720
If you get hungry at night,

166
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,840
just raid the fridge.

167
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,619
It's my first visit.

168
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,300
Don't tempt me into mischief.

169
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:39,960
There seems

170
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,279
nothing ideal for midnight snacking.

171
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,180
When I'm away,

172
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:48,019
does the fridge get this empty?

173
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,820
It's fine.

174
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,340
I've got this.

175
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,899
It's my secret stash.

176
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,848
Thanks.

177
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,128
Let's go.

178
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:13,039
I'll show you

179
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,800
my mom's flowers.

180
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:21,899
Look.

181
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,320
My mom mainly grows

182
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:33,420
phalaenopsis orchids.

183
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,619
Guess why?

184
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,639
Not because she likes them?

185
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,359
It's because they're easy!

186
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,060
It's all she can keep alive.

187
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,519
It's May already,

188
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,619
but these orchids

189
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,499
have so many blooms.

190
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,300
She must have some talent
for this after all.

191
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,779
Don't insult her.

192
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,279
She's not here.

193
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,639
She can't hear you flatter her.

194
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:00,460
It's practice.

195
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,340
I'll say it again at breakfast tomorrow.

196
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:10,240
(Dad: Xiguang,
sorry for what happened today)

197
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,320
(Xiguang,)

198
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,980
(sorry for what)

199
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,239
(happened today.)

200
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,560
(I don't distrust you.)

201
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:21,560
(It's just that I've)

202
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,300
(been feeling low
due to illness lately,)

203
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:25,019
(and often can't control myself.)

204
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,639
(I said many hurtful things today.)

205
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,300
(They were unintentional.)

206
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:30,840
(You must never doubt)

207
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,999
(that in this world,)

208
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,180
(I love you the most.)

209
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,279
(I'll think)

210
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,539
(about what you said.)

211
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,920
My dad sent me a message apologizing.

212
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:52,720
But somehow,

213
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,460
I couldn't easily

214
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,460
reply with "It's okay."

215
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,060
But he's

216
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,259
so seriously ill.

217
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,940
I just couldn't bear...

218
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:09,700
I understand.

219
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,279
I've been through

220
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,320
this before.

221
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,460
Your grandpa?

222
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,872
Yes.

223
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:29,856
Come on.

224
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,320
Let's go downstairs

225
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,499
for some air.

226
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,239
I told you before.

227
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,600
Before the exam,

228
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:41,840
someone told me

229
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,779
how my father died.

230
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:47,659
So I moved out of my grandpa's place.

231
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,340
You said that later,

232
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:52,259
after seeing so much death

233
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,940
at the hospital,

234
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:55,139
you learned to let go.

235
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:58,920
But before letting go,

236
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,560
I went through turmoil too.

237
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,100
I remember back then,

238
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,600
not long after I moved out,

239
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,980
my grandpa got very sick

240
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:13,879
and needed surgery.

241
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,580
Mr. Li called me,

242
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,159
hoping I'd visit him.

243
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
I rushed to the hospital.

244
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,320
I sat at the entrance

245
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:25,480
alone until dawn.

246
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,759
At last, I didn't go in.

247
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,080
I didn't leave until Mr. Li

248
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,039
told me the surgery

249
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,800
succeeded.

250
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,800
Everything involving emotions

251
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,999
may be unsolvable.

252
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,800
Only time will tell.

253
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,940
But the younger me

254
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,999
made

255
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:02,859
a naive vow.

256
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:05,480
What vow?

257
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,379
Although a bit childish,

258
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,519
I believe

259
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,820
I'll hold on to it.

260
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:22,220
Back when I was 15,

261
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,700
I told myself

262
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:25,879
that I must

263
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,019
be good to those I love.

264
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,499
Whether it's family

265
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,359
or a partner.

266
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:33,800
I want the ones I love

267
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,639
to never suffer

268
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,999
because of moral dilemmas

269
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:42,019
and emotional conflicts caused by me.

270
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,180
I was trying to comfort you.

271
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:58,659
Why did it backfire

272
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,200
and make you cry?

273
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,920
No,

274
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:07,800
I was just thinking

275
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,920
of you,

276
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:11,239
only 15,

277
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,659
so small,

278
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,659
sitting alone on the steps

279
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,580
all night long.

280
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,119
It breaks my heart.

281
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,680
I can do it too.

282
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,680
Yusen,

283
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,220
I will also make sure

284
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,220
that after 30, Lin Yusen

285
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:34,399
never suffers

286
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:37,039
from moral dilemmas

287
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,920
and emotional conflicts
because of his loved ones.

288
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:46,300
Okay.

289
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,080
But,

290
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:09,680
there's a crucial detail

291
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,639
I need to correct.

292
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:12,379
What is it?

293
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,659
The 15-year-old me

294
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,060
was already six feet tall.

295
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,420
I wasn't small.

296
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:13,779
Maybe later,

297
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,920
send a simple message.

298
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,279
Not for others,

299
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,600
just for yourself.

300
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:23,659
That way,

301
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,960
you might feel better

302
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,999
and won't agonize over it.

303
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:35,999
And then,

304
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,619
get some proper rest.

305
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,899
Every day you wake up from now on,

306
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,912
I'll be there.

307
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,019
Yusen,

308
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,539
although

309
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,139
I was a little bit late,

310
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,060
from now on,

311
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:00,680
you'll always have me.

312
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,180
Grandma, I'm fine.

313
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,739
Yusen and I

314
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:37,999
are on our way back to Suzhou.

315
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,019
We have a meeting at ten.

316
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:41,480
Xiguang,

317
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:42,599
if your work is busy,

318
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,059
don't travel back and forth.

319
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,099
This morning,

320
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,839
I got a call from your dad.

321
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,299
He apologized to me.

322
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,799
Your grandpa and I

323
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,079
came to see him at the hospital.

324
00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:52,739
Grandpa wanted to scold him,

325
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,460
but seeing how he looks now,

326
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:55,480
he just couldn't do it.

327
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,819
What can we do? He's our own child.

328
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,079
But I notice

329
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:02,200
he's much calmer today.

330
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,140
Probably because you

331
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,819
scolded him yesterday and woke him up.

332
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,460
Seems like he's reflecting a bit.

333
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,920
As long as it doesn't affect

334
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,839
his upcoming surgery.

335
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:13,819
It won't. It's good for him.

336
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,480
He was irritable the past few days.

337
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,480
Terrible temper.

338
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,160
The doctors kept telling us

339
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,900
to keep him calm

340
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,920
and comfort him.

341
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:23,039
But nothing we said worked.

342
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,519
Now, by some twist of fate,

343
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,720
he's quieted down,

344
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,559
not throwing tantrums anymore either.

345
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:29,900
That's good.

346
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,460
Xiguang,

347
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:34,259
there's something

348
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,900
I've been meaning to ask,

349
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,420
but now I'm too embarrassed
to bring it up.

350
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,299
What is it, Grandma? You can tell me.

351
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,200
You said before that Lin

352
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,920
is a very skilled surgeon.

353
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,519
I was thinking,

354
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,160
when that foreign doctor arrives,

355
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:50,059
could he

356
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,940
help us

357
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,819
communicate with the foreign doctor?

358
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,059
We don't understand anything!

359
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,559
Though we have advisors,

360
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:58,900
it's never as reassuring
as having Lin there.

361
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,279
But,

362
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,559
after everything,

363
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,299
I feel too embarrassed

364
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:05,480
to make this request.

365
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,059
Grandma,

366
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,799
Yusen has been looking over Dad's

367
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:10,880
medical records.

368
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,896
He's provided many insights.

369
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,319
When the plan comes in,

370
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,480
he will also help review it.

371
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,880
Grandma,

372
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,299
whether it's for you

373
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,900
or my duty as a former doctor,

374
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,319
I will do my best.

375
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:30,539
Lin,

376
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,180
thank you so much.

377
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:42,368
(One Month Later, Nanjing)

378
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:44,420
(Nanjing Cheng Rui
Architectural Design Firm)

379
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,160
Today's meeting

380
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:47,120
is not for opinions.

381
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,720
No discussions.

382
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,680
I'm just here to present to you

383
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,900
the final design.

384
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:54,319
Wang, good to see you.

385
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,559
Haven't seen you

386
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:56,700
this spirited for long.

387
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,579
No matter where he comes from,

388
00:19:59,099 --> 00:19:59,940
I'm now confident

389
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:01,099
to compete.

390
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:02,279
Well said, Mr. Wang!

391
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,319
Let's gear up.

392
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,999
Next week's bid opening,

393
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,279
we're going to win it!

394
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
The bid opening is in Suzhou,

395
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,192
early next Saturday morning.

396
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:13,519
We plan to stay

397
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:14,660
in Suzhou on Friday.

398
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,140
It's in Suzhou?

399
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,279
That's perfect!

400
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:18,680
At that time, Yusen and I

401
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,400
will see you off.

402
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:20,480
That's wonderful!

403
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,799
It's a pity Feng Teng has restrictions

404
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,900
on attendees,

405
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:25,200
or I was planning

406
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:26,180
to take you all along.

407
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,339
We certainly can't take that risk.

408
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,519
Sheng Xingjie is probably watching us,

409
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,599
looking for a slip-up.

410
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,140
If he reports us,

411
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:35,319
we'll be disqualified.

412
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,599
Don't talk about that.

413
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,819
Your generation is so superstitious.

414
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,200
You youngsters

415
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,239
are fearless out of ignorance.

416
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:47,440
Why isn't Yusen here today?

417
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,980
He is working overtime this morning

418
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:50,860
for next month's

419
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,239
equipment installation.

420
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,519
He'll go to Shanghai this afternoon
to meet Professor Xi.

421
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,660
He's joining the institute?

422
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:58,688
Yes.

423
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,519
He spends a lot of time every day

424
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:01,259
on it now.

425
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:02,660
But he didn't neglect

426
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,380
factory matters.

427
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,200
He's incredibly energetic.

428
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:07,380
Yeah.

429
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:09,620
Not tired even working two jobs.

430
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,660
Probably a perpetual machine.

431
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,660
Right, how's your dad doing?

432
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,220
It's been a while.

433
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,160
Is he discharged?

434
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:19,460
Not yet.

435
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,680
He's doing rehab there.

436
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,739
How's his recovery going then?

437
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:29,200
The surgery itself was very successful,

438
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,680
but this condition is tricky.

439
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,940
Even after successfully
removing the tumor,

440
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,799
hearing is still affected.

441
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,739
It probably won't fully return
to how it was.

442
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,839
But preserving some hearing

443
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:41,599
is very fortunate.

444
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,900
The facial paralysis is improved too.

445
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,059
Your dad

446
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:48,559
is a very proud man.

447
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,660
It must be hard for him.

448
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,019
It's fine now.

449
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:55,999
His mood

450
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:56,900
is stable right now.

451
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,019
True.

452
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,799
After such a serious illness,

453
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:02,539
people do change.

454
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,360
The accuracy rate

455
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,360
is getting better.

456
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,999
How long do I have to train?

457
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,259
Overall, rehabilitation
takes about six weeks.

458
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,019
However,

459
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:43,279
if it progresses well,

460
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:44,900
you can continue training

461
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:45,860
at home later on.

462
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,799
Neural rehabilitation

463
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,960
is a very lengthy process.

464
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,016
Take it slow.

465
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,519
What about

466
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:53,920
the level of recovery?

467
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:54,819
It depends

468
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,940
on your specific progress.

469
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,920
But you need

470
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,160
to brace yourself mentally.

471
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:01,579
Rest for a while.

472
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,519
Later,

473
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,420
we'll continue

474
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,900
the facial rehabilitation.

475
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:09,700
Mr. Nie.

476
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,200
Xu.

477
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,299
I'm here today

478
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,200
to update you

479
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,140
on the Intelligent Digital Center bid

480
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,839
of Feng Teng.

481
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,288
Take a look.

482
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,339
Chengyuan,

483
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,299
Xiguang's here.

484
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,448
Dad.

485
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,559
Take a seat.

486
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,839
Have some fruit.

487
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:25,880
I'll finish this quickly.

488
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,259
Rest more.

489
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,680
Don't worry about the company.

490
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,640
I'm just listening to the update.

491
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:31,900
Yes, ma'am.

492
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,019
I'm almost done.

493
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,339
The bid opening

494
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,299
is scheduled

495
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,499
for next Saturday

496
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:38,480
in Suzhou.

497
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,839
Should we...

498
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,120
Maybe I should leave

499
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,420
and come back later.

500
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,440
What's wrong?

501
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,759
Uncle and Aunt

502
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,579
are also bidding

503
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:47,559
for this project.

504
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:48,960
I think

505
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,819
I'll wait outside.

506
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,660
You're not involved.

507
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,660
Why leave?

508
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,779
That's not good.

509
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,839
After all, I know both sides.

510
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,200
What if there's any

511
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,239
information leakage

512
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,299
and you suspect me?

513
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,120
Xu,

514
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:04,980
please go out and wait for a moment.

515
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:05,999
Okay.

516
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,059
I'll go cut some fruit for you.

517
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:15,900
Are you blaming me

518
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,099
for what happened last time?

519
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:19,239
Things happened fast,

520
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,360
and I was a bit rash,

521
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:22,360
wronging you.

522
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,559
I apologize.

523
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,536
No,

524
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:27,319
it really is better to stay out of it.

525
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,460
Cheng Rui

526
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,460
simply has no chance of winning the bid.

527
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:33,599
Why so stubborn?

528
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,099
Even if you told them

529
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,099
the bottom line

530
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,860
of the bid,

531
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,099
with their strength,

532
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,920
their proposal

533
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:40,279
wouldn't score high enough.

534
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,360
How do you know

535
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,680
Uncle and Aunt can't make it?

536
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:44,200
Let's be realistic.

537
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,059
Look at the other companies bidding.

538
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,440
Which one isn't better

539
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:48,640
than Cheng Rui?

540
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:49,940
Sheng Yuan

541
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,239
is determined to win.

542
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:52,460
Earlier on,

543
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,079
Sheng Bokai even called me,

544
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,579
trying to ask me to rig the bid.

545
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,360
Isn't that illegal?

546
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,680
You know bid rigging?

547
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,579
Of course.

548
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,620
Just a group of people

549
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,579
occupying the slots.

550
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:03,980
Except for the decided winner,

551
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,140
everyone else

552
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,360
half-hearts their proposal

553
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,799
and colludes on their prices
to ensure that one wins.

554
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,999
I heard you talk about it

555
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,099
when I was little.

556
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,059
Understand it in just a few words?

557
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,480
Impressive.

558
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:17,499
You really are

559
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,019
inheriting my business acumen.

560
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,660
If anything, it's from Mom.

561
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,400
So you agreed?

562
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:27,539
Feng Teng Group isn't some pushover.

563
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,999
How could they let such

564
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:31,019
petty tactics slide easily?

565
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,120
They spotted the irregularities.

566
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:33,880
However,

567
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,759
out of respect for Mr. Sheng,

568
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,839
they just gave a private warning.

569
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:40,819
Seeing his first scheme fail,

570
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,480
Sheng Bokai spent heavily

571
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,200
to bring in

572
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,620
the top international architect

573
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,460
Du Lan.

574
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:48,680
With a master like that,

575
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:50,680
how can Cheng Rui possibly compete?

576
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:52,960
Leaving Sheng Yuan aside,

577
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,519
our Yuan Cheng Group

578
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:55,420
has deep expertise

579
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,880
in design and construction

580
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,599
that Cheng Rui can't match.

581
00:25:58,819 --> 00:25:59,739
So I say Cheng Rui

582
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:00,940
has no chance of winning.

583
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,299
Purely a business judgment.

584
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,940
They shouldn't

585
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,739
be wasting time

586
00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:06,120
and effort on this project.

587
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,079
Xiguang,

588
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,880
now that you're working,

589
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,420
remember this.

590
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:14,680
Business world is a battlefield.

591
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,319
Be ruthless.

592
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,799
Always stay rational.

593
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,599
You must never let emotions

594
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,400
cloud your judgment and decisions.

595
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,519
Point taken.

596
00:26:25,344 --> 00:26:28,992
(Suzhou Intelligent Digital Center
Bid Opening Meeting)

597
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:30,640
Yes.

598
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,720
When we'll get inside,

599
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:33,200
let's follow the procedures.

600
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,279
Don't forget.

601
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:38,368
Xiguang,

602
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:39,980
just drop us off here.

603
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:40,920
Don't wait for us.

604
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,440
We don't know when
the bid opening will end.

605
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,408
And once inside,
phones will be handed over.

606
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:46,680
We will lose touch.

607
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:47,680
Okay.

608
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:48,339
Aunt,

609
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:49,980
will the business bid open today?

610
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:52,279
According to the documents,

611
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:52,999
it's today.

612
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,120
That's for the best.

613
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,860
If it drags on,

614
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,220
there may be foul play.

615
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:57,099
So we'll know

616
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,860
the result today.

617
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,592
Yes.

618
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,140
Why isn't he

619
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,160
making threats today?

620
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:26,680
He must be scared of us.

621
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,519
Seems like it.

622
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,900
How boring.

623
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,739
You two...

624
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,700
Alright, we're heading in.

625
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,880
Behave.

626
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:36,599
Go back now.

627
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,239
See you in Suzhou tonight.

628
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,339
Don't worry, Aunt.

629
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,499
We already made plans.

630
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,560
Okay.

631
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
Then we're going in.

632
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,928
Okay.

633
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,779
Good luck, Aunt.

634
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,816
Okay.

635
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,064
Good luck, Mr. Wang.

636
00:27:48,704 --> 00:27:49,279
Let's go.

637
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:49,920
Good luck!

638
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,720
What plans do we have?

639
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,579
Why didn't I know?

640
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,259
Well.

641
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,799
There's a property

642
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,620
I'm interested in.

643
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,440
How about we take a look?

644
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:05,632
What...

645
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:06,779
Houses?

646
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:24,460
Did you plan this all along?

647
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:26,656
Yes.

648
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,599
Long planned.

649
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,360
Hello.

650
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:33,120
You must be Mr. Lin and Ms. Nie?

651
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,080
Yes.

652
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,779
Welcome!

653
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,980
I've been waiting.

654
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,180
Please.

655
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,079
Let me introduce

656
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,999
our property to you.

657
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,099
Our Lakeview Villa

658
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,660
is situated on the most beautiful
shoreline of Cheng Lake.

659
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,839
It's a low-density,
exclusive villa community.

660
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,019
The greenery ratio

661
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:50,860
reaches 60 percent.

662
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,319
Originally, we launched

663
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,239
16 villas.

664
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,120
Each one

665
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,839
boasts prime lake views.

666
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,539
Out of the private garden,

667
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,779
you can walk by the lake.

668
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,032
Come here.

669
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,259
The design

670
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,720
was crafted by a top-tier team,

671
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,160
creating the rare

672
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:05,640
Chinese minimalist style.

673
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:09,799
The house and lake scenery
blend perfectly,

674
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:12,099
exuding a unique Jiangnan charm.

675
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,360
(Lakeview Villa)
Look.

676
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,920
It has complete amenities nearby.

677
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,720
Hospitals, international schools,

678
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,440
everything.

679
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,319
Are you looking to invest?

680
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,779
But this place

681
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:22,279
is a bit remote, isn't it?

682
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,680
Our company

683
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,920
is on the edge of the park.

684
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,620
This is even more remote.

685
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,860
Not for investment.

686
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:30,839
For us to live in.

687
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,120
To live in?

688
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,239
It's remote here,

689
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,039
but it's only

690
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,160
a 15-minute drive

691
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,039
to our company.

692
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,400
But you'll be

693
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,680
working in Shanghai later.

694
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,420
You're at Guang Yu.

695
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,920
Me?

696
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,952
You have a laser pointer?

697
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,799
Of course.

698
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:52,940
Here.

699
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,839
When I first met Professor Xi,

700
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:57,999
she told me

701
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,799
that Shanghai's new

702
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,824
Brain Science Research Center
will be in Songjiang.

703
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,360
(Songjiang District)
Roughly around here.

704
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,120
Driving

705
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:06,620
from here to the institute

706
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
takes about 50 minutes.

707
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:09,660
Guang Yu is located here.

708
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:10,360
(Industrial Park)

709
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,220
This community

710
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,579
is right

711
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,599
between our workplaces.

712
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,579
So this is where I imagine

713
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:18,259
we would live.

714
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,599
Then our house

715
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,360
would be perfect for you newlyweds.

716
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:27,999
I swear

717
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:29,539
no other place has

718
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:30,380
a better location.

719
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,039
Not necessarily.

720
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,720
There are two more

721
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,160
we could go check out.

722
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:40,259
But they aren't as good as here.

723
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:42,120
We have in-house

724
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,339
property management.

725
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,799
Exceptional service quality.

726
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,860
In autumn,

727
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,220
residents get free crabs.

728
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:55,239
You really have been

729
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,380
planning this for a long time.

730
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:02,319
I've been secretly
researching all along.

731
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,519
Alright then.

732
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,960
To honor your research,

733
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,799
we'll go

734
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,599
check them out one by one.

735
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:14,759
We have plenty of time today anyway.

736
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:16,539
Wait.

737
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,499
Well, besides the crabs,

738
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:19,819
we also have discounts.

739
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,759
Plus, it's move-in ready.
No waiting needed.

740
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:23,239
Mr. Lin, you've done your homework.

741
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,099
You know

742
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,920
other properties take at least a year.

743
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,180
Ours is ready now.

744
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,579
What you see is what you get.

745
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:30,360
Actually,

746
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:31,660
we aren't married.

747
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,759
But she calls

748
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,739
the shots.

749
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,739
Just convince her.

750
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,239
Miss,

751
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,660
trust me.

752
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,860
You can certainly

753
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,200
look at other communities.

754
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,019
But

755
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,860
(Lakeview Villa)
ours is definitely the best!

756
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:50,940
We're closest to your

757
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,499
workplace.

758
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,779
Look along this route.

759
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,559
Other villas are closer

760
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,140
to Shanghai.

761
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,339
You'd have

762
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,319
a longer commute.

763
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,279
Your fiancé surely won't like that,

764
00:31:59,739 --> 00:32:00,239
right?

765
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,499
You have a point there.

766
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:09,980
So please take us

767
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,079
to see the actual place.

768
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:11,904
Come on.

769
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:12,539
Please.

771
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:29,888
(Suzhou Intelligent Digital Center
Bid Opening Meeting)

772
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,099
It shouldn't be over yet.

773
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:33,579
Aunt hasn't texted me.

774
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,779
So phones are still locked.

775
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,440
Let's sit here.

776
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,299
Failure isn't rare.

777
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:42,799
Losers need grace too.

778
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,960
You helped outsiders harm
the group's interests.

779
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,059
I will report

780
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,180
everything to Grandpa.

781
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,239
Cheng Rui won the bid?

782
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:04,739
Thanks for telling us the good news.

783
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,960
Xingjie,

784
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,880
though you lost this time,

785
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:10,319
you gained the courage

786
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,579
to personally report

787
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,420
to the Chairman.

788
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,299
I believe the Chairman

789
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:16,200
will be proud of your growth.

790
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,360
You just wait.

791
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,339
I'll be waiting.

792
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,299
Well done.

793
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,180
Always.

794
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:39,440
Based on what Xingjie said,

795
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,239
Aunt's team won, right?

796
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,360
100 percent.

797
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,799
That's great!

798
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,160
Aunt!

799
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:47,980
Xiguang!

800
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,420
We got it!

801
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,640
We just heard about it

802
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,940
from a livid

803
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:55,599
Sheng Xingjie.

804
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,739
Ms. Shen, hold it together.

805
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,792
People are watching.

806
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,999
This is me holding back.

807
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,759
Or I'd be jumping for joy.

808
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,660
Xiguang, Lin,

809
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,900
thank you.

810
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,640
And Mr. Zhang, Mr. Hua.

811
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:07,660
Thank your company.

812
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,880
This time,

813
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,139
you've helped us a lot.

814
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,240
In fact,

815
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,480
you are the key to victory.

816
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,240
The committee

817
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,740
was impressed by the concept
of green energy efficiency.

818
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,980
Our design proposal

819
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,119
scored top marks.

820
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:20,139
We merely played a supporting role.

821
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,900
Cheng Rui's team is exceptional

822
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,880
with a brilliant design.

823
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,820
Oh, you.

824
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:24,920
At such a time,

825
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,519
what's with the modesty?

826
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,579
Didn't you have other plans?

827
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,420
Why are you waiting here?

828
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,696
Sorry for the trouble.

829
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Not at all.

830
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,280
We actually went out and got back.

831
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,880
Just got back.

832
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,780
Yes, Aunt.

833
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:39,860
We didn't wait long.

834
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:41,260
We just went to buy a house.

835
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:44,840
Buy a house?

836
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:53,760
Feng Teng Group just announced

837
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,579
the winner of the bid

838
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,179
is Nanjing Cheng Rui.

839
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,599
Is that Jiang Ping's company?

840
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:03,719
Yes.

841
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,880
Furthermore,

842
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:06,579
Cheng Rui won this bid

843
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,840
largely

844
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,019
because Shuangyuan

845
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:10,119
designed for them

846
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:11,119
a building-integrated

847
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:12,320
solar power system.

848
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,800
They impressed the committee

849
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:15,960
with their green,

850
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:17,719
energy-saving, and low-carbon design.

851
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,079
Dad.

852
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:27,648
Dad.

853
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:30,940
You're not a kid anymore.

854
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,420
Stop running around like a clueless fly

855
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,039
all day.

856
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:36,128
Dad,

857
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,440
Xingjie...

858
00:35:37,499 --> 00:35:38,219
Enough.

859
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,940
I won't blame him.

860
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:42,539
After all, he is my eldest grandson.

861
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,199
He lacks the capability
to manage the business.

862
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,219
In the future, being a wealthy idler

863
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,760
isn't bad.

864
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,120
Dad,

865
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:51,039
give Xingjie another chance.

866
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,840
This was just an accident.

867
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,260
You can't write him off completely

868
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,240
based on one loss.

869
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,099
Besides,

870
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,960
if it weren't for Yusen

871
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,760
and his betrayal,

872
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,219
taking your resources

873
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,619
to help outsiders,

874
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,079
Xingjie wouldn't have

875
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,219
lost this project.

876
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:07,760
One loss?

877
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,760
Be honest. How many times?

878
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,900
Mobilizing the entire group,

879
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:13,539
he was effortlessly outplayed

880
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:14,960
and utterly crushed.

881
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,800
And he has the nerve to complain?

882
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,219
Losing is losing.

883
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,820
He doesn't have the dignity

884
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,280
to accept defeat.

885
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,740
He'll never succeed.

886
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,039
Get out of my sight!

887
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:24,900
Dad.

888
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:25,659
Bokai,

889
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,440
I think you should go back now.

890
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,139
Many years ago,

891
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,340
I thought talents

892
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,559
like Yusen's father

893
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,820
were common.

894
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,619
Now I realize

895
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:14,940
they are one in ten thousand.

896
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,679
In the entire Sheng Yuan,

897
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,780
I can't find a single descendant

898
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,760
I can entrust it to.

899
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:30,336
(General)

900
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:34,119
Li.

901
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,360
In a few days,

902
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,340
we'll go to Suzhou.

903
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:39,904
Okay.

904
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:44,320
Last time Xiguang visited me,

905
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:45,380
you were there.

906
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,780
Looking at it now,

907
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,559
back then, she had been involved

908
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,900
in Cheng Rui's design proposal.

909
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:51,800
At that time,

910
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,199
did you notice it?

911
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,760
I left very quickly back then.

912
00:37:55,499 --> 00:37:56,440
I can't remember.

913
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,059
So,

914
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,280
you didn't notice either.

915
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,380
Not your fault.

916
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,579
She didn't slip up at all.

917
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,944
Good.

918
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,659
Well done.

919
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:11,260
Sheng Bokai schemed carefully

920
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,599
to push his son into power.

921
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:13,760
Didn't expect

922
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,559
my daughter outmaneuvered

923
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,480
him effortlessly.

924
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,480
Truly my daughter.

925
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,360
As they say, like father, like daughter.

926
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,019
It's in the blood.

927
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:24,840
But

928
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,380
will Bokai at Sheng Yuan

929
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,980
hold a grudge against you?

930
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,980
Yuan Cheng didn't win either.

931
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,599
Why hold a grudge against me?

932
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:32,579
Besides,

933
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,260
his son proved so useless.

934
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,360
Whether he can maintain

935
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,599
his position at Sheng Yuan

936
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,499
is hard to tell.

937
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:39,940
Don't worry.

938
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,639
Just say a few pleasant things

939
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:43,780
to keep up appearances.

940
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:44,608
Okay.

941
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:46,784
Mr. Nie,

942
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,736
time to go to the hospital for therapy.

943
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:49,960
Mr. Nie,

944
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:50,900
please rest well.

945
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:51,920
I'll go handle

946
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,519
the follow-ups.

947
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,300
What is it? Tell me.

948
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,219
The South City Villa management called.

949
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:04,159
They said this year's fee is not paid.

950
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,019
So...

951
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,420
After all, the South City Villa
is under my name.

952
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,360
It's not appropriate for others

953
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,059
to keep living there.

954
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:15,460
Go handle it.

955
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,300
Mr. Nie,

956
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,039
so you mean...

957
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,099
Bad location.

958
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:21,240
Sell it.

959
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,168
Yes.

960
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:26,119
Do you think I'm being

961
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:26,940
too harsh?

962
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,460
O-Of course not.

963
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:30,179
Mr. Nie, you treated

964
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:32,159
Ms. Qian with all due consideration.

965
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,880
But she used your name
to provide guarantees.

966
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,519
Then she called the police
