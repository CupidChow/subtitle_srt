00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,010
I won't even be able to make calls
once we land.

192
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,550
Look, I only did it for your own good.

193
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,210
You're terrified of flying, right?

194
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,810
So I purposely told you a later date.

195
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,070
That way, you're already on the plane

196
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,790
before you even have time to panic.

197
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,210
It's much healthier for you.

198
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,270
Pretty brilliant, wouldn't you say?

199
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,610
Brilliant, my foot.

200
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,430
Xiguang,

201
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,930
come on.

202
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,130
Quit it. Let's go.

203
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,090
We're gonna be late.

204
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,850
Thanks.

205
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,470
No problem.

206
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,970
I know, one bad flight

207
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,870
and now you're traumatized for life.

208
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,330
But we're taking off soon,
so just relax.

209
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,930
That wasn't just "ordinary" turbulence.

210
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,010
It was an out-of-body,
terrifying experience.

211
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,350
Why don't I feel scared anymore
now that we're in the air?

212
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,890
You don't get motion sick
and you're not afraid of heights,

213
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,910
so you're just afraid of dying, right?

214
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,170
Look, once we're up there,

215
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,190
it's all up to fate.

216
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,290
Worrying isn't going to help.

217
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,530
Ugh. Why did I ever

218
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,450
agree to your mom

219
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,490
and come on this trip with you?

220
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,910
I'm taking you on a trip. Seriously?

221
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,670
Traveling all this way for a view

222
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,510
is like going to great lengths

223
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,450
just to chase a relationship.

224
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,130
Xiguang,

225
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,170
be brave

226
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,130
and enjoy the view.

227
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,450
And after you've seen it?

228
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,690
You'll just walk away?

229
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,050
What else? Are you supposed
to move in and live there?

230
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,030
So that's how you treat

231
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,630
your relationships, right?

232
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,070
You're such a playboy.

233
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,610
What are you talking about?

234
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,370
Xiguang, let's take a picture together

235
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,830
to mark the start of our journey.

236
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,610
Stop it.

237
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,710
- Stop.
- Come on.

238
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,150
What if this becomes our last photo?

239
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,470
You're way too old
to be called a "lass" anymore.

240
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,730
Yeah... I suppose.

241
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,250
[Delete]

242
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,450
This is all your fault.

243
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,190
Told you not to take pictures.

244
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:41,870
Young lady,

245
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,610
you gave me such a scare.

246
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,890
I couldn't catch a wink of sleep
the whole flight.

247
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,450
I am so sorry.

248
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,710
Do you need help with your luggage?

249
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,490
No.

250
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,590
So sorry again.

251
00:16:59,130 --> 00:16:59,610
Let's go.

252
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,109
Let's go!

253
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:07,990
Come on.

254
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:11,950
Follow me.

255
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,270
Hurry up.

256
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,329
Let's go.

257
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,150
Let's get a photo together.

258
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,510
Come on.

259
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,450
Xiguang,

260
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,290
ever played online games?

261
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:43,910
Yeah, I have.

262
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:44,630
Then don't you

263
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,730
feel like a companion pet right now?

264
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,290
Other pets

265
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,870
actually help their masters

266
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,930
pick up loot and stuff.

267
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,050
But you?

268
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,270
You barely even put me in the frame.

269
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,310
That was a fluke.

270
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,070
Check out what I took.

271
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,790
You look like a goddess
in every single shot.

272
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,390
I don't care.

273
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,310
I'm just gonna coast.

274
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,030
The Cambridge study program

275
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,030
doesn't even start until next Monday.

276
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,650
That gives us
three whole days to ourselves.

277
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:15,830
You can be the boss

278
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,750
and plan the itinerary.

279
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,350
Not until Monday?

280
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,310
I knew it. You dragged me here

281
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,470
way too early on purpose.

282
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,950
Hey, I did it all for you.

283
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,790
For me?

284
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,390
Yeah.

285
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,890
I see you're suffering

286
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,610
from a classic case
of the post-grad blues.

287
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,370
So I thought,

288
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,390
let's just make a break for it

289
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,490
and get some fresh air.

290
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,310
You didn't seem to appreciate

291
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,510
all the efforts I put in...

292
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:39,950
What's wrong?

293
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,430
Xiguang,

294
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,130
use your words.

295
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,010
Don't just tackle me like that.

296
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,990
I know this is an emotional moment,

297
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,770
but you can't just go around

298
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,570
hugging me like this.

299
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:51,950
Jiang Rui.

300
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,250
Thank you.

301
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,090
Don't be so formal.

302
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,190
As long as you're happy, it's worth it.

303
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,590
I am happy.

304
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,170
Really?

305
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,810
Yeah.

306
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,950
And...

307
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,870
something just clicked for me.

308
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:17,850
What is it?

309
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,390
Well,

310
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,450
in the past few days,

311
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,010
we've seen so much beautiful scenery.

312
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,170
But no matter how beautiful it is,

313
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,250
we only get a glimpse
before we have to leave.

314
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,370
I have to

315
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,530
say goodbye

316
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,310
without looking back,

317
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:40,810
because

318
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,150
it doesn't belong to me.

319
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,610
Look at you, getting all poetic.

320
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,890
What's the rush?

321
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,990
We're still young.

322
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,290
Someday, we'll have our own

323
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,350
"Real Estate Scenery."

324
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,890
What the heck?

325
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,350
"Real Estate Scenery"?

326
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,190
Yeah.

327
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,330
A view with your name

328
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,190
written all over it.

329
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,210
Alright then.

330
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,130
I'll take care of the arrangements

331
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,790
for the next few days.

332
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,050
Where to next?

333
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,390
How about Windermere?

334
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:17,970
Off we go.

335
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,690
Go.

[Wuxi]

337
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,150
[Jiang Yun]

338
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,270
Look at these photos.

339
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,850
You're getting thinner and thinner.

340
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,710
Did you go to Europe to study,

341
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,730
or to lose weight?

342
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,670
You know how terrible

343
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,910
the food is in Europe.

344
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,450
I thought, at the very least,

345
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,750
their cakes

346
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,410
would be decent.

347
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,550
But as it turns out,

348
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,890
they're so sweet
that even I, a Wuxi native,

349
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,510
couldn't handle it.

350
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,270
Don't worry, though.

351
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,750
I'll gain it all back within two weeks.

352
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,070
Don't go on a binge-eating spree.

353
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,890
Just stick to a regular diet.

354
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,930
You've been away for two months now.

355
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,550
It's time to settle down

356
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,410
and get back to work.

357
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,030
The CPA firm called

358
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,790
a couple of days ago

359
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,170
to ask when you're coming in.

360
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,230
By the way,

361
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,870
weren't you saying

362
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,870
you were looking for a job by yourself?

363
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,030
How's that going?

364
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,550
One company in Suzhou

365
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,030
and two or three in Nanjing

366
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,850
have sent me offers.

367
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,350
But only the Suzhou one said

368
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,550
I could start in September.

369
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,510
The others said

370
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,230
they'd let me know

371
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,210
whenever a position opens up.

372
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,530
What kind of companies are they?

373
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,270
The companies in Nanjing

374
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,610
are a CPA firm,

375
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,510
a Fortune 500 multinational,

376
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,470
and a pharma company.

00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,450

378
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,610
is a private manufacturing firm

379
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,670
that makes PV panels.

380
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,210
What's the name

381
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,330
of the one in Suzhou?

382
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,130
Shuangyuan
Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd.

383
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,470
That was a company
Yuancheng invested in,

384
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,670
back before your dad and I got divorced.

385
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,410
Yuancheng

386
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,570
holds a 49% stake,

387
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,430
and Shengyuan

388
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,790
holds 51%.

389
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,450
So,

390
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,490
it's called "Shuangyuan."
[*Meaning: double "yuan".]

391
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,390
Oh, by the way,

392
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,430
there is one thing

393
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,930
I need to relay to you.

394
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,390
What?

395
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,210
Don't tell me

396
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,430
the company in Nanjing

397
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,910
is also partly owned by our family?

398
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,190
Don't worry.
We don't have that kind of muscle.

399
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,310
While you were in Europe,

400
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,550
your father came to me.

401
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,490
He wants you to work at Yuancheng

402
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,130
as his successor.

403
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,310
[Yuancheng Group, Wuxi]

404
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,310
Is the partnership with Shengyuan

405
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,410
dead in the water?

406
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:17,970
It's been dragging on for months.

407
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,590
[Nie Chengyuan]
Probably gone.

408
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,590
We were hoping to leverage their brand

409
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,570
and marketing expertise

410
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,810
to give the property
a more premium positioning.

411
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,190
But once again, Lin Yusen screwed

412
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,910
everything up.

413
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,290
I think we should

414
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,970
stop messing around with them.

415
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,350
Our brand recognition here

416
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,790
is already pretty high.

417
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,850
Better to rely on ourselves than others.

418
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:36,730
Why don't we just

419
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,790
focus on building solid quality,

420
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,070
and make a real splash?

421
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,050
It's not just about this.

422
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,790
There was an earlier project,

423
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,370
which also fell through because of him.

424
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,830
Nie,

425
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,330
is there some history between you two?

426
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,070
I've only run into him
a couple of times at Shengyuan.

427
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,710
Young face.

428
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,990
A real snake.

429
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,830
But he's not the real problem.

430
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,610
Sheng Xianmin doesn't even care

431
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,710
about his own daughter or son-in-law,

432
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,410
so why would he give the time of day

433
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,270
to his grandson?

434
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,210
Then...

435
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,590
Let's call it a day.

436
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,350
Please enjoy.

437
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:17,910
Thank you.

438
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,070
So, you went to Europe,

439
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,410
yet you didn't even

440
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,790
bring me back a single souvenir?

441
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,390
I asked you to stop by the office,

442
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,150
and you wouldn't.

443
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,410
It's all going

444
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,890
to be yours eventually anyway.

445
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,170
What's the harm in visiting?

446
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,370
I'll reimburse you ten times over
for whatever you spent.

447
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,210
I don't want to go to your company

448
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,210
because I don't want to run into
someone I'd rather not see.

449
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,870
What kind of person do you think I am?

450
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,270
You think I'm that clueless?

451
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,870
The office is a place of business.

452
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,350
Not necessarily.

453
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,290
It's not like
you haven't done it before.

454
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,590
How's your mom doing lately?

455
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,730
She's great.

456
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,770
Haven't you two been on the phone?

457
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,130
She's acting so dismissive these days,

458
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,130
always trying to hang up
after just a few words.

459
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,190
That's what happens
when her stock is up.

460
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,250
Who wants to stay on the phone

461
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:26,790
with their ex-husbands?

462
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,830
Mom has plenty of suitors these days.

463
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,290
I heard

464
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,270
someone even chased her all the way
from Nanjing to Wuxi.

465
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,470
At this rate,
she might even get remarried

466
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,270
before you do.

467
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,690
Stop talking nonsense.

468
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,170
I told you

469
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,150
I'm not getting remarried.

470
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,290
That old friend of mine

471
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,090
is in bad shape.

472
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,150
She barely has any time left.

473
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,210
Is it so wrong for me to look after her?

474
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,570
It's a perfectly innocent friendship,

475
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,530
but your mom just loves chasing shadows

476
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,810
and lets her imagination run wild.

477
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,330
She won't take anything lying down.

478
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,350
Well, your friend's "last few years"

479
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,190
sure have lasted a long time.

480
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,910
How can you talk like that?

481
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,050
I'm just telling the truth.

482
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,190
Years ago,

483
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,950
you said she didn't have long to live.

484
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,330
Now I've graduated from college

485
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,390
and she still only has a few years?

486
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,070
What is this, an unlimited refill
on her life?

487
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,750
Is this all you wanted to talk about?

488
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,310
If that's it, I'm off.

489
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,450
Actually, I wanted to talk

490
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,130
about your work.

491
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,190
You mentioned

492
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,150
that you sent your résumé to Shengyuan.

493
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,550
Now that you're back,

494
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,770
are you getting ready to start?

495
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,010
I scrapped that plan ages ago.

496
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,510
Why?

497
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,730
Bad vibes.

498
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,750
Going to Shengyuan

499
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,530
might have taught you a thing or two.

500
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,550
But it's just as well you aren't going.

501
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,770
Come work here instead.

502
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,790
It's time you get familiar with things.

503
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,390
My business

504
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,590
is going to be yours one day, after all.

505
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,130
Since your mother told you about it,

506
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,810
that means she's not against the idea.

507
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,450
Mom respects me.

508
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,970
Even if she were against it,

509
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,330
she would tell me your word.

510
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,330
But I don't want to...

511
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:06,930
Xiguang.

512
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,410
I'm not as young as I used to be.

513
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,290
I wouldn't say that.

514
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,030
You...

515
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,010
Xiguang,

516
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,230
I'm carrying you on my back

517
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,150
and walking all that way
just to get you KFC.

518
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,190
When I'm old,

519
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,570
you'd better remember to carry me

520
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,490
for some braised pork.

521
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,410
But it's not like
you're going to shrink.

522
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,110
I can't lug you around.

523
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,470
Then you'll just have to find me

524
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,850
a strapping son-in-law.

525
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,090
What kind of nonsense
are you telling her?

526
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,330
Things used to be so good.

527
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,530
I'm only

528
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,850
listening to Mom on this one.

529
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,250
If she doesn't want me to go,

530
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,510
then I won't.

531
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,330
Saying that

532
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,610
must have driven your father livid.

533
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,250
Well, he nearly

534
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,950
did the same to me back then.

535
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,050
Xiguang,

536
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,310
if your dad and I

537
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,630
hadn't fallen apart,

538
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,310
and we were still a whole family,

539
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,170
would you have wanted
to go to Yuancheng then?

540
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,950
Then now I would listen to you both.

541
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,290
Mom,

542
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,810
I feel like

543
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,110
I've just been

544
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,450
drifting through life,

545
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,190
without

546
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,190
a clear goal.

547
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,870
Does that make you disappointed in me?

548
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,530
People who have it all figured out
from day one

549
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,750
and stick to their path

550
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,790
without ever wavering

551
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,990
are a rare breed.

552
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,790
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself.

553
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:01,970
Xiguang,

554
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,830
I don't want you to work in Yuancheng.

555
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,390
Then I won't go.

556
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,910
It's not because I'm being selfish.

557
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,610
It's because

558
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,790
I don't want you

559
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,930
caught in the crossfire

560
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,590
of the messy fallout

561
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,790
between your dad and me.

562
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:15,710
If you go,

563
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,870
you'll be torn in two

564
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,110
and be miserable.

565
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,590
Maybe one day,

566
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,270
when you're strong

567
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,650
and mature enough,

568
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,810
we can talk about it then.

569
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,010
Go to Suzhou.

570
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,090

571
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:36,970
That's right.

572
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,450
Whatever happens,

573
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,710
that's a job you earned all by yourself.

574
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:48,950
Hello, Mr. Song.

575
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,050
Please.

576
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,270
We're meeting

577
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,490
Shengyuan's VP,

578
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,230
Sheng Zhongkai,

579
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,590
and some other execs.

580
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,130
I'll get you some face time.

581
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,350
It'll make things

582
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,350
much easier later on.

583
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,090
Mr. Sheng,

584
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,610
it's been a while.

585
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,570
I heard Shengyuan
has big moves in the works.

586
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,490
Congratulations!

587
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,130
It has been a long time.

588
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,030
I was just thinking about you.

589
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,010
Have a seat.

590
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,270
Aaron from Huifa Bank

591
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,810
came by a while ago.

592
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,150
He specifically mentioned you,

593
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,750
saying it was you

594
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,270
who personally showed him the ropes.

595
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,310
He's a hard worker.

596
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,470
A few years back,

597
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,930
when Huifa started
their corporate banking,

598
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,890
they poached him from me.

599
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,510
I tried to warn him then.

600
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,910
Huifa couldn't even

601
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,930
get their retail mortgages

602
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,370
right,

603
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,970
and their supporting services

604
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,670
for corporate development loans

605
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,650
are a total mess.

606
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,330
But

607
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,310
he's very talented.

608
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,750
What he's achieved

609
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,350
in such a short time there

610
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,990
is really quite impressive.

611
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:46,730
After all,

612
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,250
his team was green

613
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,370
and lacked experience.

614
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,550
The young people

615
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,350
are really full of drive.

616
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,890
I checked

617
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,750
their team's plan,

618
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,410
and they've thought everything through.

619
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,450
Plus,

620
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,410
their interest rates
are very competitive.

621
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,750
Well, you haven't seen

622
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,590

623
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,530

I hope you'll

635
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,770
all keep an eye out for him.

636
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,830
Lucky for us,

637
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,190
we've got a really handsome guy
on our side today.

638
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,050
Otherwise,

639
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,990
we'd be totally outshone

640
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:27,790
by you guys.

Mr. Lin.

644
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,870
Mr. Song, I don't believe
you've met him yet?

645
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,430
It is indeed our first time meeting.

646
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,550
So sharp-looking.

647
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,990
I always felt like
I'd seen you somewhere before.

648
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,350
It just came to me

649
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,510
that it was about six months ago,

650
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,770
at a job fair in Nanjing.

651
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,570
We crossed paths at our booth.

652
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,950
Is that so, Zhuang Xu?

653
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,850
You applied for a position at Shengyuan?

654
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,210
No.

656
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,290
was actually dropping off
a resume for a classmate.

657
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,450
I wonder

658
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,530
if she ever ended up joining us?

659
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,110
She went abroad for her studies.

660
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,210
Ah, that's a pity then.

"Xiguang" means morning light.

That sounds a bit like "Nie Xigua".

call me, "Xigua".

00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,030

00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,590
I could start in September,

765
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,710

for two months first.
