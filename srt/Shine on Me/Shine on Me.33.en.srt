00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,520
Here he comes.

13
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,920
You scoundrels!

14
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,700
Who gave you the nerve

15
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,640
to cause such a scene at my door?

16
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,520
Mr. Nie,

17
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,760
you're a big shot,

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,940
not just in Wuxi,

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,080
but across the entire country.

20
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,960
We wouldn't dream of
causing trouble for you.

21
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,460
Qian Dashun

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,100
hit us up for some cash,
and we each ended up

23
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,960
lending him around two
or three hundred thousand.

24
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,640
He told us you were the guarantor.

25
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,640
Since we couldn't get a hold of you,

26
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,579
we had no choice but to come here

27
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,700
and ask your parents.

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,720
Qian Dashun borrowed money from you?

29
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,780
What does his debt have to do with me?

30
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,540
Why isn't Nianyuan back yet?

31
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,560
I wonder

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,120
how the search is going.

33
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,300
You two really played me for a fool.

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,880
Now look what happened.

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,780
I've borrowed nearly two million
from the villagers.

36
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,360
If you don't help me pay them back,

37
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,620
I can never go back after this.

38
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,720
He told everyone
he was borrowing it for you

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,860
and even said you guaranteed it
and signed for it.

40
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,040
It's all right there on the IOU,

41
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,060
plain as day.

42
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,620
A couple of days ago, he got drunk

43
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,500
and told us everything went south.

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,400
Then the very next morning,

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,480
he just vanished

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,620
and won't pick up his phone,

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,460
so who else were we supposed

48
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,980
to turn to but you?

00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,760
Where's the IOU?

50
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,380

What happened to the money I gave you?

54
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,520

a little bit.

117
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,620

Nearly two million,

Nianyuan.

122
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,240
It was Nianyuan.

123
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,780
She told me about an investment

124
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,740
that was a sure thing

125
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,400
and asked me for some capital.

126
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,580
At first, it actually paid off,

127
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,200
and we got the principal
and interest back.

128
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,000
I had no idea that when we reinvested,

129
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,880
those two would just take
the money and run.

Look,

135
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,280
if you don't own up to this,

136
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,880
we'll have to post it
all over the Internet.

137
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,940
We can't just keep it bottled up
after getting ripped off.

138
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,060
Gotta let it out somehow.

139
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,440
Get the IOUs

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,480
and their transfer records

141
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,159
verified

142
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,380
and sorted.

143
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,180
See?

144
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,860
I knew Mr. Nie was a smart man.

145
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,900
Things would get very ugly

146
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,020
for everyone

147
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,040
if this blew up into a scandal.

148
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,659
So,

149
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,300
besides the principal,

150
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,280
what about our interest?

151
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,960
You want interest?

152
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,220
You are fully aware

153
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,920
this has nothing to do with me.

154
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,680
I don't have to give you a single cent.

155
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,580
If you want interest,

156
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,720
you won't get anything at all.

157
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,380
You can take your chances
in court with Qian Dashun.

158
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:10,980
But...

159
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,940
isn't he your dad-in-law?

160
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,780
Since when do I have a dad-in-law?

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,900
Mine died a long time ago!

162
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm settling this debt today,

163
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,260
but there won't be a second time.

164
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:20,900
And

165
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,840
if I hear

166
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:23,940
even a whisper

167
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,120
of this outside,

168
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,560
I...

169
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,660
Fine.

170
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,260
Alright.

171
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,580
We'll take the loss.

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,900
Forget the interest.

173
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,600
Let's just leave it at that.

174
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't agree.

175
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,360
You have to pay Li and the others

176
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,220
back,

177
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,400
including interest

178
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,900
at the bank rate.

179
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,700
You can settle up
with Qian Dashun later.

180
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,880
But

181
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,100
the Wu brothers

182
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,159
and those two

183
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,880
won't get anything.

184
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,040
They're always

185
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,840
thick as thieves with Qian Dashun.

186
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,420
They probably set this whole trap

187
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,300
up together.

188
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,180
I won't allow it.

189
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,159
Mom,

190
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,360
let me handle this.

191
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,440
Just stay out of it.

192
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,260
Handle it? My foot!

193
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,820
You pay them back today,

194
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,520
and in a few days,
someone else will claim

195
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,940
Qian Dashun owes them money.

196
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,180
What then? You're going to pay them too?

197
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,720
Is something wrong with your head?

198
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,740
Unbelievable.

199
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,520
I've thought it over,

200
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,500
and the only way is to call the police.

201
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,600
Let them investigate and find out

202
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,320
exactly how much

203
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,580
that old geezer owes.

204
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,800
This is fraud.

205
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,860
He should be locked up.

206
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,660
Mom, let's take this inside.

207
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,000
"Inside"? For what?

208
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,320
Mom.

209
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,560
There's nothing left to say.

210
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,600
Are you afraid of losing face?

211
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,760
After the scene you caused today,

212
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,940
everyone in this village knows.

213
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,060
Now you're worried about your "face"?

214
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,640
You didn't care much for your dignity

215
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,580
when you were fooling around

216
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,840
with Qian Fangping.

217
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,180
Look at this.

218
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,900
Guang's boyfriend is here

219
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,600
for the very first time,

220
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,400
and you've dragged this filth

221
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,760
right to our doorstep.

222
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,360
I can't even hold my head up anymore.

223
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,040
You've dragged our family name
through the mud.

224
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,520
I am beyond humiliated!

225
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,500
Guang, call the police.

226
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,420
Don't.

227
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,060
Go ahead!

228
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,100
Don't!

229
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,460
Do it!

230
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,740
- I said call them!
- Mom!

231
00:07:59,220 --> 00:07:59,580
Dad.

232
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,380
[Radiation Area,
No Entry When Light Is On]

233
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,900
Guang,

234
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,620
did I chew your dad out so hard

235
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,780
that he actually collapsed?

236
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,300
Don't worry, Grandma.

237
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,060
Don't overthink it.

238
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,440
Dad probably just

239
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,100
got worked up and passed out.

240
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,780
This isn't on you at all.

241
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,520
If anything, it's Qian Dashun's fault.

242
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,180
Exactly.

243
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
It's all on that old geezer

244
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,720
and on Chengyuan himself.

245
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,220
So don't let it get to you.

246
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
But I cursed him,
saying something's wrong with his head.

247
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,880
Could there be something actually wrong
up there now, Lin?

248
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,179
I wouldn't go that far.

249
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,480
Grandpa, Grandma,

250
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,400
why don't you both have a seat?

251
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,440
It's going to be a while

252
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,080
before the CT results are out.

253
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,080
Have a seat, Grandpa.

254
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,740
Alright.

255
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,540
Doctor,

256
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,580
what's actually wrong

257
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,620
with my dad?

258
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,460
Are you the patient's daughter?

259
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,400
Your dad's right internal auditory canal

260
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,200
is significantly enlarged.

261
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,440
There's an isodense lesion

262
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,660
in the opening area.

263
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,320
We strongly suspect an acoustic neuroma.

264
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,980
A tumor?

265
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,800
An acoustic neuroma

266
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,760
is a benign tumor.

267
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,300
It's usually not life-threatening.

268
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,820
Excuse me,

269
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,680
but would it be okay if I took a look

270
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,260
at the raw CT scans

271
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,760
on your computer?

272
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,960
The lesion is right here.

273
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,340
It's not very clear

274
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,320
on the CT.

275
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,280
We'll need an MRI to confirm.

276
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,660
It's most likely an acoustic neuroma,

277
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,260
measuring roughly two centimeters.

278
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,160
That's on the larger side,

279
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,000
but fortunately,
the compression isn't that severe.

280
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,980
The adhesion
shouldn't be too bad either.

281
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,740
Acoustic neuromas

282
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,920
tend to adhere to the auditory

283
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,620
and facial nerves.

284
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,080
If the adhesion is serious,

285
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,400
it can lead to a range of facial

286
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,680
and hearing symptoms.

287
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,860
Are you a neurosurgeon?

288
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
How could you tell all that?

289
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,920
I used to be.

290
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,080
I've performed

291
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,400
a few acoustic neuroma surgeries myself.

292
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,820
So what do we do now?

293
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,560
We still need an MRI

294
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,300
for further confirmation.

295
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
If it is confirmed,

296
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,960
we'll have to get him in
for surgery to have it resected.

297
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,280
Craniotomy?

298
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,000
Then we'll get the MRI
as soon as he wakes up.

299
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,920
A tumor

300
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,940
out of nowhere?

301
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,820
He's only fifty, for crying out loud.

302
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,480
He's still in his prime.

303
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,200
Back when he was with Jiang Yun,

304
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,460
things were great.

305
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,380
But now?

306
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,040
He's let Qian Fangping brainwash him

307
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,420
into a total idiot.

308
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,340
Not a single day of peace
since she showed up.

309
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,520
Even if he was dead set on remarrying,

310
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,400
he should've at least found
someone decent,

311
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,500
with actual character.

312
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,240
How could he be so blind

313
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,760
to trust a con artist like Qian Dashun?

314
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,820
Now look where that's gotten him.

315
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,500
A tumor.

316
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,000
What on earth are we going to do?

317
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,800
Grandpa, Grandma,

318
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,100
don't stress yourselves out too much.

319
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,220
The doctor and Yusen said

320
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,400
it's a benign tumor.

321
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,840
Malignant ones are incredibly rare.

322
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,340
He'll be fine
once it's surgically removed.

323
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,100
I can't even imagine the toll

324
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,220
he'll have to endure
with going through brain surgery.

325
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,400
Grandpa, Grandma,

326
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,860
at least try to get
a little something down.

327
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,140
I'm not eating.

328
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,240
Grandpa,

329
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,600
are you still feeling dizzy?

330
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,780
I'm fine.

331
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,340
The scare snapped me right out of it.

332
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,400
What I have is just minor stuff

333
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,720
but here he is so young

334
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,120
and facing a major crisis like this.

335
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,900
It's all that drinking
and those late nights

336
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,280
catching up to him.

337
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,820
You're awake.

338
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,700
Dad.

339
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,920
- Easy.
- Easy.

340
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,520
Hurry,

341
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,340
lie back down.

342
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:14,880
It's okay.

343
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,680
Where am I?

344
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,260
Miss.

345
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,340
- You passed out.
- My dad is awake.

346
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,220
You're in the hospital.

347
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,060
I'll go get the doctor.

348
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,420
Mom,

349
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,960
what are you crying for?

350
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,140
What's wrong with me?

351
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,660
Don't hide it from me.
Give it to me straight.

352
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,940
First of all,
don't start imagining the worst.

353
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,660
The doctor said
it's not life-threatening.

354
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,120
The CT scan shows

355
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,060
you might have

356
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
a benign growth

357
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,740
in your ear.

358
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,500
But we still need an MRI

359
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,480
to be sure.

360
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,060
What kind of growth?

361
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,400
A tumor?

362
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,360
That's impossible.

363
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,740
How could I have a tumor?

364
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,560
Doctor.

365
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:24,920
How are you feeling?

366
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,780
Still dizzy?

367
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,780
Much better,

368
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,180
but my right ear won't stop ringing.

369
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,180
We need to get that MRI
scheduled as soon as possible.

370
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,120
Is there still time to do it today?

371
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,900
Tomorrow is the earliest.

372
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,060
It's too crowded here,

373
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,220
and we have to wait in line.

374
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,840
I'll go to another hospital.

375
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,660
Public hospitals are always crowded,

376
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,000
but I'd still recommend

377
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,280
getting treated in one.

378
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
I have

379
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,080
my own professional medical consultants.

380
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:56,960
Where's my phone?

381
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,600
Just listen to Lin.

382
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,360
He helped your dad with his dizziness

383
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,560
and it cleared up in no time.

384
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,220
What does he know?

385
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,040
He's fine for minor aches and pains,

386
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,440
but how can he handle a tumor?

387
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,480
My consultants

388
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,320
are all seasoned professionals.

389
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,460
Besides,

390
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,760
even if we switch hospitals,

391
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,520
when it comes to the surgeon
down the line,

392
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,620
I'm going with the best,

393
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,840
public or private.

394
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,720
Grandma,

395
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,680
let him handle it.

396
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,280
Told you.

397
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,260
This company

398
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,340
[Andong Wealth Advisors]
was only on a short-term lease,

399
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,800
and they moved out just last month.

400
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,380
Excuse me,

401
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,800
[Deqiu Eatery]
where's Miss An?

402
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,820
Miss An.

403
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,680
About this tall,

404
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,960
wearing a red coat,

405
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,020
with big eyes.

406
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,420
You met her last time.

407
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,160
To be honest, I have no memory

408
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,300
of this Miss An you're talking about.

409
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,460
She's

410
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,620
the factory owner's daughter.

411
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,060
You were the one hosting us last time.

412
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,240
You were super polite to her

413
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,420
and kept calling her Miss An.

414
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,860
The owner's daughter?

415
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,260
What owner?

416
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,340
Isn't this the restaurant

417
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,700
for the factory next door?

418
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,760
I heard it was mainly for their VIPs.

419
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,840
It used to be,

420
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,500
but it's been independent
for a long time now.

421
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,680
By the time it got to our boss,

422
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,780
it had already changed hands twice.

423
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,920
But,

424
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,240
the factory does send their VIPs

425
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,420
over here all the time.

426
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,380
But isn't the factory owned

427
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,300
by someone named An?

428
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,320
I checked it online.

429
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,400
It's definitely An.

430
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:50,840
True,

431
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,040
but word is

432
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,900
she only has a son.

433
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,740
No daughter.

434
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,620
Li,

435
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,760
you've got a good memory.

436
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,120
Do you remember

437
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,980
hosting a customer

438
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,000
named An last month?

439
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,500
The one who was with me.

440
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,740
It rings a bell.

441
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,720
Skinny,

442
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,160
red coat?

443
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,740
Exactly.

444
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,520
When she booked the table,

445
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,260
she told us her name was Miss An,

446
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,780
so of course that's what we called her.

447
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
I remember

448
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,920
she showed up pretty early

449
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,940
and specifically told us

450
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,120
the guests were important,

451
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,940
so we should pull out all the stops.

452
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,780
She even took me for a stroll
around the factory.

453
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,780
The security at that plant

454
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,060
is pretty lax.

455
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,400
It's easy to find someone

456
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
to show you around.

457
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,540
Fangping,

458
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,619
we're in the clear.

459
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,900
Wu told me

460
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,800
Chengyuan covered all our debts,

461
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,300
so I can come home tomorrow.

462
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,579
I told you

463
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,300
we should've just talked to him sooner,

464
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,660
but you just wouldn't listen.

465
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,839
Give Wu a call

466
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,780
and find out the specifics.

467
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,380
Hey,

468
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,220
Wu,

469
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,440
you absolute scumbag.

470
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,680
What the heck were you doing

471
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,380
causing a scene at my son-in-law's?

472
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,860
You think I'd actually stiff you?

473
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,800
I just went away for a few days,

474
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,880
and look at you, getting all worked up

475
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
and making
a complete spectacle of yourself.

476
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,760
Drop the nonsense, alright?

477
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,400
Your son-in-law?

478
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,580
That big shot

479
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,720
doesn't even recognize you as family.

480
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,540
Mr. Nie made it crystal clear

481
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,180
his dad-in-law passed away ages ago.

482
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,060
Don't even dream of
getting a single cent

483
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,720
out of me from now on.

484
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,100
And that "son-in-law" of yours

485
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,960
got so livid that he collapsed

486
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
and was hauled off to the hospital.

487
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,340
What?

488
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,180
Nie Chengyuan is in the hospital?

489
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:04,940
Let me tell you,

490
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,980
your free ride is officially over.

491
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,280
Wait,

492
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,200
Nie Chengyuan is in the hospital?

493
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,300
What exactly happened?

494
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,800
He hung up.

495
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,100
He said he passed out from pure rage.

496
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,300
You should give him

497
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,000
a call.

498
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,500
Did you find Qian and Mr. Zhao?

499
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,640
No.

500
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,760
I've looked everywhere.

501
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,360
The factory isn't even hers,

502
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,660
and that investment firm
is a ghost town.

503
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,600
It's all fake.

504
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,000
The whole thing is a sham.

505
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,680
They're just a bunch of con artists.

506
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,100
A scam? For real?

507
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,680
What about Luo Ke?

508
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,020
Is he a fraud too?

509
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,140
Luo Ke?

510
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,740
He got taken for over a million himself.

511
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,520
And he's just letting it slide?

512
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,020
Doesn't his family
have some serious pull?

513
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,640
Can't he pull some strings
to track them down?

514
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,420
I asked him.

515
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,820
He said he doesn't care.

516
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,280
To him, it's just pocket money
for a couple of months.

517
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,180
As long as his dad doesn't find out,
he's fine.

518
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,960
It's over.

519
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,480
We're totally wiped out!

520
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,220
I put everything I had into that,

521
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,300
and now it's all gone!

522
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,840
Good grief!

523
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,060
You idiot!

524
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,900
You've completely ruined me!

525
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,420
I only put in two hundred thousand
at first,

526
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,520
and I pulled it out.

527
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,260
You're the one who insisted
on investing more later.

528
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,220
How can you even think of
pinning this on me?

529
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,560
If you hadn't been out

530
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,220
running with that shady crowd,

531
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,020
I never would've fallen

532
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,340
for such a massive scam!

533
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:54,860
Yuan,

534
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,660
don't panic.

535
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,940
Your step-dad covered all the money

536
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,160
we borrowed from the villagers.

537
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,300
It's okay if we're broke for now.

538
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,460
Once things settle down,

539
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,280
we'll just ask him for more.

540
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,540
Just play nice
and say some sweet things.

541
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,560
Really?

542
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,700
Mr. Nie really paid it all back?

543
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,660
He doesn't blame us?

544
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,220
Blame you for what?

545
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,660
You guys were scammed too.

546
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,880
A few million

547
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,380
is just pocket change to a guy like him.

548
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,560
He has always had

549
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,860
a soft spot for Fangping since young.

550
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,820
It's fine.

551
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,660
Fangping,

552
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,180
just butter him up a bit.

553
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
You know how men are.

554
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,260
They're all the same, really.

555
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,440
I'm afraid things are different
this time.

556
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,540
His tone on the phone today

557
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,480
was off.

558
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,120
What's so different about it?

559
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,080
A few million

560
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,360
is nothing to him.

561
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,680
Since he's sick,

562
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,500
go take good care of him

563
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,220
and everything will blow over.

564
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,960
Just give him a call

565
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,060
to show you care.

566
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,560
I should've never had you.

567
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,600
Sorry,

568
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,840
the number you have dialed
is powered off.

569
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
Please try again later.

570
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,760
He's not picking up.

571
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,920
I'll try again tomorrow.

572
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,260
Based on the MRI results,

573
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,600
we can basically confirm

574
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,420
it's an acoustic neuroma.

575
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,020
It's 2.1 centimeters in diameter

576
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,540
and requires surgical removal.

577
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,860
Why didn't you warn me
about this before?

578
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,680
I recall you mentioning

579
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,280
symptoms of dizziness and tinnitus,

580
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,240
but every time we scheduled a check-up,

581
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,260
you were too busy with work

582
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,000
and didn't show.

583
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,380
Without an examination,

584
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,640
an acoustic neuroma
is indeed very difficult to diagnose.

585
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,040
The dizziness went away
after I took some meds back then.

586
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,320
So, what's the plan?

587
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,720
Last I heard

588
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,980
from the doctors at People's Hospital,

589
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,340
they'd have to cut his head open.

590
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,820
Surgery for an acoustic neuroma

591
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,820
usually involves opening the skull.

592
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,420
The outcome

593
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,240
really depends on

594
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,440
how skilled the surgeon is.

595
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,440
We tend to use

596
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,760
the preservation rates
of facial and hearing functions

597
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,740
as

598
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,940
the benchmarks for a successful surgery.

599
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,140
A top-tier surgeon

600
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,300
can achieve

601
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,840
a facial nerve preservation rate

602
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,080
of over 80%

603
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,780
during long-term recovery.

604
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,940
However, as for hearing preservation,

605
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,560
the best data in the country

606
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,680
is only around 40%.

607
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,800
What does that mean?

608
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,320
Are you saying he might go deaf?

609
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,040
And what does facial preservation mean?

610
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,700
The location of an acoustic neuroma

611
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,420
is quite tricky.

612
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,340
It has adhered to

613
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,760
the auditory

614
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,020
and facial nerves.

615
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,280
In an ideal scenario,

616
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,100
surgery can prevent facial paralysis,

617
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,440
but there is a high probability

618
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,760
of losing hearing

619
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,220
in one ear.

620
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,000
Even in the best-case scenario,

621
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,920
hearing will still be

622
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,100
significantly weakened.

623
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,120
Removing an acoustic neuroma

624
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,540
is one
of the most challenging procedures

625
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
in neurosurgery.

626
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,220
It really puts a surgeon's

627
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,940
technical skill to the test.

628
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,100
How did he end up with this?

629
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,120
We don't even have

630
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,880
a family history of it.

631
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,400
I told you

632
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,660
that the Qian family was bad luck,

633
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,500
but you wouldn't believe me.

634
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,900
Find me the best doctor.

635
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,440
My hearing must be preserved.

636
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,220
We've already put together

637
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,520
a list of the top surgeons,

638
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,580
along with their pros, cons,

639
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,260
and success rates.

640
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,380
The first few

641
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,620
are renowned experts in the country.

642
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,880
Our top recommendation is Dr. Tan Zhi

643
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,160
from Tianhe Hospital.

644
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,180
He's one of the nation's
leading authorities

645
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,700
on intracranial tumors.

646
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,720
There's another doctor

647
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,740
who isn't on the list

648
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,500
because he's quite young,

649
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,840
only around 30.

650
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,740
However, he has an amazing track record

651
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,720
and he studied abroad

652
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,560
under a world-renowned expert

653
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,700
in acoustic neuromas.

654
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,340
While he hasn't performed

655
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,280
a massive number of surgeries,

656
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,520
his success rate is remarkably high.

657
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,780
His preservation rates
for both hearing and facial function

658
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,420
are world-class.

659
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,200
Which hospital is he at?

660
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,300
Songshan Hospital.

661
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,280
Surnamed Lin,

662
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,620
he's the protégé

663
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,360
of the neurosurgery authority Li Shuzi.

664
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,460
Should we

665
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,220
try to get in touch

666
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,060
with him?

667
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,420
Since he's young,

668
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,500
we didn't list him

669
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,860
as a top recommendation just to be safe,

670
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,320
but we could certainly

671
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,580
bring him in for a consultation.

672
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,760
Then bring him in.

673
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,700
Contact all the good doctors.

674
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,040
There's no need.

675
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,060
Just stick to the others.

676
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,540
Dr. Lin

677
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,880
from Songshan Hospital

678
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,220
hasn't performed surgery in a long time.

679
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,540
Dr. Liu,

680
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,260
you really need

681
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,560
to update your information.

682
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,500
That is

683
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,680
from two years ago.

684
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,760
He was a sensation
in the industry back then,

685
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,660
but

686
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,920
I haven't heard much

687
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,080
about him since.

688
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,020
I was actually planning

689
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,560
to look into his status.

690
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,260
Guang,

691
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,420
how do you know that?

692
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,480
Grandma,

693
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,140
the Dr. Lin he's talking about

694
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,920
is Lin Yusen.

695
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,560
How can you be so sure?

696
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,360
Lin is a common surname,

697
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,760
and there are promising young doctors

698
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,420
everywhere.

699
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,020
Besides,

700
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,580
why are you just getting here now?

701
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,180
Dr. Liu is already finished.

702
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:01,920
Dr. Liu

703
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,240
arrived earlier.

704
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,560
Dr. Liu,

705
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,100
is it him?

706
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,060
Indeed,

707
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,280
it is Dr. Lin Yusen.

708
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,540
Mr. Nie,

709
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,220
a doctor with that kind of talent

710
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,880
is extremely rare.

711
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,500
Doctors like him
are few and far between.

712
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,940
Calling him one in a million
wouldn't be an exaggeration.

713
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,760
They definitely aren't "everywhere."

714
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,080
Why would he stop doing surgery?

715
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,800
Such a shame.

716
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,020
He was in a car accident

717
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,080
and messed up his hand.

718
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,940
[Taihu Lake High-end Medical Center]

719
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,560
Alright, here's the last of them.

720
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,160
Mr. Nie, I'll be heading out then.

721
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,200
There's one more thing.

722
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,380
What is it?

723
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,260
Just spit it out.

724
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,640
What's with the hesitation?

725
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,500
The South City Villa

726
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,720
has called me several times

727
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,920
asking about you.

728
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,000
They said they can't reach you.

729
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,620
How should I respond?

730
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,540
You didn't tell her where I am, did you?

731
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,740
I wouldn't dare say a word

732
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,540
without your instructions.

733
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,480
Ignore it.

734
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,920
I don't want to see her.

735
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,700
Also,

736
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,540
cut off

737
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,600
all her expenses
and fund requests immediately.

738
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,040
Understood, Mr. Nie.

739
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,340
Gong,

740
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,460
how is Chengyuan doing?

741
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,360
I'm really worried about him.

742
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,820
Ms. Qian,

743
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,680
I'm sorry,

744
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,840
but I'm not at liberty

745
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,200
to discuss Mr. Nie's situation.

746
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,460
Please don't put me in a difficult spot.

747
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,100
Chengyuan has
some misunderstandings about me.

748
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,720
You've got to help me
get through to him.

749
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,540
I really didn't know

750
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,080
my dad had borrowed that much money.

751
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,600
Tell him

752
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,100
I just want to see him,

753
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,000
just once.

754
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,300
I'll leave

755
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,220
as soon as I find he's okay.

756
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,700
Otherwise, I'll be on edge

757
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,020
and I won't be able to sleep a wink.

758
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,080
I'm sorry, Ms. Qian.

759
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,400
Mr. Nie said

760
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,400
he doesn't want to see you
for the time being.

761
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,540
You can

762
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,640
stay in the house for now

763
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,140
since he didn't mention that,

764
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,880
but he won't be covering

765
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,660
any further expenses.

766
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,440
That's impossible.

767
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,140
Chengyuan would never treat me
like this.

768
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,160
What exactly happened to him?

769
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,640
Is he being controlled

770
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
by those two old folks

771
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,300
from the Nie family?

772
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,240
We live in a society ruled by law.

773
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,200
Nobody would dare do that.

774
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,560
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

775
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,640
What's the deal?

776
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,800
Is that scumbag Nie Chengyuan

777
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,180
really turning his back on you?

778
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,220
I messed up.

779
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,740
I was so panicked that day.

780
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,980
I should have just said

781
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,200
I had no idea about your debts.

782
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,300
If you didn't know,

783
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,580
there's no way he would've helped me
pay them back.

784
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,800
Now look at us.

785
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,240
He's even cut off our living expenses.

786
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,940
He won't pick up my calls

787
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,780
or reply to my texts.

788
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,300
I don't even know where he is.

789
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,680
If I could just see him,

790
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,340
I could talk him around,

791
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,860
but if he won't even meet me,

792
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,160
what am I supposed to do?

793
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:50,780
Mom,

794
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,260
what if

795
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,320
I ask some of my friends

796
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,260
at the hospital?

797
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,180
Maybe they can find out

798
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,500
which hospital Mr. Nie is in.

799
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,280
Friends?

800
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,960
Your friends are useless.

801
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,140
Turn your ringtone off.

802
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,120
It's getting on my nerves.

803
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,820
Mom,

804
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,080
it's Luo Ke.

805
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,780
Maybe he found the scammers.

806
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,280
Put it on speaker.

807
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:14,700
Hello,

808
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,620
Luo Ke.

809
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,180
Did you find Qian

810
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:17,880
and Mr. Zhao?

811
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,040
Qian my foot.

812
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,080
Where would I even find her?

813
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,000
My dad found out

814
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,880
and forced me to go to the police.

815
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,480
My reputation is shot.

816
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,080
Look,

817
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,760
I'm calling to ask

818
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,920
if you want to report it together.

819
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,480
A larger total
might carry more weight with the police.

820
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,760
And besides, if I'm not the only one,

821
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,520
I won't look like such a total chump.

822
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,040
If we report it,

823
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,700
can we get the money back?

824
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,840
There's a chance, I guess.

825
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,300
I'm just worried
that by the time they catch them,

826
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,340
the money will be mostly spent.

827
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,960
But we just get back

828
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,440
what we can.

829
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,760
Let me think about it.

830
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,360
If I report it,

831
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,540
I should probably do it in Wuxi.

832
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,200
It's all the same.

833
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,860
Whatever.

834
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,800
I just wanted to let you know.

835
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,220
Mom,

836
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,500
maybe

837
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,040
we should report it too.

838
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,120
If they catch them,

839
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,340
we might actually get the money back.

840
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:09,960
Exactly.

841
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Let's report it.

842
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,200
If all the money is recovered,

843
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,260
wouldn't it all be

844
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,220
ours?

845
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,360
Nie Chengyuan cares so much
about his face.

846
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,420
There's no way he'd ask you

847
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,680
for that money back.

848
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,080
Report it?

849
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:23,780
Yes.

850
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,560
Fangping,

851
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,560
stop stalling.

852
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,160
If those two scammers

853
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,840
get caught

854
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
and we haven't reported it,

855
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,520
but Yuan's friend

856
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,280
has,

857
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,080
what if they don't give us

858
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,580
our share of the money?

859
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
You're right.

860
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,960
Nie Chengyuan can turn on

861
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,100
his own wife just like that.

862
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,360
Who knows

863
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,220
how he'll treat me later?

864
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,220
Now he's completely gone dark.

865
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,120
If

866
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,480
something happens to him,

867
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,880
I'll be left with nothing.

868
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,500
Getting the money back
is the only thing that's real.

869
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,400
Once it's back,

870
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,180
it's ours.

871
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:04,500
Nianyuan,

872
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,900
report it.

873
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,140
Do it now.

874
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,560
I'm going by myself?

875
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,880
You good-for-nothing.

876
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,680
I'm coming with you.

877
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,220
Grandma?

878
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,020
Grandma.

879
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,600
Guang,

880
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,320
you're here.

881
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,640
Why did you come down?

882
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,820
Just out for some fresh air.

883
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,400
Your dad has been in a foul mood lately.

884
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,140
He's been snapping

885
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,600
at every single person
who comes by from the company.

886
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,760
I can't even stand to be around him.

887
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,780
He's always been proud.

888
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,640
With this disease,

889
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,980
if after the surgery...

890
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,640
He must be really anxious right now.

891
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,800
I was worried sick before too,

892
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,640
but I've come to terms with it
these past couple of days.

893
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,380
It's not life-threatening,

894
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,880
so as long as he's still breathing,
that's plenty.

895
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,340
We're all human.

896
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,640
Everyone has their health issues.

897
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,900
Besides,

898
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,260
if he stays in such a bad mood,

899
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,820
won't that just make things worse?

900
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,840
Right?

901
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,040
Thank you, Lin,

902
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,400
for taking the trouble

903
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,280
to drive Guang back and forth
these past few days.

904
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,720
It's no trouble at all, Grandma.

905
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,680
Plus, there's a lot of work

906
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,420
at the company lately,

907
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,620
so I have to travel
between Suzhou and Nanjing anyway.

908
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,640
It's all on the same route.

909
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:19,880
Alright.

910
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,360
Has a surgeon been picked
for Dad's operation?

911
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,260
It's settled.

912
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,940
Your dad insisted on waiting

913
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,040
for a foreign doctor

914
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,220
called "Will" something.

915
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,020
William Schneider.

916
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,060
That's the one.
You really know your stuff.

917
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,640
So, how is that doctor?

918
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,460
Dr. Schneider

919
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,060
is a top neurosurgeon in Germany.

920
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,360
I've looked over

921
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,840
all the test results Xiguang sent.

922
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,820
Mr. Nie's hearing has weakened.

923
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,220
If the tumor
is severely adhered to the auditory

924
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,640
and facial nerves,

925
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,040
the surgery will be extremely difficult.

926
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,800
Professor Schneider

927
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,500
happens to be an expert in this field

928
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,000
and has published several papers

929
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,980
on strategies

930
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,960
for preserving nerve function.

931
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
He's the perfect choice

932
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,960
for the lead surgeon.

933
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:08,860
Let's head over

934
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,040
to the doctor's office first.

935
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,360
This is Dr. Schneider's profile.

936
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,140
Miss Nie,

937
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,080
you can take a look.

938
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,560
[William Schneider]

939
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,160
We don't have any issues

940
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,060
with the choice of doctor.

941
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,200
It's just the timing.

942
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,460
If the surgery is pushed back

943
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,940
by a week to ten days,

944
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,060
would that cause any problems?

945
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,320
I recall

946
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,500
from our last call

947
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,380
that you were leaning towards

948
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,300
finding a local doctor

949
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,220
and operating as soon as possible.

950
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,520
Ideally,

951
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,700
yes.

952
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,040
However,

953
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,980
for intracranial surgery,

954
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:36,980
the patient needs

955
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,440
to remain calm and positive.

956
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:39,920
Since

957
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,000
Mr. Nie is being so insistent,

958
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,960
I'd suggest

959
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,200
going along with what he wants.

960
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,160
We'll monitor

961
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,140
his condition around the clock

962
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,360
to ensure

963
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,780
the surgery goes
as smoothly as possible.

964
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,620
That makes sense.

965
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,380
Thank you, Dr. Liu.

966
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,540
I'm going to go check on Dad.

967
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,420
Wait for me.

968
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,560
Okay.

969
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,720
Is Lin not coming?

970
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,820
Dad has a bit of prejudice
against Yusen,

971
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,680
so he's sitting this one out

972
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,100
to avoid any awkwardness.

973
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,300
How can he be so ungrateful?

974
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,120
Guang,

975
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,340
you should head out early later.

976
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,440
There's not much to do here anyway.

977
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,960
Don't keep Lin waiting.

978
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,780
Grandma, it's fine.

979
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,100
I'll just find a spot downstairs

980
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,060
to get some work done.

981
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,480
I'm fine.

982
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,220
It's just a minor surgery.

983
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:32,900
Once I'm out,

984
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,340
we will get together.

985
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,640
No drinks for now, though.

986
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,160
That's not it at all.

987
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,280
Where did you hear those rumors?

988
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,660
Fine,

989
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm hanging up now.

990
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,320
Dad,

991
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,820
how are you feeling today?

992
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,080
What is wrong with you?

993
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,600
I told you not to call

994
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,360
the police.

995
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,920
Why did you do it anyway?

996
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:03,980
Do you think

997
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,780
just because I'm stuck
in this hospital bed,

998
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,020
I can't keep you in line anymore?

999
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,780
What are you talking about?

1000
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,060
Still trying to keep me in the dark?

1001
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,480
The news is all over Wuxi.

1002
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,300
I've been getting calls

1003
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,100
all morning.

1004
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,199
On the surface,
they're "checking in" on me,

1005
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,800
but really, they're just fishing
to find out

1006
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,000
how much I got scammed for!

1007
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,960
You're grown-up now,

1008
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,199
can't you be a bit more mature

1009
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,239
and have some perspective?

1010
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,020
A few million is nothing.

1011
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,960
Just let it go.

1012
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,380
How is that more important
than my corporate image?

1013
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,719
In business,
your reputation is everything.

1014
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,179
You can't even get
your priorities straight.

1015
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,219
How could you let a measly few million

1016
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,540
get to you like this?

1017
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,800
You're my only daughter.

1018
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,540
All my money will be yours anyway.

1019
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,600
What's the rush?

1020
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,480
What on earth are you saying?

1021
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,380
When did Guang ever call the police?

1022
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,940
So it wasn't you guys?

1023
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,980
I see what's going on now.

1024
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,520
Someone reported a scam,

1025
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,580
and because it's linked to you,

1026
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,420
everyone is calling you. Is that it?

1027
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,800
Grandma and I weren't the ones scammed

1028
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,739
and aren't even involved,

1029
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,720
so we couldn't have called the police.

1030
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,920
We only thought about it that day

1031
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,180
because people were at our door
causing a scene.

1032
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,380
That's long over now.

1033
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,300
It's way too late to go to the police.

1034
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,200
If you

1035
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,680
want to be the fall guy

1036
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,440
and pay off someone else's debts,

1037
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,480
that's on you.

1038
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,420
We have even less reason to report that.

1039
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,220
Qian Dashun borrowed money,

1040
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:09,820
he couldn't pay back

1041
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,520
and skipped.

1042
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,800
The people who got fleeced

1043
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,980
was either him or his daughter.

1044
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,480
They're the ones who called the police.

1045
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,140
Wuxi is a small place,

1046
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,560
and plenty of people know

1047
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,660
about you and Qian Fangping.

1048
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,080
If she went to the police

1049
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,440
and got recognized,

1050
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,420
of course

1051
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,440
it would blow up

1052
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,540
and point back to you.

1053
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,880
Why didn't you

1054
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,800
suspect them first

1055
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,540
instead of coming at me?

1056
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,960
Guang,

1057
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,200
my sweet granddaughter,

1058
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
don't be upset.

1059
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,700
I will give him
a piece of my mind for you.

1060
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,880
You've completely lost your wits.

1061
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,540
No wonder people say

1062
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,240
a new woman in your life
makes you forget your own child.

1063
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,740
You and Qian Fangping
aren't married yet,

1064
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,580
and your heart

1065
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,860
is already in the wrong place.

1066
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,480
I'm done taking care of you.

1067
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,960
I'm washing my hands of this.

1068
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,280
You've got money, right?

1069
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,660
Go hire some more consultants

1070
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,040
and caregivers.

1071
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,400
Let Qian Fangping and Qian Dashun

1072
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,440
wait on you.

1073
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,840
Since you people are such "family,"
after all!

1074
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,420
Guang, let's go.

1075
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,560
You think I called the police

1076
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,160
because I wanted the money back

1077
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,040
and didn't care about your reputation?

1078
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,580
Haven't I considered

1079
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,600
your reputation enough?

1080
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,660
Ma Nianyuan used my name

1081
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,760
to lure Yusen to Wuxi.

1082
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,880
Yusen got into a car accident on the way

1083
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,420
and can never hold a scalpel again.

1084
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,540
His career is ruined.

1085
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,380
Did I ever tell

1086
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,500
my mom about this?

1087
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,900
Did I tell Grandma?

1088
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,120
I didn't tell a soul.

1089
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,380
And

1090
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,280
after Yusen found out the truth,

1091
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,680
he never mentioned it to a single member

1092
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,320
of his family.

1093
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:39,980
Have we not protected

1094
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,760
your reputation enough?

1095
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,120
This involves

1096
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,080
Lin too?

1097
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,280
Lin's accident

1098
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,480
was Ma Nianyuan's fault?

1099
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,720
And what did we get

1100
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,440
in return?

1101
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,080
We got you targeting him even harder,

1102
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,500
even blocking his share transfer.

1103
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,080
Of course,

1104
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,380
that's your right as a shareholder,

1105
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,280
which is why

1106
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,120
I never approached you about it.

1107
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,820
But I truly don't understand.

1108
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,560
How can you

1109
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,040
feel no guilt

1110
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,940
about indirectly destroying

1111
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,060
someone's career?

1112
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,300
Instead, after learning the truth,

1113
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,100
you doubled down.

1114
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,020
Is it because you know

1115
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,180
you're in the wrong

1116
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,920
and you're just taking it
to the next level?

1117
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,100
Are you acting like

1118
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,540
you don't care

1119
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,960
just to cover up your own guilt?

1120
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,740
Nie Xiguang!

1121
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,380
You keep saying

1122
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,040
I'm your only daughter,

1123
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,340
but all these years

1124
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,540
you've been busy looking after

1125
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,840
your first love and her daughter.

1126
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,060
Where did that leave me?

1127
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,620
When I was studying in Nanjing,

1128
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,420
how many times did you visit?

1129
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,020
I work in Suzhou,

1130
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,600
and before you knew about Yusen,

1131
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,560
did you ever come to see me?

1132
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,840
Not once.

1133
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,680
Yusen thought

1134
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,260
I was the one who lured him to Wuxi,

1135
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,300
so he hated me for being heartless

1136
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,020
and ignoring him after the accident.

1137
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,080
If I hadn't gone to Suzhou

1138
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,940
and uncovered the truth,

1139
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,060
I might have spent my whole life

1140
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,240
taking the fall for Ma Nianyuan.

1141
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:58,920
If a man

1142
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,880
as capable as Yusen

1143
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,400
hated me,

1144
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,980
would he

1145
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,800
retaliate?

1146
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,320
Did you think about that?

1147
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,740
Has Ma Nianyuan done

1148
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,660
other things

1149
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,600
in my name?

1150
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,540
Are there

1151
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,220
more "debts" I'll have to pay for her?

1152
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,360
Now that the truth is out,

1153
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,500
did you investigate?

1154
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,740
Did you comfort me?

1155
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,080
Did you punish her?

1156
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,100
Were you even worried that what she did

1157
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,120
might hurt me?

1158
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,160
No.

1159
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,480
You did nothing.

1160
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,520
Not a single thing.

1161
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,600
You took

1162
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,580
Ma Nianyuan's word as gospel

1163
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,840
regarding the accident,

1164
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,980
and even two years later,

1165
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,320
you're still slandering
Yusen's character.

1166
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:39,840
Today,

1167
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,020
they were the ones
who called the police,

1168
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,280
yet your first instinct

1169
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,440
wasn't to doubt them

1170
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,980
but to blame me.

1171
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,260
Dad,

1172
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,080
do you actually love me

1173
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,600
like you say you do?

1174
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,840
Are you lying to me,

1175
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,820
or just lying to yourself?

1176
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,020
What a shame.

1177
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,660
This is just a crying shame.

1178
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,940
What are you doing here?

1179
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,200
I ran into your mom downstairs,

1180
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,260
so I walked up with her.

1181
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,540
Mom.

1182
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,380
I was nearby on business

1183
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,380
and figured since you were visiting
your dad today,

1184
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,540
I'd come pick you up.

1185
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,480
Since I was already here,

1186
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,560
I thought

1187
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,360
I didn't need to be so heartless.

1188
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,120
A visit

1189
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,460
is only natural.

1190
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,140
I didn't expect to hear all this.

1191
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,560
I think I'd better

1192
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,300
stick to being heartless.

1193
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,780
Xiguang,

1194
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,760
you've been through so much.

1195
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,600
Why didn't you tell me?

1196
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,220
I...

1197
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,620
I didn't

1198
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,240
want you to be sad.

1199
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,880
Then, as time went on,

1200
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,520
I just didn't want
to talk about it anymore.

1201
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:45,920
I

1202
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,580
stopped being sad over your dad
a long time ago.

1203
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,000
Lin,

1204
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,420
I am so sorry.

1205
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,180
Ms. Jiang,

1206
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,560
this has nothing
to do with you, Xiguang,

1207
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,640
or her grandparents.

1208
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,400
Does your mom know

1209
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,200
about this?

1210
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:14,780
I think...

1211
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,200
a regular car accident

1212
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,900
is easier for her

1213
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,020
to accept.

1214
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,760
Sorry to put you out.

1215
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:33,840
Mr. Nie,

1216
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,900
you're in a hospital bed,

1217
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,600
so I won't kick you while you're down.

1218
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,040
But sooner or later,

1219
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,440
we are going

1220
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,140
to settle this score.

1221
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:07,040
[Taihu Lake High-end Medical Center]

1222
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,640
It's getting late.

1223
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,200
Let's all grab a bite.

1224
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,180
Xiguang's grandma, you should come too.

1225
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,320
Guang's grandpa is home alone,

1226
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,920
so I should probably head back.

1227
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,000
All right then.

1228
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,680
Grandma, how are you getting home?

1229
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,040
A ride is already set up for me.

1230
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,300
I'll walk you to the car then.

1231
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:46,860
Careful.

1232
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,200
I will.

1233
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,520
Lin,

1234
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,180
once all this mess blows over,

1235
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,700
you and Guang must come over

1236
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,680
to our place.

1237
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,180
I'll cook you something special.

1238
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:05,620
I'd love to.

1239
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,900
I'll definitely be visiting often.

1240
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,180
I'll be off then.

1241
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,560
Get home safe.

1242
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,500
Let's have a simple meal.

1243
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:35,900
You've been

1244
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,280
running back and forth
and must be exhausted.

1245
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,580
Once we're finished,

1246
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,280
just stay the night at home

1247
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,360
and don't head back to Suzhou.

1248
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,300
You too, Lin.

1249
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,560
Don't worry about the drive.

1250
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,840
