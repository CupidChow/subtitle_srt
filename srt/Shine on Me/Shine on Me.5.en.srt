00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,080
What?

192
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,740
You're trying to pin the blame

193
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,880
entirely on us?

194
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,620
We have

195
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,660
a copy of the contract.

196
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,640
It clearly says RMB on there.

197
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,980
Verification was your job,

198
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,480
and you Finance people failed miserably.

199
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,820
You're shifting the blame.

200
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,680
Sure, we were supposed to verify it,

201
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,080
but your department

202
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,120
also had one person prepare

203
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,000
and another review it.

204
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,900
How did you miss it then?

205
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,320
You were the ones
who signed the contract.

206
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,620
If you couldn't catch the error,

207
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,920
why should it fall entirely on us?

208
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,240
Who's really responsible

209
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,660
for the original mistake?

210
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,400
Don't get worked up.

211
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,200
You're not the one who did the books.

212
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,320
Why are you so stressed?

213
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,500
Whoever did it takes the heat.

214
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,940
Isn't the name on the stamp

215
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,560
Nie Xiguang?

216
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,860
Who's that?

217
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,780
Never heard of her.

218
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Must be a newbie.

219
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,440
I...

220
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,600
I was the one who actually handled it.

221
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,440
Nie just started here

222
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,300
and is still learning the ropes.

223
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,160
I just used her stamp

224
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,880
to process it.

225
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,680
Dou Cheng,

226
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,980
when you were begging us

227
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,540
to rush the order that day,

228
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,160
didn't you see her then?

229
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,000
Stop playing these dirty games.

230
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,280
I'm Nie Xiguang.

231
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,960
I'll take full responsibility

232
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,840
for Finance's part,

233
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,440
but for errors made at the source

234
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,020
that have nothing to do with us,

235
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm absolutely not taking the blame.

236
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,660
You'll own it?

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,260
As if you even could.

238
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,060
Your entire annual salary

239
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,520
is nothing compared to what we lost.

240
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,460
Are you serious?

241
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,380
Stop acting so heroic.

242
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,660
What we just saw

243
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
was the module production line.

244
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,180
Up ahead is the cell production line.

245
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,800
Tech and the lab

246
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,980
are also in the cell plant.

247
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,900
Let me show you.

248
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,120
Is that half-finished building
over there

249
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,740
the Phase II plant?

250
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,600
Yes.

251
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,540
It's been sitting unfinished
for a long time.

252
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,560
The path for the PV industry

253
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,280
has been incredibly bumpy.

254
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,880
This company

255
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,980
was founded in 2005.

256
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,240
The first three years were the only time
everything went right.

257
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,420
In those days,

258
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,780
output value was soaring,

259
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,740
and annual profits
topped a hundred million.

260
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,700
Then came 2008,

261
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,680
and the financial crisis hit.

262
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,620
We barely managed to scrape by.

263
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,600
Things only looked up for two years

264
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,600
before the AD/CVD duties hit.

265
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,640
That wiped out our entire market share

266
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,980
in both Europe and the U.S.

267
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,220
We were among the lucky ones.

268
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,620
A few domestic orders kept us afloat.

269
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,740
But so many others
have declared bankruptcy

270
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,400
and been forced out of the industry.

271
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,240
The state of the PV market these years

272
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,960
has been tense indeed.

273
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,360
Mr. Zhang, holding the fort
all by yourself

274
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,440
is no small feat.

275
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,700
Before my transfer here,

276
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,840
my grandpa specifically told me

277
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,920
to learn as much as possible from you.

278
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,120
It's not that I'm anything special.

279
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,480
I've just been cautious
and conservative.

280
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,980
Ever since 2010,

281
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,700
I've strictly controlled our capacity,

282
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,160
and we stopped hiring as well.

283
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,200
This year, due to poor performance,

284
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,140
some staff in Administration

285
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,160
have left.

286
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,000
Out of necessity, we hired

287
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,280
a few fresh graduates to fill the gaps.

288
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Hiring during a time like this

289
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,620
is quite rare in this industry.

290
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,620
Yusen,

291
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,840
I heard

292
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,540
you volunteered to transfer here

293
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,460
from HQ.

294
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:40,820
That's right.

295
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:41,960
Why is that?

296
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,660
I remember

297
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,240
last year,

298
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,360
at the corporate strategy session

299
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,200
on the Phase II expansion project,

300
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,920
you and I

301
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,600
both voted against it.

302
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,320
I think we're on the same page.

303
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,980
It's not the expansion you're against,

304
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,700
but the timing.

305
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,300
I asked

306
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,240
to be sent here

307
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,460
because I believe

308
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,340
the turning point has arrived.

309
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,660
Tell me about it.

310
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,800
So, you're putting me on the spot.

311
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,160
If you look at

312
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,660
the trajectory of global PV,

313
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,360
from the U.S.

314
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Million Solar Roofs Initiative

315
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,820
or Germany's

316
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,860
Renewable Energy Sources Act,

317
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,260
the PV momentum

318
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,480
has always come from the top down.

319
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,280
It's all part

320
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,200
of the global energy play.

321
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,500
For China,

322
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,160
developing clean energy

323
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,120
and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels

324
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:32,940
is necessary

325
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,880
and a national imperative.

326
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,560
Giving up is not an option.

327
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,640
The government just released

328
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,660
a series of PV development roadmaps.

329
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,620
The signal is crystal clear.

330
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,420
They're pivoting to the domestic market.

331
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,880
So, you're here

332
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,520
because HQ's intent

333
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,840
is to resume the expansion?

334
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,420
Exactly.

335
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,660
HQ will release the Phase III funding

336
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,580
as soon as possible,

337
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,800
but any further shortfall

338
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,060
must be self-funded.

339
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,400
Mr. Zhang,

340
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,120
has the second payment

341
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,760
from Yuancheng cleared?

342
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,240
Not yet.

343
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,720
This is Tech.

344
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,120
Mr. Zhang.

345
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,540
Where's Mr. Hua?

346
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,700
He's in the lab.

347
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,540
He'll be here any minute.

348
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,340
Mr. Zhang.

349
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,340
Let me introduce everyone.

350
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,620
This is

351
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,680
our new Deputy GM,

352
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,040
Mr. Lin Yusen.

353
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,600
This is Mr. Hua Xiangyang,

354
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,460
who holds a PhD

355
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,680
from the School of Photovoltaic

356
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,400
and Renewable Energy Engineering
at UNSW Sydney

357
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,160
and

358
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,760
he leads our R&D

359
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,140
on PERC technology.

360
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:45,780
Hello.

361
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,500
Sorry.

362
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,640
I was fixing some equipment.

363
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,440
No problem.

364
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,500
Is the machine down again?

365
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,280
Just a minor glitch.

366
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,080
It's still holding up after a quick fix.

367
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,160
I was actually looking for you.

368
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,460
We've had

369
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,380
a minor breakthrough
in conversion efficiency,

370
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,500
but

371
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,060
we're still struggling
to keep it stable.

372
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,480
Even a minor breakthrough

373
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,940
is great news.

374
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,500
Come on.

375
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,720
Let's check it out at the lab.

376
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,520
Let's go.

377
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,560
Mr. Lin,

378
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,000
Finance and Procurement

379
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,960
have a massive screw-up on their hands.

380
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,040
They are having a total meltdown.

381
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,780
If you want

382
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,820
our cooperation, fine,

383
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,560
you need to send an email,

384
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,280
stating clearly:

385
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,300
"Due to a blunder by Finance,
a payment was issued incorrectly.

386
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,240
Procurement is now being requested

387
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,280
to step in
and coordinate with the vendor."

388
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,440
And we need to be clear

389
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,160
that the fund recovery

390
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,760
isn't

391
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,500
our job.

392
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,360
What do you mean,

393
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,780
it's not your job?

394
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,740
Are you just going

395
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,400
to dodge the blame?

396
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,100
Hello?

397
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,420
Got it.

398
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,860
Stop it, everyone.

399
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,880
This has escalated

400
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,580
all the way to Mr. Lin.

401
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,400
Don't panic.

402
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,940
Now that the higher-up is involved,

403
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,340
it'll get sorted out.

404
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,560
Hello?

405
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,300
That's great.

406
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,440
Thanks a lot.

407
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,440
Understood.

408
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,020
Mr. Wang from Administration said

409
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,200
Mr. Lin reached out

410
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,120
to the company

411
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,180
and managed to get the money back.

412
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,380
They've agreed

413
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,560
to wire the funds by tomorrow.

414
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,440
He also mentioned

415
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,180
that we're expected

416
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,960
at the Administration immediately.

417
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,840
Mr. Lin wants to see us.

418
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,100
The balding guy in there

419
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,560
is Mr. Mo, the Head of Procurement.

420
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,480
Mr. Lin called him in, too?

421
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,100
He seems to have quite an attitude

422
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,420
and doesn't have much respect
for Mr. Lin.

423
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,160
He used to be at the Shengyuan HQ.

424
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,040
He's been here
since Shuangyuan was first set up.

425
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,200
We've been through three Deputy GMs

426
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,080
and he's the only one who stayed.

427
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,100
He's a real veteran around here.

428
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,920
Word is, he has serious backing at HQ.

429
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,820
Qiqi,

430
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,820
you're about to be promoted
to Senior Accountant.

431
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,620
If Mr. Lin asks,

432
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,600
just tell him

433
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,380
I did the books.

434
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,920
No.

435
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,620
You're still on probation.

436
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,880
What if Mr. Lin gets upset

437
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,120
and fires you?

438
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,960
I'm not afraid.

439
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,040
Xiguang,

440
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,720
I know you mean well,

441
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,440
but we have to be honest,

442
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:52,880
right?

443
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,840
We'll just tell the truth.

444
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,060
That's the only way
to have a clear conscience.

445
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,160
Where is Mr. Wu?

446
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,060
Mr. Wu is away on a business trip today.

447
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,500
He's already been briefed
on the situation

448
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,599
and is on his way back now.

449
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,980
Tell him

450
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,339
to keep his eyes peeled

451
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,420
when hiring.

452
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,660
Look at these people

453
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,400
he brought in.

454
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,640
What a total liability.

455
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,240
If Mr. Lin hadn't stepped in

456
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,700
and got that money back,

457
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,720
you couldn't pay for this mess
even if we sold you off.

458
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,340
There was an oversight on my part,

459
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,200
but you guys

460
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,300
made the error first

461
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,640
and pushed us to rush the payment.

462
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,880
My apologies, Mr. Mo.

463
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,040
We'll be more careful.

464
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,100
How dare you

465
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,220
talk to Mr. Mo like that?

466
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:45,940
Just a reminder,

467
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,320
Mr. Mo,

468
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,980
human trafficking is a crime.

469
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,680
Mr. Lin.

470
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,200
Such impressive composure.

471
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,840
Still in the mood for jokes.

472
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,260
You're too young,

473
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,680
and frankly, a medical degree

474
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,440
hardly prepares you

475
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,000
for real-world management.

476
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,840
With entry-level staff like these,

477
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,640
you have to be firm with them.

478
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,960
A few more years in the trenches,

479
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,100
and you'll see.

480
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,660
Thanks for your guidance.

481
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,020

Miss Nie,

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,480

Oh, my.

503
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,580
Is he pink-slipping me, too?

504
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,140
Mr. Lin.

505
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,740
As of this moment,

506
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,460
you're moving to Administration.

507
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,180
You've been transferred
to Administration?

508
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,340
Yeah,

509
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,840
I'll report for duty tomorrow.

and the Deputy GM.

513
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,520
So that means

514
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,760
Mr. Lin will be

515
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,590
your direct supervisor.

516
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,520
I guess that's for the best.

With Mr. Lin watching,

518
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,560
Mr. Mo will have to tone it down a bit.

519
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,180
Otherwise, I'm really afraid
he'd come after you.

520
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,200
Even though Mr. Wu
would look out for us.

00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,820
I'm fine.

But the Senior Accountant promotion

is that the money was recovered.

00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,740
that my alliance with Mr. Lin

760
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,540
has unilaterally collapsed.

761
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,400
You poor, naive thing.

762
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,240
Does Mr. Lin even know

763
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,780
he's in an alliance with you?

764
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,440
I'm a total goner.

765
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,100
My brain is now hard-wired

766
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,380
for the price of low-iron glass

767
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,800
per square meter,

768
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,360
the cost of EVA film

769
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,660
per kilogram,

770
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,840
and payment cycles.

771
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,540
The romantic girl in me

772
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,220
is dead.

773
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,780
I seriously don't understand

774
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,020
the Administration's logic.

775
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,080
This job is too "character-building".

776
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,520
Yin Jie, since you joined,

777
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,310
have you ever been assigned

778
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,200
this kind of grunt work?

779
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,120
What?

780
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,820
During my first few days here,

781
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,660
I didn't even get a good look
at the boss's face.

782
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,640
No.

783
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,680
Something smells fishy.

784
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,220
Mr. Lin treats Xiguang very differently.

785
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,520
Thanks for noticing

786
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,200
that he's being exceptionally cruel
to me.

787
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,720
No.

788
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,020
You're reading it all wrong.

789
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,360
Xiguang,

790
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,400
does he actually

791
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,220
have feelings for you?

792
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,780
That's how it always goes

793
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,640
in dramas.

794
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,260
The female lead joins the company

795
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,240
and gets

796
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,960
special treatment,

797
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,560
then gets transferred
right under the boss's wing

798
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
so he can see her every day.

799
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,720
If a guy in a drama

800
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,920
asks a girl

801
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,700
what she wants to eat

802
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,840
and cooks for her,

803
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,860
does that mean

804
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,780
he likes her?

805
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,480
Totally.

806
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,640
Cooking for someone
is the ultimate love language.

807
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,680
It's so sweet.

808
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,360
I love it.

809
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,500
But in reality,

810
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,200
maybe he just didn't want her

811
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,680
to treat him to a big meal

812
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,340
and would rather do it himself

813
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,120
than owe her a favor.

814
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,660
He's the standoffish type, huh?

815
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,260
So

816
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,760
delusion is a disease,

817
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,360
and it seriously needs the cure.

818
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,860
I've decided,

819
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,280
once this project is wrapped up,

820
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:18,380
I'm taking some time off.

821
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,360
I thought you were taking time off.

822
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,480
What are you doing now,

823
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,380
pulling overtime?

824
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,380
I'm putting together

825
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,199
a deluxe spreadsheet

826
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,159
that will blow my ex-ally's mind

827
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,100
and get my vacation approved.

828
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,620
I've gathered historical quotes

829
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,000
from various suppliers for every product

830
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,900
via phone and email.

831
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,100
Since you might need

832
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,500
to keep this confidential,

833
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,460
I made the calls from my personal phone.

834
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,380
My number is registered in Wuxi,

835
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,120
so they won't

836
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,260
link it back to us.

837
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,540
For the emails, I made up

838
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,300
a fake company based in Jiangxi.

839
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,720
In the sheet,

840
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,700
I also entered

841
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,760
our average transaction prices

842
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,660
over the years.

843
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,160
Any price variance over 10%

844
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,140
is highlighted in red.

845
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,440
You've been very thorough.

846
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,900
Excellent work.

847
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,740
Thanks, Mr. Lin.

848
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,060
Mr. Lin,

849
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,800
I'd like to request some time off.

850
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,820
[Leave Request Form]

851
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,380
Three days?

852
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,000
Why such a long leave?

853
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,260
Because...

854
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,060
I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

855
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,360
Unfortunately,

856
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,820
I used to be a doctor

857
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,160
and I really don't see

858
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,780
any signs of illness.

859
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,300
Were you a TCM doctor?

860
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,120
I mean, only TCM doctors

861
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,200
can diagnose just by looking.

862
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,420
Request denied.

863
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,840
You may leave.

864
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:40,820
How did it go?

865
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,620
Did your "ex-ally" drop his jaw?

866
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,180
Are you a TCM doctor?

867
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,380
No.

868
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,800
Have you lost your mind?

869
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,600
Would saying that

870
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,860
make you angry?

871
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,880
Why would I be mad?

872
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,060
At most,

873
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,840
I'd just think you've lost it.

874
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,820
Exactly.

875
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,240
He was being so weird.

876
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,220
It was like someone stepped on his tail.

877
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,320
Who are you talking about?

878
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,170
[Leave Request Form]

879
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,460
I mean

880
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,900
I'd better keep my head down
for a few days.

881
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,880
I think I've reached my breaking point.

882
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,320
I need to go out
for a real meal tomorrow.

883
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,920
How come you hit your "limit"
every three days?

884
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,920
Wait.

885
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,860
Just make do with this dorm for now.

886
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:37,960
Your uncle

887
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,780
has pulled some strings for you.

888
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,820
They'll try their best not to assign you

889
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,460
any roommates.

890
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,600
Come on,

891
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,400
let's go.

892
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,680
What's going on?

893
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,280
Someone new just moved into Building 1.

894
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,840
Dorm Management promised us

895
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,180
that we'd get

896
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,540
the first available room.

897
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,320
I've got the scoop.

898
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,980
The guy who moved
into Building 1 yesterday

899
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,200
is a new hire in Procurement.

900
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,480
A room opened up in Building 1,

901
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,560
and he just moved right in.

902
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,740
What gives?

903
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,360
Shouldn't we have been prioritized?

904
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,460
We've been here longer.

905
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,020
This is totally unfair.

906
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:33,740
No way.

907
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,900
I'm going to file a formal complaint.

908
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,640
A complaint probably won't do any good.

909
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,400
Word is, he's a relative

910
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,300
of Mr. Mo from Procurement.

911
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,120
Procurement again?

912
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,240
Mr. Mo is way too full of himself.

913
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,780
Exactly.

914
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,900
So what if he's a relative?

915
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,660
Rules are rules, right?

916
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:51,960
Logistics

917
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,300
will definitely back him up.

918
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,480
Even if we complain,

919
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,420
they'll probably just stall

920
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,540
and give us the runaround.

921
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,640
I heard the cafeteria caterer

922
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,980
is also a crony he brought in.

923
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,840
No wonder the food is so terrible.

924
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,540
Old hatreds and new resentments.

925
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:07,980
No,

926
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,480
we can't just let this slide.

927
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,980
Should we just go straight to Mr. Lin?

928
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,400
Mr. Lin?

929
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,100
Yeah.

930
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,700
Mr. Lin outranks Mr. Mo

931
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,260
and he is not afraid of him.

932
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,060
Besides, Yin Jie and I
are in Administration,

933
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,340
and Yuhua, you're in Marketing.

934
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,820
Both departments report directly to him.

935
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,720
Who else are we supposed to go to?

936
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,960
But what if Mr. Lin resents us

937
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,780
for causing trouble

938
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,820
and putting him in a spot?

939
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,340
You have a point.

940
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,160
If Mr. Lin thinks

941
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,300
we're being immature and reckless,

942
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,420
then we're screwed.

943
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,540
True.

944
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,200
I guess I wasn't thinking it through.

945
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:53,800
Listen.

946
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:55,820
Forget

947
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,880
about the complaint form.

948
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,140
I'll go talk to Mr. Lin alone.

949
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,040
I don't care if he has
a bad impression of me.

950
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,200
Anyway,

951
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,180
it's already as bad as it gets.

952
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,280
Don't.

953
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,560
You shouldn't just

954
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,580
throw in the towel like that.

955
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,500
Either we go together

956
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,520
or no one goes at all.

957
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,520
You hear me?

958
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,280
Yeah.

959
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:24,760
Ke,

960
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,140
here you go.

961
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,020
What kind of meeting lasts this long?

962
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,600
Mr. Lin.

963
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,280
I'll head back

964
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,380
and touch base with Mr. Ba

965
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,120
at Shengyuan Finance.

966
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,400
Mr. Lin.

967
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,500
