It's late.

51
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,800
Is this appropriate?

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,880
What's inappropriate about it? It's only 9 p.m.

But Rongrong is still at home.

What? No way.

Of course I do.

Time's up.

70

It's not that I want to go see her.

71

It's fate.

72

Don't you miss me?

81
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,350
Yes.

82
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,590
What?

83
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,270
What did you say?

84
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,280
I didn't hear you.

Just...

89

I just put it there casually.

90
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,240
I want to give it a name.

91
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,640
A name?

92
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,159
Its name would be Zhou Ziqian.

93
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,720
Who would share the same name with a doll?

94
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,320
That's weird.

95
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,200
No.

96
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,440
We'll call it Zhou Ziqian.

97
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,000
You still owe me two requests.

98
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,440
I'll use one request for its name.

99

OK.

You can stay here.

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
I'll pack up.

107

Take a look around.

108
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,280
Can I see everything?

109
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,800
Yes.

110
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,760
There's nothing I have to hide.

111
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,000
I didn't expect this.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,080
What a surprise.

113
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,960
Ji Qiu.

114

Ji Qiu.

117
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,400
I caught you.

118
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,360
What?

119
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,630
You had a crush on me long time ago.

120
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,040
You hid it so well.

121
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,600
How does it feel?

122
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,990
Do you feel excited when I became real from the photos?

123
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,430
What are you thinking about every day?

124
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,200
This is a photo for guest selection for the variety show.

125
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,400
Take a look over there.

126
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,200
There should be a photo of Ye Qiao.

127

Oh.

128

Can't you remember that

135
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,880
you wrote him a love letter in high school?

136

What?

Thinking that I'd be able to see you in three days,

140
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,400
I'm so happy that I couldn't sleep for days.

141

Are you an owl?

Stop laughing.

You're probably the most charming man I've ever met.

146

It's like every strand of your hair can sing.

Every look is full of emotions.

148

Seriously?

149
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,520
What kind of person has emotions in every look  of their eyes?

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,710
Is it like this?

151
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,840
Or like this?

152
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,950
Even your sweating movements are cool.

153
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,520
I'm so angry that I feel hot.

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,200
[Lies and Cheating]

171
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,610
It's late.

172
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,890
You are still working?

173
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,350
Yes.

174
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,030
Yes, we are.

175
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,830
That's right.

176
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,760
I'm talking to him

177
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,140
about

178
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,360
some remaining issues about the show.

179
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,170
I don't have much time during the day.

180
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,720
So I can only come and discuss it at night.

181
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,650
Oh.

182
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,330
You guys are working hard.

183
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,640
But

184
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,370
why work on the bed in the room?

185
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,350
The sofa in the living room is also fine.

186
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,160
Yes.

187
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,300
Well...

188
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,460
I know.

189
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,990
You don't want to disturb me, right?

190
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,620
Qiu, thank you.

191
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:31,930
Rongrong.

192
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,140
Why are you standing there?

193
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,110
Come for a seat.

194
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,940
By the way,

195
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,960
what was I saying just now?

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,800
I remember now.

197
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,510
Ji Qiu..

198
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:44,610
I mean Miss Ji,

199
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,370
was she a fan

200
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,630
of Chen Xinhong?

201
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,770
Yes.

202
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,530
She liked him so much.

203
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,300
She bought a lot of posters and albums.

204
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,980
She also went to his concert with Li Yan.

205
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,500
Who is Li Yan?

206
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,460
Ah.

207
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,680
Well,

208
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,990
a boy who liked Qiu in high school.

209
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,550
He was a bit handsome.

210
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,360
They were very close.

211
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,550
No.

212
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,310
Yes.

213
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,870
You went out to buy albums together

214
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,140
and didn't come back by midnight.

215
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,530
I called you back.

216
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,380
He even gave you Chen Xinhong's poster.

217
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,600
You really forgot?

218
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,590
So

219
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,310
Ji Qiu

220
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,280
had such a past with this boy.

221
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,630
Actually,

222
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,480
I can't remember.

223
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,160
You really don't remember?

224
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,090
It's okay.

225
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,600
Qiu,

226
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,230
I can help you recall it.

227
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,490
At that time...

228
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,680
They went to the concert together.

229
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,570
They must have had fun.

230
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,970
They went out to buy albums at midnight.

231
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,530
Is there any album that can't be bought during the day?

232
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,880
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

233
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,670
[Grape Ji]

234
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,450
I'm still angry with you no matter what you say now.

235
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,340
You are gonna have to work harder than this.

236
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,690
What?

237
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,410
She just hung up

238
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,500
and stopped calling?

239
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,010
Can't she try harder?

240
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,040
She didn't really mean it.

241
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,120
Zhou Ziqian.

242
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,170
What?

243
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,400
Zhou Ziqian.

244
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,080
Smile.

245
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,230
Smile, Zhou Ziqian.

246
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,440
Qianqian.

247
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,080
Qianqian.

248
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,050
Qianqian.

249
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,250
What's the matter?

250
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,390
I'm busy.

251
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,320
Oh.

252
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,070
Let's make it public.

253
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,200
Officially.

254
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,150
What?

255
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,410
You suddenly want to make it public?

256
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,730
My boyfriend is so handsome.

257
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
If I don't make it public,

258
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,000
it's my loss.

259
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,880
I just thought about it.

260
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,930
It's not something we can't do.

261
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,730
Then when are we going to make it public?

262
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,090
You just said you'd think about it.

263
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,190
I just did and I agreed.

264
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,050
Tomorrow is the weekend.

265
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,020
So I'll gather everyone around

266
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,160
and tell them about it.

267
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,880
By the way, ask Fu to join us.

268
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,930
He hasn't contacted me lately.

269
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,270
He seems busy.

270
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,760
Fu Qile.

271
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,480
Does he know?

272
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,620
Probably not.

273
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,390
I didn't even tell Rongrong.

274
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,190
Okay.

275
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,330
See you tomorrow.

276
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,050
See you tomorrow.

277
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,030
You already knew it, didn't you?

278
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,380
A sense of profession.

279
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:34,720
I guessed it.

280
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,360
People like you

281
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,930
really read others' mind, don't you?

282
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,480
It depends on whose mind I'm reading.

283
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,290
Well,

284
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:43,960
who...

285
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,220
You.

286
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,280
Haven't anyone told you before?

287
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,870
You can't hide anything.

288
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,810
So,

289
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,210
I was quite worried.

290
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,770
You know my big secret.

291
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,710
I hope

292
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,850
Ji Qiu will never know about that.

293
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,170
Can you keep it a secret?

294
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,300
When did you fall in love with her?

295
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,880
When I realized

296
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,580
I would be happy to see her.

297
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,630
I feel anxious when I don't see her.

298
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,950
But when I think of her, I look forward to seeing her again.

299
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,260
Maybe

300
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,690
it was during the recording,

301
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,380
or when we went to Qiuye Town together.

302
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,930
If it was earlier,

303
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,360
maybe it was when I was a kid.

304
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,590
What about you?

305
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,630
The first time I saw her,

306
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,830
it was the summer of 2012.

♫I've finally got ready to see you♫

308

And the situation we first met

309
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,730
was not really lovely.

310
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,020

♫I must act more natural than you♫

322

I was talking nonsense.

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,820
She is different

from other girls.

there's a game of chess.

329

But she's the piece who just rushed in recklessly.

It feels fresh.

331
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,390

♫Why are they avoiding me♫

333
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,000
She was born free.

00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,660
A lot

341
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,560
actually happened back then.

342
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:14,910
♫I will write a soft love song for you♫

343
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,780
Something happened to my family.

344
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,790
Rumors were spreading.

345
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,060
When everyone

346
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,869
was trying to avoid and stay away from me,

347
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:21,099
♫In your preferred grammar♫

348
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,680
I was ready to be left alone.

349
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,400
Is this seat taken?

350
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,660
But I didn't expect

351
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,839
she would show up.

352
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:28,720
♫Can we be together♫

353
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,780
Is this taken?

354
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:35,880
♫It must be so sweet♫

355
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,590
No.

356
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,660
Such a nice seat but no one's taken it. What a shame.

357
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:44,820
♫I live in the same sunset as you do♫

358
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,090
Perfect.

359
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,070
I like it.

360
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,600
That was when we were regrouping classes in the 2nd year of high school.

361
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:51,520
♫So gentle that you feel tired♫

362
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,250
I don't know if anyone had told her.

363
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,300
At least,

364
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,020
she didn't show anything.

365
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:58,270
♫Can we be together♫

366
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,980
Hurry up.

367
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,960
At first,

368
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,730
♫It must be so sweet♫

369
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,760
I was always subconsciously trying to find a topic.

370
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,060
I was afraid they would find out

371
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,370
that I didn't fit in.

372
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,260
Later, I found

373
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:14,170
♫Even if the world becomes hoarse♫

374
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,650
that she always indulged me.

375
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:22,140
♫I won't let you be afraid♫

376
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,680
To be honest,

377
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,280
I almost went to learn the law.

378
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:28,220
♫I've finally got ready to see you♫

379
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,200
I envy you.

380
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,750
At least,

381
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,230
I've never seen Qi Jiu back then.

382
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,200
♫My heart is pounding with all kinds of feelings♫

383
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,470
That's the only thing that makes me luckier than you are.

384
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,190
At least

385
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,750
we went through punishment,

386
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,130
we jogged,

387
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,110
and we wore the same uniform.

388
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,430
Are you trying to piss me off?

389
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,860
You wouldn't even let me say it?

390
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,030
So, for me,

391
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,600
she is not just the girl I like.

392
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,700
She's the moon in the dark.

393
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,220
She never belonged to me.

394
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,950
But she lit me up.

395
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,800
But

396
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,740
I think

397
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,480
we can't be anything more than friends.

398
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,060
But if you don't treat her well,

399
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,280
that might be another story.

400
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,560
I won't give you this chance.

401
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,030
Today,

402
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,670
I have something to announce.

403
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,360
I'm in a relationship.

404
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,710
Me too.

405
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,380
Alas.

406
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,220
I know.

407
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,270
It's just Ms. Cheng.

408
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,240
It must be Jiang Yu from senior class.

409
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,510
I mean,

410
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,740
we are together.

411
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,540
Ji Qiu

412
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,050
and I.

413
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,520
Look at you.

414
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,110
There you go again.

415
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,440
Right?

416
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,690
Tell you what,

417
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,160
if you are with Miss Ji,

418
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,550
I can date Jeon Ji-hyun.

419
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,190
Can you be practical?

420
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,410
Ji Qiu.

421
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,510
Give me your hand.

422
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,430
It's just holding hands.

423
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,250
Let go of her right now!

424
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,300
You let go.

425
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:17,800
I...

426
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,270
I...

427
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,600
It's nothing.

428
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,020
I...

429
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,610
You are really together?

430
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,420
Yes.

431
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:33,890
Really?

432
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,110
Yes.

433
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,090
Qian.

434
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,770
My hand...

435
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,620
You can deal with it after the competition.

436
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,410
After all,

437
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,880
I have my own war to fight.

438
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,230
Xu Wang.

439
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,610
You knew it?

440
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,250
I told you I believed it.

441
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,480
Mr. Fu.

442
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,400
You knew it too?

443
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,680
I guessed.

444
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,500
When did it happen?

445
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,180
I'm with you all the time.

446
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,030
And I'm good at observing.

447
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,390
Why didn't I notice anything?

448
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,070
You hid it so well.

449
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,540
Are you sure?

450
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,900
We

451
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,370
kept a low profile.

452
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,040
Miss Ji.

453
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,850
What do you see in Zhou Ziqian?

454
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,220
He is handsome.

455
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,630
What are you doing?

456
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:31,890
My beautiful face.

457
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,570
I have to protect it well in the future.

458
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,330
Are people in love

459
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,590
so cheesy?

460
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,810
I'm just protecting my face.

461
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,030
Don't you think it's cheesy?

462
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,180
What are you doing?

463
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,100
I'm calculating that

464
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,620
since you are in a relationship,

465
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,890
I can't keep Qiu with me all the time.

466
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,980
How about this?

467
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,910
You can have her on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

468
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,130
She's mine on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

469
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,430
To be fair,

470
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,060
the last day on Sunday,

471
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,900
we'll decide by rock, paper and scissors.

472
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,840
No way.

473
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,100
I haven't said anything that you took Xu Wang all the time.

474
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,290
Zhou Ziqian, if you keep talking nonsense,

475
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,970
I'll ask Qiu to break up with you.

476
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,330
It's too late.

477
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:08,720
I...

478
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,400
Zhou Ziqian.

479
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,260
How much did you drink?

480
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,780
My head hurts.

481
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,160
I want to lie down.

482
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,050
Can you walk now?

483
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,370
Zhou Ziqian.

484
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,360
How about

485
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,950
going to lie down on my bed?

486
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,580
Let's go.

487
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,050
Let's go.

488
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,040
I can't hold on any longer.

489
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:31,920
Zhou Ziqian.

490
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,100
It's late. You should go home.

491
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,280
What?

492
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,070
Ouch.

493
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,370
Ouch.

494
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,340
Oh, no.

495
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,270
I can't get up.

496
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,620
Are you faking it?

497
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,350
You're so cruel.

498
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,650
I'm having a headache.

499
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,030
I can't even talk.

500
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:58,880
Really?

501
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,000
I'll get you some honey water.

502
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,800
Lie down.

503
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,160
Go.

504
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,090
I need a rest.

505
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,270
Goodness.

506
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:20,810
You are still here.

507
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,070
I knew you were faking it.

508
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,290
Get up and go home.

509
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,060
You want me to leave?

510
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,580
How can you let me go?

511
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,130
You don't like me anymore.

512
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,860
And I really feel bad.

513
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,830
And I...

514
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,350
My face is hot. Feel it if you don't believe me.

515
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,950
It's so fake. How could I believe it?

516
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,500
You are not sick.

517
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:47,810
Isn't it hot?

518
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,450
Then...

519
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,410
It is.

520
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,680
It doesn't necessarily mean you are sick.

521
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,220
Then tell me.

522
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,580
My face is hot now.

523
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,510
My body temperature is rising.

524
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,360
And my heart is pumping.

525
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,040
But I'm not sick.

526
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,520
What else could it be?

527
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,900
[Video Club]

528
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,580
Do you really know

529
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,970
how to use it this time?

530
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,520
Of course.

531
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,410
I've been studying this camera for a long time.

532
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,970
In today's club activity,

533
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,940
my photos will definitely get a high score.

534
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,790
Hey.

535
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,260
With him in the activity,

536
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,220
are you sure of this?

537
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,580
Then...

538
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,420
I'll get the second highest score.

539
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,570
It's almost sunset.

540
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,960
The senior schoolmates asked us to go to the venue.

541
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,140
Let's go.

542
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,810
Let's go.

543
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,580
Hey, Tiantian.

544
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,060
The teacher said we should form a study group and help each other.

545
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,900
Have you found a partner?

546
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,750
You and me.

547
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,030
Can we help each other?

548
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,300
I'm going to find the English class representative.

549
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,260
You...

550
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,010
You could ask Zhou Yubei.

551
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,270
What?

552
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,230
OK.

553
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,190
You'd better team up with others.

554
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,580
I heard many people were looking for you.

555
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,800
Why would you in my team?

556
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,410
The teacher wants to improve the average grades of our class.

557
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,390
Your score is very important.

558
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,370
You do it because the teacher said so?

559
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,470
If you are with others, its called mutual help.

560
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,110
If you are with me, you will be alleviating poverty.

561
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,900
♫I haven't written to others since October♫

562
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,580
You can say no.

563
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,670
The teacher didn't ask for it.

564
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,450
I did.

565
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,890
♫I'm just a little composer♫

566
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,300
Teaming up with you.

567
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:47,970
What?

568
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,030
I can't help you with anything.

569
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,660
♫Never mind these bad things and put them in the corner♫

570
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,550
No one can help me.

571
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,860
But teaming up with you,

572
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,810
♫Just think about what it's worth♫

573
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,710
it feels good.

574
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,870
Oh.

575
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:06,000
♫Focus on the things that will make you feel better♫

576
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:03,930
Gosh.

577
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,820
There's nothing to hesitate about.

578
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,580
The lighting is great now.

579
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,900
♫It will make you happier♫

580
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,380
Let me take a photo for you.

581
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,320
You...

582
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:16,870
♫I've been thinking about you lately♫

583
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,900
You've been filming for so long.

584
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,650
Come and join us.

585
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,990
♫You know I'm happy to hear you talk and you are happy to share♫

586
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,200
Zhou Yubei, smile.

587
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:27,370
♫The way you look at me I can't help getting close to you♫

588
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,980
Come closer.

589
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,530
Come closer.

590
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,750
♫No one loves you as much as I do♫

591
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,260
One.

00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,100
Two.

593
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,020
Three.

594
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,540
Hello.

595
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,380
Sister-in-law.

596
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:46,680
Sister-in-law.

597
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,320
What are you waiting for?

598
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,830
Ziqian's girlfriend. Call her sister-in-law.

599
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,260
Hello.

600
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,370
Hello.

601
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,080
Zhou Yubei.

602
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,010
No way.

603
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,480
I left one question to finish.

604
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,410
You chased me here?

605
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,500
I came to watch the game.

606
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,220
Oh.

607
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,940
Right.

608
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,450
It's your brother's game.

609
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,770
What are you looking for?

610
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:25,990
I…

611
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,420
I'm looking for Miss Ji.

612
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,110
Hey.

613
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,950
Miss Ji.

614
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,790
Rongrong.

615
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,380
Tiantian.

616
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,180
Yubei.

617
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:34,980
Sister-in-law.

618
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,160
Tiantian is here too?

619
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:38,970
Hey.

620
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,450
Is Fu really not coming?

621
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,590
He said he couldn't come because he's having a client.

622
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,650
It's okay. There's a live stream.

623
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,620
Sister-in-law,

624
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,840
Our coach said

625
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,730
everyone can bear without a seat but you.

626
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,460
You must sit in a position where everyone can see you.

627
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,210
Yes.

628
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,350
Why?

629
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,110
When others play,

630
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,750
their girlfriends can't come to watch the game.

631
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,390
Because it will easily affect their performance.

632
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,860
But Ziqian is different.

633
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,820
When you come,

634
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,170
he performs better.

635
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,390
Great!

636
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,370
Why haven't they entered yet?

637
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,670
It should take a while.

638
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,100
You look good today.

639
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,990
Not bad.

640
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,510
I remember when you first came to Jiangyi,

641
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,770
you said you came to get the championship.

642
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,910
There are two types of people

643
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,700
who would say that.

644
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:30,500
The first type is

645
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,930
the beginners

646
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,480
who have never learned lessons from experiences.

647
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,490
The other is

648
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,090
those who experienced too much

649
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,260
with clear goals.

650
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,400
You are the latter.

651
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,530
So I admire you.

652
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,340
You always know what you want.

653
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,560
I didn't know before.

654
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,380
But a friend

655
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
helped me figure it out.

656
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,650
You...

657
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,250
You like Song Rongrong?

658
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,240
I should have guessed this.

659
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,200
You should have told me earlier.

660
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,590
Zhou Ziqian and I would have helped you.

661
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,370
After this competition,

662
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,010
I'll find a chance

663
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,100
to tell her myself.

664
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,050
It's almost time.

665
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,530
Come on.

666
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,670
Come on.

667
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,340
Now you are wathching the men's 10-meter-air-rifle competition

668
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,890
of the National Shooting Championships.

669
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,980
The test is over and

670
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,790
the official competition will begin soon.

671
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,280
The contestants entering the finals are

672
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,370
Target No. 1,

673
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,430
Ye Siyuan from Anyang.

674
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,530
He ranks the 4th

675
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,490
with 584 points in the preliminary.

676

♫Life comes up, life comes down♫

677
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,480
Target No. 2, Zhou Ziqian from Jiangyi.

678
