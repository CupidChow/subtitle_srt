5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,970
Zhou Yubei is so good at volleyball.

6
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,390
Come on, Zhou Yubei!

7
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,290
Come on!

8
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,390
Zhou Yubei.

9
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,200
Tiantian.

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,120
They are all freshmen, right?

11
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,150
Obviously, they've never seen the world.

12
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,020
If they've seen better athletes

13
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,980
like we did,

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,640
they wouldn't have been so excited.

15
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,660
Who are you talking about?

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,590
Zhou Ziqian.

17
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,620
Right.

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,910
We should have befriended Zhou Yubei.

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,120
In that case,

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,940
we could have the chance to watch Zhou Ziqian's game, right?

21
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,920
Good idea.

22
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,410
Zhou Yubei, come on! Zhou Yubei, you are the best!

23
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,720
Zhou Yubei, come on!

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,759
Is her head hit by a ball?

25
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,910
Zhou Yubei, come on! Zhou Yubei, come on!

26
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,090
Hey, Yubei.

27
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,130
Don't be tricked by her.

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,229
She must have something bad planned.

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,240
How could she cheer for you?

30
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,720
Impossible.

31
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,950
Yubei,

32
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,880
aren't you going to team up with me?

33
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,530
Tiantian, you're trying so hard.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,190
It's worth it, for the game.

35
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,700
How about we buy sunglasses later?

36
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,350
Okay.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,930
Is there any style you want?

38
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,380
Something cute.

39
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,300
Zhou Ziqian.

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,970
You can recognize me even like this?

41
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,760
It's so obvious.

42
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,940
Are you

43
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,910
cosplaying?

44
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,630
I'm just trying to cover up a little.

45
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,220
I'm a public figure now.

46
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,340
It would be bad if I cause a stir in the society.

47
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,050
Why do I feel like

48
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,300
I've seen you a lot these days?

49
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,200
Don't tell me this is a coincidence.

50
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,980
I'm here because Rongrong asked me to.

51
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,090
I have a rightful reason.

52
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,450
I called him here.

53
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,250
Well, I was just about to talk to you.

54
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,500
Your variety show is doing well lately.

55
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,780
It has made shooting quite popular.

56
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,080
By the recommendation of the shooting team,

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,690
our magazine has decided to interview Xu Wang for the next episode.

58
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,020
This is work.

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,430
I thought I should buy him some suitable clothes.

60
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,720
A girl and a boy.

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,120
You can give me advice.

62
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,450
You are asking him for outfit advice?

63
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,820
I think you should forget it.

64
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,640
He has very bad taste.

65
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,930
My taste is not bad, okay?

66
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,680
All right, everyone, there's one last round.

67
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,120
You can team up freely and play.

68
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,490
OK.

69
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,329
Hey.

70
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:38,370
We're already a team.

71
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,660
What are you looking at, Tiantian?

72
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,910
I think the first step to get along

73
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,450
is to start with being teammates.

74
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,010
Zhou Yubei.

75
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,590
Team up with me.

76
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:51,850
Okay.

77
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,460
Fu Tian is the worst volleyball player in our class.

78
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,240
Why don't we choose someone else?

79
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,330
You can also choose to have two new teammates.

80
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,140
Now that I've thought about it, she seems pretty decent.

81
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,360
We won't change then.

82
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,209
Don't worry.

83
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,200
I'll protect you from behind.

84
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,640
No. I'm too tired to play anymore.

85
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,790
Zhou Yubei. The ball!

86
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,980
Watch out!

87
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,240
Are you okay?

88
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,340
I'm fine.

89
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,840
I just...

90
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,150
Come on, gather up.

91
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,880
Have you all warmed up?

92
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,620
The exam starts now.

93
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,450
It's serious.

94
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,530
I think...

95
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,800
This is an internal injury.

96
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,530
Not to mention the exam,

97
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,770
I can't even walk.

98
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,520
What happened?

99
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,150
Sir.

100
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,030
Fu Tian might have hurt her leg.

101
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,380
Can I take her to the infirmary first?

102
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,800
Okay.

103
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,320
Go ahead.

104
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,160
Tell me if you need anything.

105
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,690
OK. Classmates.

106
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,110
Come up.

107
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,110
What?

108
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,790
You will carry me?

109
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,460
You said you couldn't walk, didn't you?

110
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,210
Oh.

111
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,540
You want to carry me yourself.

112
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,840
Let's go.

113
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,550
Come here. Gather around.

114
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,730
It's okay to walk more slowly.

115
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,530
♫I want to spend every summer with you♫

116
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,180
Your legs hurt, right?

117
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,910
I just don't want you to be tired.

118
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,730
♫I want to kiss your face under the sunset♫

119
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,320
They don't hurt that badly.

120
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,730
♫I like to see you in a daze♫

121
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,910
I think you're good at carrying people.

122
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,020
♫It's the most special dependence♫

123
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,870
You carry me much better than my brother did.

124
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,880
♫My promise to you will never be changed♫

125
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,010
When I was little,

126
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,630
♫I want to take a walk with you when flowers bloom♫

127
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,120
I had to cling to him myself when he carried me on his back.

128
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,990
♫I want to hold your sleeves and sit by the sea♫

129
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,780
He didn't like how I constricted his neck.

130
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,030
I didn't like how he carried me. So uncomfortable.

131
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,520
♫The wind blows your skirt and it starts dancing♫

132
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,480
Did your brother carry you on his back when you were little?

133
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,580
♫You are my only one. I just want to be with you♫

134
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,270
Does he like raising kids?

135
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,520
Not really a little kid.

136
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,480
♫The secret in the fragrance of flowers♫

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,990
But a 204-month-old kid.

138
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,200
♫How poetic this moment is♫

139
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,740
You talk so much.

140
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,980
When did he start practicing shooting?

141
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,659
Come on. Tell me.

142
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,120
Rongrong.

143
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,400
What do you think?

144
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,370
Pretty.

145
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,200
What about me?

146
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:07,750
You are pretty too.

147
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,100
Is it pretty?

148
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,100
Yes.

149
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,910
What about mine?

150
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,590
It's pretty.

151
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,800
You didn't even look.

152
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,110
Hello.

153
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,200
Hello, sir.

154
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:32,970
Yes.

155
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,020
I'm Zhou Yubei's brother.

156
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,800
He hit a girl in his class?

157
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,380
Please go on.

158
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,800
Her name's Fu Tian, right?

159
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,620
Her contact information...

160
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,300
Okay, I'll read the message right away.

161
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,310
Okay, thank you.

162
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,370
Tiantian.

163
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,370
Do you...

164
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,520
Know her?

165
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,490
So,

166
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,480
my brother and Fu Qile's sister are classmates.

167
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,130
And my brother hit his sister.

168
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,120
It seems to be the case.

169
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,360
I just called Tiantian and asked her.

170
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,460
She said she's fine.

171
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,620
She just didn't want to take the exam.

172
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,560
Weren't we also like this when we were that age?

173
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,610
Although I know Fu Qile very well now,

174
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,550
business is business.

175
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,610
Besides,

176
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,730
as a public figure,

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,430
my brother hit someone.

178
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,770
I should bring some fruits to visit her.

179
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,640
By the way, do you know Fu Qile's address?

180
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,910
Yes, I do.

181
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,720
But you seem

182
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,770
very happy.

183
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,550
No.

184
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,800
No way.

185
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,020
This is the normal nervousness before visiting others.

186
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,580
Is his house big?

187
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,909
Is everything in his house

188
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:47,840
clean and tidy since he's a teacher?

189
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,190
No.

190
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,909
He has a sister.

191
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,420
Is his house pink?

192
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,020
Why do I feel

193
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,730
you are so curious about him?

194
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:58,800
No.

195
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,470
I'm not.

196
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,120
What does he usually do at home?

197
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,870
Meditate?

198
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,360
Does he quarrel with his sister?

199
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,130
Do they fight?

200
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,200
Your teacher just called me

201
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,070
and said you were tripped by a classmate at school.

202
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,710
You hit your head?

203
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,770
I faked it.

204
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,250
I didn't want to take the exam.

205
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,680
Besides, Zhou Yubei was trying to block the ball for me.

206
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,590
That's why he hit me.

207
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,300
He didn't mean it.

208
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,290
Zhou Yubei?

209
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,230
Yes.

210
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,990
Zhou Ziqian's brother.

211
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,299
Can you

212
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,230
sit a little bit more appropriately?

213
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,120
Come on, brother.

214
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm already tired after sitting at school all day.

215
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,510
There's no one else at home.

216
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,490
Let me lie down for a while.

217
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,810
Coming.

218
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,230
Hello, Mr. Fu.

219
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,540
Sorry, wrong person.

220
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,660
Can you finish wiping the ice cream on your face,

221
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,070
changing out of your pajamas,

222
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,820
and washing your bangs

223
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,840
in five minutes?

224
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,710
I can't help you then.

225
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,230
Come in.

226
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,550
Who is it? It's so late.

227
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,770
Hello.

228
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,990
Ah.

229
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,950
Your sister...

230
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,900
She...

231
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,350
She's shy of strangers.

232
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,450
She's always like this when she meets someone she doesn't know.

233
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,940
Don't mind her.

234
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,590
Introverted.

235
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,410
This is my brother.

236
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,380
Doesn't he look exactly like me?

237
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,550
Hello.

238
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,090
Hello.

239
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:53,770
Have a seat.

240
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,250
Why isn't your house pink?

241
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,540
What?

242
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,540
Well...

243
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,500
Gosh.

244
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,910
Why do we have guests all of a sudden?

245
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:09,880
Well...

246
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,300
Hello.

247
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,820
Tiantian.

248
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,730
We didn't

249
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,160
lose our memory.

250
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,340
Brother.

251
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,750
What are you talking about?

252
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,550
You really like to joke.

253
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:33,940
Well,

254
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,620
Yubei told me

255
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,230
he accidentally hit you today.

256
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:37,650
Oh.

257
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,550
It's okay.

258
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,220
I've forgiven him.

259
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,190
I'm a generous person.

260
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,780
I never care about these trivial matters.

261
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,230
Mr. Zhou.

262
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,410
Do you remember me?

263
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,490
We met at school.

264
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,260
Oh...

265
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,840
Oh, right.

266
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,760
You're the classmate who's quite close with Yubei, right?

267
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,630
Close?

268
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,350
No, no, no.

269
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,570
Well,

270
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,670
I... I never draw much attention

271
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,860
at school.

272
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,200
Tiantian.

273
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,210
Fu Tian.

274
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,620
You guys talk.

275
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,380
I need to wash my hands.

276
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,860
Where is the bathroom?

277
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,380
Over there.

278
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,450
This...

279
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,520
Why is there my poster on her wall?

280
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,090
Yubei,

281
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,600
let's go home.

282
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,470
Do you need help?

283
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,960
Listen. I can explain.

284
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,870
Oh no.

285
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,590
In other words,

286
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,070
your sister is my fan.

287
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,110
Your sister is my fan?

288
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,960
Your sister is my fan.

289
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,800
In biology,

290
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,760
we are independent individuals.

291
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,080
Don't involve the brother into his sister's matters.

292
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,630
But in geography,

293
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,800
you live together.

294
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,950
You call this geography?

295
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,800
Wow.

296
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,050
Amazing.

297
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,510
You know geography?

298
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,920
A little.

299
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,950
A little.

300
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,160
Wow.

301
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,510
Your English is good too.

302
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,410
I've been studying shooting recently.

303
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,480
But I think it's so hard.

304
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,550
Why are you so good at everything?

305
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,370
It mainly depends on talent.

306
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,340
I wish you were my brother.

307
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,380
I have a suggestion.

308
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,980
I think your brother doesn't exercise enough.

309
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,230
I'll call his coach later.

310
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,200
He might be back late in the future.

311
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,320
Do you mind?

312
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,250
No.

313
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,890
I have a suggestion too.

314
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,160
Fu Tian has too little homework.

315
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,960
You're right.

316
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,730
The suggestion is valid and accepted.

317
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,240
Do you feel cold behind your back?

318
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,880
Is the air conditioner's temperature set too low?

319
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,160
I think so.

320
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,550
Your classmate

321
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,950
isn't like her brother at all.

322
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,980
She's quite cute.

323
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Don't you think she's noisy?

324
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,580
No.

325
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,980
She talks a lot.

326
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,770
Not really.

327
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,430
She likes sleeping in class.

328
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,570
She's growing.

329
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,670
Do you hate her that much?

330
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,360
No.

331
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,300
I'll go out for recording in a few days.

332
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,270
If you're lonely at home,

333
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,960
ask your classmates to come over and play.

334
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,000
Fu Tian seems to be

335
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,320
good at livening up the atmosphere.

336
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,200
What do you think?

337
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,410
I think Miss Ji is good at livening up the atmosphere too.

338
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,680
Why have you never

339
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,610
invited her to our house?

340
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,160
You weren't there when she came.

341
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,380
I mean you weren't there when she came to work.

342
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,120
I didn't say anything.

343
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,600
Miss Ji.

344
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,940
I've confirmed with the guests.

345
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,280
Other guests are not in Jiangyi.

346
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,340
They will set off to the recording site themselves.

347
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,490
Mr. Fu and Mr. Zhou will come with us.

348
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,120
OK.

349
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,850
What is she watching?

350
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,620
Eighty out of 100,

351
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,210
she's watching Zhou Ziqian.

352
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,010
Zhou Ziqian.

353
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,030
Miss Ji.

354
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,470
Zhou Ziqian is so handsome.

355
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,490
Watching his game

356
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,990
is totally a visual enjoyment.

357
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,130
Hey.

358
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,880
Should we add a part of shooting?

359
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,680
Didn't you like Xiao Chen the most?

360
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:17,860
Alas.

361
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,700
I suddenly realized

362
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,270
men who focus on their career are the most handsome.

363
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,950
I've got everything ready

364
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,750
for the recording tomorrow.

365
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,090
Just in case,

366
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,740
I'll check it again.

367
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,090
The premise is

368
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,850
you have to be Zhou Ziqian.

369
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:40,900
By the way,

370
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,230
Miss Ji.

371
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,200
Our program has good reviews recently.

372
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,380
Although our city has always been famous for shooting,

373
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,840
no one really paid attention to it.

374
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Since our show was aired,

375
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,550
shooting suddenly became popular.

376
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,730
Fu Qile told me that the college is also considering starting shooting classes.

377
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,620
It seems to be true.

378
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,980
We have to sign Zhou Ziqian for the second season.

379
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,470
Otherwise, he will become more expensive.

380
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,500
That makes sense.

381
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,600
Miss Ji,

382
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,670
is there any other handsome guy in the shooting team besides Zhou Ziqian?

383
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,790
Like this?

384
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:11,840
Okay.

385
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,840
Do we really need to shoot every spot?

386
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,950
Yes.

387
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,070
We need to know the life of shooting athletes.

388
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,790
So we need to be fully prepared before the interview.

389
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,090
OK.

390
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,290
I don't know about it.

391
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,030
I'll listen to you.

392
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,410
I'll take you wherever you want to go.

393
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,500
Okay.

394
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,200
Rongrong.

395
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,090
You're here again.

396
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,080
What did you bring this time?

397
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,030
I'm here to work this time.

398
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,100
It's serious.

399
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,630
Where are we going next?

400
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,870
♫I haven't written to others since October♫

401
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,030
This is your dorm?

402
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,840
Can I film it?

403
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,530
Yes.

404
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,760
I've talked to Gao Yuan.

405
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,850
♫I'm just a little composer♫

406
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,619
♫Never mind these bad things and put them in the corner♫

407
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,780
♫Just think about what it's worth♫

408
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,819
You really raised it well.

409
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,440
Mine is very thin.

410
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,960
♫Focus on the things that will make you feel better♫

411
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,450
I didn't abuse it.

412
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,760
When I don't have time,

413
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,890
Gao Yuan helps me take care of it.

414
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,859
♫It will make you happier♫

415
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,200
Gao Yuan?

416
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,160
Don't let him touch it.

417
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,890
He raised several cactuses to death in junior high

418
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:26,839
♫I've been thinking about you lately♫

419
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,200
because he watered them eight times a day.

420
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,950
♫You know I'm happy to hear you talk and you are happy to share♫

421
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,070
Why do you remember all that?

422
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,490
Because those were my cactuses.

423
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:37,340
♫The way you look at me I can't help getting close to you♫

424
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,720
♫No one loves you as much as I do♫

425
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,840
You bought this book too?

426
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,190
I think it's pretty good.

427
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,260
So I bought one for myself.

428
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,980
Look wherever you want.

429
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,440
I found that you have many books that I have.

430
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,270
What is this?

431
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,090
I'm back.

432
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,930
Put it down.

433
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,690
Well,

434
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,980
about the magazine...

435
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,620
I can explain.

436
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,020
Okay.

437
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,160
Explain it.

438
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,090
Well,

439
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,000
my friend left it here.

440
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,110
He asked me to keep it for two days.

441
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,380
It's not mine.

442
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,590
Really?

443
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,290
But

444
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,270
it's inappropriate.

445
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,820
Well...

446
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,800
Actually,

447
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,910
it's quite common.

448
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,770
No.

449
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,840
Our magazine is not like this.

450
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,840
Do you read it?

451
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:40,900
No.

452
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,760
Xu Wang.

453
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,120
You were reading it the other day.

454
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:43,920
Yeah.

455
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,200
I believe you didn't read it.

456
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,560
I...

457
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,730
Don't try to drag others into this.

458
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,740
Listen.

459
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,630
I've filmed it all.

460
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,200
After I go back,

461
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,840
I'll write that some shooting athlete

462
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,950
reads inappropriate books in the dorm

463
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,210
and tries to mislead his

464
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,170
unparalleled,

465
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:01,750
smart,

466
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,810
and talented,

467
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,690
pure roommate.

468
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,470
Hey.

469
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,280
That's too much.

470
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,750
There are so many adjectives for him.

471
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,870
I'm just "someone"?

472
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,300
Hello?

473
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,440
We need to gather with them.

474
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,440
I'll go with you then.

475
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,540
I'm going back.

476
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,210
Okay.

477
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:17,930
Let's go.

478
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,500
In a month,

479
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,840
the National Shooting Championships will begin.

480
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,770
Our training plan

481
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,700
needs to be adjusted once more.

482
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,590
Especially Zhou Ziqian.

483
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,020
after the variety show recording is over in a few days,

484
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,340
you need to focus on getting ready.

485
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,190
Got it.

486
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,060
Besides,

487
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,200
the official match date

488
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,840
has been set on November 22th.

489
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,900
I hope you all know it.

490
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,220
Are you clear?

491
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,220
Yes.

492
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,880
If there's no problem,

493
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,810
go practice.

494
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,440
Does the 22th sound familiar to you?

495
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,030
22th...

496
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,950
We talked about this.

497
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,230
About his parents.

498
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,660
It happened on November 22th.

499
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,830
Oh.

500
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,380
What a coincidence.

501
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,220
Do you think on that day

502
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,220
he will...

503
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,620
Beat you up?

504
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,300
Is it really okay to talk about others' parents?

505
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,450
What does it have to do with you?

506
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,700
We don't have time to argue with you.

507
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,020
But some people just can't understand unless it's pointed out.

508
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,860
What do you mean?

509
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,640
Behave yourselves for the time being.

510
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,570
Don't make trouble.

511
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,430
Of course,

512
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,390
you can do it the other way around.

513
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,110
We can also

514
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,700
provide you with the report and accusation service,

515
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,770
plus suspension.

516
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,680
And get another suspension free.

517
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:31,710
Hey.

518
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,590
Was I handsome just now?

519
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,700
Not as handsome as me.

520
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,780
Humph.

521
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:48,620
Hey.

522
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:49,880
Are you going to

523
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,080
shoot the variety show tomorrow?

524
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,870
What's up?

525
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,700
Will Miss Cheng go with you?

526
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,120
Are you excited?

527
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,390
You have to seize the chance.

528
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,540
If you need it,

529
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,580
I can go give Miss Cheng a hint for you.

530
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,050
So shy.

531
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:10,980
Won't even let me talk about it.

532
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,800
That's more like it.

533
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,730
Making progress.

534
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,800
You want to practice for one more hour?

535
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,500
Sure.

536
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,620
What?

537
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,850
You can come to me directly for such trivial matters in the future.

538
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,690
Don't be shy.

539
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,810
It's okay.

540
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,730
Go.

541
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,450
OK.

542
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,630
I just talked to Miss Cheng for a while this afternoon.

543
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,740
He's jealous?

544
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:49,950
It seems that he really likes her.

545
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,770
No.

546
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,900
I have to help him.

547
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,160
Ji Qiu.

548
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,150
Where is Miss Cheng?

549
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,290
Isn't she with you?

550
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,200
Oh.

551
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,300
Miss Cheng went back to get something.

552
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,000
She'll be here soon.

553
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,680
Let's go upstairs first.

554
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,450
Okay.

555
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,890
Hey.

556
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,690
Leave the box to me.

557
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,900
Don't worry about

558
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,310
us back home.

559
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,720
I'm here.

560
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,820
You even started acting.

561
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,500
Miss Ji.

562
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,410
I have something that

563
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,020
I need your help with.

564
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,090
What is it?

565
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,230
You don't know it, do you?

566
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,190
Zhou Ziqian

567
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,200
likes Miss Cheng of our team.

568
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,300
But he is shy.

569
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,230
He never told her.

570
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,880
During the recording this time,

571
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,620
I was thinking,

572
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,300
Miss Ji,

573
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,580
can you seek a chance

574
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,950
to create some private space for them?

575
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,550
I think it will work.

576
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,370
Okay.

577
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,620
No problem.

578
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,620
Thank you.

579
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,680
Hey, Miss Ji.

580
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,560
Miss Ji.

581
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:16,770
Miss Cheng.

582
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,230
Why are you...

583
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,680
Over here.

584
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,250
The seat is vacant.

585
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:26,910
Here.

586
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,820
Thank you.

587
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,230
You're welcome.

588
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,120
What?

589
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,160
Don't worry.

590
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,660
What?

591
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,580
Don't worry about what?

592
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,690
You haven't confessed your love yet.

593
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,400
I told Miss Ji that you like Cheng Jia.

594
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,020
I...

595
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,830
I asked her to give you two some privacy.

596
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,950
You have to seize the chance, okay?

597
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,240
Okay?

598
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,590
You...

599
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,410
Why are you so courteous?

600
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,030
You're welcome.

601
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,880
It's nothing.

602
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,340
What?

603
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,590
That's all I can do for you as your friend.

604
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:49,760
Alright.

605
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,300
The car is leaving.

606
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,370
I'm leaving. Bye.

607
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,650
Hey.

608
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,500
Where can you find

609
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,790
such a good friend like me?

610
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,640
You can sleep if you're tired.

611
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,090
It's only been a while.

612
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,520
If you're bored,

613
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,200
play with this.

614
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,620
I took it from Tiantian.

615
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,550
Does Tiantian know that you have

616
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,550
all the stuff she left behind once in a while?

617
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,880
How can I play this?

618
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:44,970
Look.

619
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,690
How should I explain it?

620
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,020
What are you talking about, looking so happy?

621
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,550
What?

622
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,870
Me?

623
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm happy to sit with you.

624
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,790
I like this one.

625
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,830
This one is tall.

626
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,210
I like tall ones.

627
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,090
I think the little one is cuter.

628
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,490
What are you talking about?

629
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,110
What?

630
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,980
Nothing.

631
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,780
He's bored.

632
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,110
He insisted on asking me about my type.

633
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,110
Hey.

634
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,950
Mr. Zhou.

635
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,710
What's your type?

636
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,480
I like long hair.

637
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,340
Long hair.

638
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't like short hair.

639
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,380
Actually,

640
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,340
you don't have to shout.

641
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,540
We can hear you.

642
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,520
Okay.

643
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,770
I also like someone older than me.

644
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,380
I happen to be one year older than you.

645
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,060
What?

646
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,550
I like tall girls.

647
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,870
Do you think I'm tall?

648
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,230
Why does Zhou Ziqian have to show it off?

649
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,000
What's wrong?

650
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,380
Are you tired?

651
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,740
Yes. In my heart.

652
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,340
Hello?

653
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,770
Oh, you're here.

654
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,010
Okay, I'll pick you up.

655
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,310
Oh.

656
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,340
It's basically what I listed out for you.

657
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,230
I haven't sorted out the details of the interview.

658
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,420
But don't worry.

659
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,980
Just simple questions.

660
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,450
I've never heard you talk about your job before.

661
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,290
My job

662
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,100
is quite boring compared to Qiu and Fu's job.

663
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,840
I think it's fun.

664
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,300
But others may not think so.

665
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,500
So I don't talk about it much.

666
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,360
Tell me.

667
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,980
Let me tell you something interesting.

668
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,180
We once interviewed a popular actress.

669
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,230
She gave her cat a name that's very similar to a human's name.

670
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,260
She kept mentioning it during the interview.

671
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,090
We all thought she was exposing her relationship

672
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,260
and we were so excited.

673
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,770
Later we found out that we made a big mistake.

674
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,130
Isn't it interesting?

675
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,240
Really?

676
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,740
I'll write it down if there's anything interesting.

677
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,950
When you're bored,

678
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,810
I'll tell you the stories in a package.

679
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:49,740
Okay.

680
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,840
By the way,

681
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,300
I've never heard you talk about your past.

682
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,410
Was it not fun?

683
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,580
Maybe I have a bad memory.

684
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,200
I can't remember those interesting things.

685
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,620
It's okay.

686
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,530
I have a good memory. I remember everything.

687
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,210
Call me if you're bored.

688
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,090
It's almost time. I'll see you off.

689
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,730
No need.

690
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,320
I know the way.

691
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,250
Bye.

692
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,340
Oh.

693
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,620
I didn't see it.

694
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,480
Wow.

695
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,840
Why are you so serious?

696
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,550
Didn't you smile happily

697
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,810
with your girlfriend just now?

698
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,840
Everyone is guessing

699
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,020
what happened to you lately.

700
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,550
Turns out you are in a relationship.

701
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,900
Do you dislike me?

702
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,160
So you know.

703
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,950
I'll try my best

704
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,380
to make you dislike me more.

705
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,500
Given your current condition?

706
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,790
You can't even get the ranking for competition in the team assessment.

707
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:07,740
Fine.

708
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,460
Just for a few days.

709
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,560
I can bear with it.

710
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,120
You will be too ashamed to stay here

711
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,610
when you can't get any place in the competition, right?

712
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,070
Today is finally over.

713
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,660
Ye Qiao asked me just now

714
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,520
if there are activities like bungee jumping later.

715
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,090
I think if I said yes,

716
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,770
I would be assassinated at any time.

717
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,980
But today's content was quite good.

718
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,400
In order to prevent Lin Xiao from being afraid, Xiao Chen asked to switch to the front.

719
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,740
I didn't expect that.

720
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,730
When Xiao Chen's video is aired,

721
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,220
many people will become his fans.

722
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,160
After all,

723
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,450
who doesn't like a little angel?

724
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,800
I wonder if you saw it.

725
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,660
Miss Cheng was so worried

726
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,380
when Mr. Zhou was bungee jumping.

727
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,300
She kept pinching me. My skin almost turned purple.

728
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,370
People might think she's his girlfriend.

729
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,560
Hey, Miss Ji.

730
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,340
Did you see that?

731
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,810
No.

732
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,550
It's normal for them

733
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,870
to be in a relationship, right?

734
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,750
But you've always kept an eye on Miss Cheng.

735
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,060
Have you sorted out your records?

736
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,630
♫I've thought about it many times♫

737
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,860
I'll sort it out right away.

738
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,360
♫I have thrown away this charming and empty thing in vain♫

739
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,790
♫I pick up the pen and only remember your wish♫

740
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,360
Let me help you.

741
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,360
♫But my mother said boys can't be too sweet♫

742
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,230
No need.

743
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,750
You just lost the game and were punished to carry things.

744
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,880
It's not heavy.

745
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,860
♫I want to experience so many things with you♫

746
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,910
Ji Qiu.

747
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,500
Let me help you.

748
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,170
I won today.

749
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,890
Don't bother.

750
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,800
♫I wish I could have all the good and bad sides of you♫

751
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,640
You must be careful with your hands, Mr. Zhou.

752
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,380
♫I hope we can be the only light♫

753
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,910
Mr. Zhou.

754
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:41,150
♫That we can see in each other's eyes♫

755
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,030
Let's go.

756
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,510
♫I'll learn to be a fool♫

757
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,630
♫Learn to be soft-hearted even if you turn a blind eye♫

758
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,660
She almost didn't talk to me for a whole day.

759
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,340
Did something happen?

760
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,900
♫Clumsy with words but brave for you♫

761
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,480
♫Plain and daily but romantic for life♫

762
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,330
Coming.

763
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,620
Ji Qiu.

764
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,250
Well,

765
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,290
this is the equipment for tomorrow's recording.

766
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,550
You can shoot some videos during the recording.

767
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,480
Anything?

768
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,550
Anything.

769
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,460
You can shoot the scenary.

770
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,820
As long as it's beautiful.

771
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,840
It's quite clear.

772
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,490
Why don't you come in first?

773
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,300
Have you had dinner?

774
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,370
I bought some food.

775
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,160
I have to send DV to others.

776
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
I don't have much time.

777
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,850
I'm not coming in.

778
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,810
Aren't you going to teach me how to use it?

779
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,590
I thought you used it well.

780
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,550
I'll get going.

781
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,590
Okay.

782
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,340
Okay.

783
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,320
Have you decided to come in and eat?

784
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,020
Eat what?

785
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,610
You knew I was coming?

786
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,480
No, I didn't.

787
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,410
What is it?

788
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,050
Oh.

789
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,220
I'm here to check the physical training schedule for tomorrow's recording.

790
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,900
Let's talk inside.

791
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,060
No.

792
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,470
It's inappropriate.

793
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,380
If you need to talk,

794
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:41,910
we can go to the meeting room.

795
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,160
I don't mind.

796
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,510
But I do.

797
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,730
It's just about work.

798
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,230
Miss Cheng,

799
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,050
let's talk in the meeting room if it's work.

800
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,590
We are talking about my training plan.

801
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,770
It's work.

802
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,530
We were going to the meeting room.

803
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,650
Sorry to bother you.

804
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,660
Go on.

805
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,500
Meeting room.

806
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,210
What did you say

807
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,520
about physical training?

808
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,600
It's so far away.

809
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,230
Can you

810
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,190
hear me?

811
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,510
How about I come sit over?

812
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,620
This is okay.

813
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,090
It's good.

814
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,300
Isn't it good for you to stay in the gym?

815
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,660
You had to come here with me.

816
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,340
How troublesome.

817
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,850
Because I like you.

818
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,880
But I...

819
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,170
I don't like you.

820
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,560
Do you have someone you like?

821
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,120
Yes.

822
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,500
Kind of.

823
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,820
You like Miss Ji, right?

824
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,380
Is it that obvious?

825
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,870
It's okay.

826
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,540
I guessed it.

827
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,440
Well,

828
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,820
can I ask you out

829
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,659
after we go back to Jiangyi next week?

830
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,679
You already know that I like Ji Qiu,

831
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,040
but you are still asking me out?

832
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:24,860
Your feelings for Miss Ji

833
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,590
have nothing to do with how I feel about you.

834
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:27,840
Besides,

835
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,110
you are not a couple.

836
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:29,980
Also,

837
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,090
does Miss Ji

838
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,510
like you?

839
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,800
Gosh.

840
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,270
Hey.

841
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,370
What time is it now?

842
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,080
It's almost night.

843
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,550
Why are they pulling each other in front of the room?

844
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,280
If you say it's none of my business,

845
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,560
you're right.

846
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,170
But I'm worried...

847
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,580
I'm only worried that it'll be bad if people take pictures of it and post it online.

848
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,790
You're right.

849
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:06,750
That makes sense.

850
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,880
I have to talk to him next time.

851
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,390
What did you say, Yuan?

852
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,800
I just said that.

853
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,520
What?

854
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,840
I said everything.

855
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,070
With Zhou Ziqian's temperament,

856
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,750
if you want to wait for him to confess,

857
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,160
it will be years.

858
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,160
Instead of waiting for him to do it,

859
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,110
it's better to count on Miss Ji.

860
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:28,750
What?

861
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,250
Double seven.

862
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,620
But Ziqian didn't say it clearly that he likes Miss Cheng.

863
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,580
Yes.

864
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,300
Double eight.

865
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,090
What if we got it wrong?

866
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:38,880
That would be awkward.

867
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,620
How is that possible?

868
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,470
Think about it.

869
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,520
Some time ago,

870
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,050
didn't Zhou Ziqian smile like a fool from time to time?

871
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,910
-Yeah. -And he kept looking at his phone.

872
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,830
If he gets jealous,

873
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,740
it must be very obvious.

874
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,380
Everyone can see it.

875
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,220
Why?

876
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:51,900
Well.

877
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,590
Jealous?

878
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,450
What's the reaction of being jealous?

879
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,630
I can tell that you're inexperienced.

880
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,420
Come on.

881
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,350
I'll teach you a lesson today.

882
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,180
Otherwise,

883
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,250
when you are in a relationship,

884
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,890
you can't tell if your girlfriends are jealous.

885
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,550
Being jealous

886
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,400
is expressed in various ways, depending on the person.

887
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,360
When some people are jealous, you can't tell it at all.

888
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,120
Some people

889
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,980
will take a 180° turn

890
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,790
and become a totally different person.

891
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,020
The most direct expression

892
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,860
is irritation.

893
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,590
Being very irritated.

894
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,590
For those who are irritated when they are jealous,

895
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,740
the first thing they do is to

896
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,900
distract themselves with something else.

897
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,200
So annoying.

898
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,650
Get back to work.

899
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,660
But

900
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,240
it's basically useless.

901
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,630
I can't write.

902
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,730
What else?

903
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,620
And...

904
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,010
I haven't read about it yet.

905
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:52,910
What?

906
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,270
Read?

907
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:54,730
Yes.

908
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,020
Xu Wang bought a bunch of books again.

909
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,970
I read about it randomly.

910
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:58,840
Then I couldn't find it.

911
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,600
Hey.

912
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,480
By the way,

913
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,250
why isn't Xu Wang back yet?

914
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,880
Has he gone out?

915
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,640
I haven't seen him much

916
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,960
in the training field these days either.

917
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:10,790
Maybe

918
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,730
he's having additional training.

919
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,710
Double Q.

920
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,930
I only have one left. Be careful.

921
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,350
Hey, why are you so fast?

922
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,340
Because I'm good at this.

923
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,540
Yuan,

924
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,660
you're cheating again.

925
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,250
You lost, Yuan. Take the consequence.

926
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,880
You have the most cards left.

927
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,300
Give us your phone.

928
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,110
Hurry up.

929
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,480
Come on.

930
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,860
We agreed that

931
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,120
we'll send WeChat messages to a random person.

932
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,780
Fortunately, there are few people in my contact.

933
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,050
I know.

934
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,620
Hey.

935
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,030
How about

936
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,410
sending something to Ji Qiu?

937
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,920
Ask

938
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,200
how Ziqian is doing.

939
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,170
Did he confess his love?

940
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,380
Yes, I'm curious too.

941
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,850
Good idea.

942
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,340
Ji Qiu,

943
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,310
You saw it?

944
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,150
Yes.

945
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,660
You took the wrong one.

946
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,030
Your parents died because of you.

947
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,320
No matter whether there is season two,

948
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,130
whether we are here or not,

949
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,860
as long as they are together,

950
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,450
it'll be...

951
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,070
Let's Meet Now.

952
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,660
I think

953
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,050
you may want to be alone now.

954
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,450
I'll get going then.

955
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,110
Long time no see.

956
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,420
I almost forgot what you look like.

957
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,980
Now I remember.

958
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,710
Have we not seen each other for that long?

959
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,950
[Let's Meet Now]

960
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,990
Am I a plain Jane?
