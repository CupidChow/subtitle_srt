00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,160
♫I want to spend every summer with you♫

00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,640
♫I want to kiss your face under the sunset♫

7
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,240
♫I like to see you in a daze♫

8
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,960
♫It's the most special dependence♫

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,600
♫My promise to you will never be changed♫

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,160
♫I want to take a walk with you when flowers bloom♫

11
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,020
So amazing!

12
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,039
I suggest you go to the hospital

13
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,340
for a professional diagnosis.

14
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,390
Thank you, doctor.

15
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,200
Who's this guy?

16
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,130
He's just too good,

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,270
right?

18
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,789
He's not like your brother at all.

19
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,050
How can you compare my brother with him?

20
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,940
Compared me with whom?

21
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,800
Why did you come back so early today?

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,070
Well then, take a look with He.

23
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,410
I'm going to

24
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,100
put a psychological sand box here.

25
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,820
What do you think?

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,740
Pretty good.

27
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,510
Great.

28
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,670
Can you be a little more perfunctory?

29
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,350
Hey, brother.

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,200
Do you think it's too late

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,210
to learn shooting now?

32
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,190
Shooting?

33
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,540
I know how to shoot.

34
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,680
If I don't have work today,

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm going to watch the game.

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,829
Boss,

37
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,430
you know a lot about this?

38
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,200
I just play.

39
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,090
Of course

40
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,560
I can't compete with the pros.

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,350
Well,

42
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,790
do you know Zhou Ziqian?

43
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,650
Zhou Ziqian?

44
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,030
Bravo! Still 10.3 rounds.

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,120
Zhou Ziqian's next shot is very crucial.

46
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,170
If he wants to catch up,

47
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,180
he must shoot 10.6 rounds.

48
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,120
10.4 rounds.

49
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,760
Zhou Ziqian

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,730
shot 10.4 rounds on the last shot.

51
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,870
Congratulations on the second player, Zhu Yao,

52
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,650
for winning the men's 10 meter air pistol event

53
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,250
in the five provinces shooting league

54
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,770
with a total score of 242.7 rounds.

55
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,040
The first player, Zhou Ziqian,

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,060
won the second place by 0.1 round.

57
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,420
That's a pretty good score for a rookie.

58
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,990
Your treat, your treat.

59
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, okay, okay.

60
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,010
I can't believe he's on my friend's team.

61
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,310
Do you think I can get a picture with him?

62
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,310
He's looking over here.

63
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,400
Hello, Miss Ji.

64
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,060
Well done.

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,440
You're pretty good.

66
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,850
I thought you weren't gonna show up.

67
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,410
If I didn't show up, how would I know that

68
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,100
one minute ago you're new to the shooting gallery

69
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,490
and now you're on the field?

70
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,910
It was Ji Qiu who mistook me for a novice.

71
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,260
I just didn't get a chance to explain.

72
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,019
Are you sure?

73
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,850
Anyway, congratulations.

74
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,440
And thanks to you,

75
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,050
I can hang out with pros at my level.

76
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,900
Song Rongrong,

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,409
you're too late.

78
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,770
You didn't see how good I was.

79
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,380
You weren't even in the top five.

80
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,270
But today I didn't lose anything.

81
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,159
Hey, hey, hey.

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,290
Stop looking.

83
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,630
Ziqian,

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,150
it's getting late. Let's go.

85
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,280
Yuan!

86
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,180
Well, we're going to a victory party.

87
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,520
Just a few of us.

88
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,240
Are you guys going, too?

89
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,380
Can we?

90
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,550
I'd like to go.

91
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,510
I want to celebrate with my best friend.

92
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,560
He came in sixth.

93
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,530
Fifth.

94
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,220
Ah, fifth.

95
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,150
He had never had it before.

96
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,460
You don't look like you're celebrating my victory.

97
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,630
Let's go.

98
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,590
Cheers!

99
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,800
Congratulations!

100
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,900
Ziqian.

101
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,870
I hope you do well

102
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,210
in the next national championship game.

103
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,140
Yuan!

104
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,860
Do your best.

105
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,550
Stop laughing.

106
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,810
Why did you say that to me?

107
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,120
You brats.

108
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,880
Am I too nice to you?

109
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,400
You have no idea

110
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,080
what I'm capable of.

111
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,150
Cut the crap. Let's drink.

112
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,460
Is there something on my face?

113
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,890
No, no, no.

114
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,570
We're just a little curious.

115
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,130
Ji Qiu, what's your relationship

116
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,600
with Ziqian?

117
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,430
We are... friends.

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,620
We just met,

119
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,880
but it's better than you.

120
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,120
I hit it off with Ji Qiu.

121
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,920
I feel very close.

122
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,650
That goes too far.

123
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,750
By the way,

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,220
I heard from Ziqian that

125
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,820
you came especially to watch the game today.

126
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,250
Because the tickets were free.

127
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,170
In fact, we came especially to watch you.

128
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,680
You all played very well.

129
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,120
But we didn't play.

130
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,340
I'm actually kind of interested in shooting.

131
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,610
So as soon as I saw you,

132
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,000
I knew you were really good.

133
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,340
Ji Qiu is not only interested in shooting,

134
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,270
but she is also exceptionally good at it.

135
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,200
She taught me.

136
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,500
She's kind of my teacher.

137
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,640
Then you must be really good at that.

138
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,030
Hey, Ji Qiu.

139
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,120
Here's to you.

140
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,920
From now on,

141
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,930
you are my sister.

142
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,890
Oh,

143
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,900
no, no, no.

144
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,670
I mean, you shoot well

145
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,640
and you're pretty.

146
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,810
I wish you were my sister.

147
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,650
Right, right, right.

148
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,840
Ji Qiu, you're not only good-looking,

149
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,010
but also have a good skin.

150
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,570
Thank you.

151
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,460
Since you put it that way,

152
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,220
I have to drink it.

153
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,060
Come on.

154
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,340
Impressive!

155
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,760
You have a high tolerance.

156
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,060
Hey, Ji Qiu.

157
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,000
How long have you been learning to shoot?

158
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,680
More than two years.

159
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,850
Actually, I just...

160
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,370
Then you're a natural.

161
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,210
Come on, sister.

162
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,680
A toast to you.

163
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,190
I'm just interested in it.

164
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Here, Ziqian.

165
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,460
Excuse me.

166
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,550
Ji Qiu.

167
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,650
Ziqian, don't sit.

168
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,700
Switch places with me.

169
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,150
Come on, to Ji Qiu.

170
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,450
Cheers, cheers.

341
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,880
What a coincidence, Ji Qiu.

342
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,670
Are you here for Ziqian?

343
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,410
♫I have a special hobby♫

344
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,940
You guys go ahead.

345
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,520
♫I'd write a song when I miss you♫

346
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,810
We have to get going.

00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,079
Okay, we're leaving.

348

♫Maybe I speak without thinking♫

349

350
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,090
I'm leaving.

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,830

♫Give me a nameless ticket♫

353

You're not here to see me.

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,990

♫I've had a dream since I met you♫

358
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,840
Oh, I see.

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,120
♫In the dream I'm singing this song♫

360
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,460
Who are you looking for?

361
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,300
Maybe I know.

362
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,010
♫I'm singing in the galaxy and in the wind♫

363

Liang Chuan from the swimming team.

364

♫I dreamt of all the heart-pounding moments♫

365

366
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,930
is the training area of the swimming team.

367
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,890
♫How many times do I have to tell you this is not the point♫

368

♫The point is I'm in love with your face♫

369
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,900
Time's up. I should get going.

370
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,380

371
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,600
♫I like it warmer so I don't like winter♫

372

♫Given that you are by my side♫

374
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,840

378
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,670
Excuse me.

379
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,850
May I ask,

380
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,490
is Liang Chuan here?

381
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,380
Me?

382
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,740
Hello, Liang Chuan.

383
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,900
I'm Ji Qiu, the director of NT platform.

384
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,450
I'm here for a variety show.

385
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,280
I've contacted you before.

386
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,320
We had an appointment today.

387
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
Ji Qiu?

388
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,570
Hello, Miss Ji.

389
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,850
Just call me Ji Qiu.

390
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,160
You're a director?

391
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,620
Why are the directors so good-looking these days?

392
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,360
I just took a bath towel.

393
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,440
Why are you so nervous?

394
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,280
Or is that what you want to talk about?

395
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,620
Let's talk about work first.

396
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,280
This time we plan

397
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,630
an indoor puzzle program.

398
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,430
I don't know if you know anything

399
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,130
about variety shows before.

400
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,920
I can explain it to you.

401
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,300
Variety shows are about choosing the right stars

402
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,540
to be the permanent guests.

403
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,200
According to the setting of the program,

404
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,850
it brings a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere

405
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,950
to the audience.

406
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,080
Why did you stop talking?

407
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,070
I don't know if you heard

408
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,470
what I just said.

409
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,390
Yes.

410
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,430
I heard you.

411
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,110
But there're a lot of details that need to be discussed later.

412
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,470
I haven't finished training today.

413
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,680
And I don't like to keep girls waiting.

414
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,760
How about this?

415
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,550
I'll treat you to dinner alone sometime this evening.

416
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,350
Let's talk more about it.

417
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,340
Hey.

418
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,760
Why are you working so hard?

419
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,310
Don't we have races behind us?

420
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:25,950
You can't use your hand.

421
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,890
I can tell by the comparison.

422
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,030
No wonder Mr. Zhang has been hating me more than ever.

423
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,260
Maybe I'll be down in three minutes

424
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,300
when I play in the final.

425
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,630
What are you talking about?

426
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,710
Don't you know how I feel?

427
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,820
By the way,

428
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,160
is there a good swimmer named Liang Chuan in the swimming team?

429
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,560
Liang Chuan?

430
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,150
Oh.

431
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,030
He was the champion of the last swimming championships.

432
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,960
He was quite famous.

433
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,350
But I have to warn you.

434
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,790
Get away from him.

435
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,150
What's wrong with him?

436
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,590
You have no idea.

437
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,470
He's a good swimmer.

438
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,370
But his character

439
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,620
is so bad.

440
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,350
Why not?

441
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,380
No need for dinner.

442
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,040
Mr. Liang,

443
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,830
I'll talk to you some other time.

444
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,790
Sorry, my hands are wet.

445
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,950
Are you okay?

446
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,900
I'm fine.

447
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,960
Excuse me.

448
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,330
So you are Miss Ji's…

449
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,120
What do you think?

450
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,500
Okay, I got it.

451
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,630
I didn't do anything.

452
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,280
You could have pulled her up.

453
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,560
The water is not deep.

454
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,900
She fell in by herself.

455
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,250
You are...

456
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,400
Shooting team's

457
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,320
Zhou Ziqian.

458
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,820
Right?

459
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,330
Forget it.

460
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,370
I guess we both like the same kind of girl.

461
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,000
If you want to change your girlfriend,

462
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
remember to tell me.

463
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,300
We are in the same team.

464
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,500
I would never touch...

465
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,600
You know the water is pretty cold today.

466
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,770
Not bad.

467
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,960
I swim a dozen laps every day.

468
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,760
Is that a problem?

469
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,290
Then you can swim another ten laps.

470
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,910
Let's go.

471
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,190
Is it cold?

472
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,090
I'm okay.

473
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,650
Then why are you trembling?

474
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,340
Wait a minute.

475
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,950
Actually, I...

476
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,680
This is my clothes.

477
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,800
It may not fit well.

478
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,160
But it's better than the wet clothes you're wearing.

479
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,940
If you don't mind,

480
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,050
wear my clothes.

481
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,510
Thank you.

482
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,230
Well,

483
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,330
it fits well.

484
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,330
I'm afraid you won't be able to get it at this time of day,

485
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,440
so I brought you a box of cold medicine.

486
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,570
Remember to take it at night before bed.

487
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,370
Thank you.

488
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,700
Will you be working with

489
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,910
Liang Chuan in the future?

490
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,870
I'm not sure.

491
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,400
I have to give them my feedback.

492
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,380
I'll see what the bosses at the station say.

493
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,630
He's not a good guy.

494
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,890
Don't go to him alone again.

495
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,500
In fact, If you hadn't kicked him,

496
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,480
I would have kicked him.

497
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,640
It was kind of hard for me to put up with it.

498
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,940
It's my fault that I didn't give you a chance.

499
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,980
It's my face

500
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,790
that always gets me in trouble.

501
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,660
♫I've thought about it many times♫

502
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,690
The shooting gallery is next door.

503
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,820
Next time you come,

504
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,550
call me anytime.

505
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,400
♫I have thrown away this charming and empty thing in vain♫

506
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,820
Okay, time's up.

507
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,370
It's about to close.

508
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,040
Let me take you home.

509
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,890
♫I pick up the pen and only remember your wish♫

510
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,980
Well...

511
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:34,320
♫But my mother said boys can't be too sweet♫

512
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,120
Well, thank you.

513
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,750
A piece of cake.

514
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,300
Let's go.

515
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,980
♫I want to experience so many things with you♫

516
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,780
♫I wish I could have all the good and bad sides of you♫

517
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,430
♫That we can see in each other's eyes♫

518
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,570
If he gives you a hard time next time,

519
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,420
tell me.

520
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,040
♫That we can see in each other's eyes♫

521
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,450
You need to worry about yourself.

522
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,430
Take care of yourself even at work.

523
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,050
Well,

524
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,070
I'm gonna go do the laundry.

525
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,420
I'll bring it to you after I clean it up.

526
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,340
Don't worry.

527
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,650
Why don't you go back? It's getting late.

528
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,050
You too. Take care.

529
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:12,890
Ji Qiu,

530
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,720
haven't we

531
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,840
met somewhere before?

532
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,700
What a corny joke.

533
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,090
I'm just kidding.

534
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,530
I'm leaving.

535
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,580
Hello?

536
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:44,940
Rongrong.

537
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,470
I just had something.

538
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,820
I'm already at home downstairs.

539
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,660
I saw you.

540
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,560
A man.

541
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,400
Yes.

542
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,970
How did he come back with you?

543
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,420
Isn't that Zhou Ziqian?

544
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,770
Something happened tonight.

545
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,090
I'll tell you later.

546
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,170
Fu knew Zhou Ziqian played him.

547
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,400
He's been grumpy for days.

548
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,850
What do you mean?

549
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,870
The professional shooting player disguised him as a novice to compete with you.

550
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,940
Aren't you angry?

551
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,040
Let's eat first.

552
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,530
Play?

553
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,420
What?

554
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,320
It's a swimmer who put you in the water?

555
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,550
The name Liang Chuan sounds like a serious person.

556
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,880
Why is he such a bad guy?

557
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,090
You can't just kick him.

558
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,060
Qiu,

559
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,510
you should go up and get another kick.

560
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,670
I'm too angry.

561
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,590
If Zhou Ziqian hadn't kicked him, I should have done it.

562
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,910
If I hadn't been worried about my job,

563
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,930
I would have...

564
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,480
You just fell into the water.

565
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,510
Don't drink too much of this cold drinks.

566
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,320
I only took a sip.

567
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,130
Your heart is so big.

568
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,030
Next time if you are in a situation like this,

569
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,600
I can go with you.

570
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,880
Hey,

571
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,750
I've beaten more boys in school

572
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,980
than girls you've chased.

573
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,660
Just a piece of cake.

574
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,960
When are you gonna get over this bravado thing?

575
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,930
Fu,

576
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,250
did he ever chase a girl at school?

577
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,910
How come I don't remember any of them.

578
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,840
Yes.

579
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,350
I'm sorry.

580
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,060
I forgot there's no comparison.

581
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,220
Rongrong.

582
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,780
Yes.

583
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,820
Sometimes,

584
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,540
I don't have a good memory.

585
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,090
I have no choice.

586
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,640
I'm slow, but I remember it as long as I can.

587
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,380
I still think that guy is up to no good.

588
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,570
That guy?

589
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,330
Zhou Ziqian.

590
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,330
I don't know if he's up to something.

591
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,310
But I think

592
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,830
he treats you differently.

593
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,530
I think he likes you.

594
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,560
He's so much younger than me.

595
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,220
How did you get us together?

596
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,230
I was just saying.

597
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,280
But you can't judge a man by his age.

598
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,480
I think Zhou Ziqian is reliable.

599
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,440
What are you doing?

600
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,270
Your eyes are a bit creepy.

601
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,800
I see you've lost weight recently.

602
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,030
I think so.

603
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,290
You're not cute without the flesh on your face.

604
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,640
But I haven't been sleeping well lately.

605
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,030
Let me see.

606
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,110
There's no cure.

607
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,850
I'm a lecture in psychology,

608
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,900
not a vet.

609
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,450
Hey.

610
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,860
How can you tolerate his humiliation?

611
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,270
You bully people every day. No wonder you are single.

612
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,960
♫I have a special hobby♫

613
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,850
Look at you. You're not single?

614
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,920
♫I'd write a song when I miss you♫

615
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,690
I have Qiu. Who do you have?

616
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,690
♫Maybe I speak without thinking♫

617
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,110
♫But I love you more than what I expressed♫

618
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,970
Friendship comes first. Competition comes second.

619
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,400
Forget about the plastic friendship.

620
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,070
♫Give me a nameless ticket♫

621
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,290
♫Let me get on the train to your heart♫

622
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,980
♫I've had a dream since I met you♫

623
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,610
♫In the dream I'm singing this song♫

624
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,630
♫I like it warmer so I don't like winter♫

625

626

00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,830
♫All the stores are vending love♫

628
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,730
Qiu.

629
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,320
What?

630
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,920
Zhou Ziqian likes you.

631
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,730
It's true.

632
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,450
Think about it.

633
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,010
Maybe it is.

634
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,310
I'm slow, but I still feel weird.

635
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,360
There must be something.

636
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,570
Look.

637
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,500
Zhou Ziqian is handsome

638
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,730
and he's a shooting player.

639
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,680
He has a bright future.

640
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,670
Although he's young,

641
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,700
in the face of character,

642
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,070
it is not a problem.

643
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,180
Rongrong.

644
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,860
What do you think

645
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,220
of me?

646
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,800
Tell me the truth.

647
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,360
Well,

648
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,690
not good.

649
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:57,830
Hey.

650
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,540
Rongrong.

651
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,050
You don't have to be so honest.

652
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,970
I just don't usually dress up.

653
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,330
I'll just change and go out.

654
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,660
All beautiful scenery.

655
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,700
Gosh.

656
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,620
The point is

657
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,130
you don't usually do it.

658
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,320
♫Am I the shining star?♫

659

It's true.

669
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,030
Think about it.

00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,010
the first time we met,

675
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,140
he was suspected of hitting on me on purpose.

676
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,790
♫You hold me so tight♫

677
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,300
We've only known each other for a few days.

678
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,370
♫Like I would slip away♫

679
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,400
I can't believe he knows so much about my hobbies and habits.

680
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,320
♫The best encounter has arrived♫

681
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,570
Something I said consciously or unconsciously.

682
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,980
Now I think about it.

683
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,560
♫I'm thrilled to say the word♫

684
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,690
They're all weird.

685
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,870
Could it be...

686
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,950
What if it's just a whim?

687
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,610
But if it's true,

688
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,820
brother and sister love is so crazy.

689
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,180
How should I reject him?

690
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,050
Gosh,

691
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,920
so bad.

692
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,060
[Zhou Ziqian: Ji Qiu, if you come to the gym again at work, you can come to me.]

693
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,920
[Haha, it's good to be a part-time bodyguard when there's no races.]

694
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,690
[Since we're friends, I'll give you a discount.]

695
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,510
What's wrong, Ji Qiu?

696
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,220
You were scary.

697
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,820
I'm sorry.

698
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,680
It's all right.

699
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,810
It's not working time.

700
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,630
Your boyfriend?

701
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,610
Not yet.

702
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,500
That will be soon.

703
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,330
I'm telling you,

704
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,630
that's what boys are like at this time.

705
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,440
I wish I could text you every day.

706
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,860
And I have to ask you everything.

707
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,100
Congratulations.

708
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,530
If anyone says

709
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,370
we're single in the future,

710
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,820
I can finally argue back.

711
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,610
I have a friend.

712
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,670
A friend?

713
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,670
She's been getting messages

714
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,620
from a guy all the time.

715
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,830
And it's just

716
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,680
trivial matters.

717
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,240
From your points,

718
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,690
does he have other intentions?

719
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,630
It's obvious.

720
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,750
Does he like your friend?

721
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,820
Really?

722
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,990
Most likely.

723
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,490
How do you feel today?

724
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,320
[Zhou Ziqian: How do you feel today? Do you feel uncomfortable?]

725
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,940
Do you feel uncomfortable?

726
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,100
Take medicine when you catch a cold.

727
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,130
[Zhou Ziqian: Take medicine when you catch a cold.]

728
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,590
I'm too charming. It's my fault.

729
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:37,910
[Zhou Ziqian]

730
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,990
What should we do?

731
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,290
You can't let him get any deeper into this.

732
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,150
[Ji Qiu]

733
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,290
Oh.

734
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,980
What does that mean?

735
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,320
What are you looking at?

736
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,100
Amusement park.

737
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,640
You want to go?

738
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,050
I wasn't in Jiang Yi when I was young.

739
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,330
There was no amusement park there.

740
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,350
So we sometimes took a ride to Jiangyi on weekends.

741
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,050
We always forgot to go home.

742
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,760
We were all dragged back by our parents.

743
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,120
I didn't know

744
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,090
you missed it.

745
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,659
Since you've made it so clear,

746
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,159
it's okay for me

747
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,650
to go with you.

748
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,400
If you don't want me to go, forget it.

749
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,170
You don't want me to go

750
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,320
because you want to ask a girl out?

751
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,590
Something's going on.

752
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,340
Who is it?

753
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,100
No.

754
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,270
You think too much.

755
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,659
Just tell me the truth.

756
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,420
Your secret is safe with me.

757
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,580
It's time for lunch.

758
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,790
Don't change the subject.

759
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,460
You ate it half an hour ago.

760
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,960
What?

761
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,400
Who's talking?

762
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,540
Look at you.
