5
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,760
They planned a date,

6
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,610
but their plan got disrupted by accident.

7
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,870
Somehow, they met each other at the appointed time.

8
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,950
Such a serendipity.

9
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,340
However, they can only be brother and sister.

10
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,310
What a pity.

11
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,500
What are you talking about?

12
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,520
We were supposed to celebrate for him.

13
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,700
Now is the perfect time.

14
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,100
It's more fun with more people.

15
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,350
Congratulations on your championship.

16
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,860
Cheers.

17
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,039
Cheers. Congratulations, Ziqian.

18
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,340
This time,

19
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,539
he really scared me.

20
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,560
I was afraid he would miss during the game.

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,270
Am I that unreliable?

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,810
Are you really asking this question?

23
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,960
The way you behaved

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,020
before the game,

25
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,740
it's like you've lost your soul.

26
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,330
Really?

27
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,729
-Everyone can tell. -It's very obvious.

28
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,620
It's true. The way who you were a few days ago

29
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,500
reminds me of a teammate.

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,100
Did your teammate find out why he behaved that way?

31
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,479
He was in love.

32
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,070
What? He was in love?

33
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,829
It was my normal anxiety before the game.

34
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,520
You didn't focus on trainning but kept an eye on me all the time. Why?

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,500
To your anxiety before the game.

36
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,520
Miss Ji,

37
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,390
is Zhou Ziqian really in love?

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,710
I'm not sure.

39
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,700
Ziqian, you don't know, do you?

40
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,050
Your phone call video

41
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,950
went viral.

42
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,850
The call?

43
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,710
I saw it, too.

44
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,240
It's said the way he looked like on the call video

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,220
showed how nervous he was to tell the girl his feelings,

46
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,620
how he was turned down,

47
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,230
and how annoyed he was after being turned down.

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,090
So interesting.

49
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,460
Look at his face.

50
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,870
What is this?

51
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,050
This must be fake.

52
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,420
Of course, it's fake.

53
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,890
A phone call?

54
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,830
He didn't call Mr. Zhang, did he?

55
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,630
No.

56
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,470
-We were all with Mr. Zhang. -Right.

57
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,970
Are you still denying you were dating?

58
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,540
You told me you were talking to a friend in the car today that...

59
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,710
Shut your mouth. Eat more.

60
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,950
"It's good for your brain."

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,220
You lucky dog.

62
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,010
But it was me he was calling.

63
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,390
And we talked about the variety show.

64
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,260
I see.

65
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,160
If it was Miss Ji,

66
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,670
there's nothing to gossip about.

67
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,270
So you really don't have a girlfriend.

68
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,030
What's your problem?

69
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,760
Why it can't be

70
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,740
Ji Qiu?

71
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,900
You two are brother and sister.

72
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,740
Isn't it this simple?

73
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,920
Yes.

74
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,510
It's normal.

75
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,570
Tell you what.

76
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,120
Everyone in our company will fall in love

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
but not Ji Qiu. I won't believe it.

78
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,350
Why?

79
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,060
The experience is so bad.

80
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,890
Speaking of Ji Qiu's ex-boyfriend,

81
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,290
a scumbag...

82
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,570
I was young and immature.

83
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,170
The meat is turning cold. Hurry up and eat.

84
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,460
♫Oh. Love me. Love me♫

85
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,150
Did he bully you?

86
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,040
♫You are my only one in this colorful world♫

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,460
No, how could I be bullied?

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,100
♫You are the only exclusive secret that entered my heart♫

89
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,190
After we broke up,

90
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,140
he just wouldn't let me go. It was annoying.

91
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,050
♫Oh. Kiss me. Kiss me♫

92
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,550
-Have some meat. -Why wouldn't he let you go?

93
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,210
♫Just one of your expressions can make me fall in love with you♫

94
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,510
♫I'm afraid I'll only meet this once in my life♫

95
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,480
♫Oh. Kiss me. Kiss me♫

96
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,960
♫Just one of your expressions can make me fall in love with you♫

97
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,260
Maybe it's because

98
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,260
his girlfriends are not as pretty as me.

99
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,220
♫I'm afraid I'll only meet this once in my life♫

100
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,970
♫Oh. Love me. Love me♫

101
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,200
That's true.

102
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,340
♫You are my only one in this colorful world♫

103
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,470
What happened next?

104
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,390
♫You are the only exclusive secret that entered my heart♫

105
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,010
Then he was beaten.

106
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,050
Why?

107
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,410
♫Oh. Kiss me. Kiss me♫

108
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,390
Because

109
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,180
he asked too many questions.

110
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,850
♫Just one of your expressions can make me fall in love with you♫

111
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,940
♫I'm afraid I'll only meet this once in my life♫

112
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,430
We are leaving.

113
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,020
Hurry up.

114
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,390
Let's go home.

115
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,690
Are you going training tomorrow?

116
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,420
The coach gave me a few days off after the game.

117
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:35,400
There's still half a month before the shooting.

118
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,080
Take the chance,

119
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,590
you can go travelling wherever you want.

120
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,090
I'll hang out with you tomorrow.

121
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,440
Me? I have to work tomorrow.

122
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,920
Then you come hang out with me when you have time.

123
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,430
How old are you?

124
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,300
You still want others to play with you?

125
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,770
I don't care.

126
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,020
You tricked me into recording the show. You have to take the responsibility.

127
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,710
It's written on the contract.

128
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,950
You signed the name yourself.

129
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,050
You can't blame others for tricking you.

130
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,120
If you're bored,

131
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,250
just sleep at home.

132
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,840
You close your eyes. When you open them, it will be another day.

133
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,350
Well, you promised to buy me dinner.

134
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,460
How about tomorrow night?

135
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,790
It depends.

136
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,450
Depends on what?

137
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,990
You have too many questions.

138
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,050
But you didn't answer my questions.

139
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,770
They're not answering the phone.

140
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,630
What should we do?

141
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,409
We should tell Miss Ji.

142
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,780
You guys are so early.

143
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,780
What's wrong? You all look weird.

144
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,100
Hey, Miss Ji.

145
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,350
Something is wrong with the guests again.

146
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,050
Dr. Yang, calm down.

147
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,060
I'm not here to confront you.

148
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,150
But we've signed the contract.

149
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,140
The recording will start in half a month.

150
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,390
If you have any questions,

151
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,280
tell us and

152
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,070
we...

153
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,090
Hello, Dr. Yang.

154
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,530
He called me this morning

155
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,670
just to notify

156
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,520
without discussion.

157
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,710
What happened?

158
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,980
Why did he suddenly changed his mind?

159
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,460
Miss Ji,

160
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,650
I know why.

161
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,470
I heard from the other team that

162
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,490
Dr. Yang is

163
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,450
working with another talk show.

164
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,360
And they may talk about the position of a regular guest.

165
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,030
And they're willing to pay the penalty for him.

166
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,210
So you can imagine how much they will offer.

167
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,040
Just in case,

168

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
That's the worst.

334
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,170
♫I hope we can be the only light♫

335
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,140
If there is a way

336
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,780
♫That we can see in each other's eyes♫

337
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,250
to disclose these knowledge

338
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,350
and avoid misunderstandings,

339
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,740
♫I'll learn to be a fool♫

340
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,450
I'd love to do it.

341
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,610
-Really? -Yeah.

342
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,310
♫Learn to be soft-hearted even if you turn a blind eye♫

343
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,630
Thank you so much, Fu.

344
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,280
I thought you wouldn't say yes.

345
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,200
That's great.

346
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,540
♫There will be a silent arrangement tomorrow♫

347
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,630
♫No sorrow, no joy, I'm so touched♫

348
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,320
You really did me a big favor

349
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,330
this time.

350
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,930
You don't feel pressured now?

351
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,130
Not at all.

352
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,990
Let's go.

353
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,230
You have to treat us.

354
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,070
What do you want to eat?

355
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,610
Anything.

356
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,770
It's so late. Why isn't she back yet?

357
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,290
Wait.

358
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,570
Why?

359
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,610
But it's normal to care about her.

360
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,550
I've been waiting so long.

361
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,490
It'll be a loss if I don't see her.

362
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,480
-Zhou Ziqian. -What took you so long?

363
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,710
What took you so long?

364
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,090
I had to finish something.

365
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,480
Why are you here?

366
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,370
I...

367
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,740
My friend lives nearby.

368
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,580
I need to talk to him urgently.

369
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,550
I was just passing by.

370
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,580
By the way,

371
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,030
I sorted out some files about the variety show

372
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,060
for you last time.

373
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,840
Are you gonna go up and get it?

374
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,730
Now?

375
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,090
Okay.

376
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,960
I don't think Rongrong is back.

377
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,720
Have a seat.

378
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,510
What are you waiting for?

379
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,290
It's not your first time here. Have a seat.

380
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,750
You said you didn't know anything about variety shows.

381
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,090
I found some interesting clips for you.

382
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,970
You can take a look.

383
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,480
What's wrong?

384
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,180
You're blushing.

385
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,349
Do you have a fever?

386
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,680
Are you hot?

387
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,520
I'll get you some water.

388
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,369
Ji Qiu,

389
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,310
is there anything different

390
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,570
after the last accident?

391
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,220
Accident? What accident?

392
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,280
Did you really forget?

393
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,970
How could I know if you don't tell me?

394
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,220
Last time at my house,

395
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,500
we...

396
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,730
I...

397
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,690
You...

398
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,730
You mean...this?

399
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,450
Isn't this an accident?

400
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,960
You still think about it?

401
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,170
It's nothing.

402
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,340
I was careless.

403
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,920
Grape Ji.

404
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,480
It's not a trivial matter.

405
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,060
To be precise,

406
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,670
it's like when

407
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,860
I ate less,

408
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,700
when I lost a shoe,

409
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,530
or when I broke a glass.

410
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,490
That's not a big deal.

411
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,950
I'm leaving.

412
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,090
So weird.

413
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,130
How is this a trivial matter?

414
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,090
How is this a trivial matter?

415
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,560
You've been repeating this for half an hour.

416
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,220
I'm not interested to know what's going on,

417
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,380
but can you talk outside?

418
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,620
You also think it's a trivial matter?

419
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,340
You said you were going to a reality show.

420
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:21,910
Yes.

421
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,100
What do you think?

422
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,530
-You have anything to say? -Yes.

423
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,440
Be careful when you're on TV.

424
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,680
I can pretend I don't hear you at home.

425
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,100
But if you talk too much on the show,

426
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,430
the audience will find out soon.

427
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,070
Find out what?

428
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,760
That you have no common sense.

429
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,060
But it doesn't affect me.

430
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,260
No one knows I'm your brother anyway.

431
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,380
You're so mean.

432
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,700
No girls in school like you, right?

433
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,540
Can't you act like a real brother?

434
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,350
Acting like what?

435
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,480
Something like being

436
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:06,990
excited,

437
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,030
to shout,

438
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,340
or scream!

439
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,440
Normal people wouldn't do that.

440
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,670
Can you tell me more about it?

441
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,800
It's 11 p.m. now.

442
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,860
Can we stop disturbing the neighbors?

443
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,130
I heard that  Zhou Ziqian is among the guests.

444
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,200
Hey, where exactly are you shooting?

445
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,700
Brother, I promise

446
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,060
I will be good,

447
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,880
quiet and obedient.

448
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,990
I won't disgrace you.

449
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,280
Hey, don't close the door.

450
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,130
This is so noisy.

451
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,510
Brother, don't worry.

452
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,940
I'll promote it for you.

453
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,170
It's true.

454
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,480
My brother went to a variety show.

455
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,950
And he was with Zhou Ziqian.

456
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,240
I'm not exaggerating.

457
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,800
It will be so easy

458
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,940
to meet Zhou Ziqian in the future.

459
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,260
Why?

460
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,320
Think about it.

461
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,930
If they are on a variety show together,

462
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,040
that means they are colleagues.

463
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,040
Colleagues are friends.

464
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,570
Friends are brothers.

465
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,590
If so,

466
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,110
Zhou Ziqian will be my brother.

467
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,030
You have a point.

468
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,280
Tiantian, if your brother becomes a famous psychologist,

469
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,220
everyone will be envious of you.

470

I admire you.

501
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,170
You admire us for this?

502
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,780
You're so ignorant.

503
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,930
Did you smile just now?

504
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,860
No, I didn't.

505
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,010
I choked.

506
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,360
Next team.

507
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,250
How is it going?

508
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,640
Nan ranks third.

509
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,370
Zhou Ziqian and Gao Yuan took the first and second place.

510
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
But Nan's current score

511
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,430
is far ahead of the fourth.

512
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,450
There's still the fifth team left.

513
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,090
Don't forget

514
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,530
Xu Wang is here.

515
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,140
Someone assigned from outside of our team.

516
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,860
It's fine as long as you can join the provincial game.

517
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,960
There are four candidates this time.

518
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,850
You didn't see the announcement, did you?

519
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,040
This time is different.

520
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,070
Only the top three are qualified.

521
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,450
Well...

522
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,590
No matter what, I must win this time.

523
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,810
I have a friend.

524
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,050
He's from Xu Wang's team.

525
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,590
He told me something about him.

526
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,600
What is it?

527
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,240
Do you know Xu Ming?

528
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,080
The champion of 10 meter air rifle

529
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,270
during the National Shooting Tournament.

530
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,820
He died in an accident two years ago.

531
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,970
It was Xu Wang's father.

532
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,290
His father?

533
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,580
Xu Wang had good grades before.

534
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,810
But his parents had a car accident

535
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,700
on their way to his game.

536
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,770
They died on the spot.

537
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,150
After that incident,

538
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,450
he lost his faith.

539
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,360
His game result after that was unstable.

540
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,950
After that,

541
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,200
he never took any champion.

542
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,180
Team Five, get ready.

543
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,860
I heard that you often got bad results

544
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,090
because of family affairs.

545
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,090
And that your hands always tremble.

546
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,090
You are not trembling today?

547
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,080
What's wrong with him?

548
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,700
I don't know.

549
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,410
Why is Yu Nan standing so close to him?

550
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,630
Seven points.

551
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,950
What's going on?

552
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,210
It's strange.

553
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,980
Xu Wang was much better when he was trainning.

554
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,390
What is he mumbling about?

555
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,830
Why is he so mean?

556
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,200
He did it on purpose to play with people's mind.

557
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,400
I finally understand

558
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,830
why you can't stay in the old team anymore.

559
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,050
Because you can't compete at all.

560
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,100
I really feel sorry for your family.

561
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,370
Are you done?

562
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,660
Do you want to fight? Come on!

563
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,000
Hit me. I won't fight back.

564
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,890
Come on.

565
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,110
Oh, I forgot.

566
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,790
Xu Wang was a champion.

567
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,610
How could a champion fight?

568
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,440
How dare you?

569
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,900
It's just an internal assessment.

570
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,100
Why are you so impatient?

571
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,340
You don't want to be kicked off from the competition, do you?

572
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,720
Take him away.

573
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,340
Here you are.

574
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,170
The assessment is finished.

575
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,560
Yes.

576
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,910
Gao Yuan told me you watched my game.

577
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,840
Why does Gao Yuan say everything?

578
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,840
Did he also say that I would take notes while watching?

579
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,180
Don't believe him. I'll only watch two more times.

580
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,580
Are you surprised today?

581
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,290
I ended up like that today.

582
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,130
He was right.

583
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,810
I came to Jiangyi to win the championship.

584
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,600
I've heard something similar before.

585
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,600
But it was more like

586
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,420
"when I stand on the shooting ground,

587
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,140
I am the champion".

588
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,610
Is your family's arrogance hereditary?

589
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,030
Do you know

590
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,260
your dad was my idol?

591
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,980
I watched the game in 2009 many times.

592
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,020
I even remember

593
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,980
the champion gold coin.

594
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,910
When I saw you in the game,

595
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,730
I want to see

596
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,810
how his son plays.

597
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,330
After I saw you play,

598
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,880
you are just fine.

599
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,990
Almost as good as me.

600
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,230
This is not too bad

601
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,100
a comment.

602
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,350
Yu Nan and the others disturbed you in this way.

603
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,280
That means they admit that they're not as good as you.

604
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,240
It's easy for you to win.

605
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,440
Ignore them.

606
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,860
There are people

607
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,240
who are good at dealing with them.

608
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,990
No way.

609
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,110
Why is he holding a gun like holding a embroidery needle?

610
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,910
Impressive.

611
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,570
He's been practicing for so long,

612
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,520
but he can't even shoot 10 points.

613
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,230
You know nothing about him.

614
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,320
He's good at talking.

615
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,150
So his shooting skills was naturally left behind.

616
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,260
Oh, I see.

617
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,570
Does this game

618
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,780
depends on talking skills?

619
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,730
Are you out of your mind staring at me instead of training?

620
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,150
The doctor has the final say if we are out of our mind.

621
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,390
I warn you to mind your own business.

622
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,500
If you are not good enough, your dirty work won't help you, either.

623
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,100
No matter what you say,

624
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,910
the result of the team assessment is out.

625
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,780
I rank the third. Xu Wang doesn't have a chance.

626
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,220
I envy you.

627
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,710
You're so easily satisfied.

628
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,540
Hello, Song Rongrong.

629
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,940
Come over for dinner tonight.

630
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,380
Dinner? When did you learn how to cook?

631
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,330
Do you want to come?

632
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,110
Sure.

633
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,820
No excuses to say no to free food.

634
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,150
Zhou Ziqian is here.

635
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,720
We'll be there soon.

636
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,730
Okay.

637
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,670
Do you mind if I bring someone with me?

638
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,510
Sure.

639
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,330
Done.

640
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,400
He said he would bring one more teammate.

641
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,770
So I have to cook more.

642
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,700
You want them to try it?

643
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,020
Yes, we two share the same taste.

644
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,890
We need to find more people

645
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,380
to know if it really tastes good.

646
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,390
Qiu, which dish do you think I should cook?

647
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,200
You didn't tell them

648
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,990
this is your first time cooking?

649
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,790
Do I have to say that?

650
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,170
Then why do you suddenly want to cook?

651
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,970
Ding Ding told me today

652
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,200
her boyfriend is under a lot of pressure at work recently.

653
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,720
But every time she makes something delicious,

654
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,130
her boyfriend will become happier.

655
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,340
So you want to make it for your future boyfriend?

656
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,450
I want to cook for you.

657
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,300
Rongrong.

658
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,970
Since I've asked you to come,

659
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,380
I can guarantee that

660
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,980
we'll have a big meal later.

661
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,600
Why is it so smoky?

662
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,970
Why is this different from the recipe?

663
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,440
Coming!

664
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,720
What are you doing, Song Rongrong?

665
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,680
I'm cooking. I just...

666
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,490
You found him?

667
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,170
What?

668
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,040
♫Am I the shining star?♫

669
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,700
♫Are you fond of me?♫

670
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,550
So...

671
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,920
the person you're looking for is Xu Wang?

672
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:16,440
♫You just stepped in sight, with your sparkly eyes♫

673
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,540
Not bad.

674
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,230
It's exactly the same as the portrait.

675
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,560
Nonsense.

676
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,900
♫Am I falling for you?♫

677
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,370
He is much more handsome than the portrait.

678
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,900
I drew it as you described.

679
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,360
♫Do you feel the same?♫

680
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,440
Two eyes, one nose, one mouth and...

681
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,820
♫We just soaked in the fire, as no one would care♫

682
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,800
Don't listen to him.

683
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,630
He doesn't even know the essence of what I said.

684
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,800
What essence?

685
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,640
The handsomeness which you don't have.

686
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,360
Song Rongrong.

687
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,340
Can you spare me some face?

688
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,020
That portrait looks real.

689
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,170
It looks like me.

690
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,080
Are you making fun of yourself?

691
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,450
That's too much.

692
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,780
How come you know everything?

693
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,510
What do you think? You must admire me now?

694
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,180
Do you remember me?

695
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,330
Yes.

696
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
We've met twice.

697
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,170
The first time was when I was asking you the way.

698
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,390
The second time was on the street.

699
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,140
Why do you keep looking for me?

700
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,120
Actually, last time when you asked me for directions,

701
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,920
I thought you were a scumbag.

702
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,510
So I lied to you.

703
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,990
The elevator did not break down that day.

704
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,610
You must climbed the stairs for a long time.

705
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,550
I'm sorry.

706
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,000
No wonder when Xu Wang came back that day,

707
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,340
he couldn't even stand on his feet.

708
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,890
Was it that bad?

709
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,960
No, I haven't joined the team when I met you.

710
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,900
Don't worry about it.

711
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,910
I'm an athlete.

712
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,010
It's just a few steps.

713
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,860
For me, it's just training.

714
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,820
-Really? -Sure.

715
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,520
Do you have coke at home, Rongrong?

716
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,630
I don't think so.

717
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,950
I'll buy it. I saw a convenience store on my way here.

718
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,540
I'll go, too.

719
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,050
It's rare.

720
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,660
Why does she become active all of a sudden?

721
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,520
Fortunately, everyone's problem is solved.

722
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,370
We can finally have a nice weekend.

723
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,130
You have two days off this weekend, right?

724
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,000
What do you want?

725
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,100
I want...

726
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,170
This is so funny.

727
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,240
They asked me to get some Chinese onions.

728
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,750
But I don't see any.

729
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,410
Go visit somewhere with you?

730
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,370
No. Impossible.

731
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,370
It's not easy that I have two days off.

732
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,710
You can ask anything from me,

733
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,040
but don't even think about my vacation.

734
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,180
-Tell you what... -Qiuye Town.

735
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,660
I don't know many people anymore

736
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,460
where I grew up.

737
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,670
No.

738
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,360
Would you think about it?

739
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,290
It's not easy for me to have a few days off.

740
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,380
I'm not going.

741
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,540
-Are you sure? -Yes.

742
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:20,360
♫I haven't written to others since October♫

743
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,280
I remember someone

744
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,500
promised me three requests.

745
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,949
I'm now using one precious request

746
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,620
to exchange for a few days of your vacation.

747
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,350
♫I'm just a little composer♫

748
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,449
Is it too much to ask?

749
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:31,110
♫Never mind these bad things and put them in the corner♫

750
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,070
♫Just think about what it's worth♫

751
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,670
Cheers.

752
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,150
I wish we could play soccer more often.

753
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,250
Then Xu Wang will fall in love with Jiangyi soon.

754
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,890
I already do.

755
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,620
So the first reaction of falling for someone

756
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,460
is not blushing nor a strong heartbeat.

757
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,690
It's that you can't help

758
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,790
but taking one more look.

759
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,320
If you like something,

760
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,840
isn't it normal to look at them more?

761
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,830
That's what kids think.

762
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,420
What do adults think?

763
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,880
The adults?

764
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,040
It's hard for adults to find what they like.

765
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,310
So once you found it,

766
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,170
is it enough to just take one more look?

767
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,860
Then,

768
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,050
do you want to take a look now?
