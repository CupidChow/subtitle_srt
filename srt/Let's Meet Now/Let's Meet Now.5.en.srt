about why you picked this name.

If we meet,

10
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,930
we can make the days before and after the meeting

11

good days.

12
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,960
That's what Mr. Qian said.

13
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,380
At present, we plan to set the content of each program

14
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,520
in the form of reality show and documentary,

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,090
combined with the personality characteristics of guests

16
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,420
to maximize the charm of the characters.

17
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,560
The content is not fixed,

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,200
and the form is not completely fixed.

19
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,700
We hope to open up the domestic slow variety market

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,240
through this show.

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:51,390
As for last one,

31
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,850
we plan to invite a celebrity

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,229
with diversified personalities.

33
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,640
Since the audience has seen their side A,

34
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,460
I hope our show

35
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,200
can display their side B more.

36
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,480
In this way, we can ensure the popularity of the show

37

and the reality of guests' personalities.

38

Speaking of sporty guest,

39
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,870
I can come up with

40
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,660
a famous swimmer

41
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,970
called Liang Chuan.

42
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,710
I think he's quite suitable.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,450
Liang Chuan.

44
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,820
Recently, his private life was revealed to be licentious by the internet.

45
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,550
So I don't think he's appropriate.

46
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,620
Our current decision

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,430
is Zhou Ziqian.

48
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,780
I know him.

49
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,050
He's quite popular.

50
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,920
He looks like a leading actor in trendy drama.

51
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,130
That depends on you.

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,750
What matters is whether you are considering

53
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,290
the stars with huge fan bases

54
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,720
in your plan.

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,570
For example, Ye Qiao.

56
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,690
Ye Qiao.

57
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,930
We worked with her before.

58
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,420
But she's not

59
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,520
on our invitation list yet.

60
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,620
If we invite another guest,

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,890
I'm afraid...

62
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,120
I'll be frank with you.

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,579
Every first attempt has a chance to fail,

64
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,460
because the public recognition is unknown.

65
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,580
So you must have a guarantee.

66
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,930
If Ye Qiao can come,

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,380
you won't be short of topics

68
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,560
or exposure.

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,810
It will be possible that it gets popular before it broadcasts.

70
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,760
Of course, I know

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
you have concerns.

72
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,110
There are different comments

73
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,460
about Ye Qiao.

74
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,810
But you said it yourself

75
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,050
that you need to see both side A and B of the celebrities.

76
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,650
Now you only see Ye Qiao's side A.

77
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,250
How do you know she doesn't have a side B?

78
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,140
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

79
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,600
It was my thoughtlessness.

80
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,000
We will reconsider it.

81
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,360

Yang Yiwei, a famous PhD in Economics.

85
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,730
Zhou Ziqian, a shooting athlete.

86
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,780
And Ye Qiao.

87
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,150
Each of us is responsible for one guest.

88
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,670
We have one week to invite them.

89
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,320
Although these elites can be grumpy,

90
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,760
and their demands can be bizarre.

91
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,550
But as long as we remember one thing,

92
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,400
we can overcome it.

93
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,500
What is that?

94
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,090
If they don't come,

95
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,550
we have to pack up and leave.

96
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,640
That's strange.

97
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,110
I'm suddenly full of energy.

98
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,890
Whether our plan is successful or not

99
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,910
depends on how likely these guests

100
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,830
are to participate.

101
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,630
Alright, let's choose our targets.

102
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,850
If you feel difficult

103
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,830
to make up your mind,

104
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,280
you can discuss with each other.

105
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,110
It's not difficult at all.

106
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,860
How hard can it be?

107
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,340
Ji Qiu, we are not as good as you.

108
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,930
Please take care of Ye Qiao.

109
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,400
Let me try it.

110
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,290
Try to read the guest information

111
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,430
and meet their demands.

112
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,150
What about the other one?

113
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,440
What about Zhou Ziqian?

114
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,240
Zhou Ziqian.

115
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,540
Leave him there.

116
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,390
Ji Qiu, I still have a question.

117
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,640
How are you going to invite Ye Qiao?

118
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,060
Hmm.

119
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,450
Ye Qiao,

120
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,790
what we want is natural beauty.

121
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,270
So when we were planning,

122
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,960
we chose those beautiful places.

123
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,940
For example, Shangri-La

124
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,820
and the coast of Qingdao.

125
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,030
After high-intensity work,

126
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,000
packing up and embarking on an unknown journey

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,690
with your peers

128
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,460
can be a rare experience.

129
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,130
It sounds interesting to me.

130
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,659
It's not about you.

131
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,250
Think about Ye Qiao.

132
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,000
Will you still find it fun if you were her?

133
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,470
Let me think about it.

134
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,270
Outdoor journey?

135
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,510
There must be a lot of mosquitoes.

136
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,110
What if I get bitten?

137
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:52,159
What's worse,

138
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,140
I can't wear a dress.

139
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,420
And you just mentioned peers.

140
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,830
One of your guests is 30 years old.

141
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,890
Are you saying I'm that old?

142
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,240
You're exaggerating.

143
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,030
It's true.

144
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,990
I heard that

145
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,710
she was pissed off immediately

146
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,880
when she saw a bug during the show.

147
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,770
Also,

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,070
Ye Qiao has always been sensitive to age.

149
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,950
She'll get mad if you say that.

150
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,160
This is already the

151
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,000
forth plan, right?

152
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,450
How about this?

153
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,540
I'll try this when I meet her tomorrow.

154
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,600
Miss Ye,

155
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,909
you can display your true nature

156
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:33,870
and attract the audience in our show.

157
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,600
What if her true nature will

158
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,130
ruin the interests of audience?

159
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,110
I don't care.

160
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,630
I've made several plans.

161
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,110
When I see her tomorrow,

162
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,120
I'll try them one by one.

163
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,540
It will work eventually.

164
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,380
It didn't work?

165
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,460
Yang.

166
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,090
We've made an appointment several times.

167
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,120
And didn't we meet agreement this time?

168
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,200
What's the use of my words?

169
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,580
Miss Ye changed her schedule at the last minute.

170
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,530
And honestly,

171
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,450
she is not likely to participate in a reality show.

172
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,000
We can make another appointment,

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,260
if time is not appropriate.

174
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,300
Miss Ye is calling me. I have to go.

175
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,210
-Sorry, Ji Qiu. -Yang.

176
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,140
Yang.

177
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,800
Hello, Miss Ye. I'm still here.

178
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,540
What's the use of these plans

179
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,320
if I can't even meet her?

180
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:24,720
No problem.

181
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,050
Good for you.

182
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,000
What do you mean?

183
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,730
They all belong to you.

184
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,220
Only this one is mine.

185
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,650
What?

186
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,710
Stop it.

187
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,650
She's been doing this for you the whole time.

188
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,330
She's in the badminton team next door,

189
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,570
and have come here many times.

190
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,760
But you never noticed.

191
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,020
They want to

192
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,130
have dinner with us tonight.

193
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,880
She promises to buy me milk tea for a month

194
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,770
as long as you will be there.

195
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,200
Just go.

196
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,740
I'll share with you.

197
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,460
I am getting rid of sugar.

198
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,440
Go by yourself.

199
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,580
Why do you refuse?

200
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,680
What kind of girl do you like?

201
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,840
Isn't she pretty?

202
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,050
You...

203
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,910
Are you...

204
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,760
No wonder...

205
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,240
Last time I saw you use my bracers.

206
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:25,860
What are you going to do?

207
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,300
To find my bracers.

208
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,160
I'll lend you mine.

209
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,320
I don't mind.

210
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,960
No.

211
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,809
What bracers?

212
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,039
The white ones?

213
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,150
They're here.

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,040
You left them last time.

215
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,860
Okay. You can come over now.

216
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,570
I'm at home.

217
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:52,710
Wait.

218
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,520
Bring me some snacks.

219
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,080
You just failed

220
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,540
to invite her.

221
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,650
How can you become so depressed?

222
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,160
You don't understand.

223
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,550
I've already made several appointments with her in advance.

224
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,810
It's fine if she didn't agree.

225
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,840
She agreed to see me this time,

226
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,150
but suddenly changed her mind.

227
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,610
Women have complicated minds.

228
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,950
So you don't see yourself as a woman?

229
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,810
Since Ye Qiao is so difficult to invite,

230
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,640
why don't you invite other guests first?

231
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,160
If the other guests agreed,

232
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,730
Ye Qiao might agree too.

233
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,520
Other guests?

234
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,530
I'll go get something to drink.

235
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,310
Let's talk about it seriously.

236
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,560
Hey.

237
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,560
Ji Qiu.

238
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,440
It's an accident.

239
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,180
An accident.

240
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,000
Never mind.

241
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,440
Where are the bathroom?

242
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,220
I'll take it off and wipe it up.

243
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,890
I know.

244
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,910
The shirt you lent me last time is still here.

245
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,730
I'll go get it for you.

246
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,600
Okay.

247
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,820
Open the door.

248
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,190
The door is unlocked.

249
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,450
Just come straight in...

250
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,200
Grape Ji.

251
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,210
You're pulling on the doorknob with your hands, right?

252
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,540
Stop that.

253
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,300
Let go.

254
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,620
What are you talking about?

255
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,110
Open the door.

256
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,410
Why did you lock the door?

257
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,700
So it's not you?

258
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,730
Then how come I can't open the door?

259
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,070
Alright.

260
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,030
Don't waste your energy.

261
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,500
It should be because the lock cylinder is stuck.

262
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
Weird.

263
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,230
Don't worry.

264
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,000
We have lockpickers in our community.

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,320
I'll go find one.

266
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,730
It's okay.

267
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,690
Be careful.

268
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,170
Hello, Rongrong. What's going on?

269
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,300
Nothing.

270
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
I'm just calling to check on you.

271
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,050
How's the plan to invite Ye Qiao?

272
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,640
Don't mention it.

273
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,220
I didn't even see her.

274
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,560
So I haven't used my plans yet.

275
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,180
We were trying to design several plans for her before.

276
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,760
But now I can't even see her at all.

277
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,910
So I can't do anything about it.

278
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,280
You haven't seen her yet?

279
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,550
She made a schedule temporarily.

280
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,310
She does have a schedule.

281
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,940
She is coming to our magazine today to shoot the cover.

282
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,310
She'll be here soon.

283
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,810
How long is she going to shoot?

284
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,720
About three hours.

285
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:26,700
Wait for me.

286
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,300
I'll be right there.

287
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,590
Okay.

288
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,010
Nice!

289
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,740
Great.

290
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,180
Finished.

291
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,750
Thank you, Miss Ye.

292
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,960
Miss Xia, let's change your look.

293
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,920
There's another theme later.

294
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,620
-Thank you. -Thank you.

295
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,570
Thank you.

296
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,530
You're welcome. Do you need a make-up fix?

297
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,990
I don't need.

298
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,300
I'm young enough.

299
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,530
So my skin is in good condition.

300
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,890
How about you go help Miss Ye?

301
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,550
I just got closer to her

302
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,150
and saw the wrinkles at the corners of her eyes.

303
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,000
To be honest,

304
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
Xia Yao is really cute.

305
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,660
How can there be such a cute girl?

306
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,180
Am I wrong?

307
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,050
I think

308
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,410
Ye Qiao looks better.

309
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,170
But

310
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,300
didn't you say before that you were afraid to work with Ye Qiao?

311
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,860
But compared to Xia Yao,

312
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,380
I think she's better.

313
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,070
I'll be right back.

314
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,290
Where is she going?

315
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,370
I don't know.

316
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:45,880
Rongrong.

317
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,240
How is it?

318
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,270
Ye Qiao hasn't left yet, right?

319
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,780
Not yet.

320
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,130
But she will leave in a while.

321
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,110
How about you wait here for a while?

322
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,040
She'll leave...

323
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,370
Miss Ye.

324
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,660
Are you done with work already?

325
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,350
Miss Ji.

326
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,620
What a coincidence.

327
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,120
I didn't expect to see you here.

328
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,680
I came here specifically to see you.

329
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,510
Could you give me a few minutes?

330
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,550
Gao Yuan.

331
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,960
Mr. Zhang, what's up?

332
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,850
Where is Zhou Ziqian?

333
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,560
He went to the bathroom.

334
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,500
Can you seniors

335
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,750
behave better?

336
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,060
Call him

337
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,700
and ask him to come back now.

338
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,820
OK.

339
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,560
Hurry up.

340
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,210
What's he doing? Why isn't he answering his phone?

341
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,250
I told her to slow down.

342
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,730
But would she be too slow?

343
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,900
Did she forget me?

344
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,640
Impossible.

345
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,290
How is that possible?

346
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,820
We are so close, how could she forget about me?

347
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,850
Then how should I explain to Mr. Zhang?

348
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,790
Grape Ji.

349
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,280
Are you looking for a locksmith in Atlantic?

350
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,460
Reality show?

351
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,820
Miss Ji.

352
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,920
Don't you know I don't like reality shows?

353
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,610
I know you were once on a reality show

354
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,640
that really caused you a lot of trouble.

355
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,790
But

356
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,150
ours is definitely different.

357
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,100
Really?

358
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,690
When will the driver arrive?

359
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,290
About ten minutes.

360
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,890
Is ten minutes enough?

361
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,740
Miss Ji.

362
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,890
Ten minutes?

363
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,960
Miss Ye,

364
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,810
I wonder if you have ever thought about

365
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,960
showing your most authentic side

366
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,070
to the audience?

367
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,160
Do you think there are celebrities who show the most authentic side

368
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,480
to the audience?

369
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,740
You're right.

370
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,480
Once those celebrities show their true temperament in the show,

371
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,350
it will atract huge attentions

372
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,030
within the few months when show is broadcasting.

373
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,300
Not only will the show be brought topics,

374
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,470
celebrities will also meet troubles.

375
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,580
Although the reality show we are intended to make

376
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,080
can't completely remove those regular forms,

377
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,790
it still has new concept of slow reality shows.

378
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,720
Maybe there will be just some

379
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,310
dining and chatting.

380
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,610
But you can find the most comfortable way to get along with the others.

381
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:04,900
Miss Ye,

382
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,000
at least we will try our best

383
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,859
on its reputation.

384
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,829
We will definitely not let you down.

385
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,260
Really?

386
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,970
But it's not up to you.

387
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,550
Which platform doesn't care about the click rate?

388
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,010
I won't beat around the bush.

389
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,310
Let me ask you.

390
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,450
What's your budget?

391
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,130
Because it's a new show, so...

392
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,970
Ratings, word of mouth and topics,

393
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,330
These are all insubstantial.

394
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,160
You can give me your words.

395
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,990
But it can't be written in the contract.

396
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,030
If I take your show,

397
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,090
I'll turn down an TV series with IP,

398
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,740
and three brand advertising.

399
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,040
When we worked together for New Star Is Born,

400
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,980
I've already lowered my pay once.

401
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,170
If I take your show,

402
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,800
it'll be

403
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,640
a great loss.

404
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,760
Sorry, Mr Ji. I have something to do.

405
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,380
See you.

406
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,720
Miss Ye,

407
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,140
I'm really happy to work with you today.

408
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,240
In the past,

409
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,860
I only cooperated with those skilled actors

410
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,900
to shoot the cover.

411
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,270
It's the first time to work with

412
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,810
someone like you.

413
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,440
Someone like me?

414
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,390
What kind of people am I?

415
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,720
Miss Ye, don't get me wrong.

416
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,970
I didn't mean that.

417
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,370
Indeed.

418
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,620
You're the most ordinary one of the people

419
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,130
I've worked with.

420
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,300
After all, I've only entered this industry for a year.

421
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,840
I only have one film.

422
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,040
Without Director Liu's help,

423
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,920
it wouldn't have reached such a high score of 8.

424
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,140
You

425
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,100
should have got this acchievement long ago.

426
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,660
How come the highest score is only 6.5?

427
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,340
The former netizens

428
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,400
were so strict.

429
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,060
Miss Ji.

430
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,500
Do you know her?

431
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,540
She...

432
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,270
You don't know her?

433
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,840
I don't know her either.

434
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,670
Then that's not my problem.

435
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,770
Miss Ye,

436
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,200
it's okay

437
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,220
if you don't know her now.

438
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,460
Xia Yao

439
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,900
will have many more works in the future.

440
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,050
By the way,

441
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,090
we will participate in the recording

442
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,070
of a reality show in a few days.

443
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,210
You will certainly get to know her in the future.

444
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,400
But since you have such a bad temper,

445
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,810
I don't think any reality show crew would dare to invite you, right?

446
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,450
How about I ask them

447
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,720
if they are still short of people

448
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,750
when I go to the recording?

449
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,920
Please send the plan and contract

450
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,380
of the reality show you just mentioned

451
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,340
to my agent later.

452
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,890
But the budget we just talked about seems to be...

453
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,030
Do I look like someone who is short of money?

454
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,150
How is it going?

455
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,870
Ye Qiao...

456
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,530
Seems...

457
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,910
May...

458
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,950
Maybe...

459
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,260
Probably...

460
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,630
She would probably agree.

461
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,820
She agreed...

462
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,930
I'm not finished yet.

463
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,810
It's not a done deal yet.

464
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,410
Keep a low profile.

465
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,410
That's almost done.

466
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,440
Maybe.

467
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,000
You're amazing.

468
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,960
It all thanks to you.

469
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,660
I'll treat you to dinner after you get off work.

470
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,200
But I will get off very late.

471
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,320
It's okay. I'll wait for you.

472
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,430
I have nothing to do anyway.

473
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:44,960
Okay.

474
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,100
I keep feeling like

475
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,340
I'm forgetting something.

476
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,540
You've always had a bad memory.

477
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,030
Just recall it.

478
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,760
What were you doing before you came here?

479
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,040
Nothing. I was at home.

480
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,050
Damn.

481
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,370
Thank you, sir.

482
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:06,970
You're welcome.

483
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,350
Are you okay?

484
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm fine.

485
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,480
It's good that you're okay.

486
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,420
Do you really think so?

487
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,850
Well...

488
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,010
I'm sorry.

489
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,730
I just had an urgent matter.

490
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,980
So I forgot.

491
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,240
Are you cold or hungry?

492
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,510
Do you want me to take you to...

493
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,930
What are you looking at?

494
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,350
Do you think that bath ball

495
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,900
looks like you?

496
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,000
And does that bottle

497
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,990
look like Gao Yuan?

498
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,820
The white one

499
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,950
is exactly the same as Fu Qile.

500
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,770
I'm fine.

501
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,890
With so many people by my side,

502
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,210
I'm not lonely.

503
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,570
Have you become stupid?

504
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,070
No.

505
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,710
If you spend four hours in the bathroom,

506
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,840
you'll be the same.

507
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,980
Let me help you.

508
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,330
You're so heavy.

509
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,530
Since you think I'm heavy...

510
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,500
-I... -No. No.

511
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,700
Not at all.

512
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,670
♫I have a special hobby♫

513
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,670
♫I'd write a song when I miss you♫

514
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,640
♫Maybe I speak without thinking♫

515
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,340
♫But I love you more than what I expressed♫

516
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,650
♫Give me a nameless ticket♫

517
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,980
♫Let me get on the train to your heart♫

518
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,730
♫I've had a dream since I met you♫

519
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,260
♫In the dream I'm singing this song♫

520
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,300
♫I'm singing in the galaxy and in the wind♫

521
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,290
♫I dreamt of all the heart-pounding moments♫

522
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,270
♫How many times do I have to tell you this is not the point♫

523
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,430
♫The point is I'm in love with your face♫

524
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,590
Are you thirsty?

525
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,080
♫I like it warmer so I don't like winter♫

526
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,210
Have some coke?

527
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,020
♫Given that you are by my side♫

528
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,160
♫If there's no beginning or end♫

529
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,050
I'll get you some water.

530
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,840
♫I'd rather sleep tight in your arms♫

531
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,060
♫I only looked at you once but it means forever♫

532
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,520
♫Do the moon and the sun miss each other too?♫

533
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,010
♫On the day I met you♫

534
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,440
♫All the stores are vending love♫

535
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,780
Is this water cold?

536
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,390
Yes.

537
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,490
It's usually...

538
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,650
It's okay. The water in the bathroom

539
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,300
is also cold.

540
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,290
I'll go get you hot water.

541
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,250
Here's the hot water.

542
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,520
Why is my shoulder

543
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,330
so painful?

544
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,860
This should be an old disease.

545
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,380
I definitely didn't fall in the bathroom.

546
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,260
I'm fine.

547
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,450
You don't need to give me a massage.

548
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,680
I can bear it.

549
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:54,570
It's okay.

550
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,550
Is it here?

551
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,090
Lower.

552
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,320
A little to the left.

553
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,110
Are you pretending?

554
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,090
You're scolding me?

555
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,320
No.

556
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,150
You're still scolding me?

557
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,360
You're really annoying.

558
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,230
Mr. Zhang.

559
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,310
Yes.

560
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,250
I had a temporary accident.

561
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,000
It's my own fault.

562
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,660
I'll go back to practice in the evening

563
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:53,860
to make up the training time.

564
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,080
I definitely won't affect tomorrow's practice schedule.

565
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,020
OK.

566
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,990
I'll be right back.

567
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,700
Why are you...

568
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:13,820
Let me give you a ride.

569
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:17,800
Do you feel sorry?

570
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,720
It's my responsibility.

571
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,130
I'll stay with you

572
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,700
to make up for your extra training time.

573
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,810
What are you waiting for? Get on.

574
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Let's go. Driver.

575
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,890
I wonder if Qiu has solved the matter of Zhou Ziqian.

576
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,930
Rongrong.

577
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,180
Xia Yao just changed her clothes.

578
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,910
The director asked us to complete the one-person interview now.

579
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,150
Okay.

580
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,800
And...

581
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,610
I just saw Xia Yao's boyfriend come over.

582
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,650
Guess who he is?

583
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,770
Liang Chuan.

584
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,530
Is the shade of the lipstick I'm using today

585
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,200
not suitable for me?

586
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,290
Let me take a look.

587
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,260
It's okay, baby. You look good in any way.

588
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,260
They look great together.

589
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,480
Is he Liang Chuan?

590
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,680
Yes.

591
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,430
Didn't you meet him before?

592
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,280
Can't you remember again?

593
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,560
I would like to ask

594
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,110
if this place is in this building?

595
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
Can we start now?

596
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,180
It's going to start.

597
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,770
Okay, let's start.

598
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,560
There are fifteen questions in total.

599
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,640
The content of the interview has been confirmed with your staff before.

600
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,320
Let's get started if there's no problem.

601
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,140
If this person is Liang Chuan,

602
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,900
then who was that person last time?

603
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,320
If he was not bad and helped me,

604
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,830
wouldn't I be doing something wrong?

605
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,820
What's wrong with you today?

606
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,400
Why are you so distracted?

607
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,530
You seem to have been like this since a while ago.

608
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:13,930
Is that true?

609
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:19,480
♫I haven't written to others since October♫

610
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,770
I don't seem to be like that.

611
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,780
I see.

612
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,440
♫I'm just a little composer♫

613
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,280
You've been staring at Liang Chuan today.

614
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,670
You're not envious of Xia Yao

615
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,900
for having such a good boyfriend, right?

616
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,200
♫Never mind these bad things and put them in the corner♫

617
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,250
But that's normal.

618
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,850
I am the same as you.

619
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,360
♫Just think about what it's worth♫

620
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,570
Unfortunately,

621
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,630
Liang Chuan already has a girlfriend.

622
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:41,570
♫Focus on the things that will make you feel better♫

623
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,820
I don't envy her.

624
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,830
I have a question for you.

625
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,470
♫It will make you happier♫

626
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,520
I made a mistake

627
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,010
and I'm sorry for the person I hurt.

628
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,420
♫I've been thinking about you lately♫

629
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,680
But for some objective reasons,

630
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,130
I haven't seen him for a long time.

631
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,550
If it were you,

632
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,760
would you go find him and apologize?

633
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,530
♫You know I'm happy to hear you talk and you are happy to share♫

634
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,230
Apologize...

635
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,930
♫The way you look at me I can't help getting close to you♫

636
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,550
Of course you should apologize.

637
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,620
Think about it.

638
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,950
If you don't apologize,

639
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,730
you will always think about it.

640
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,320
♫No one loves you as much as I do♫

641
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,410
That would make you unhappy, wouldn't it?

642
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,980
But I don't know him.

643
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,900
How did you hurt him

644
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,200
if you didn't even know him?

645
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,110
It's a long story.

646
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,700
What?

647
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:23,850
Come in.

648
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,220
It's such a big place.

649
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,110
It's a good thing I'm here.

650
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,290
Otherwise you would be scared.

651
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,090
Me?

652
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,590
Weren't you afraid of the dark when you were a kid?

653
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,400
Not anymore?

654
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,900
It's fine if you still are.

655
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:37,970
I'll protect you.

656
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,860
I'm not afraid.

657
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,090
Don't you usually train at night?

658
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,690
The training time is fixed.

659
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,860
This is my first night training.

660
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,680
Thank you

661
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,420
for giving me a new experience of training at night.

662
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,510
What is this?

663
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,220
[Shooting record sheet]

664
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,870
Shooting record sheet.

665
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,440
You are at the first place?

666
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,750
What do you mean by that tone?

667
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,270
Who knows if it's true.

668
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,870
I can't see it anyway.

669
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:07,920
You don't believe me?

670
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,460
Whatever you say.

671
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,200
I don't want to hear that.

672
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,820
I'll show you now.

673
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,390
You are so childish.

674
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,460
Go practice now.

675
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,100
I'll just sit here and look for some useful information.

676
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,470
Hurry up.

677
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,440
♫Her smile♫

678
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,450
♫The second under the sun♫

679
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,370
♫A dense diary♫

680
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,530
♫I can't write how fabulous he is♫

681
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,460
♫I thought she didn't know♫

682
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,540
♫She's happy and young♫

683
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,950
♫Like a breeze like a warm sun♫

684
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:20,200
♫My face blushes in June for the first time♫

685
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,970
♫I can't hide my feelings for you♫

686
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:27,000
♫I want the whole world to know how much I like you♫

687
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,240
♫A world without you would be very lonely♫

688
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,070
♫I prefer the breeze to fly over with the clouds♫

689
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,100
♫No rain outside the class♫

690
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,350
♫I swore then♫

691
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,600
♫I'll protect you from the thunder♫

692
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,680
♫I'm peeping at you in my nap♫

693
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,680
♫I miss you every morning♫

694
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,120
♫When the sun shines on your gentle side face♫

695
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,340
Zhou Ziqian.

696
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,120
Did you finish?

697
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,420
♫At that moment♫

698
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,430
Yeah.

699
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,470
♫I swear♫

700
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,810
♫I love you so much♫

701
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,610
♫I listen to the sound of the blue sky♫

702
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,020
♫Spring Breeze and Lunar Symphony♫

703
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,150
Let's go.

704
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,600
♫You're the most amazing book♫

705
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,720
♫And the only thing that makes me keep wathing♫

706
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,120
Boring.

707
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,110
The person who would do such a thing

708
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,550
must be someone

709
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,650
who stood downstairs

710
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,730
to yall girls' names out back in high school

711
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,300
and caused trouble frequently.

712
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,870
You can tell that?

713
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,480
Of course.

714
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,610
You've dated a lot of girls in high school, right?

715
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,690
You're wrong. Not a single one.

716
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,190
What about you?

717
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,690
Did you have any boys you liked in high school?

718
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,420
No.

719
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,150
That's because you didn't meet me in high school.

720
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,750
With our personalities,

721
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,590
we will definitely fight if we meet in high school.

722
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,320
Why are you so happy?

723
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,680
Ye Qiao agreed to participate in our show in the afternoon.

724
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,150
Then several other guests who were hesitating

725
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,630
also called us.

726
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:03,850
Great.

727
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,200
Other guests were confirmed.

728
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,070
Now if you agree,

729
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,780
we'll have all the guests.

730
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,060
-If it's fast... -Wait.

731
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,080
Me?

732
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,030
Yes.

733
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,320
You.

734
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,490
Didn't I tell you last time?

735
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,510
You agreed last time.

736
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,770
This time, we'll...

737
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,780
-Last time was last time. -This time...

738
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,400
This time is this time.

739
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,650
Have you chosen

740
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,160
all the other guests?

741
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,540
Yes.

742
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,610
You're the only one left.

743
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,360
So

744
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,710
I'm the most important guest?

745
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,620
Of course.

746
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,020
It turns out I'm so important.

747
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,000
I'll have to think about it then.

748
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,220
I was locked up for several hours today

749
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,230
and it caused a serious psychological damage

750
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,900
on me.

751
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,170
Although I feel a little better

752
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,320
now,

753
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,360
I don't think I'm fully recovered.

754
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,110
What do you think?

755
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,620
Will my ideas work for you?

756
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,480
You can tell me first,

757
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,560
but whether I agree with it or not

758
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,570
is another matter.

759
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,290
Then it's not necessary.

760
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,460
Good.

761
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,980
My mood suddenly got a lot better.

762
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,330
I can think about this.

763
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,679
Think about it...

764
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,580
Of course you need to think about it.

765
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,989
So how many days do you need to think about it?

766
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,090
One?

767
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,260
Two?

768
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,570
It depends on your sincerity.

769
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:32,590
How can I get him to agree?

770
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,350
Did I treat you bad?

771
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,170
I like you so much.

772
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,389
If you don't agree...

773
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,219
Do you want to see me disappointed?

774
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,500
You like me?

775
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,690
You've never experienced this before.

776
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,630
The more you try

777
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,679
to find something,

778
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,840
the harder you can find it.

779
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,429
It will be there

780
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
when you don't want to look for it.

781
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,500
So, don't wait anymore.

782
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,140
Time flies.

783
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,110
Day after day.

784
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,960
[Let's Meet Now]

785
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,990
I feel like I haven't experienced anything yet

786
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,980
and time has passed.
