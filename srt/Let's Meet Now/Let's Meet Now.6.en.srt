5
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,920
How do I get him to agree to the variety show?

6
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,310
How am I supposed to find him?

7
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,120
Why is it so hard?

8
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,380
I was almost there

9
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,340
when Zhou Ziqian appeared.

10
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,539
I can't believe he was putting on a show with me.

11
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,740
I called him so many times this morning,

12
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,870
but he wouldn't come out.

13
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,410
There's nothing you can do.

14
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,610
You are wrong first.

15
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,600
But at least you have the right goal.

16
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,700
I don't even know where this guy is.

17
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,789
Didn't you say he's an athlete?

18
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,560
I saw him in uniform last time.

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,570
Last time I saw him,

20
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,289
it was near their athletes' dormitory.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,110
He must be an athlete.

22
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,640
But I've been looking for him for so long lately,

23
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,270
and I can't find him.

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,320
You can ask Zhou Ziqian for help.

25
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,720
If they are all from the Jiangyi sports team,

26
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,690
I'm sure Zhou Ziqian can help you find him.

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,540
I'll call and ask him.

28
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:07,890
Wait.

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,530
You need to tell him in detail.

30
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,490
What does this guy look like?

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,450
You can't talk this thing out during lunch break.

32
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,040
You should talk in person.

33
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,610
But didn't you say you couldn't ask him out?

34
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,220
Qiu,

35
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,180
are you trying to use me as an excuse to ask him out?

36
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,660
Why are you so quick

37
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,780
with me?

38
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,310
It's the 11th lap.

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,560
Maybe coach forgot about us.

40
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,790
This is the 10th lap.

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,350
You're so cool.

42
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,570
You trained so late last night.

43
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,829
And you're acting like nothing happened today.

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,510
Zhou Ziqian.

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,280
Your phone call.

46
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,840
Hello, Rongrong.

47
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,370
Song Rongrong?

48
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,710
Why does she want with you?

49
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,240
Well, I need your help.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,500
Can you help me find someone at the gym?

51
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,120
Looking for someone? Sure.

52
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,650
Tell me more.

53
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,650
Qiu said I couldn't say it over the phone.

54
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,790
What?

55
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,210
I was wrong.

56
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,030
I mean that guy is special,

57
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,780
so I think it's better to say it in person.

58
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,680
Okay.

59
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,770
I'll meet you there in a minute.

60
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,740
Okay.

61
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:53,000
What are you doing?

62
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,730
I can't believe Song Rongrong didn't ask me for help.

63
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,110
There must be something wrong.

64
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,710
I'll go with you.

65
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:00,600
Okay.

66
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:01,840
Let's go.

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,240
Let's sit a little longer.

68
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,030
I'm not tired.

69
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,840
You guys go ahead.

70
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,070
Rongrong asked me to come here.

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,480
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,820
I...

73
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,240
I was just passing by.

74
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,970
Anyway, we asked you to come here.

75
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,500
Why is he here too?

76
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,700
We've known each other for so many years.

77
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,370
Why didn't you ask me for help

78
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,400
with this kind of thing?

79
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,750
This is ridiculous.

80
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,720
Actually, Qiu...

81
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,510
Let's get down to business first.

82
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,650
Get down to business.

83
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,170
By the way,

84
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,850
you said you were looking for someone.

85
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,380
He's probably an athlete?

86
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,400
Yes.

87
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,110
Then why did you ask Zhou Ziqian for help?

88
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,909
You should come to me.

89
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,110
I know someone

90
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,480
on the Jiangyi sports team.

91
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,760
The cafeteria lady on the gymnastics team

92
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,850
and the cleaning uncle on the swim team.

93
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,070
I have a lot of connections.

94
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,830
You don't understand.

95
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,740
What's his name?

96
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,670
I don't know.

97
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,770
You don't know?

98
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,120
What does he look like?

99
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,770
I know that.

100
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,990
Tell me more.

101
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,110
You said he's special.

102
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,830
It should be easy to find him.

103
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,160
He...

104
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,860
is a man.

105
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,290
He has black hair.

106
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,659
And he is not fat.

107
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,690
He has two eyes, one nose and one mouth.

108
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,440
And...

109
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,900
Can you tell me something that I don't have?

110
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,940
Handsome.

111
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,909
I don't think you can describe it very well.

112
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,880
Let me show you the gym

113
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,230
while everyone's resting.

114
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:56,930
Now?

115
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,010
There are a lot of people eating now.

116
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,409
You can look for him carefully.

117
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,940
Well, okay.

118
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,710
Qiu, we're leaving.

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,810
Bye.

120
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,620
Now that we're here,

121
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,620
should we get some more food,

122
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,280
talk or something?

123
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,220
Ji Qiu,

124
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,990
Rongrong could have just asked Gao Yuan.

125
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,910
But she called me.

126
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,580
You asked her to do that?

127
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,680
So you wanted to ask me out?

128
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,659
Is it that obvious?

129
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,780
Well, actually...

130
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,440

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,970
If you don't promise me,

170
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,830
♫All the stores are vending love♫

171
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,909
can you bear to see me disappointed?

172
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,070
Like... Like me?

173
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,840
I didn't say I wouldn't participate.

174
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,630
So you mean...

175
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,750
I need you to give me three things.

176
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,390
What is it?

177
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,100
I haven't decided yet.

178
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,210
I'll let you know when I figure it out.

179
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,300
Besides,

180
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,630
since I'm on the show after the game,

181
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,150
if I'm not playing well,

182
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,130
it definitely has an impact.

183
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,180
I don't want my hands to be tired

184
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,760
before the game.

185
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,430
Of course.

186
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,020
The shrimp looks good.

187
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,580
But the shell...

188
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
Don't let this shrimp shell

189
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,200
cut your hand.

190
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,940
I know how to peel shrimp.

191
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,710
I'll do it.

192
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,240
Remember to keep the shrimp whole,

193
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,059
or it won't taste good.

194
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,230
Okay.

195
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,280
Can someone explain to me

196
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,280
what this is?

197
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,870
The guy Song Rongrong was looking for.

198
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,570
Are you sure we can find him based on this?

199
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,770
Don't mind it.

200
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,160
It was drawn according to the description.

201
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,690
Xiao Liu's drawing is the best one.

202
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,380
Yes.

203
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,660
I think

204
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,680
my drawing is better than his.

205
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,540
Show me.

206
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,210
Confidence is good,

207
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,880
but overconfidence is a problem.

208
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,360
Anyway, starting today,

209
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,640
you're gonna have to help find him.

210
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,770
Pay attention to

211
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,320
the canteen, swimming pool and badminton hall.

212
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,740
My happiness depends on you.

213
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,510
No, I didn't mean that.

214
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,120
I promised to help her find him.

215
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,620
How embarrassed I am if I can't find him.

216
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,890
If I lose face, could I still be happy?

217
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,290
Yuan, don't worry.

218
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,360
We'll look for him very carefully.

219
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,560
Yes, this gym is not big.

220
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,830
I'm sure we can find him.

221
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,490
Let's go.

222
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,400
Exactly the same.

223
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,550
I think mine is better.

224
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,760
Don't worry.

225
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,150
All my brothers are here.

226
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,140
I'm gonna help you find this guy.

227
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,720
Everyone, stop.

228
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,080
Assemble.

229
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,030
I'd like you to meet a new player.

230
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,670
This is Xu Wang.

231
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,050
He just transferred from the next provincial team.

232
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,310
He'll train with the first team.

233
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:39,760
Hello, everyone.

234
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,870
This is Gao Yuan, Zhou Ziqian.

235
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,060
They are playing in the national league later.

236
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,850
It's too late this time.

237
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,060
I guess you'll have to race together next time.

238
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,110
Mr. Zhang is so happy.

239
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,910
Is Xu Wang particularly good?

240
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,610
So curious about him? You can compete with him.

241
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,210
I'm not curious.

242
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,150
What are you murmuring about?

243
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,210
There's a bed available in Gao Yuan's dorm.

244
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,030
You can live with him.

245
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,060
My deluxe room is gone.

246
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,700
But it would be nice to have one more person.

247
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,840
We can talk in the evening.

248
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,400
Do you snore?

249
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,540
No.

250
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,640
I snore. We can complement.

251
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,890
What are you talking about?

252
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,700
Get back to training.

253
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,750
I'll show you around.

254
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,410
Ziqian, keep an eye on them for me.

255
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,280
This way.

256
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,840
This is the lounge.

257
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,510
There's also a separate lounge nearby.

258
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,840
A player suddenly appeared on our team.

259
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,230
You...

260
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,860
You're late.

261
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,230
The sausages were all sold out.

262
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,400
Would you like egg dumplings?

263
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,810
You pissed them off?

264
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,690
I'm here to learn shooting.

265
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,220
I don't care about them.

266
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,770
They are like that.

267
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,090
You looked exactly like me the other day.

268
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,970
I asked them about a guy.

269
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,900
I hadn't even said a word yet, they started to hate me.

270
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,570
By the way,

271
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,850
do you know this person?

272
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,680
No.

273
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,920
Oh no.

274
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,700
I really can't find him.

275
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,980
Didn't you say you were sure you'd find him?

276
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,940
I've been searching the whole gym

277
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,830
for days.

278
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,120
There should be someone

279
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,010
who's cute and has seen you before.

280
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,750
-But... -Really?

281
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,050
Me.

282
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,320
Zhou Ziqian is one of them.

283
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,510
Xiao Wu and Xiao Liu are so much worse.

284
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,990
So no one else.

285
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,430
Are you sure the guy you're looking for is an athlete?

286
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,050
Now that you mention it,

287
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,240
I'm a little unsure.

288
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,490
It's okay. I'll keep looking.

289
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,360
It doesn't matter if you can't find him.

290
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
I just want to say sorry.

291
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,500
I don't think we can rush this.

292
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,900
Yes.

293
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,770
Have you ever had such an experience?

294
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,310
The more you look for something,

295
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,660
the less likely you are to find it.

296
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,500
When you don't want to look for it,

297
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,910
it appeared.

298
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,130
So,

299
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,350
you have to wait.

300
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,250
♫I haven't written to others since October♫

301

I'm sure that's something girls love about you.

314
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,700
If I were a girl, I would marry you.

315
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,370
You're kidding.

316
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,560
I was just paying a little attention.

317
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:00,780
Hey, Xu Wang.

318
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,640
I want to ask you a question.

319
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,070
You're the best in Suyang Province.

320
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,720
Why are you on our team?

321
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,580
Because your team is better.

322
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,990
Right. Because we have Zhou Ziqian.

323
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,170
But with you here,

324
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,320
our team must be better.

325
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,000
I watched his first game in China.

326
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,360
♫How many days I haven't kept in touch with you♫

327
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,740
He played very steadily.

328
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,750
What a coincidence.

329
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,730
He watched all your games yesterday.

330
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,950
♫Do you remember the conversations still♫

331
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,770
You haven't talked to him

332
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,960
in all these days,

333
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,840
but I think you two are gonna get along well.

I'm two years older than you.

501
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,050
Xu Wang, let me see yours.

502
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,490
[Psychology Age: 40]

503
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,610
Forty.

504
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,130
Forty? I told you that wasn't true at all.

505
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,020
Such a handsome young man

506
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,480
is not even over 18.

507
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,380
It must have gone too far.

508
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,920
Right? I think so, too.

509
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,870
It's not true.

510
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,190
This test is just for fun.

511
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,460
Don't take it too seriously.

512
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,250
Some are accurate.

513
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,320
Some are not so accurate.

514
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,150
Speaking of pressure,

515
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,080
I hope that when you reduce the pressure,

516
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,310
you won't suppress your emotions first.

517
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,120
Sometimes the smile is a burden.

518
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,440
We can tell a person's mood

519
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,540
at the moment from his expression.

520
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,960
So I want you to be who you are

521
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,490
when you face me.

522
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,090
And I'll be able to help you better.

523
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,520
Mr. Zhou, can you help me with a demonstration?

524
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,340
Are you nervous?

525
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,910
No, no.

526
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,670
The second you hesitated

527
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,790
has already told me the answer.

528
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,470
There's too much chance in a problem.

529
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,650
Ask a few more questions.

530
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,220
Okay.

531
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,530
Do you like apples?

532
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,290
Yes.

533
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:12,870
Truth.

534
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,580
Do you think you're handsome?

535
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,230
No?

536
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,280
Do you think you can win the championship?

537
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,500
-Yes. -Truth.

538
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,850
Do you hate me?

539
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,860
Of course not. Mr. Fu loves joking.

540
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,050
Truth.

541
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,750
It can be seen that

542
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,950
a person's first reaction is often the most real.

543
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,260
So I hope you can stay calm

544
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,690
in the following psychological counseling.

545
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,690
Calm down

546
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,960
and listen to every question I ask.

547
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,540
Mr. Fu,

548
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,010
I have a question.

549
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,470
Go ahead.

550
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,830
I've been waking up in the morning with a tightness in my chest

551
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,440
and a lack of breath.

552
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,430
Half of my shoulder is always numb.

553
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,760
But I'm healthy.

554
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,150
Is it psychological?

555
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,480
I don't think it's physical.

556
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,930
In fact, it may be because of the loss of energy and blood.

557
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,340
Plus, you're taking it too seriously.

558
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,150
You mental overload

559
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,640
is causing difficulty breathing.

560
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,990
-As for the shoulder... -Mr. Fu.

561
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,350
Don't you think that's what happens

562
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,880
when we sleep with our arms on our side?

563
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,610
You knew this was the reason,

564
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,040
and you slept in this position

565
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,380
for several days.

566
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,910
We can't rule out the possibility of psychological problems.

567
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,250
Mr. Zhou,

568
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,170
call me if you have any questions,

569
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,240
and I'll do my best to help you.

570
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,220
Wow.

571
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,230
You have no idea what I've been through today.

572
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,080
There were so many people in the room.

573
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,670
He only asked me questions.

574
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:56,710
Was that reasonable?

575
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,760
Normally,

576
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,060
existence is reasonable.

577
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,230
I wonder if Fu Qile has a problem with me.

578
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,930
He asked me

579
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,030
for an hour and three minutes out of two hours.

580
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,360
Doesn't that tell us something?

581
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,280
It's a little weird when you say it like that.

582
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,440
So you're here to talk to us

583
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,240
because you want revenge?

584
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,550
Or you want to lock Fu up tomorrow

585
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,690
so you can never see each other again.

586
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,750
No.

587
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,010
Ji Qiu,

588
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,130
You know what Fu Qile hates, what he fears,

589
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,190
and what his flaws are, right?

590
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,350
I know,

591
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,720
but I can't say it for nothing.

592
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,010
That's it?

593
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,720
-I don't think anyone is... -I know.

594
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,400
I know everything

595
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,580
Qiu knows.

596
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,420
Rongrong, have more snacks

597
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,870
to replenish your energy. Let's talk slowly.

598
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,170
To be honest, Fu has many shortcomings.

599
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,030
Tell me more.

600
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,130
He's so handsome.

601
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,510
Every time we go out, girls ask him for his WeChat.

602
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,470
Too much hassle.

603
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,660
Besides, he knows so much.

604
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,620
When I talk to him, I feel like I've never been to school.

605
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,280
And he's so quick,

606
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,770
I always lose games with him.

607
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,580
-And...
-This...

608
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,990
is a weakness?

609
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,110
Yes.

610
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,790
I'm sorry.

611
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,520
Sorry.

612
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,840
I'm leaving.

613
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,350
Didn't I just say weakness?

614
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,440
What do you think?

615
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,130
I know.

616
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,800
Fu's greatest weakness is that he can't talk very well.

617
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,300
So people who can be friends with him

618
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,210
are not very smart.

619
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,340
Did Zhou Ziqian leave something behind?

620
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,450
Fu.

621
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,620
You have no idea what I've been through today.

622
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,950
It was kind of a career hiccup running into Zhou Ziqian.

623
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,720
So you watched him for one hour and three minutes?

624
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,260
It's not that dramatic.

625
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,900
One hour and one minute tops.

626
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,400
How do you know?

627
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,080
What are you doing up at night?

628
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,860
I'm thirsty.

629
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,430
What took you so long to get back?

630
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,550
I talked to Ji Qiu and Rongrong about something.

631
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,200
Brother,

632
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,530
you hang out with so many amazing girls every day,

633
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,950
why are you still single?

634
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,920
So many?

635
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,420
Ji Qiu, Rongrong,

636
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,080
and me.

637
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,380
I'm serious.

638
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,550
Why are you not in a hurry?

639
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,320
You don't seem to get it.

640
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Let me tell you.

641
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,480
Even if a girl likes you, she won't say it easily.

642
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,050
If you really like her, tell her.

643
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,270
Girls won't like you if they wait too long.

644
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,010
You're a kid.

645
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,690
So what?

646
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,670
Nobody has ever been in love.

647
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,090
Don't look down on me.

648
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,850
I'm gonna find a boyfriend as soon as I'm an adult.

649
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,680
So you're running around after other boys,

650
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,850
just to get ready for a boyfriend?

651
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,680
What are you talking about?

652
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,110
I'm not talking to you.

653
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,450
By the way, go to the library by yourself tomorrow.

654
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,920
It's not on my way to school.

655
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,550
Come on, brother.

656
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,570
You're the best.

657
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,250
I told my classmates that

658
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,800
that you would send me.

659
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,310
You can't embarrass me.

660
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,860
I'm going to the shooting team tomorrow.

661
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,200
Zhou Ziqian seems to be there.

662
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,620
What did you say?

663
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,560
I said we couldn't risk big things for the sake of small ones.

664
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,490
Your sister is an adult.

665
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,740
I won't get lost.

666
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,480
So, brother,

667
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,110
can you give me a ride?

668
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,290
No.

669
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,830
Go to your library.

670
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,490
Brother, I want an autograph.

671
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,950
I'm going to work.

672
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,220
You're the best.

673
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,000
I just want an autograph.

674
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,590
Brother, let me massage your leg.

675
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,830
Is it comfortable?

676
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,140
Let that go.

677
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,370
That's impossible.

678
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,270
You sure you don't want to do this for me?

679
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,160
I'm not gonna be happy until you give it to me.

680
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,990
If I wasn't happy,

681
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,140
I wanted to go talk to Ji Qiu.

682
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,740
What if I accidentally

683
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,420
tell Ji Qiu that you like her?

684
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,420
Don't talk nonsense.

685
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,610
I've been talking nonsense for a long time.

686
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,680
Besides, I'm not talking nonsense.

687
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,790
I don't know whose diary said

688

2012, sunny,

689
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,360
Ji Qiu's birthday is a week away.

690
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,870
My mood is the same as the weather today.

691
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,510
Is an autograph that what you're asking for? Simple.

692
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,180
How many do you want?

693
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,430
One is enough?

694
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,620
You're the best.

695
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,670
I can't take it.

696
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,410
I'll get an autograph for my sister.

697
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,220
No, no.

698
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,430
How could my sister like Zhou Ziqian?

699
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,100
I have a colleague.

700
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,410
Fu, what's wrong?

701
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,370
He's been out and about all morning.

702
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,270
Why would he take a picture?

703
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,430
Fu, yesterday's meeting...

704
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,360
Fu.

705
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,650
Have you got the electronic version of yesterday's meeting?

706
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,320
Yes, I do.

I'll send it to you.

708
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,500
There's no rush.

709
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,780
I should have said no.

your pen...

719

You have to get me an autograph.

720
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:41,890
Promise me.

721

You're doing such a good job.

Aren't you going back?

727

I'm afraid you don't understand,

728
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,520
so I'll just stand here

729
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,640
and answer it.

730
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,460
I have a bad feeling.

731
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,720
All right.

732
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,960
That's a lot of questions. Hurry up.

733

My hands are sore

from the long morning training with the gun.

I'm struggling with a pen. I can't write this much now.

738
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,950
I'm in a healthy state of mind,

739
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,530
so let's just forget this test.

Struggling with a pen?

00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,900
I studied a little surgery.

742

Let me give you a massage.

743
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,120
No, no.

744
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:10,429
I suddenly feel better.

What?

749
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,020
I need you to stay.

Peace be with you.

Mr. Fu.

Look.

She's angry?

757

She didn't tell me there were so many people.
