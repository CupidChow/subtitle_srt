5
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,530
If I bring the team assistant,

6
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,980
will she think I'm finicky?

7
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,170
I think she will.

8
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,350
What are you talking about?

9
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,830
Are you talking to me?

10
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,539
Yes.

11
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,300
Zhou Ziqian.

12
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:23,900
When are we leaving tomorrow?

13
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,150
Actually,

14
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,289
you don't have to go with me.

15
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:31,320
How about I go talk to the coach?

16
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,320
No.

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,039
I wanted to go.

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,710
I've watched many of your games

19
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:38,229
and I think you're amazing.

20
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,150
I really wanted to know you.

21
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,120
The coach is calling me.

22
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,220
I'm leaving.

23
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,289
So soon?

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,039
He works so hard.

25
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,350
I'm sure

26
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,200
Xu Wang raises it better than this.

27
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,580
What's wrong?

28
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,740
The printer is broken again.

29
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,800
Chen tried hard today but couldn't fix it.

30
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,310
I went to the company next door to print it.

31
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,960
It's broken again?

32
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,990
Xu Wang is good at physics.

33
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,880
He should be able to fix it fast if he's here.

34
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,730
Does this have anything to do with physics?

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,040
Who is Xu Wang anyway?

36
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,470
Oh, right.

37
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,910
A friend of mine.

38
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:30,730
By the way,

39
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,220
I just bought many.

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,610
Thank you.

41
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,500
I don't think Xu Wang has tasted

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,210
this kind of candy produced in Jiangyi.

43
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,220
You've been talking about him all day.

44
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,750
Who is this Xu Wang?

45
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,970
Your boyfriend?

46
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,520
No.

47
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,540
Don't joke about this.

48
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,829
Well, if I may say,

49
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,700
at your age,

50
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,610
you should have a boyfriend.

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,950
Hey, are you free tonight?

52
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,860
Go somewhere with me.

53
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,190
Tonight?

54
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,510
Where?

55
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,340
Is it fun?

56
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,440
Trust me.

57
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,680
It'll be fun.

58
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,080
Not bad. You can drink a lot.

59
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,910
This is not fun at all.

60
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,590
This is a blind date organized by my friends.

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,890
Don't worry.

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,450
These boys are quite decent.

63
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,690
You can start by getting to know each other.

64
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,930
But I don't want to.

65
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,079
Try some meat.

66
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:27,570
Xu Wang.

67
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,790
Why Xu Wang again?

68
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,790
How many times

69
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,690
have you called his name today?

70
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,690
I saw him.

71
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,070
Oh no.

72
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,730
If he knows I'm on a blind date,

73
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,850
he will misunderstand me, won't he?

74
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,600
What should I do?

75
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,410
Who is this girl?

76
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,350
I've never seen her before.

77
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,310
Her name is Song Rongrong.

78
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,750
She came with me today.

79
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,329
No wonder you're so pretty.

80
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,650
I wouldn't have forgotten if I had seen her.

81
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,220
Since you're here,

82
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,370
make some friends.

83
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,340
You have to drink.

84
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,240
That's right.

85
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,190
How can you not drink?

86
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:10,870
Bottom up.

87
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,590
Come on, Ding Ding.

88
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,860
Cheers.

89
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,440
Cheers.

90
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,780
Well, Ding Ding,

91
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,790
I have something to do.

92
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,580
How about I...

93
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,540
Rongrong, right?

94
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,420
Did anyone say you look like a celebrity?

95
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,850
No.

96
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,830
The one with short hair.

97
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,080
The one who likes wearing tank tops, right?

98
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,300
Yes, that one.

99
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,409
Her waist is so thin, and her legs are so long that I feel...

100
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,020
Excuse us, Rongrong.

101
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,400
We are all quite straightforward.

102
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,240
Please don't mind.

103
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,820
The girl called Rongrong doesn't look smart.

104
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,780
Isn't that what you want?

105
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,030
Don't think I didn't see it.

106
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,580
You couldn't take your eyes off of her.

107
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,750
That kind of girl.

108
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,180
If you talk to her more, she will think you like her.

109
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,690
They're easy to fool.

110
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,330
But in terms of the length of legs,

111
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,840
Susu has the longest legs.

112
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,940
Did you see Xia, over there?

113
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,140
Her waist is also very thin. You must haven't noticed.

114
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,040
And that Ding Ding.

115
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,130
She must have had many boyfriends.

116
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,710
But I don't know what tricks will work on her.

117
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,640
You should get that fool first.

118
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,820
That's easy.

119
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,850
Just a matter of two more bottles of wine.

120
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,830
Remember to order more wine later.

121
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:27,970
Where were you?

122
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,760
Keep drinking.

123
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,480
Come on.

124
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,610
Come on.

125
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:33,990
Song Rongrong.

126
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,890
Let me send you back.

127
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,480
Xu Wang.

128
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,210
Xu Wang?

129
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,940
So Xu Wang is a real person.

130
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,970
Who are you?

131
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,250
Why are you leaving at will?

132
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,130
Rongrong, sit down.

133
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,040
You're going to...

134
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,659
Let go. It hurts.

135
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,159
If you touch her again,

136
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,760
what hurts won't only be your hands.

137
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,000
What do you mean?

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,780
Right.

139
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,840
What's wrong with my friend?

140
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,159
You want to fight?

141
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,790
Don't fight.

142
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,290
We're all good people.

143
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,260
Let's talk.

144
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,710
Talk?

145
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,460
About what?

146
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,060
About who has the longest legs,

147
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,130
or whose waist is the thinnest?

148
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,990
Or who seems to have had the most boyfriends?

149
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,300
Didn't you two talk enough in the men's room?

150
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,350
Really?

151
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,680
Can't you tell?

152
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,830
They were heard.

153
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,580
What's wrong with you?

154
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,110
Don't talk nonsense.

155
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,250
I never said that.

156
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,180
He's talking nonsense.

157
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,020
Did you come here together?

158
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,260
Can I take her home first?

159
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,960
Okay. No problem.

160
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,350
Rongrong said she wanted to go home early.

161
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,970
Right?

162
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,030
Hurry up.

163
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,660
Go.

164
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,030
You're leaving already?

165
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,159
If I see you again,

166
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,510
I...

167
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,920
I'll call the police.

168
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,170
Call the police?

169
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,430
We should call the police.

170
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,630
Did you look in the mirror before you went outside?

171
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:57,030
♫I haven't written to others since October♫

172
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,950
Why are you here today?

173
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,940
An old friend is here.

174
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:01,020
♫I'm just a little composer♫

175
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,870
We had a dinner date.

176
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,920
Can you just leave like this?

177
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,800
It's okay. He's gone already.

178
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,780
♫Never mind these bad things and put them in the corner♫

179
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,510
Why were you so angry just now?

180
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,120
Although we haven't known each other for long，

181
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,940
♫Just think about what it's worth♫

182
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,180
I never saw you like this.

183
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,330
Like this?

184
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:19,120
♫Focus on the things that will make you feel better♫

185
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,620
Like what?

186
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,580
Just...different from usual.

187
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,780
You're usually patient and attentive.

188
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,820
You don't seem to care about anything.

189
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,030
♫It will make you happier♫

190
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,060
But this is the first time I've seen you like this.

191
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,000
♫I've been thinking about you lately♫

192
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,020
They bullied my friend.

193
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,110
♫You know I'm happy to hear you talk and you are happy to share♫

194
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,370
If you haven't come over today,

195
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,190
I might sit until the end.

196
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,500
♫The way you look at me I can't help getting close to you♫

197
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,200
I think I can make do with it.

198
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,930
There are things you don't have to make do with.

199
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,870
♫No one loves you as much as I do♫

200
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,909
And don't drink

201
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,120
when you are out with unfamiliar people.

202
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,760
I don't want to go on blind dates anymore.

203
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,450
Blind date?

204
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,530
No.

205
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,630
I wasn't here for a blind date.

206
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,310
No.

207
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,480
I didn't want to come here for a blind date.

208
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,710
I'm not looking for a boyfriend.

209
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,290
Let's go. I'll take you home.

210
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,060
Qiu is working overtime anyway.

211
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,800
No hurry.

212
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,450
What?

213
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,730
Nothing. Let's go.

214
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,560
Qiu, you know what...

215
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,390
She's not back yet.

216
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,120
Hello, Ding Ding?

217
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,200
I'm home.

218
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,909
How many people?

219
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,340
Only me.

220
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,230
I was looking forward to the follow-up between you two.

221
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,809
Why did you go home alone?

222
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,850
I was going home anyway.

223
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,789
Are you still there?

224
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,420
I left a long time ago.

225
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,050
Those two scumbags pissed me off.

226
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,540
Susu exposed them in the company WeChat group.

227
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,680
They are probably condemned by all the girls in the company right now.

228
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,570
Don't change the subject.

229
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,490
Listen to me.

230
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,090
Since you like your friend,

231
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,280
you should hurry up.

232
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,800
There are only few boys like him now.

233
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,880
I like him?

234
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,280
I saw it.

235
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,770
I saw sparkles in your eyes

236
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,170
when you looked at him.

237
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,250
Don't you like him?

238
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,630
Who said that?

239
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,570
Nonsense.

240
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,500
How come?

241
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,500
How come what?

242
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,140
How about this?

243
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,860
Imagine

244
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,460
if he picks you up from work every day,

245
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,780
will you be happy?

246
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,120
Yes.

247
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,910
If he asks you out,

248
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,830
will you go?

249
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,830
Yes.

250
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,200
If he tells you you are pretty,

251
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,400
will you be excited?

252
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,490
Of course.

253
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,600
That's it.

254
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,080
You must like him.

255
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,890
No.

256
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,200
Enough.

257
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,910
When girls fall in love,

258
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,030
they like to lie to themselves.

259
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,400
Think about it on your own.

260
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,670
Bye.

261
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,990
It's so hot.

262
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,180
It seems that...

263
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,410
I'm in love with him.

264
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,500
Everything is ready.

265
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Let's go through the process.

266
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:20,910
OK.

267
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,310
Have you confirmed the order of the guests coming tomorrow?

268
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,270
Yes.

269
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,870
The first one to go up is Lin Xiao.

270
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,390
She is lively and cute.

271
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,470
She'll be able to warm up the stage if she's the first.

272
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,700
Next is Xiao Chen.

273
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,900
As a member of the most popular boy group FEEL,

274
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,370
he has a very large fan base.

275
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,480
We must get the security ready in advance.

276
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,490
Next, Zhou Ziqian and Fu Qile.

277
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,420
Because neither of them is from the entertainment industry,

278
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,120
and they know each other,

279
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,570
we arranged them together.

280
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,240
Ye Qiao will be the last.

281
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,140
She usually only gets off the car

282
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,240
after all the guests are here.

283
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,430
So we may have to wait for a few minutes.

284
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,840
We need to rehearse

285
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,720
what may happen on site in advance.

286
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,780
I will be

287
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,610
Zhou Ziqian and Xiao Chen.

288
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,580
Tianyang, then you are Fu Qile.

289
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,970
Miss Ji is Ye Qiao.

290
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,130
C will be Lin Xiao.

291
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,710
I'll start first.

292
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,170
Zhou Ziqian and Fu Qile

293
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,870
are very familiar with each other.

294
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,050
At this time, the tacit understanding between men

295
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,010
must be shown by them.

296
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,360
Isn't this Mr. Fu?

297
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,930
Isn't this Mr. Zhou?

298
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,540
Brother, I missed you so much.

299
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,580
I really missed you, bro.

300
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,890
Miss Ji, should it be like this?

301
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,290
Probably.

302
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,780
I heard you two knew each other from before.

303
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,170
You must be very close.

304
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,320
Just so-so.

305
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,110
Not at all.

306
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,590
To be exact,

307
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,960
I don't know him.

308
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,270
Let's continue.

309
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,720
Although Ye Qiao is distant,

310
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,020
Lin Xiao's nickname is Little Sun.

311
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,490
She can definitely melt her.

312
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,030
Great work, Miss Ye.

313
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,370
Miss Ye.

314
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,860
Miss Lin Xiao is over there.

315
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,220
Do you want to say hello to her?

316
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,920
I can, but it's not necessary.

317
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,350
The last one, Xiao Chen.

318
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,200
Although he's young,

319
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,520
he debuted early.

320
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,590
He must be good at dealing with relationships.

321
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,080
And he's always been a considerate guy.

322
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,230
He must be good at getting along with girls.

323
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,780
Nervous?

324
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,960
No, I'm not.

325
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,960
They are all my older brothers and sisters.

326
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,920
I think I can learn a lot from them.

327
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,080
I think I'm one year younger than you.

328
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,250
Really?

329
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,610
I can't tell.

330
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,680
Maybe I look younger.

331
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,760
Five totally different young people get to know each other

332
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,950
in a variety show with no restrictions.

333
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,330
With totally different personalities,

334
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,100
there will be all kinds of sparkles among them.

335
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,980
Five kinds of completely different professional experiences.

336
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,590
There will never be awkward silence on the stage.

337
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,940
Long time no see.

338
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,220
Your skin looks nice too.

339
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,070
He's very popular online.

340
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,480
Let's take a photo.

341
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,470
OK.

342
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,680
Stand still. Ready.

343
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,040
One, two, three.

344
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,930
The most important thing is the atmosphere.

345
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,090
It will be very entertaining,

346
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,490
friendly,

347
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:32,960
and harmonious.

348
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,770
This is quite different

349
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,740
from what we imagined.

350
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,270
What's wrong?

351
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,260
Why did everyone stop talking

352
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,760
after self-introduction?

353
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,170
Ji Qiu,

354
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,970
try to communicate with the guests

355
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,460
to liven up the atmosphere.

356
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,480
No problem.

357
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,130
Good work.

358
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,660
Good work.

359
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,310
You two, say something to liven up the atmosphere.

360
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,950
The director's eyes are killing me out there.

361
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,390
What's there to say?

362
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,060
Anything.

363
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,960
Good work.

364
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,350
Did you all have breakfast?

365
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,800
Well...

366
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,770
I did.

367
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,330
Really? Me too. What a coincidence.

368
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,540
Miss Ji,

369
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,010
given this situation,

370
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,550
do you remember

371
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,150
what we predicted about the first part?

372
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,600
The first part

373
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,730
is drawing lots to decide

374
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,730
who will act alone in this show.

375
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,940
The other four

376
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,030
will be divided into two groups

377
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,000
based on the props

378
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,270
we took from their houses.

379
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,450
Two teams of two.

380
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,400
Before they start,

381
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,050
they need to be connected with an elasticity rope.

382
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,620
And the one who acts alone

383
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,490
doesn't have any restriction

384
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,590
to be fair.

385
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,480
I'm suddenly worried about

386
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,500
the one to be chosen to act alone.

387
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,080
He must be very sad

388
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,090
to be left alone.

389
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,900
How sad would it be?

390
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,350
It must be sad

391
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,650
to step out alone.

392
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,230
But it can't be helped.

393
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,220
Xiao Chen.

394
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,330
[Xiao Chen]

395
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,560
Xiao Chen.

396
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,010
It's really...

397
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,270
What a...

398
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,620
What a pity.

399
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,330
Xiao Chen, as the guest

400
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,780
who'll be acting alone for the recording today,

401
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,810
can get going to the next venue first.

402
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,770
Well,

403
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:44,710
my friends,

404
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,370
I'm leaving.

405
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,120
Well,

406
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,260
the four of you left

407
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,040
will be divided into two groups of two.

408
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,260
I won't team up with you.

409
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,520
What a coincidence. I won't either.

410
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,970
Here's the travel fee

411
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,089
to the next venue, Xiaolanshan Mountain.

412
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,099
It's all here.

413
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,089
Keep it well.

414
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,099
Fifty yuan?

415
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,380
Are you sure?

416
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,319
We tested it ourselves.

417
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,900
This is the minimum travel expense

418
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,089
to the next venue.

419
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,410
I have a small suggestion.

420
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,300
Let's split the money

421
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,390
and take care of our own half.

422
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,310
What a coincidence. I think so too.

423
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,040
Can you walk properly?

424
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,170
The road is wide. I'm not walking abnormally.

425
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,770
What are you doing?

426
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,440
The road is so wide.

427
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,840
I also want to walk on this side.

428
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,400
A famous shooting athlete

429
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,840
and a psychology lecturer.

430
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,030
Why are they like my Bai and Yuan?

431
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,420
Your kids?

432
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,280
My two shibainu dogs.

433
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,920
How about this?

434
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,560
Let's be friendly during the drive.

435
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,740
What do you mean by that?

436
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,250
For example, let go of your hand now.

437
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,300
Are you sure you want to talk like this?

438
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,030
Just like that.

439
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,620
I saw you brought an assistant this morning.

440
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,830
Where is she now?

441
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:34,940
Right.

442
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,990
Where is she?

443
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,360
Don't forget to bring the props.

444
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,370
Okay, Miss Ji.

445
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,310
Everyone is moving to the next venue.

446
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,070
Why are you still here?

447
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,050
I...I'm looking for someone.

448
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,920
Looking for someone?

449
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,680
Which team is he on?

450
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,050
Zhou Ziqian's team.

451
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,870
Zhou Ziqian?

452
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,790
I'm the new assistant of Jiangyi Shooting Team.

453
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,650
The coach asked me to come with him

454
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,690
to this shooting

455
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,300
and see if I can help.

456
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,920
I can take care of him.

457
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,130
Don't worry.

458
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,180
I won't disturb your shooting.

459
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,060
I'll just stand there and watch.

460
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,780
It's okay.

461
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,070
Everything's ready, Miss Ji. Let's go.

462
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,000
OK.

463
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,200
Zhou Ziqian and others have left.

464
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,970
Would you like to go to the next venue

465
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,030
with me and wait there?

466
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,220
Is that okay?

467
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,330
Sure.

468
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,050
Okay, thank you.

469
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,170
The car is over there.

470
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,010
You go first.

471
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,700
Okay.

472
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,290
Thank you.

473
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,860
Assistant?

474
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,490
Why didn't Zhou Ziqian tell me about it?

475
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,320
Xiao Chen disguised himself

476
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,760
to avoid being recognized by the fans

477
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,900
and got on a taxi.

478
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,500
It's like I'm watching a scene

479
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,230
from a drama about the Qing Dynasty.

480
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,410
[Ji Qiu]

481
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,640
Is there a conflict between the guests?

482
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,210
The problem is not the conflict,

483
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,730
but it's a bit too harmonious.

484
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,310
Ye Qiao,

485
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,410
look over there.

486
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,120
Isn't it beautiful?

487
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,580
Yes.

488
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,890
Ye Qiao, is your stuff heavy?

489
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,100
Do you need my help?

490
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,720
No need. Your stuff is heavy too.

491
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,670
I'll carry it myself.

492
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,830
It's okay. I can handle it.

493
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,480
Excuse me.

494
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,450
I'll change a card.

495
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,920
Please take a rest.

496
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:17,990
OK.

497
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,170
The camera was recording.

498
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,050
You said you'd carry my stuff.

499
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,420
Are you afraid that I won't be scolded after it's aired?

500
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,960
I was just afraid that you can't carry it.

501
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,780
It's not recording now.

502
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,960
You don't need to laugh.

503
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,370
You made quite a lot of mistakes

504
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,510
due to confidential issues.

505
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,420
It won't happen this time, right?

506
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,340
Ah.

507
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,370
What is it? A bug?

508
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,350
Take it away.

509
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:47,970
It's okay.

510
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,090
I got it for you.

511
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,400
It's okay.

512
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,720
You...

513
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,270
Aren't you afraid of this?

514
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,490
When I was little, I lived with my grandparents.

515
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,290
No one played with me then.

516
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,940
I was so happy when I saw them.

517
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,560
Because they could play with me for a long time.

518
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:11,840
It's okay.

519
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,910
I'll help you catch them all along the way.

520
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,080
Thank you.

521
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,410
Ye Qiao,

522
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,110
why are you afraid of bugs?

523
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,760
Are you afraid of all kinds of bugs?

524
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,080
Are you afraid of butterflies then?

525
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,130
You talk so much.

526
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,980
I do talk a lot.

527
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,870
Do you need any help from me?

528
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,880
Just talk less.

529
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,280
Mr. Fu.

530
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,000
Let's play a game.

531
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,840
No.

532
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,790
Are you afraid of losing?

533
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,770
It's just rock, paper, scissors.

534
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,500
Whoever loses

535
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,730
will carry a piece of the other's luggage.

536
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,860
Rock, paper, scissors.

537
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,260
Mr. Zhou.

538
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,150
Thank you.

539
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,620
Again.

540
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,660
The one who loses this time

541
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,300
will carry all luggage for the other one

542
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,510
for half an hour.

543
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,090
Are you sure?

544
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,220
Rock, paper, scissors.

545
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,490
It's getting late.

546
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,360
Let's go.

547
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,850
No.

548
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,400
Again.

549
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,800
For one hour this time.

550
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,160
Rock, paper, scissors.

551
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,880
Rock, paper, scissors.

552
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,770
One more.

553
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,850
Rock.

554
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,430
Scissors.

555
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,520
Paper.

556
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,390
I quit.

557
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,140
You have to carry it for

558
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,420
eight hours in total.

559
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,550
Let's play again.

560
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,330
No.

561
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,110
Come on. Last round.

562
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,290
No.

563
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,830
Mr. Zhou, try it.

564
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,520
You have a chance.

565
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,930
Just once.

566
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,670
Why are you so talkative?

567
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,030
It's almost ready.

568
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,400
We need to confirm with the guests again.

569
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,260
Miss Ji.

570
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,340
They are coming.

571
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,070
Am I seeing it right?

572
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,750
Ye Qiao is able to smile?

573
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,780
Miss Ye Qiao,

574
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,650
let's take this time to record a promotion video.

575
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,720
Let's go.

576
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:01,980
Ye Qiao.

577
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,590
Water with brown sugar.

578
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,270
Drink this. It won't take long.

579
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,330
Zheng Hui.

580
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,510
Miss Ji.

581
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,450
Why are you so tired?

582
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,710
Are Zhou Ziqian and Fu Qile back?

583
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,380
Just arrived.

584
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,700
We're the last to arrive today.

585
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,130
Mr. Zhou and Mr. Fu are quite exhausted today.

586
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,290
They didn't even have dinner.

587
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,720
There's no food left?

588
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,730
I just went to have a look.

589
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,600
The food is all cold.

590
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,660
The night recording is about to start.

591
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,550
We don't have time to buy food now.

592
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,440
I thought I'd find something for them

593
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,130
for a quick bite.

594
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,280
You take a rest.

595
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,140
I'll go find something for them.

596
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,030
Okay, thank you, Miss Ji.

597
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,870
Are you feeding pigs?

598
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,110
You didn't eat, right?

599
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,200
I specially prepared

600
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,050
sushi, fruit, and sandwich for you.

601
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,070
And drinks.

602
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,440
I don't know which one you like,

603
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,400
so I bought them all.

604
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,440
How did Coach Zhang trick you here?

605
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:01,930
With you.

606
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,950
Forget it. Stop talking.

607
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,990
I'll stop then.

608
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,020
Eat up.

609
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,120
He already had food.

610
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,400
Ji Qiu.

611
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,350
Why are you here?

612
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,450
Zhou Hui told me you didn't have dinner.

613
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,680
So I brought you some food.

614
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,690
Good. I'm hungry.

615
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,390
That's all I have.

616
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,190
It's okay.

617
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,980
This is enough.

618
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,760
Have a seat.

619
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,240
There's so much left.

620
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,990
Are you done eating?

621
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,860
I have a friend who hasn't eaten yet.

622
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,600
He's still in the tent.

623
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,550
Thank you.

624
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,870
After you eat,

625
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,710
get some rest.

626
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,730
Or after the recording starts,

627
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,840
you won't be able to sleep even if you want to.

628
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,320
There won't be

629
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,880
any strange games tonight, right?

630
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,670
This is a serious show.

631
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,210
As far as I know,

632
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,160
when you give me this look,

633
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,090
it won't be serious.

634
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,830
Nonsense.

635
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,560
Aren't you saving it for your friend?

636
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,140
He's not hungry.

637
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,780
Here.

638
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,840
Try this. This is pretty good.

639
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,790
Just eat it like this.

640
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,170
It tastes okay, right?

641
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,270
So Miss Ji and Mr. Fu are a couple.

642
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,870
No wonder they look so good together.

643
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,800
I'm done eating.

644
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,710
Miss Ji. Miss Ji.

645
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:47,860
Emergency!

646
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,990
What is it?

647
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,070
My hand carried too much weight today.

648
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,980
I can't hold chopsticks.

649
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,110
Since I can't hold chopsticks,

650
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,140
I haven't even had dinner.

651
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,840
What should I do?

652
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,550
You didn't have dinner?

653
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,840
Just a little.

654
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,240
I don't care.

655
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,090
I want this bread.

656
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,960
The same one as this.

657
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,510
Take it if you want.

658
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,970
I said I can't move my hands.

659
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,730
You can't move them?

660
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,380
It seems to be better.

661
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,390
Learn from me.

662
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,410
This is acting.

663
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,250
I'm leaving. Get ready.

664
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,050
The recording will start soon.

665
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,280
Before tonight is over,

666
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,310
we have a little game in the end.

667
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,560
The rule of this game is very simple.

668
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,570
Say something that you've never done before.

669
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,950
If a guest has done it,

670
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,500
he/she needs to fold one finger.

671
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,900
If you haven't done it, you don't need to fold it.

672
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,990
The first person who gets ten fingers folded will lose.

673
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,090
As usual,

674
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,770
the loser will be punished. Right?

675
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,750
Exactly.

676
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,660
Your crew is so good at tricks.

677
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,690
Let's talk about the punishment first.

678
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,260
We can talk about the reward first.

679
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,600
The one

680
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,410
with the most fingers left

681
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,250
can ask any of you

682
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,110
a question.

683
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,520
I like it.

684
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,920
Okay, I'll go first.

685
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,130
I've never driven a car.

686
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,880
Neither have I.

687
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,010
I've never sworn.

688
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,960
I've never worn tight pants.

689
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,650
I've never taught students.

690
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,080
Except Mr. Fu,

691
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,260
no one has done that, right?

692
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,930
I've never participated in a shooting competition.

693
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,460
Except Mr. Zhou,

694
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,010
no one has done that either, right?

695
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,640
I've never had a lecture.

696
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,520
I've never won a gold medal.

697
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,340
I've never had a sister.

698
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,020
I've never had a younger brother.

699
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,460
I've never written on the blackboard.

700
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,440
I've never walked with anyone at night.

701
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,860
I've never bought midnight snacks for anyone.

702
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,490
I've never gone shopping with anyone.

703
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,650
I've never done my homework.

704
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,600
I've never shot anyone else's target.

705
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,390
I've never asked for an autograph.

706
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,960
I've never been locked up in the bathroom.

707
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,430
Well...

708
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,760
According to the current situation,

709
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,920
Ye Qiao still has nine chances.

710
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,210
Xiao Chen has eight more chances.

711
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,450
Lin Xiao has

712
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,860
seven chances.

713
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,270
Fu Qile and Zhou Ziqian

714
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,630
each have one chance left.

715
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,930
So Ye Qiao will be the final match point.

716
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,000
OK, I'll go.

717
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,300
I've never fallen in love with anyone.

718
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,240
But what's the standard of "falling in love"?

719
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,530
If I think someone is good-looking,

720
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,810
and I'm happy to see him,

721
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,340
does this count?

722
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,290
Right, Mr. Fu.

723
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,490
In psychology,

724
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,290
what counts as "falling in love"?

725
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,450
♫I've finally got ready to see you♫

726
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:23,900
♫My heart is pounding with all kinds of feelings♫

727
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,340
If you are in love with someone,

728
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,910
you'll think of her right away when this topic is brought up.

729
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:32,370
♫How should I hold the flowers so I don't look nervous♫

730
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,370
When you are in love with someone,

731
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,160
when you see her,

732
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:38,200
♫Your city is so big♫

733
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,660
you can't help laughing.

734
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,670
You want to keep in touch with her all the time.

735
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,910
Every second you can't see her

736
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:45,720
♫I'm about to see you♫

737
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,330
feels longer than two or three seconds.

738
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,830
As long as you are with her,

739
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:52,600
♫I must act more natural than you♫

740
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,070
no matter how long it is,

741
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,960
you won't feel bored.

742
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,410
When you see her with another guy,

743
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:01,990
♫The eyes that can push my tears away♫

744
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,920
you can't help getting angry.

745
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,320
When you are in love with someone, you become a different self.

746
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,410
But everything about her

747
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:07,570
♫Why are they avoiding me♫

748
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,650
will become very meaningful.

749
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:14,290
♫I won't let you be afraid♫

750
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:20,660
♫I've finally got ready to see you♫

751
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:26,840
♫My heart is pounding with all kinds of feelings♫

752
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,540
Now Zhou Ziqian also folded a finger.

753
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,160
There are two losers now.

754
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,440
Fu Qile and Zhou Ziqian.

755
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,690
As the final winner, Ye Qiao,

756
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,320
you can ask any of them a question.

757
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,650
I'm curious about

758
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,060
Mr. Zhou's performance in the last round.

759
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,890
So this question is for you.

760
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,990
I have a question.

761
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,510
If you can call the one you love

762
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,850
on the spot of a shooting competition,

763
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,700
what would you say first?

764
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,380
I think what

765
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,470
I would say first is,

766
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,860
are you watching my game?

767
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,500
What's wrong?

768
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,600
Why does it sound so familiar?

769
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,890
Miss Ji, you didn't realize

770
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,120
this sentence has no information at all.

771
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,230
Mr. Zhou

772
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,000
was obviously joking.

773
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,260
Is that so?

774
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,840
Because we lost the game,

775
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,740
we have to stay in the same tent.

776
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,590
Are you that happy about it?

777
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,420
Let me correct it.

778
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,890
Even sharing a tent with you

779
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,250
didn't affect my mood.

780
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,670
Why are you

781
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,060
so happy today?

782
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,390
Aren't you a psychology teacher?

783
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,840
Take a guess.

784
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,360
No.

785
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,030
Are you asleep?

786
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,170
Why is the moon so round tonight?

787
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,679
No way.

788
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,750
I'm hallucinating because I've been thinking about it too much.

789
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,580
Zhou Ziqian.

790
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,750
Why are you here?

791
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,270
I'm getting a jacket from the car.

792
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,389
What are you doing here?

793
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:37,780
I came out to get some fresh air.

794
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,870
You worked hard for the recording today.

795
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,820
Go back and rest early.

796
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,580
I'm off.

797
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,380
Hey, Ji Qiu.

798
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:49,090
Look.

799
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,760
The weather is so nice today.

800
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,540
Why don't you come with me to see the stars

801
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,080
and enjoy the moon?

802
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,530
You must be tired from shooting today.

803
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,480
I heard from Zhou Hui that you almost walked back.

804
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,650
It's alright. The thing is...

805
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,340
The thing is...

806
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,850
We encountered a few games on the way, right?

807
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,830
We barely played any.

808
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,660
We didn't succeed,

809
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,540
so we didn't get to ride the vehicle.

810
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,060
How come?

811
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,400
The games we picked are all very simple.

812
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,100
How is it simple?

813
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,910
There was a game of

814
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,870
throwing stones.

815
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,870
I played it for more than 20 times,

816
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,700
but I never succeeded.

817
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,660
My hand almost cramped.

818
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,210
This game requires skills.

819
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,100
Skills?

820
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:44,870
Of course.

821
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,640
When you play this game,

822
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,780
you need to stretch your hands

823
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,500
but relax your fingers.

824
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,000
Like this? Like this?

825
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,210
Like this.

826
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,500
No.

827
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,730
It's like this.

828
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,150
Why is a shooter's hand so stiff?

829
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,240
♫I've thought about it many times♫

830
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,970
♫I have thrown away this charming and empty thing in vain♫

831
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,020
What are you looking at?

832
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:31,400
♫I pick up the pen and only remember your wish♫

833
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:29,830
I'm thinking.

834
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:35,980
♫But my mother said boys can't be too sweet♫

835
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,640
I haven't got it yet.

836
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,460
♫I want to experience so many things with you♫

837
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,350
You don't want to teach anymore?

838
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,400
♫I wish I could have all the good and bad sides of you♫

839
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,710
I don't think it's about the game.

840
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,700
It's about the person who plays.

841
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,980
♫I hope we can be the only light♫

842
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,750
♫That we can see in each other's eyes♫

843
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:59,120
♫I'll learn to be a fool♫

844
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,080
By the way,

845
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,610
your shooting team hired an assistant.

846
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,240
♫Learn to be soft-hearted even if you turn a blind eye♫

847
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,320
Why didn't you tell me?

848
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,960
I didn't know until Li Tianyang told me.

849
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,500
♫Clumsy with words but brave for you♫

850
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,210
I didn't want to bring her.

851
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,270
I'm a boy.

852
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,450
If you...

853
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,090
♫Plain and daily but romantic for life♫

854
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,490
If others think I'm finicky, it won't be cool.

855
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:17,940
I'll learn to be a fool.

856
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,360
It's rare.

857
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,670
You care about what others think.

858
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:22,350
♫Reckless and anticipated at the same time♫

859
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,890
Of course.

860
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,850
You made a fool of yourself

861
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,850
quite a lot of times in our show.

862
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,450
After the show is aired,

863
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,830
♫There will be a silent arrangement tomorrow♫

864
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,810
other people's thoughts can't be...

865
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,070
Can I bribe the staff then?

866
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:31,660
♫No sorrow, no joy, I'm so touched♫

867
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,750
It depends on how you bribe her.
