00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,690
Qiu, you're back.

6
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,040
You know what.

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,269
I went by the bookstore today

8
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,520
and I almost ran into Xu Xiang.

9
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,570
Luckily, I ran fast.

10
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,730
You still avoiding Xu Wang?

11
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,740
I have no choice.

12
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,890
I don't want to push him.

13
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,000
Qiu, what happened?

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,180
Maybe I'm a little tired.

15
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,630
I'm gonna go get some rest.

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,759
When she went out today, she was fine.

17
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,190
Why is she suddenly unhappy?

18
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,190
He's busy this weekend?

19
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,330
Did he have other plans?

20
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,910
But he wasn't that busy before.

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,470
Strange.

22
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,820
Besides, he always

23
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,630
made me angry today.

24
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,990
Ji Qiu,

25
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,890
good luck on your date.

26
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,750
Who wants to hear that?

27
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,910
I don't want to see you for a while.

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll go if I want.

29
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,920
Why do I care about what he thinks?

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,430
Why do I think so much?

31
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,440
Do I like...

32
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,030
Impossible.

33
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,610
How could it be?

34
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,500
It's getting more and more ridiculous.

35
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,320
Don't smile so nicely

36
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,880
when you take photos with others next time.

37
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,120
The homework I gave you last time,

38
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,460
you did a good job.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,980
The final exam is coming.

40
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,320
I can see

41
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,100
you are a little anxious.

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,520
At the end of this class,

43
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,190
let's relieve some stress.

44
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,310
Some words are difficult to say.

45
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,000
Now you can

46
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,820
say anything

47
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,579
that you don't dare to say.

48
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,070
Mr. Fu,

49
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,310
anything?

50
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,770
Yes.

51
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,490
I'll go first.

52
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,360
I think

53
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,160
Mr. Nie's hair has been missing a little bit lately.

54
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,410
Mr. Fu, you look very handsome today.

55
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,829
Was I not handsome before?

56
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,800
Yes.

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,010
Why does Mr. Li's lectures always overrun?

58
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,380
There's nothing good in the cafeteria every time I go there.

59
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,240
When will we install air conditioners in our dorm?

60
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,460
I want to date.

61
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,710
-Me too. -I want to lose weight.

62
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,450
I want to get rich.

63
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,790
I want to go to Tibet.

64
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,630
Meng Yang.

65
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,800
I like you.

66
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,320
♫Am I the shining star?♫

67
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,810
♫Are you fond of me?♫

68
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:38,020
♫You just stepped in sight, with your sparkly eyes♫

69
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,430
Why are you here?

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,830
Are you here for class again?

71
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,430
I have something to do here,

72
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,900
so I stopped by.

73
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,550
Kids nowadays

74
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,080
are really bold.

75
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:55,820
Kids?

76
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,940
You can't be two years older than them.

77
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,750
But

78
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,850
you're bolder.

79
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,340
Did you...

80
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,470
Talked to Ji Qiu before?

81
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,610
Do you think

82
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,350
I would tell you?

83
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,070
Hey.

84
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,870
You're too petty.

85
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,670
I like it.

86
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,920
Well...

87
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,330
When did you know Ji Qiu?

88
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,450
I've known her for a long time.

89
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,830
In high school.

90
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,640
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,950
I'm earlier than you.

92
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,010
Primary school.

93
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,950
Well...

94
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,380
Jiang Yu.

95
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,700
What do you think?

96
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,100
Why did you bring him up?

97
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,850
Nothing.

98
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,260
I was just asking.

99
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,480
I feel

100
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,850
Ji Qiu was popular

101
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,250
at school.

102
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,640
When she was in high school,

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,230
everybody knew her.

104
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,110
What was she like

105
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,080
at that time?

106
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,650
At that time,

107
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,750
she did very well.

108
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,590
And she

109
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,240
didn't follow the rules.

110
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,920
The teachers had a love-hate relationship to her.

111
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,350
She even sat beside the teacher's desk for a while.

112
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,830
In 12th grade,

113
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,930
in order not to affect our study,

114
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,770
our teacher asked us to study in the classroom

115
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,160
at the New Year's Eve Gala.

116
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,110
Later,

117
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,840
under her guidance,

118
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,910
over half of the students

119
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,210
skipped class and went to the auditorium.

120
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,700
Over half of them?

121
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,220
Who wasn't there?

122
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:35,990
I.

123
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,380
Then why did you say that?

124
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,320
Aren't you just this bold?

125
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,520
Because

126
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,490
someone had to

127
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,720
keep an eye on the teacher.

128
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,460
Before I met Ji Qiu,

129
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,330
actually,

130
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,890
I was kind of an extra person.

131
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,490
In my class,

132
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,630
only I didn't have a deskmate.

133
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,490
I always sit alone

134
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,150
when eating.

135
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,250
When I did exercise,

136
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,220
I was alone, too.

137
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,260
It's Ji Qiu

138
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,270
who was there.

139
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,020
♫I've thought about it many times♫

140
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,240
Then Rongrong.

141
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,830
To be honest,

142
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,750
♫I have thrown away this charming and empty thing in vain♫

143
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,710
I'm the lucky one.

144
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,810
That's because you don't know me.

145
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,520
If I had been here,

146
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,200
I would have protected you.

147
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,180
♫I pick up the pen and only remember your wish♫

148
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,820
You're just a primary school student.

149

♫But my mother said boys can't be too sweet♫

150
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,820
Who needs your protection?

151
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,090
I was in junior high school.

152
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,240
♫I want to experience so many things with you♫

153

♫I wish I could have all the good and bad sides of you♫

if you give up,

157
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,590
we still can be friends.

can be friends.

163
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,270
I was the one who's forcing myself.

164

♫I'll learn to be a fool♫

165
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,270
That's not the point.

166
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,890
The point is...

167
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,020
♫Learn to be soft-hearted even if you turn a blind eye♫

168
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,350
Do you think being friends

169
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,909
is a very attractive condition?

170
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,280
♫Clumsy with words but brave for you♫

171

00:07:59,409 --> 00:07:59,909
Hey.

174
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,240
Mr. Fu.

175
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,220
Why are you here?

176
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,720
♫I'll learn to be a fool♫

177
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,970
Is this your friend, Mr. Fu?

178
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,680
He's so handsome.

179
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,130
♫Reckless and anticipated at the same time♫

180
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,010
Mr. Fu,

181
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,870
we're leaving.

182
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,430
Bye.

183
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,320
Hey,

184
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,690
tell me.

185
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,600
♫There will be a silent arrangement tomorrow♫

186
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,800
Am I not handsome?

187
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,810
Of course not. You're so ugly.

188
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,960
What are we going to eat for lunch?

189
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,450
I'm not eating. You're too ugly. I'm full.

190
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,430
♫No sorrow, no joy, I'm so touched♫

191
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,720
Actually,

192
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,550
it takes a lot of courage to confess your love.

193
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,120
Right?

194
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,799
Today, Ji Qiu was depressed all afternoon,

195
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,480
[September 1, 2013]

196
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,780
because she didn't get to eat osmanthus cakes.

197
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,630
I had to go early tomorrow.

198
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,200
I have seen it.

199
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,640
Like,

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,730
I wore the same color as Ji Qiu did today.

201
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,600
And...

202
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,910
I only read one or two pages.

203
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,730
Tell me,

204
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,940
if I told Ji Qiu about my feelings,

205
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:07,990
what would she think?

206
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,590
If

207
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,400
you're just

208
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,610
asking,

209
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,090
my answer is

210
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,110
you're so good.

211
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,460
Ji Qiu would definitely say yes.

212
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,440
But if...

213
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,720
You really want to confess your love.

214
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,380
My answer is...

215
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,750
I don't know.

216
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,220
This is between the two of you.

217
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,540
If I give you hope,

218
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,910
but the result doesn't go well.

219
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,460
I think I'll blame myself.

220
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,740
Why are you so serious?

221
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,340
I'm just asking.

222
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,810
Since you have this idea,

223
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,500
it means you're serious.

224
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,390
Brother.

225
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,730
Don't do anything regret you'll regret.

226
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,210
Okay.

227
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,850
So you didn't prepare back then?

228
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,430
Yes.

229
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,370
When I stood on the debate stage,

230
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,820
my mind went blank.

231
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,650
To be honest,

232
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,030
I didn't remember what I said.

233
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,370
I was

234
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,560
praising you,

235
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,540
saying you were quick.

236
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,820
Really?

237
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,610
Yes.

238
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,200
I also told other juniors

239
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,660
not to quarrel with you.

240
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,570
Because we'd lose.

241
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,150
Are you

242
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,470
on a vacation?

243
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,550
Yes.

244
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,480
The project just ended.

245
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,630
I'm going to take a break.

246
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,540
I've watched your show.

247
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,790
You did a good job.

248
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,640
But it must have been very hard

249
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,740
because the shooting location was in the countryside and the forest.

250
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,010
Well...

251
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,570
Why were you hands so stiff?

252
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,220
I'm fine.

253
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,130
You know, work.

254
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,050
Hey, the two people I met last time

255
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,670
was also the guests of the show?

256
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,820
So you knew each other a long time ago?

257
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,410
Fu Qile is a good friend of mine,

258
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,310
and Zhou Ziqian

259
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,170
is a brother I knew long ago.

260
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,670
Although

261
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,080
he's serious in the show,

262
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,180
in fact, he is very childish in private.

263
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,960
You have no idea

264
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,250
I worked so hard to get him on that show.

265
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,070
He...

266
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,070
Let's not talk about work.

267
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:39,900
Okay.

268
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,000
I can see that you're a workaholic.

269
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,750
Do you remember this restaurant?

270
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,280
This restaurant?

271
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,540
Have you come here before?

272
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,690
The day you joined the club,

273
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,290
you were having dinner here.

274
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,790
Ah, I remember.

275
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,490
But it's been so long.

276
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,320
The decoration of this restaurant has been changed.

277
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,680
Why do you remember it so clearly?

278
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,300
Because I was deeply impressed.

279
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,610
I remember a junior

280
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,540
mistook fruit wine as a drink

281
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,640
and got herself drunk.

282
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,050
When I sent her home,

283
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,770
she kept drinking with me.

284
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:30,920
Really?

285
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,870
She must have regretted it the next day.

286
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,190
No.

287
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,600
She completely forgot she had come to this restaurant.

288
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,370
It just came to her mind.

289
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,310
Uh...

290
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,070
Is it me?

291
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,120
What's with that dark history?

292
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,630
I must have caused you a lot of trouble.

293
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,590
No.

294
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,440
You're quite cute.

295
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,250
Their shrimps are good.

296
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:09,890
Try it.

297
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,370
Be careful not to scratch your hand.

298
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,210
You're quite considerate.

299
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,900
Unlike Zhou Ziqian,

300
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,040
he asked me to peel several shrimps for him last time.

301
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,260
He didn't even thank me.

302
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
He's so immature.

303
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,110
I'm talking too far.

304
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,730
Eat up.

305
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,420
It's getting cold.

306
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,290
Okay.

307
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,100
Hey.

308
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,640
Gao Yuan.

309
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,480
Zhou Ziqian doesn’t eat with you?

310
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,550
He...

311
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,660
He already had it.

312
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,880
He's been acting strange these days.

313
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,240
All day long,

314
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,290
except eating and training,

315
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,030
he didn't say a word.

316
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,630
Today is even worse,

317
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,520
from morning to night,

318
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,700
he didn't say a word.

319
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,940
Miss Cheng,

320
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,520
did you reject him

321
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,170
very badly?

322
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,330
Refuse?

323
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,030
Yes.

324
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,470
Isn't he in the state of breakup?

325
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,730
He's not cute anymore.

326
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,080
When will it end?

327
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,690
Miss Cheng,

328
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,130
I'm leaving.

329
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:16,650
Okay.

330
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,640
So you won't stay in Jiangyi for long.

331
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,870
♫I'm just a little composer♫

332
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,160
But...

333
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,740
Not necessarily.

334
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,370
I heard

335
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,950
Jiangyi's amusement park has just been renovated.

336
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,010
♫Only think whether it's worth it♫

337
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,730
Have you been there?

338
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,530
Amusement park?

339
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,110
Jiu Qiu.

340
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,400
♫It will make you happier♫

341
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:53,900
Oh.

342
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,630
I've been to the amusement park twice.

343
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,660
It's really fun.

344
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:02,090
♫I've been thinking about you lately♫

345
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,570
I wanted to ask you

346
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,530
did you want to go out with me?

347
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,420
♫You know I'm happy to hear you talk and you are happy to share♫

348
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,220
But I thought you'd turn me down.

349
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,720
So I didn't ask.

350
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,350
♫The way you look at me I can't help getting close to you♫

351
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,940
I think

352
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,570
you already have someone you like.

353
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,560
Do I?

354
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,760
♫No one loves you as much as I do♫

355
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,630
You were absent-minded all day.

356
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,430
Wasn't that because of him?

357
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,240
We talked so much,

358
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,140
but you only got interested

359
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,400
when it involved someone.

360
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,490
Look at you.

361
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,390
Don't you know?

362
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,340
I shouldn't have told you.

363
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,020
I

364
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,710
really don't know.

365
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,330
I'm really happy

366
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,100
to meet you in Jiangyi this time.

367
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,890
But I can't stay long because of work.

368
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,860
♫How many days I haven't kept in touch with you♫

369
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,350
So maybe we won't see each other for a long time.

370
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,080
You won't come back?

371
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,910
♫Do you remember the conversations still♫

372
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,500
Maybe.

373
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:51,700
Let's go.

374
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,710
I'll take you home.

375
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,400
♫Recall the scene when we first met♫

376
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,650
No need.

377
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,840
My colleague is nearby.

378
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,720
I had an appointment.

379
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,080
♫Is there anything different to you♫

380
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,750
Next time when you go back to Jiangyi,

381
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,340
I'll treat you to dinner.

382
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:04,800
Okay.

383
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,050
He said I liked someone.

384
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,830
But I think...

385
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,590
No way.

386
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,350
Why are you here so early?

387
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,950
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

388
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,750
Hey, Ji Qiu.

389
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,660
Did you watch the fourth episode yesterday?

390
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,000
The ratings went up again.

391
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,490
Of course.

392
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,860
Didn't Zheng Hui show up?

393
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,660
When he was attacked by water cannon,

394
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,200
the bullet comments were all about heartbroken.

395
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,550
Zheng Hui is a public figure now.

396
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,180
Ji Qiu,

397
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,210
you should thank Mr. Zhou.

398
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,250
Otherwise,

399
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,770
you would have been sprayed for a minute.

400
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,300
What do you mean?

401
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,460
Didn't you say that the director would be punished if the guest lost?

402
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,420
Ji Qiu, you were in the game zone so you didn't know.

403
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,460
Zhou Ziqian was about to lose.

404
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,160
But

405
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,569
I didn't know where he got the energy.

406
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,690
He did more than 30 push-ups in 30 seconds with no stop.

407
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,869
So you're exempted from punishment.

408
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,359
Is that so?

409
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,020
Yes.

410
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,599
It was overdone,

411
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,540
so it was cut.

412
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,930
And then I thought he pretended to be hurt all day.

413
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:25,359
He's a shooting player. How can you make him exercise too much?

414
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,730
What if something went wrong?

415
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,750
Sister,

416
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,870
we asked Miss Cheng about this.

417
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,670
This is a normal amount of exercise

418
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,650
for them.

419
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,970
Didn't you knew it before?

420
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,320
Why were you suddenly concerned about him?

421
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,210
Alright, let's get down to business.

422
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,370
This is some gifts for our guests.

423
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,670
And this is for Miss Zhou and Ms. Fu.

424
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,280
Yes.

425
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,090
We thought it would be more convenient for you to give them.

426
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,180
Okay.

427
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,250
I'll give it to them later.

428
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:55,750
Okay.

429
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,070
[Ji Grapes]

430
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,740
[Ji Grapes]

431
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,950
Hello.

432
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,660
Ji Qiu.

433
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,080
Well,

434
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,810
we have a gift for you.

435
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,270
Can you come and get it tomorrow?

436
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,230
Besides,

437
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,700
I want to talk to you.

438
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,230
Okay.

439
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,360
Then I...

440
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,290
Ji Qiu.

441
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:56,980
Yes?

442
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,240
How was your date today?

443
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,180
Not bad.

444
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,470
Yes.

445
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,430
Good.

446
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,640
Well,

447
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,370
see you tomorrow.

448
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,620
See you tomorrow.

449
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:34,680
Hello.

450
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,060
Hello.

451
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,880
I want a bouquet of tulips.

452
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,690
For your girlfriend?

453
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,600
I want to confess.

454
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,910
What about roses?

455
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,130
Most boys choose roses when they confess their love.

456
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,820
She likes tulips.

457
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,460
Okay.

458
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,580
Love is the most important thing.

459
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,860
Let me wrap it up for you.

460
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,290
How long have you known each other?

461
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,480
We met in high school.

462
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,740
In two months,

463
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,190

Gao Yuan told me

498
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,920
you broke up.

499
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,510
You believe him?

500
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,560
You confessed your love to Producer Ji?

501
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,300
I thought you went through a lot and you couldn't get her.

502
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,160
So

503
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,450
you haven't confessed yet?

504
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,440
Then why are you so upset now?

505
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,600
My idol filter for you

506
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,770
is about to break.

507
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,700
You're not as good as me.

508
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,240
It's just a sentence.

509
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,160
You can say it casually.

510
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,140
I'm not upset.

511
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,530
What have you been doing these days?

512
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,110
Thinking.

513
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,430
Thinking?

514
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,960
If one day

515
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,000
she holds his hands,

516
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,580
she take photos with him,

517
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,420
and

518
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,960
she goes to the amusement park with him

519
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,530
and they live

520
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,300
together,

521
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,630
can I stand it?

522
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,180
So,

523
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,770
your conclusion is...

524
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,620
♫I'm just a little composer♫

525
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,200
I have to go.

526
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,270
Zhou Ziqian,

527
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,450
do you know why I like you?

528
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,760
♫Only think whether it's worth it♫

529
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,760
Because you don't want to lose

530
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,370
on the court,

531
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,510
which is very attractive.

532
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,050
If

533
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,170
your confession succeeds,

534
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,060
don't tell me.

535
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,150
♫It will make you happier♫

536
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,000
But you can tell me if you fail.

537
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,840
♫I've been thinking about you lately♫

538
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,410
This can make me happy.

539
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,890
What's wrong with you?

540
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,170
♫You know I'm happy to hear you talk and you are happy to share♫

541
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,660
Let's go.

542
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,580
Some one would step ahead of you.

543
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,590
I know.

544
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,100
♫The way you look at me I can't help getting close to you♫

545
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,520
♫No one loves you as much as I do♫

546
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,450
You might find it strange.

547
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,930
It seems

548
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,220
I'm good at guessing

549
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,500
other people's ideas,

550
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,510
except you.

551
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,190
Who's unhappy today

552
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,460
and who's unhappy but he pretends to be happy.

553
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,760
I can tell

554
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,410
other people's emotions.

555
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,220
But facing you,

556
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,550
I don't think I can explain your smile

557
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,450
or sadness

558
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,840
and all the emotions on your face

559
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,770
with theory.

560
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,670
At first I mocked myself

561
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,600
♫I haven't written to others since October♫

562
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,180
I didn't learn enough.

563
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,150
Later I found out,

564
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,590
♫I'm just a little composer♫

565
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,470
when a person's emotions

566
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,780
star to be affected by another person,

567
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,030
it's hard to make a precise judgment.

568
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,360
♫Never mind these bad things and put them in the corner♫

569
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,150
From the beginning,

570
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,530
I couldn't read your mind.

571
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,510
♫Just think about what it's worth♫

572
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,850
Later,

573
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,090
I avoid your eyes.

574
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:23,700
♫Focus on the things that will make you feel better♫

575
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
It's not a good thing for us

576
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,430
to be influenced by others.

577
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,600
♫It will make you happier♫

578
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,500
Sometimes when I think about it,

579
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,130
If she were you,

580
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,570
♫I've been thinking about you lately♫

581
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,380
I don't think it's that bad.

582
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,090
When I was in school,

583
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,690
♫You know I'm happy to hear you talk and you are happy to share♫

584
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,070
you always say that

585
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,170
if I think too much,

586
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,200
I'll regret or make mistakes.

587
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,550
To eat something delicious,

588
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:45,070
♫The way you look at me I can't help getting close to you♫

589
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,370
you can wait for two hours.

590
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,320
To win a shuttlecock game,

591
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,450
♫No one loves you as much as I do♫

592
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,810
you can start from zero.

593
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,410
You always keep trying

594
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,760
probably because you're different.

595
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,770
Even though you wore uniforms, I can see you

596
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,420
at a glance.

597
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,400
Actually,

598
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,370
I like you.

599
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,010
Fu,

600
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,120
who are you talking to?

601
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,660
No.

602
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,840
Why are you here so early?

603
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,240
I have something to tell you.

604
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,960
Well,

605
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,530
I have something to ask you.

606
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:20,940
Go ahead.

607
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,250
I...

608
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,070
I think I like someone.

609
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,490
Who is it?

610
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,130
I think

611
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,090
I like Zhou Ziqian.

612
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,290
Recently,

613
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,810
I've been thinking of him.

614
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,250
When he

615
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,500
smiles,

616
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,960
amuses me,

617
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,210
and pisses me off...

618
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,840
We've known each other for so many years.

619
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,800
You know I'm a person

620
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,070
who doesn't like to expose my emotions in front of others.

621
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,420
But in front of him,

622
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,540
even if I cry,

623
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,800
I don't feel embarrassed.

624
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,410
I want to talk to him.

625
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,920
I want to hear

626
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,720
his jokes.

627
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,920
I want to walk on the street of the night with him

628
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,700
to watch the stars

629
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,610
and enjoy the moon.

630
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,260
But Fu,

631
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,760
I'm not sure if he likes me.

632
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,220
What should I do now?

633
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,700
I've never done

634
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,620
this in the past.

635
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,900
I don't think Ji Qiu I know

636
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,570
is a hesitated person.

637
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,380
No matter what she wants to do,

638
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,140
she believes she's right.

639
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,360
She won't retreat

640
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,140
or regret.

641
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,170
Am I that good?

642
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:00,900
Ji Qiu.

643
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,580
Yes.

644
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,890
Do you know you're lucky?

645
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,200
Lucky?

646
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,450
You having a good friend like me

647
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,930
is not lucky enough?

648
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,200
So,

649
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,660
believe in luck.

650
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,940
Just do

651
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,330
whatever you want.

652
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,760
Someone told me today

653
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,200
love was the most important.

654
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,160
Now I'll pass it to you.

655
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,040
You like him.

656
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,000
It's the most important thing.

657
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,200
Thank you, Fu.

658
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,840
Well,

659
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,070
you bought flowers.

660
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,500
Who are you going to meet?

661
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,160
What?

662
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,260
It's for someone.

663
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Oh, this is a gift from the program.

664
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,240
Thank you.

665
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,190
Oh.

666
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,290
I have

667
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,510
an appointment.

668
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,550
It's almost time. I...

669
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,860
I'm leaving.

670
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,230
Go ahead.

671
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,430
Ji Qiu.

672
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:20,910
I wish you

I want to see you.

690
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,450
I'm still at the TV tower.

♫Am I the shining star?♫

What's wrong?

698
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,390
I had a dream last night.

699

♫Are you fond of me?♫

700

♫You just stepped in sight, with your sparkly eyes♫

What dream?

703
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,080
It had nothing to do with my dream.

704
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,210
When I woke up,

705

I wanted to see you.

706
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,990
When I moved at 11,

707
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,040
I thought I couldn't play with you anymore.

708
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,370
I cried so hard,

709
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,850
because I thought I would never see you again.

710
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,660
When I came back,

711

♫I've thought about it many times♫

00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,970
was to see you.

♫I have thrown away this charming and empty thing in vain♫

00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,670
met you in the shooting range.

717
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,400
I saw you

♫I pick up the pen and only remember your wish♫

719

embarrassed when you hit the wrong target,

720
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,610
which is really cute.

♫But my mother said boys can't be too sweet♫

722

When I found that you didn't recognize me,

♫I want to experience so many things with you♫

I didn't know why

725
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,260
I just wanted to tease you.

♫I wish I could have all the good and bad sides of you♫

Until I told you the truth

728
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,820
at the amusement park,

729
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,700

♫I hope we can be the only light♫

you invited me to record a variety show.

I paid attention to everything about you.

760
