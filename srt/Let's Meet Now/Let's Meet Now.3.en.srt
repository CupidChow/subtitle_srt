You can give me an answer after you read it.

169
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,720
You have to give me a chance.

170
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,010
Let me think.

171
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,659
Take your time.

172
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,340
What do you want to play?

173
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,210
Roller coaster or pendulum ride?

174
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,820
I guess there are many people

175
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,830
at this hour.

176
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,909
Let's queue up then.

177
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,150
Just play what you want.

178
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,730
The carousel is also good.

179
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,110
Don't worry about me.

180
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,820
Your feelings matter the most today.

181
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,310
Grape Ji.

182
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,640
I wanted to tell you later.

183
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,260
You...

184
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,960
You posted it a month ago.

185
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,100
I got to know you go to the shooting club every Saturday.

186
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,669
♫I've thought about it many times♫

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,360
I went there for two weeks before I met you.

188
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,480
♫I have thrown away this charming and empty thing in vain♫

189
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,890
I hesitated,

190
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,140
so I didn't tell you the truth right away.

191
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,850
♫I pick up the pen and only remember your wish♫

192
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,350
♫But my mother said boys can't be too sweet♫

193
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,230
I was really happy that you came to watch the competition.

194
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,340
♫I want to experience so many things with you♫

195
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,050
Actually,

196
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,270
I've always wanted to see you.

197
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,960
♫I wish I could have all the good and bad sides of you♫

198
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,780
I know you like grapes,

199
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,440
and you hate raw garlic and coriander.

200
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,490
♫I hope we can be the only light♫

201
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,920
Your name is the last month of autumn.

202
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,240
♫That we can see in each other's eyes♫

203
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,330
Your birthday is November 28th.

204
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,640
You like all fluffy animals,

205
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,430
especially cats.

206
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,050
So you...

207
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,650
You've really had a crush on me for such a long time.

208
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,880
Take a good look.

209
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,110
Who am I, Grape Ji?

210
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,620
Ji Qiu.

211
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,860
Ji Qiu.

212
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,070
Ji Qiu.

213
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,450
Ji Qiu.

214
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,030
You are...

215
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,550
Zhou Yue?

216
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,250
You recognized me?

217
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,230
Are you really Zhou Yue?

218
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,160
Impossible.

219
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,060
He was only this tall

220
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,540
when he was little.

221
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,500
He was the shortest among his peers.

222
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,400
But you...

223
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,990
Besides, didn't you go abroad?

224
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,110
Since I came back, I've been all around you, Ji Qiu,

225
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,580
but you never recognized me.

226
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,630
♫I have a special hobby♫

227
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,190
Alas.

228
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,680
I'm a little sad.

229
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,210
♫I'd write a song when I miss you♫

230
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,970
It's only because you've changed a lot.

231
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,280
♫Maybe I speak without thinking♫

232
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,140
♫But I love you more than what I expressed♫

233
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,390
You don't look like what you used to be.

234
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,130
♫Give me a nameless ticket♫

235
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,390
I'm already in my 20s.

236
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,740
Do you still treat me like a child?

237
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,630
♫Let me get on the train to your heart♫

238
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,710
Besides,

239
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,810
why can't I change?

240
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,530
♫I've had a dream since I met you♫

241
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,670
You were so ruthless when you were little.

242
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,510
Now,

243
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,660
♫In the dream I'm singing this song♫

244
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,250
you are so ladylike.

245
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,550
Have you run it by me?

246
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,110
♫I'm singing in the galaxy and in the wind♫

247
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,050
♫I dreamt of all the heart-pounding moments♫

248
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,610
I have to run it by you?

249
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,130
♫How many times do I have to tell you this is not the point♫

250
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,310
Was I not ladylike before?

251
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,460
You are in your 20s, so what?

252
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,250
♫The point is I'm in love with your face♫

253
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,610
You kept it from me for so long, and I haven't got even with you.

254
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,130
Alright, it's my fault.

255
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,870
♫I like it warmer so I don't like winter♫

256
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,670
♫Given that you are by my side♫

257
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,060
By the way,

258
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,010
why did you change your name?

259
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,140
♫If there's no beginning or end♫

260
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,260
You haven't told me why you learned shooting

261
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,250
and became so good.

262
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,430
♫I'd rather sleep tight in your arms♫

263
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,030
Also,

264
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,120
didn't you go abroad?

265
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,310
Why did you suddenly come back?

266
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,820
♫I only looked at you once but it means forever♫

267
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,660
Now that you're back,

268
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,800
will you go abroad again?

269
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,910
Also, how are your parents?

270
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,410
♫Do the moon and the sun miss each other too?♫

271
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,580
So many questions.

272
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,470
Should I answer them all together?

273
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,520
♫On the day I met you♫

274
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,100
Let's find a place to sit down.

275
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,040
♫All the stores are vending love♫

276
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,470
Take your time answering the questions one by one.

277
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,260
Ji Qiu, your temperament hasn't changed at all.

278
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,870
He has changed a lot.

279
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,280
I remember he was chubby when he was little.

280
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,670
He liked to follow me,

281
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,900
and he was a cry baby.

282
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,550
He's totally different now.

283
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,960
He is even

284
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,580
half a head taller than dad.

285
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,690
It's been years.

286
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,960
It's normal for Zhou Yue to change.

287
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,530
Besides,

288
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,140
you've changed a lot since you were a kid.

289
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,210
You were so cute when you were little.

290
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,270
Mom.

291
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,010
We're talking about Zhou Yue.

292
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,550
Why are you talking about me?

293
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,450
But when he moved out,

294
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,550
he came to say goodbye

295
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,540
but couldn't find you.

296
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,950
He cried so sadly.

297
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,400
In the end, his parents dragged him into the car.

298
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,340
I never expected he would become a shooting athlete.

299
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,980
I watched him play.

300
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,020
He's indeed amazing.

301
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,390
He pulled the trigger like this

302
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,980
and won the second place, nice and easy.

303
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,790
Many people like him.

304
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,290
Judging from your tone,

305
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,770
you're quite happy to meet him.

306
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,460
Well,

307
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,710
I have to go.

308
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,950
My drama is going on air soon.

309
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,530
I'm hanging up.

310
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,760
Remember to eat well.

311
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,400
Mom.

312
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,590
Dramas are more important than me.

313
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,810
Yes.

314
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,450
I'm quite happy.

315
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,430
You forgot your homework again?

316
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,020
It's not homework.

317
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,530
The key chain that I wanted to give Jiangjiang

318
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,280
was lost.

319
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,840
Key chain?

320
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,690
Yes.

321
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,260
This one?

322
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,040
Yes.

323
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,670
Wait.

324
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,540
What is this?

325
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,240
Brother.

326
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,770
Did you forget?

327
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,020
Zhou Ziqian.

328
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,640
I can see that.

329
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,830
I mean why do you put this on?

330
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,950
I like his spirit of not giving up in competitions.

331
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,460
Don't scrape it.

332
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,270
You never study hard.

333

Hey, Miss Ji Qiu.

Well,

339
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,360
this is much more comfortable than taking the subway.

Ask your brother to drive you school more often.

I can also take a ride this way.

343
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,900
No problem.

344
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,780
Then I can often...

00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,510
Hey.

You won't charge me more since we are friends, right?

By the way,

348
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,230
remember to come to my rooftop tonight.

349
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,090
I have something important to announce.

350
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,790
Something important?

351

What is it?

352
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,430
If I tell you now, what should I announce tonight?

Tiantian, are you coming?

354
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,510
There's a test tonight.

Poor girl.

356

See you tonight.

Brother, tell me the truth.

358
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,310
You mainly wanted to give Miss Ji Qiu a ride, right?

359
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,780
I was only taking a ride.

360
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,290
I think your study is not hard enough.

361
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,990
You panicked.

Yes.

371
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,390
He doesn't look like a good student.

372
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,850
You're so clueless.

373

He's the top student in our class.

I heard you.

Your Chinese level is quite high.

A brother with three shortcomings.

You recognized her on Weibo

457

and hid your identity to approach her.

What's that look?

459
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,190
You're up to no good.

460
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,460
If you don't like her,

461
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,690
there must be something wrong with you.

462

Something's wrong with you.

You have no idea.

464
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,080
She was quite domineering when she was little.

465
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,730
She was bold and bullied me a lot.

466
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,300
Now, I finally have a chance.

467
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,580
I just want to

Cut it out.

It's good that you don't bully others.

471

Sure.

It's a deal then.

477
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,250
It's on our rooftop.

if you have time.

481
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,850
My hands are supposed to hold guns.

482

Are you willing to let them carry shopping bags?

483
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,460
That makes sense.

484
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,470
Remember to bring gloves.

485
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,380
Okay.

486
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,670
See you in front of the supermarket.

487

489

Why are you still here?

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,700
Why can't I be here?

491

Aren't you going to dinner?

492
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,830

Yes.

495

Even if you are siblings,

496
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,180
you can't just wear anything.

497
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,470
You are going to a party.

498
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,820
Think about it.

499
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,540
Did Miss Ji wear something casual when she saw you?

500
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,770
Thanks to me.

501
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,220
If you really wear this to the party,

502

she'll definitely be mad.

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,080
All right, go back

504
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,620
and tidy up.

505
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,910
I'm leaving.

506
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,790
Leave it to me.

507
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,490
Just go.

508
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,840
Where can you find such a caring friend like me?

509
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,950
Zhou Ziqian,

510
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,530
are you in a fashion show?

511
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,800
You're dressed so formally.

512
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,950
I have many interview shows lately.

513
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,910
I came here before I had time to change my clothes.

514
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,200
I see.

515
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,790
No wonder it's quite eye-catching.

516
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,640
But

517
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,820
it's better than your grocery shopping outfit.

518
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,710
We are going grocery shopping.

519
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,840
If you told me earlier, I wouldn't wear this.

520
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,530
Who said

521
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,270
you didn't have time to change?

522
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,040
Did I say that?

523
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,690
I don't remember.

524
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,070
Ji Qiu.

525
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,340
I suddenly recalled

526
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,000
your dress was pretty last time.

527
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,510
I also think that dress is pretty.

528
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,010
Why don't you wear it today?

529
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,410
I'm curious.

530
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,840
Since you knew who I am,

531
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,320
you've been so casual to me.

532
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,950
Ji Qiu,

533
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,250
did you...

534
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:19,820
What?

535
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,410
Do you know how tired it is to wear high heels all day?

536
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,930
I spent at least two hours to do my hair.

537
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,820
Wearing skirts all day.

538
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,160
You don't know how it feels when you can't relax your hands and feet.

539
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,550
And the contact lenses.

540
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,380
They are dry after being worn for a long time.

541
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,510
Besides,

542
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,110
I met the shooting athlete, Zhou Ziqian.

543
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,480
I was not familiar with Zhou Ziqian.

544
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,460
It's important to dress properly.

545
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,140
Now,

546
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,600
the one in front of me is my younger brother.

547
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,800
That's the treatment for a younger brother.

548
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,510
What?

549
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,560
Are you unhappy with my outfit?

550
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,040
Good boy.

551
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:55,920
Let's go.

552
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,790
Stop nagging.

553
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,250
It's been years.

554
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,810
Why does he look so different?

555
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,630
Ji Qiu.

556
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,500
Yes?

557
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,700
Do you want this?

558
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,920
Yes, okay.

559
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,170
He's suddenly so handsome.

560
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,320
It makes me uncomfortable.

561
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,010
I should be careful.

562
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,960
You're not scared?

563
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,690
It shouldn't be.

564
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,510
So bold.

565
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,230
It must be my illusion.

566
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,660
He's as childish as when he was little.

567
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,260
Or even more childish.

568
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,950
Why did you hit me?

569
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,840
Cheers.

570
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,030
Why is this blueberry flavor?

571
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,540
Didn't you buy grape flavor?

572
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,190
How would I know?

573
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,250
You took it yourself.

574
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,570
Did you change it secretly?

575
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,630
How is that possible?

576
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,310
Why not? Then how did it become blueberry?

577
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,610
-Why do I think... -Did you take the wrong one?

578
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,690
It's only been a few days,

579
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,680
but they became so close.

580
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:09,520
Try it again.

581
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,780
You reacted fast this time.

582
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,870
Qiu.

583
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,090
Don't talk nonsense.

584
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,350
Have you forgotten what the important thing is?

585
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,730
Today,

586
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,010
I have an important announcement.

587
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,550
I never thought

588
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,030
this would happen to me.

589
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,460
Let me introduce to you,

590
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,380
Zhou Ziqian.

591
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,700
He is

592
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,950
my long-lost younger brother.

593
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,980
Younger brother.

594
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,760
Younger brother?

595
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,790
Related by blood?

596
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,670
Why are you laughing?

597
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,820
I'm not laughing.

598
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,420
Not really related by blood.

599
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,280
When I was little, he was the kid next door.

600
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,210
We didn't contact each other after he went abroad.

601
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,170
After so many years,

602
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,110
he's changed a lot.

603
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,700
So,

604
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,460
I've known Ji Qiu for more than ten years.

605
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,950
We have a younger brother.

606
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,460
Should I move out?

607
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,500
To be safe,

608
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,130
you have to find a place early.

609
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,740
Qiu.

610
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,180
Can I sleep with you?

611
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,440
Actually, I can sleep on the sofa.

612
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,900
I'm just kidding.

613
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,570
You've been to his house before.

614
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,000
It's much bigger than ours.

615
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,100
You went to his house?

616
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,640
It was a special occasion.

617
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,070
Wait.

618
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,290
Since you know each other,

619
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:34,710
why didn't you tell us

620
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,480
at the shooting gallery?

621
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,700
If I did,

622
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,340
would you still compete with me?

623
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,180
Just kidding.

624
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,440
I don't know what to do

625
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,550
about reunion after a long time.

626
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,090
I just wanted to wait for Ji Qiu to recognize me first.

627
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,750
Qiu has a bad memory.

628
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,770
If you want her to recognize you,

629
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,960
you'll have to wait half or a year.

630
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,340
You have a bad memory,

631
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,560
but you remember

632
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,400
everything in my childhood.

633
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,020
Ji Qiu must have been

634
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,150
really impressed by me.

635
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,280
Let me correct it.

636
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,540
It's that I remember embarrassing things very clearly.

637
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,730
If you want to hear it,

638
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,690
I can list them for you.

639
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,120
Impossible.

640
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,590
I've never made a fool of myself growing up.

641
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,580
Really? Then who was beaten in Grade Six?

642
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,760
Let's change the subject.

643
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,210
After getting beaten, you cried and...

644
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,400
Let's eat.

645
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,260
Ji Qiu said

646
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,220
she's not hungry either.

647
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,040
Well.

648
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,290
You go first.

649
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,460
Are you alone?

650
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,710
How about I give you a ride?

651
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,820
It's okay.

652
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,990
My house is not far away.

653
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,890
I usually walk home.

654
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,350
Okay.

655
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,280
Usually?

656
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,790
How many times have you been here?

657
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,450
This time.

658
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,170
Last time.

659
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,200
The time before last time.

660
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,320
Three times.

661
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,770
It's getting late. Go back now.

662
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,250
How about

663
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,700
I see you off?

664
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,010
That's not necessary.

665
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,000
Well,

666
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,930
see you then.

667
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,210
See you.

668
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,050
Why is the atmosphere so weird?

669
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,910
Hop on. I'll take you home.

670
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,710
You're taking me home?

671
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,250
Do I have to send you back?

672
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,850
I didn't say that.

673
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,100
Stop nagging.

674
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,060
Come up now.

675
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:09,720
Well.

676
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,110
Are you looking down on my skills?

677
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,150
♫I want to spend every summer with you♫

678
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,850
Hold tight.

679
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,430
♫I want to kiss your face under the sunset♫

680
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,100
♫I like to see you in a daze♫

681
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,880
♫It's the most special dependence♫

682
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,550
♫My promise to you will never be changed♫

683
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,440
♫I want to take a walk with you when flowers bloom♫

684
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,960
♫I want to hold your sleeves and sit by the sea♫

685
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,340
Your

686
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,370
♫The wind blows your skirt and it starts dancing♫

687
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,710
skills.

688
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,650
♫You are my only one. I just want to be with you♫

689
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,400
♫The secret in the fragrance of flowers♫

690
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,100
♫How poetic this moment is♫

691
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,030
♫Can you be with me in rainy days?♫

692
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,290
♫Can you stay with me forever?♫

693
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,400
♫Can you take adventures with me?♫

694
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,260
How old are you to be so childish?

695
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,220
♫To the end of the world♫

696
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,300
♫Can we never change?♫

697
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,090
Be careful.

698
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,200
I'm not as skilled as you, Ji Qiu,

699
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,900
♫Hold your hand and take you to the mountain top to see shooting stars♫

700
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,290
but I can drive on the road.

701
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,940
♫Time can't be resisted♫

702
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,560
It was an accident.

703
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,890
♫Every day with you is sunny♫

704
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,830
You haven't been showed around Jiangyi, right?

705
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,410
♫Take you to the Ferris wheel to see shooting stars♫

706
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,810
No.

707
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,460
Do you want to see the whole Jiangyi?

708
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,880
♫Standing under the eaves waiting for the rain to clear up♫

709
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,710
What do you mean?

710
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,480
♫Let's watch a romance movie from the first decade of this century♫

711
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,460
The road ahead.

712
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,450
Turn right. I'll take you to a place.

713
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,680
♫I've always believed♫

714
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,380
♫But you have always been a cry baby♫

715
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,340
OK.

716
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,250
♫You even cry when we are playing games♫

717
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,940
♫Under the moonlight I ask you♫

718
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,050
♫Can we be together?♫

719
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,800
♫Let's meet now♫

720
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,760
Normally,

721
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,030
I don't tell anyone about this place.

722
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,260
Is there anything special?

723
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:45,750
Look up.

724
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,700
Here,

725
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,250
you can see the stars when you look up.

726
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,440
Lower your head.

727
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,210
Lower your head and you can see the whole Jiangyi.

728
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,680
Alright, let me show you over there.

729
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,360
Actually, I think this is more suitable

730
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,430
to come here in spring.

731
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,930
All the flowers bloom in spring.

732
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,840
It's much more beautiful than the artificial plants.

733
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,340
I won't recommend coming at night.

734
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,680
Why?

735
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,560
You want to know?

736
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,020
Check it out yourself.

737
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,450
Grape Ji.

738
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,950
It's a bad habit to keep people guessing.

739
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,530
Do you know?

740
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,110
You've been in Jiangyi for a long time, right?

741
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,000
The second year you went abroad,

742
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,310
I came here.

743
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,200
I went to college here too.

744
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,730
So long that

745
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,560
I don't even remember

746
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,760
when I found this place.

747
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,960
Whenever I'm very happy

748
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,640
or sad,

749
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:53,970
I come here.

750
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,190
Because I'm back,

751
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,880
you are very happy?

752
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,950
If you think so,

753
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:03,980
that's okay.

754
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,070
What about you?

755
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,860
Was it hard living abroad?

756
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,990
Why do you ask?

757
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,320
Because you never told me.

758
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,810
How was your life abroad?

759
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,400
Did you have any friends?

760
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,190
When did you learn shooting?

761
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,100
It must have been hard.

762
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,450
That's why you didn't mention anything.

763
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,920
When did you become so meticulous?

764
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,710
I've always been meticulous.

765
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,130
Actually, it was not that hard.

766
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,750
It's just I couldn't speak the language when I first arrived,

767
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,700
and I couldn't catch up with their training methods.

768
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,940
Then Coach Zhang went there.

769
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,620
It became alright.

770
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,960
I gradually caught up.

771
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,600
Not many people know this place.

772
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,670
I brought you here anyway.

773
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,680
Take it as a gift frome me to you.

774
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,590
A gift?

775
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,300
A welcome gift.

776
00:32:59,170 --> 00:32:59,880
Zhou Ziqian.

777
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,750
Although it's a bit late to say this,

778
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,130
I've decided to say it.

779
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,390

00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,680
It's at the intersection ahead.

791
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,070
I have an appointment.

792
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,370
I'll wait for him here.

Go ahead.

794
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,290
Like stars,

795
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:32,170
everyone shines independently.

796
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,389
But only when we are together,

797
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,760
we shine the brightest light.
