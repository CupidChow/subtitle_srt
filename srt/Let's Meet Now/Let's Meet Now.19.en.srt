00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:55,910
Hello.

173
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,630
Miss Ji.

174
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,900
Zhou Ziqian said you got together.

175
00:08:59,310 --> 00:08:59,780
Is it true?

176
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:01,680
Yes.

177
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,240
Oh.

178
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,240
Sorry for the trouble.

179
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,660
Bye.

180
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:10,790
Good for you.

181
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,100
Even Miss Ji knows you are joking.

182
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,220
She even cooperated with you.

183
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,030
You're really something.

184
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,530
What?

185
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,120
Is it credible?

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,460
Do you believe it?

187
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,730
Not really.

188
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,520
Do you believe it?

189
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,290
Of course not.

190
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,040
Do you believe it?

191
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,000
I do.

192
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:23,930
Look.

193
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,360
Only Xu Wang saved you from embarrassment.

194
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,800
Are you going back to the dorm later?

195
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,960
I was called.

196
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,430
For one-hour extra training.

197
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,910
I'll go buy some water.

198
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,880
I'll come back later.

199
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,480
Are you jealous?

200
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,200
Are you jealous?

201
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,410
This is my roommate.

202
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,380
I'm so touched.

203
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,800
Why is Xu Wang here?

204
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,080
You...

205
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,640
Are you avoiding me?

206
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,180
What?

207
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,650
No.

208
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,680
I didn't see you just now.

209
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,530
What a coincidence.

210
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,180
I have something to do.

211
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,610
I have to go.

212
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,320
Hey.

213
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,110
Wait.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,770
The photo taken in the bookstore

215
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,520
was developed.

216
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,860
Do you want a copy?

217
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,800
Ah.

218
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,640
No need.

219
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,700
If I take it,

220
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,320
people might misunderstand.

221
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,640
It doesn't feel appropriate.

222
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,580
Okay.

223
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,450
I'm leaving then.

224
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:40,700
Okay.

225
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:51,950
Okay.

226
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,300
Thank you.

227
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,340
Thank you.

228
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,520
Where is Zhou Ziqian?

229
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,880
I saw him hopping out just now.

230
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,520
What do you mean by hopping out?

231
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,730
Just

232
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,710
literally.

233
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,030
♫I have a special hobby♫

234
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,130
♫I'd write a song when I miss you♫

235
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,700
♫Maybe I speak without thinking♫

236
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,500
♫But I love you more than what I expressed♫

237
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,590

♫Give me a nameless ticket♫

♫Let me get on the train to your heart♫

240
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,910
♫I've had a dream since I met you♫

241
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,730
♫In the dream I'm singing this song♫

242
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,620
♫I'm singing in the galaxy and in the wind♫

243
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,450
♫I dreamt of all the heart-pounding moments♫

244
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,510
♫How many times do I have to tell you this is not the point♫

245
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Zhou Ziqian.

246
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,700
♫The point is I'm in love with your face♫

♫I like it warmer so I don't like winter♫

248
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,050
Didn't we say we'll meet somewhere else?

249
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:46,900
Why are you here?

250
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,480
♫Given that you are by my side♫

251
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,010

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,230
♫If there's no beginning or end♫

253
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,370
My legs are numb.

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,160
♫I'd rather sleep tight in your arms♫

255
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,410
Can I ask my girlfriend

00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,170
to give me a hand?

257

♫I only looked at you once but it means forever♫

258

♫Do the moon and the sun miss each other too?♫

259
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,750
♫On the day I met you♫

260
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,580
I missed the opportunity to pick you up after school.

261
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,360
♫All the stores are vending love♫

262
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,800
But I can wait for you to get off work.

263
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,060
This is your reward

264
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,150
for getting off work on time.

265
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,790
Reward?

266
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,630
Hey.

267
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,190
Why are you like an elementary school student

268
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,570
when you're in love?

269
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,590
For an elementary school student,

270
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,860
it's not too much to hold hands, right?

271
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,800
Zhou Ziqian.

272
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,340
Go.

273
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:22,980
Let's go back home.

274
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,450
Why are you so excited going back to my place?

275
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:26,800
Well.

276
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,180
It's the same.

277
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,910
I don't want to leave you.

278
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,840
So soon?

279
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,980
I'm only going on a business trip for one day.

280
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,920
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

281
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,520
I wasn't prepared.

282
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,280
Yesterday,

283
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,840
I didn't have the chance to tell you.

284
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,400
Yesterday...

285
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,220
Why are you laughing?

286
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,080
I didn't mean it.

287
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,170
What?

288
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,270
I said,

289
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,110
I didn't

290
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,330
mean it.

291
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,570
Zhou Ziqian.

292
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,840
Enough. Enough.

293
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,040
Not one second.

294
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:16,860
Not one minute.

295
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,950
Not an hour.

296
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,610
It's a whole day.

297
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,360
Yes.

298
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,860
You're already a mature boyfriend.

299
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,020
You need to learn

300
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,700
to be independent.

301
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,270
I'm leaving.

302
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,450
You're leaving?

303
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,050
Yes.

304
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:37,550
Well,

305
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,870
nothing else you wanna say to me?

306
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,940
Then I...

307
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,910
I'll miss you once

308
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,800
when I have time.

309
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,690
Then I...

310
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,200
I'll miss you twice.

311
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:51,880
Three times.

312
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:52,470
Four times.

313
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,980
Five times.

314
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,400
Okay.

315
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,220
I'm really leaving.

316
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,700
Okay.

Well,

320
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,440
when will we meet next time?

321
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,290
Next time...

322
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,110
Isn't it next time after this time?

323

♫Am I the shining star?♫

I didn't want to go back.

339

00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,410
♫Love is love♫

343
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,230
Ji Qiu.

344
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,070
Look down.

345
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,880
♫My heart is on fire♫

346
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,360
It's been five minutes.

347
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,200
It's already next time.

348
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,180
♫Love is love♫

349
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,550
Let's meet,

350
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,730
now.

351
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,980
♫My soul just being with you like♫

352
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,050
♫Love is love♫

353
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,910
♫In my life♫

354
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,190
Where else can we go at this hour?

355
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,770
There's a park nearby.

356
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,990
It seems to be pretty at night.

357
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,240
How about...

358
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,420
Why should we go to a small park?

359
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,810
Those who go to parks at night

360
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,770
are always that kind of people.

361
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,880
What kind of people?

362
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,420
Well,

363
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,800
that kind...

364
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,990
Make it clear.

365
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,630
What kind?

366
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,730
I don't want to say.

367
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,270
I'm leaving.

368
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:03,710
Let's go.

369
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:04,630
No one is there.

370
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,140
How do you know no one's there?

371
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,200
You've been there?

372
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,930
How could I?

373
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,470
Then

374
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,480
what kind are you talking about?

375
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,250
So annoying.

376
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,120
What is it?

377
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,980
What kind are you talking about?

378
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,910
Ji Qiu.

379
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,150
What are you doing?

380
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,410
You said

381
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,090
when we see something we like,

382
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,730
we should take pictures of it.

383
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,470
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

384
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,300
I didn't.

385
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,620
Say it again.

386
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,630
I need to prepare a notebook

387
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,660
and write down everything you say in the future.

388
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,329
I'll name it

389
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,579
The Quotes of Ji Qiu.

390
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,109
Then I'll find this notebook at home

391
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,380
and destroy it no matter what.

392
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,349
Home?

393
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,710
We...

394
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,480
Home?

395
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,180
Zhou Ziqian.

396
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,200
My Ji Qiu are so cute.

397
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,140
What time is your flight

398
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,410
to Chengyang tomorrow?

399
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,360
Seven in the morning.

400
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,340
So early?

401
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,590
Let me drive you.

402
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,300
No need.

403
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,810
I'll go with Zheng Hui.

404
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,090
So hard-working,

405
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,050
my Ji Qiu.

406
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,700
Let's go on a trip

407
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,620
after my competition is over.

408
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,420
A trip?

409
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,190
Yes.

410
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,990
When I was abroad, I drove around all the time.

411
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,480
I went to the top of the mountain to see sunrise and watched sunset by the sea.

412
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,450
Now that I think about it,

413
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,800
I wish you were there.

414
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,870
There's a limit to what one can see by himself.

415
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,030
You can tell me about

416
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,010
what I missed.

417
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:00,900
Yes.

418
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:03,960
What's wrong?

419
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,460
Not bad.

420
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,070
I'll think about it.

421
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,770
What are you looking at?

422
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,860
Isn't it cute?

423
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,750
My Ji Qiu.

424
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,680
Zhou Ziqian.

425
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,570
How many ugly photos have you taken of me? Delete them.

426
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,250
No, I won't.

427
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,450
-How cute my Ji Qiu is. -Delete it.

428
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,480
-It's so ugly. Delete it. -So cute.

429
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,200
♫Oh. Love me. Love me♫

430
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,590
♫You are my only one in this colorful world♫

431
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:52,010
♫You are the only exclusive secret that entered my heart♫

432
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,450
♫Oh. Kiss me. Kiss me♫

433
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,090
♫Just one of your expressions can make me fall in love with you♫

434
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,210
♫I'm afraid I'll only meet this once in my life♫

435
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,730
♫26℃ in a summer night♫

436
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,080
♫You will always remember the most profound kiss♫

437
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,590
♫Others are jealous that I got you♫

438
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,760
♫I remember vividly, the smell of your lipstick♫

439
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,450
♫The long summer is your eyes♫

440
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,910
♫Your friends are all your decorations♫

441
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,230
♫You are pure air without carbon dioxide♫

442
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,540
♫And the summer sweetheart that I fantasize about dominating♫

443
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,300
♫I will warn anyone who wants to approach you again and again♫

444
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,050
♫You are the pink carbonated drink that only belongs to me♫

445
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,550
♫My thoughts about you are never complicated♫

446
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,100
♫Because you are my pink soda♫

447
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,400
♫Popping bubbles flowed down my throat♫

448
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,700
♫Like the blooming plush of a flamingo♫

449
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,260
♫Oh. Kiss me. Kiss me♫

450
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,700
♫Just one of your expressions can make me fall in love with you♫

451
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,270
♫I'm afraid I'll only meet this once in my life♫

452
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,800
Another delivery?

453
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,340
How many couples are there already?

454
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,060
Learn from me.

455
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,660
Look ahead.

456
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,090
Don't watch those inappropriate scenes.

457
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,710
By the way,

458
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,610
Rongrong used to feed us a lot.

459
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,550
It's been a while.

460
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,640
Did Song Rongrong

461
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,610
go out with Ji Qiu?

462
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,180
I saw Ji Qiu posted an airport photo this morning.

463
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,480
She also said something like

464
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,860
"a trip for two".

465
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,880
Ji Qiu is on a business trip.

466
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,480
Ji Qiu?

467
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,750
You don't call her Miss Ji now?

468
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,550
If she finds out,

469
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,100
she'll beat you up.

470
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,830
By the way,

471
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,010
Song Rongrong

472
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,980
must have gotten into something new.

473
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,310
She has always been a person

474
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,410
of passing fads.

475
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,980
The coach texted me and asked us

476
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,700
to help move things outside.

477
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,120
I'll go with you.

478
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,800
Hey.

479
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,690
Let's go together.

480
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,660
We have enough people.

481
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,490
Don't just say it. Stand up.

482
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,380
We have enough people.

483
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,440
Yuan, what's wrong?

484
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,410
Oh, my shoulder.

485
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,880
I'm so tired.

486
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,140
Brother.

487
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,860
Why did you buy so much?

488
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,500
I can't eat this much.

489
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,180
I think it's still not enough.

490
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,870
You didn't look this thin back home last time.

491
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,970
Why didn't you tell me that you were coming to Jiangyi?

492
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,320
You came all of a sudden.

493
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,850
I thought my mom gave you an order again.

494
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,570
Don't flatter yourself.

495
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,550
I didn't come to Jiangyi for you.

496
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,610
Who are you here for then?

497
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,770
My girlfriend.

498
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,430
What's with that look?

499
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,070
Is it weird that I have a girlfriend?

500
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,860
Do you think I'm like you?

501
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,590
You haven't had a boyfriend for such a long time.

502
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,120
Hurry up.

503
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,950
I have something to do later.

504
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,590
Oh.

505
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,220
Hey.

506
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,520
Isn't that Rongrong?

507
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,730
Hurry.

508
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,620
Hurry.

509
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,120
Hey.

510
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,780
Hurry.

511
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,170
Hurry up.

512
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,270
We just said it's been a long time.

513
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,100
Then we met.

514
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,970
Is the guy next to her

515
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,050
her boyfriend?

516
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,550
No wonder she hasn't been here for so long.

517
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,920
Turns out she's in a relationship.

518
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,520
Shall we go and say hello?

519
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,660
Forget it.

520
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,420
You're right.

521
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,480
It's not convenient.

522
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,450
But

523
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,750
her boyfriend is not considerate.

524
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,100
He even let Rongrong

525
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,410
carry all these things by herself.

526
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,500
Forget it. Let's go.

527
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,590
They are waiting.

528
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,200
I just...

529
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,090
I accidentally dropped your book while looking for something.

530
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,110
It's okay.

531
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,460
Hey.

532
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,800
Guess what I saw.

533
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,680
What did you see?

534
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,180
It fell from the book.

535
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,410
When did you take this photo with Song Rongrong?

536
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,410
You didn't even tell us.

537
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,270
We took it while shooting the poster at the bookstore.

538
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:40,810
Oh.

539
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,340
I have an idea.

540
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,050
If I go to

541
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,400
nice places like a bookstore more often,

542
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,660
would I meet my Miss Right too?

543
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,270
Maybe.

544
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,090
Good idea.

545
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,220
Xu Wang.

546
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:11,970
Yes.

547
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,900
It's in the wrong place.

548
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,820
You've been here helping us for so long.

549
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,540
It seems to be the first time that you made a mistake.

550
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,380
What is it?

551
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,590
Are you in a bad mood?

552
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,410
No.

553
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,340
I'll send this over.

554
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:25,930
What?

555
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,720
Hey, baby.

556
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,230
Oh.

557
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,120
I missed you so much.

558
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,630
Have a seat.

559
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,270
Goodness.

560
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,850
Did you wait long?

561
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,270
Yes.

562
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,120
I missed you so much.

563
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,800
I'm sorry.

564
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,610
Hello?

565
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:01,960
Listen to me.

566
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,210
Come here now.

567
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,360
Your sister-in-law is nearby.

568
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,710
Okay.

569
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,790
Where are you?

570
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,180
Wait a minute. Let me see.

571
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
I think it's

572
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,700
Qingzhou Bookstore.

573
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,960
I'm not going.

574
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,340
Brother.

575
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,020
There's still time.

576
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,610
I will definitely see my sister-in-law.

577
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,120
Why are you dawdling?

578
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,180
Come here now.

579
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,390
Besides,

580
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,200
your sister-in-law bought you delicious food.

581
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,550
I'm really not coming.

582
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,450
Fine.

583
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,750
Well,

584
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,480
can you help me check if there is an extraordinarily handsome man in the shop?

585
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,990
An extraordinarily handsome man?

586
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,470
Let me see.

587
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,030
An extraordinarily handsome man...

588
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,270
No.

589
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,340
They are all ordinary.

590
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,800
Not half as good-looking as your brother.

591
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,980
I'm relieved then.

592
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,580
Okay.

593
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,380
I'll be right there.

594
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:49,800
Okay.

595
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,590
Bye.

596
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,200
Is your cousin easy to get along with?

597
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,620
Will it be awkward to meet her in a minute?

598
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,520
No.

599
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,400
Don't worry, baby.

600
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,620
My sister

601
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,830
has the best

602
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,080
temperament in our family.

603
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,500
Oh.

604
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,270
That's good.

605
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,630
What are you looking at?

606
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,440
I don't know.

607
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,590
I feel like that boy has been staring at me.

608
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,230
It must be that

609
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,180
my baby is too pretty.

610
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,820
No.

611
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,880
I have to block them.

612
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,750
I can't let others see you.

613
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,200
Silly.

614
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,160
Where are you? I'm here.

615
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,560
Xu Wang.

616
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,510
What's wrong?

617
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,100
Don't go over there for a while.

618
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,450
Okay.

619
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,880
You've been very busy these days.

620
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,440
Is it because of one person?

621
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,240
I...

622
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,380
I know.

623
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,620
But this person

624
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,880
may not be what you think she is.

625
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,270
Rongrong.

626
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,000
I can only hear your voice but can't see you.

627
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,380
Excuse me, buddy.

628
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:04,750
Let's go.

629
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,070
What's wrong?

630
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,910
Let go.

631
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,910
How is it?

632
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,880
Does it still hurt?

633
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,770
Well,

634
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,360
I've learned some bone-healing.

635
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,800
How about I give him...

636
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,500
No need.

637
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,070
Well.

638
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,320
Put your hands down.

639
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,270
Well...

640
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:26,860
Brother.

641
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,750
Xu Wang didn't mean it.

642
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,380
Your boyfriend feels really safe

643
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,530
to be around.

644
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,670
Good.

645
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,530
He's not my boyfriend.

646
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:39,990
What?

647
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,920
Are you chasing my sister?

648
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,800
Brother, what are you talking about?

649
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,550
Isn't it good?

650
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:47,520
Well.

651
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,190
Listen.

652
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,950
You have to hurry up if you want to chase her.

653
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,260
My aunt is trying to get her on blind dates all the time.

654
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,230
What?

655
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,730
Really?

656
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,970
Of course.

657
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,550
One of them is my classmate.

658
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,350
How about this?

659
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,740
I'll arrange a meeting for you.

660
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,210
What do you think?

661
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,380
Well...

662
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,780
No need.

663
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,790
Xu Wang.

664
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,630
Wait a minute.

665
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,070
I have something to do over there.

666
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,710
I have to go.

667
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,090
Okay.

668
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,390
If your hand...

669
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,610
It still hurts quite badly.

670
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,160
Well,

671
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,550
I'll tell my sister if anything happens.

672
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,590
Then you can tell him.

673
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,230
You two keep in touch,

674
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:26,860
okay?

675
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,390
OK.

676
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,730
Go back to work.

677
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,580
Brother.

678
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,630
Your hand is fine, right?

679
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,560
Why did you lie to him?

680
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,660
Sister-in-law, look at him.

681
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,700
Don't set them up.

682
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,120
I think the boy is quite cold.

683
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,130
Your sister

684
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,520
might be wronged.

685
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:52,870
Ah.

686
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,410
Baby.

687
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,220
What a boy thinks

688
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,400
can't be told by his attitude.

689
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,770
By what then?

690
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,450
His eyes.

691
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,930
The misunderstanding has been cleared then.

692
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,230
You don't have to hide from me anymore, right?

693
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,930
You should have told me earlier.

694
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,390
I've been holding it in for a long time.

695
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,250
Now that I think about it,

696
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,590
I should have asked my brother to come earlier.

697
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,860
Your meal is here.

698
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,000
Your hot and sour rice noodles.

699
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,800
Thank you.

700
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,210
Thank you.

701
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,840
Your beer.

702
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:31,680
Hey.

703
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,130
Don't scratch your hand.

704
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,440
Ask your boyfriend to do it.

705
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,020
What?

706
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,300
I'm very good at this.

707
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,590
I come here often.

708
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,270
Try it.

709
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:49,810
It's delicious.

710
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,650
There's something

711
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,780
I've been curious about.

712
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,680
Why do you like me?

713
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,410
We didn't spend much time together.

714
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,230
Well...

715
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,180
Don't laugh at me if I tell you.

716
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,910
In my dream,

717
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,120
my boyfriend looked just like you.

718
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,070
Really?

719
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,950
You look more like him when you smile.

720
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,860
If you ask me why I like you...

721
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,550
But the feelings for someone

722
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,060
is not a math formula.

723
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,370
It can't be solved simply by thinking about it.

724
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,220
Besides, I'm not good at math.

725
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,020
So,

726
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,350
there is no right answer.

727
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,550
I only know that

728
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,270
you are a shooting player.

729
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,660
And I suddenly became interested in shooting.

730
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,220
You went to the bookstore.

731
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,410
Bookstores became one of my favorite places.

732
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,350
I want to try all the delicious food you mentioned.

733
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,760
It's not because I'm greedy.

734
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,310
It's really because of you.

735
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,130
You always showed up in time when I needed help.

736
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,400
I think as long as you are with me,

737
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,210
I'm safe wherever I am.

738
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,190
The power went out that day.

739
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,070
Even if it was dark around,

740
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,930
I felt that you were shining brightly next to me.

741
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,680
So this is how it feels to be recognized.

742
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,110
Do you feel

743
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,910
happy?

744
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,610
I didn't feel like that a lot before.

745
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,500
It doesn't matter.

746
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,680
I'm happy.

747
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,360
I'll share it with you.

748
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,240
Wait a minute.

749
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,340
You're smiling.

750
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,660
I seem to have made up for the loss of smile over the past two years.

751
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,030
You won't

752
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,060
think I'm annoying anymore, right?

753
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,580
What I said at the training field last time

754
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,160
was actually because I thought

755
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,040
someone like me doesn't deserve your love.

756
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,720
That's why I said that on purpose.

757
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,450
No, you deserve it.

758
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,620
Well,

759
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,020
I didn't take it to heart.

760
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,320
Don't think too much.

761
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,410
Let's forget

762
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,680
about the unhappy things in the past.

763
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,500
Cheers.

764
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,270
But

765
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,200
I can only drink this little.

766
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,550
I can't drink too much.

767
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,220
Why?

768
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,060
When I get drunk,

769
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,240
I'll be too bold.

770
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,970
Too bold?

771
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,560
What will you do when you are too bold?

772
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,090
How can I let you know?

773
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,600
You...

774
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,200
Move!

775
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,730
I'll beat you if you don't move.

776
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,580
I will

777
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
teach you a lesson today.

778
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:13,930
You...

779
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,900
You know how to hide?

780
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,790
I got you.

781
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,250
Just wait.

782
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,280
I'll knock you out.

783
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,440
Okay.

784
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,280
This...

785
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,120
The pillar

786
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,480
is quite soft.

787
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,620
Song Rongrong.

788
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,410
You're drunk.

789
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,310
Why do you

790
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,910
look exactly the same

791
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,900
as the boy in my dream?

792
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,500
Song Rongrong.

793
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,340
Shhh.

794
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,590
I'm listening to your heartbeat.

795
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,350
Your heart rate

796
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,190
seems to be a little...

797
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,990
Irregular.

798
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,880
Song Rongrong.

799
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,300
Don't fall sleep.

800
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,610
You'll fall down.

801
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,520
Say something.

802
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:32,720
Rongrong.

803
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,480
Shhh.

804
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,060
You're so noisy.

805
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,150
You think others are noisy too?

806
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,760
Are you still training?

807
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,440
Yes.

808
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,120
I just finished training.

809
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,160
I'm a little tired now.

810
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,180
I might not be able to pick you up.

811
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,160
Can you go home yourself?

812
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:02,830
Sure.

813
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,250
I'm not a three-year-old.

814
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:05,640
Yes.

815
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,750
My Ji Qiu is so great.

816
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:09,929
Well.

817
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,610
Bye.

818
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,480
Three-year-old Zhou.

819
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:12,620
Yes.

820
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:37,100
Come here already.

821
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,060
♫I have a special hobby♫

822
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,170
♫I'd write a song when I miss you♫

823
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,730
♫Maybe I speak without thinking♫

824
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,550
♫But I love you more than what I expressed♫

825
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,870
♫Give me a nameless ticket♫

826
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,420
♫Let me get on the train to your heart♫

827
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,950
♫I've had a dream since I met you♫

828
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,770
♫In the dream I'm singing this song♫

829
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,670
♫I'm singing in the galaxy and in the wind♫

830
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,490
♫I dreamt of all the heart-pounding moments♫

831
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:09,540
♫How many times do I have to tell you this is not the point♫

832
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,730
♫The point is I'm in love with your face♫

833
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,260
♫I like it warmer so I don't like winter♫

834
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,520
♫Given that you are by my side♫

835
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,270
♫If there's no beginning or end♫

836
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,200
♫I'd rather sleep tight in your arms♫

837
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,160
♫I only looked at you once but it means forever♫

838
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,610
♫Do the moon and the sun miss each other too?♫

839
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,780
♫On the day I met you♫

840
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,400
♫All the stores are vending love♫

841
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,270
She's the moon in the dark.

842
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,230
She never belonged to me.

843
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,560
She once lit me up.

844
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:44,760
Today,

845
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,450
I have something to announce.

846
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,400
I'm in a relationship.

847
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,590
Me too.

848
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,130
Zhou Yubei, can you smile?

849
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,870
