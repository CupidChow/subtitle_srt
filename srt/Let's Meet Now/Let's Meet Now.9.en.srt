00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,379
Cheers.

6
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:10,920
Come on.

7
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,740
Try this fried eggs with tomatoes I made.

8
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,720
I thought

9
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,010
it's fried eggs with eggplants.

10
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,289
Well,

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,910
although you didn't cook well,

12
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,700
it's not that bad.

13
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,090
I only focus on flavor when I cook.

14
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,190
Try it. It looks just delicious.

15
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,700
It's fried eggs with tomatoes.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,260
Okay... fried eggs with tomatoes.

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,490
I'll pass.

18
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,950
Xu Wang.

19
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,060
Don't eat overcooked ones.

20
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,560
I haven't eaten it for a long time.

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,600
It's good...

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,970
Why don't you take Xu Wang to hang out?

23
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,600
I just found out that

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,140
he had never eaten osmanthus cake,

25
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,830
seen the sea in Jiangyi,

26
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,440
or even heard a live performance by a band in Haiyue Park.

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
Aren't you the one who knows these things best?

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,320
And you are the most free person.

29
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,150
Xu Wang, I told you last time that I have a friend

30
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,120
who is particularly free and loves to hang out.

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,350
That's her.

32
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,440
What did he say about me?

33
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,730
He said

34
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,750
you are enthusiastic, generous, cheerful

35
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,750
and easy to get along with.

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,530
I won't say anything else.

37
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,770
These dishes represent everything.

38
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,250
Come on.

39
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,010
I suddenly remembered.

40
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,070
How come you have the same hobby as Song Rongrong?

41
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,940
You all love fairy tale picture books.

42
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,020
Although picture books look simple,

43
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,079
it's like taking a walk, drawing,

44
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,290
and organizing books,

45
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,760
the simpler things are,

46
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,950
the more decompressed they will be.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,950
Right? I feel so too.

48
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,650
So what other hobbies do you have?

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,070
Maybe we have a lot of other common interests.

50
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,130
Shooting.

51
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,100
What else?

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,540
Football.

53
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,300
I like football too.

54
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,100
Shall we go play football now?

55
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,730
I know there's a really good football field around here.

56
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,770
Zhou Ziqian, are you going?

57
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,070
Is playing football at night...

58
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,940
I'll go.

59
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,210
I haven't been to a football field in a long time.

60
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,410
Of course I'm going.

61
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,290
But there are only five of us.

62
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,260
I can call another friend over.

63
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,070
Friend?

64
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,530
Is she pretty?

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,870
You are a fraud.

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,520
Isn't he pretty?

67
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,060
Hello, Mr. Fu.

68
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:25,650
Hello.

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,220
Don't you say hello to your teacher?

70
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,350
Can you play football?

71
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,690
I'm better than you at least.

72
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,110
Let's number everyone first.

73
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,270
Number 3. Number 5. Numer 40.

74
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,930
Why is that?

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,230
Last time I gave them a psychological test...

76
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,230
Let's get started.

77
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,490
Go.

78
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,030
Just leave this here.

79
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,170
Your team is too weak.

80
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,150
Too weak.

81
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,650
So what? You shorty.

82
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,440
Don't cry if you lose later.

83
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,420
Your shoes are fake.

84
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,850
How old are you two?

85
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,409
I shouldn't be in the same group with you.

86
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,830
He's only three years old.

87
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,310
It's the result of his psychological test.

88
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,930
This is not true.

89
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,780
I'm two years older than him.

90
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,840
Are you proud of it?

91
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,590
What about you?

92
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,270
He's forty years old.

93
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,680
Can't you guys take the game seriously?

94
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,210
It's all your fault.

95
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,860
Are you satisfied now?

96
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,390
We can't play now.

97
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,400
My fault?

98
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,350
Didn't you start this provocation first?

99
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,630
Let's figure out a solution first.

100
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,870
Just wait for Ji Qiu to calm down.

101
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,480
Why is Ji Qiu

102
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,760
so eager to win?

103
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,330
She has been like this since she was a child,

104
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,540
and she must win in everything.

105
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,290
Good.

106
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,240
She has always been special.

107
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,490
Since she was a child?

108
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,270
I was her childhood friend.

109
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,200
What about the period

110
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,230
between the time she was 13 to 23 years old?

111
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,440
Ji Qiu, can I join you now?

112
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,790
And me.

113
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,500
Shut up.

114
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,480
All the food I ate this afternoon has been digested.

115
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,020
I'm hungry.

116
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,820
Have some water first.

117
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,400
Thanks.

118
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,790
I remember

119
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,110
the last time I played football was when I just got out of college.

120
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,050
At that time, you had just gotten your internship offer,

121
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,420
so you were so excited that you couldn't sleep.

122
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,760
Then you just asked us to play football with you.

123
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,550
She was not playing football.

124
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,950
She was just too obsessed with scoring goals.

125
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,880
None of us can stop her.

126
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,909
That's because I wasn't there.

127
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,800
If I were there...

128
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,630
If you were there,

129
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,050
I would have compared with Rongrong.

130
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,340
You and Fu wouldn't even have a chance to play.

131
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,310
Didn't you say before that

132
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,380
it would be interesting

133
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,240
if the three of us turned into six one day?

134
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,630
I didn't expect it to come true so soon.

135
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,460
Do we have the same understanding?

136
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,880
That's different.

137
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,070
How?

138
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,890
That means us and our partners.

139
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,330
Two. Four. Six.

140
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,690
There are six of us now.

141
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,970
Is there any difference?

142
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,140
Team?

143
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,910
What team?

144
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,020
Who will I team up with?

145
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,930
I see.

146
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,340
Ji Qiu and I.

147
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,640
Aren't you guys talking about teaming up?

148
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,960
Yes, that's what we're talking about.

149
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,980
I'll team up with Xu Wang next time.

150
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,659
You just came to Jiangyi.

151
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,039
You should hang out more.

152
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,690
You're going to be surrounded by strange people

153
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,370
if you only spend time with them.

154
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,900
They are not strange.

155
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,440
I think they are all cute.

156
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,750
It would be nice if we could play football together more often.

157
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,910
Then Xu Wang will surely love this city soon.

158
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,710
I already love it.

159
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,790
I loved it from the first day I came here.

160
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,860
Seriously?

161
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,850
What's comparable about this?

162
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,240
How can a competitive shooter have no desire to win?

163
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,660
He does that a lot.

164
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,520
Same to you.

165
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,760
Are you leaving?

166
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,410
Yeah.

167
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,280
I'm going to Qiuye Town for two days.

168
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,940
By the way,

169
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,620
will you be okay

170
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,530
on your own?

171
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,720
You can tell me

172
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,000
if there is anything.

173
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,640
Are you sure you were the one who took care of me before?

174
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,190
We've always taken care of each other.

175
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,520
What are you looking for?

176
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,430
Camera.

177
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,210
Camera?

178
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,520
Is it this one?

179
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,860
This is for my club.

180
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,170
It's important.

181
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,790
You are going to shoot the girl you like, right?

182
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,760
You're still not with her yet?

183
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,850
Are you still making a pass at Ji Qiu?

184
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,790
What?

185
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,510
Who?

186
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,300
I making a pass at whom?

187
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,550
Don't talk nonsense.

188
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,530
How could I possibly take the initiative to do that?

189
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,630
That's impossible.

190
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,580
You want a bet？

191
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,130
Sure.

192
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,660
What are you doing?

193
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,550
Isn' t there any other things you can do?

194
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,800
Did you get the first place in the exam?

195
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,060
Which time are you talking about?

196
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,440
Forget it.

197
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,520
I'll let it go at that.

198
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,010
Yubei,

199
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,930
you came so early.

200
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,920
You are so well equipped.

201
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,190
Is this the building we are going?

202
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,840
Jiangjiang.

203
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,880
That's right.

204
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,700
Building 3, Room 302.

205
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,430
What 302?

206
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,910
Zhao Hao?

207
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,940
Zhou Yubei?

208
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,490
Why are you here?

209
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,590
Why can't we be here?

210
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,340
We are here to participate in club activities.

211
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,110
You two applied for the same club?

212
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,950
What club?

213
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,980
Let me tell you.

214
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,130
He won't talk.

215
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:24,810
Photography-club.

216
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,910
We also applied for the photography-club.

217
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,340
Only a very small percentage of people know that club.

218
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,860
Why did you apply for this club?

219
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,290
It's quiet.

220
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,210
But now because of you,

221
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,930
that only advantage is gone.

222
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,310
Let's go.

223
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,720
Do you also think they are noisy?

224
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,740
I think so too.

225
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,330
How about we change to another club?

226
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,380
That street dance club is pretty good.

227
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,170
I think you're noisy.

228
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,220
Yubei.

229
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,210
I'm so touched.

230
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,430
This is your first comment on me.

231
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,640
Ji Qiu.

232
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,910
Please wake me up when we get there.

233
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,610
I will beat you up

234
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,660
if you wake me up again.

235
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,940
Ji Qiu.

236
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,230
[Fu Tian]

237
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,710
Do you have a camera at home?

238
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,750
[Ji Qiu]

239
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,790
Why don't you treat people

240
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,680
like you treat me?

241
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,080
I joined a club.

242
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,140
[Fu Tian]

243
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,700
But I haven't saved enough money to buy a camera.

244
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,020
[Ji Qiu]

245
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,170
[Club? What club?]

246
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,200
Jiangjiang, your camera is quite good.

247
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,820
I would like to have one too.

248
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,050
So you came to learn photography just to take pictures of Zhou Ziqian?

249
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,930
Yep.

250
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,170
Why?

251
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,190
You should photograph those trees.

252
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,710
They can change colors.

253
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,640
Of course you don't understand.

254
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,140
After all, there is a difference between people and people.

255
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:15,890
I...

256
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,110
Hello, everyone.

257
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,730
I am a sophomore student in the photography department of Jiangyi University

258
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,100
and the president of photography-club.

259
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,750
My name is Meng Qing.

260
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,380
It's your first time here.

261
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,950
I didn't prepare anything.

262
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,700
I'll tell you about the difference

263
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,810
between film and digital.

264
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,640
Do you think this senior looks like Zhou Ziqian?

265
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,140
He is indeed like him.

266
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,480
Could he be Zhou Ziqian's brother?

267
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,250
The biggest difference between film and digital

268
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,760
is that the amount of film is limited.

269
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,640
Look at this camera.

270
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,060
A roll of film can only take 12 pictures.

271
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,150
-This means that every time you press the shutter... -12.

272
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,270
...you'll have no chance to regret.

273
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,810
The sun is shining right now.

274
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,800
Would any of you like to come up and do a demonstration?

275
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,310
Me!

276
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,040
That girl, please.

277
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,230
Just stand there.

278
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,180
Anyone else want to give it a try?

279
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,110
Then...

280
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,620
That boy, please.

281
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,850
Do you know how to use this camera?

282
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,520
Yes.

283
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,280
Let's start.

284
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,330
♫I haven't written to others since October♫

285
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,980
During the shooting,

286
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,160
the interaction between the photographer and the subject is also very important.

287
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,690
You have to make your model...

288
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,320
♫I'm just a little composer♫

289
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,230
relax completely in front of you.

290
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,290
And you have to trust each other.

291
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,990
For example,

292
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,330
you can call her name.

293
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,080
♫Never mind these bad things and put them in the corner♫

294
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,040
Fu Tian.

295
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,560
Smile.

296
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,240
♫Just think about what it's worth♫

297
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:07,420
♫Focus on the things that will make you feel better♫

298
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,030
So the first reaction of having a crush

299
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,640
is not a blush nor a racing heart.

300
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,090
It's that you can't help

301
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,320
♫It will make you happier♫

302
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,970
but look at that person one more time.

303
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,520
So, Mr. Fu...

304
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,160
eyes are the most direct, right?

305
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,200
Yes.

306
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,060
There are five minutes left until the end of class.

307
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,820
Is there anything else you want to know?

308
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,170
Mr. Fu.

309
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,840
I heard that you are going to a variety show soon,

310
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,580
is that true?

311
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,870
You...

312
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,020
How come you know it so soon?

313
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,830
Everyone knows it.

314
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,740
Mr. Fu, I'm a fan of Xiao Chen.

315
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,150
Could you please

316
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,550
get his autograph for me?

317
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,830
It may depend on your final exam grades.

318
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,020
If you can get a grade of 85,

319
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,830
I'll consider it.

320
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,680
I want it too.

321
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,840
I can get a 85.

322
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,810
Whose autograph do you want?

323
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:55,930
Zhou Ziqian!

324
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,580
Zhou Ziqian...

325
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,290
Then you have to get 100.

326
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,420
Wow, do you think the sea here

327
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,290
is not the same as Jiangyi's?

328
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,310
They're both blue.

329
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,600
But it seems that you can't see the edge of the sea here.

330
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,820
Is that a reef over there?

331
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,880
What?

332
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,620
Let's go see the sea.

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,440
Hello, do you know where I am now?

334
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,890
I am on my way to Qiuye Town.

335
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,140
Here is a side of the road with no name.

336
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,010
♫Reading the tales in your eyes♫

337
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,610
But the sea here is very beautiful.

338
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,440
Let me show you.

339
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,330
♫Drawing the smile in your mind♫

340
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,570
What do you think?

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,640
♫Bringing all the colours♫

342
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,450
I just passed by a few shells.

343
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,500
♫If you can be bright♫

344
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,310
Although they are not as big as Jiangyi's shells,

345
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,890
they are colorful.

346
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,470
♫Packing the stuff and throwing away♫

347
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,130
Isn't this place much prettier than Jiangyi?

348
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,060
♫Cover the shadow if I can♫

349
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,340
Why are you acting like it's your first time to see the sea?

350
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,830
♫Should I keep on telling you♫

351
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,030
Although I have been in Jiangyi for years,

352
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,400
♫Forget and say bye♫

353
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,910
I rarely went to the beach.

354
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,220
Not to mention other seas.

355
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,720
So...

356
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,060
♫It's alright♫

357
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,190
Even though it's not my first time to see the sea,

358
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,180
♫Cause the darkness♫

359
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,250
I still find it very refreshing.

360
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,430
Then let's stay here a little longer.

361
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,050
♫Doesn't suddenly be lighted♫

362
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,490
We're not in a hurry anyway.

363
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,290
What do you mean by staying a little longer?

364
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,240
♫It's alright♫

♫Loneliness is just a part of life♫

366
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,400
Isn't it normal

367
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,880
to see what you like for a while longer?

368
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,670
♫Including you and I♫

♫Hey don't you forget♫

370
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,109
Only a child would think so.

371
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,000
What would adults think?

372
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,450
♫How many times♫

373
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,050

♫Oh would you please♫

376
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,330
It's hard for adults to find things they like.

♫Follow the light♫

378

it's not enough for them to see those a little longer.

[Try not to contact her]

392

Isn't this place prettier than Jiangyi?

393
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,590
Brother.

394
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,630
Why are you alone here?

395
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,270
They should be off to their classes.

396
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,960
Is your club class over?

397
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,530
Yes.

398
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,760
Brother,

399
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,380
could you lend me your phone later?

400
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,140
I was just borrowing a camera from Ji Qiu.

401
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,880
but my phone ran out of battery.

402
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,220
Ji Qiu?

403
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,890
Yes.

404
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,360
Call her now.

405
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,620
Now?

406
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,870
Alright.

407
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,090
I've taken enough pictures.

408
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,010
Look.

409
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,570
I think this one is good.

410
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,140
This one is good too.

411
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,940
Not bad.

412
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,580
That's all.

413
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,580
Why did you shoot Fu Qile?

414
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,670
Yeah...

415
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,870
He doesn't like to be photographed.

416
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,500
So I'm the only one who can take pictures for him.

417
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,750
After all, he's going to be in the same variety show with you,

418
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,760
So we need some daily pictures of him.

419
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,390
Fu Qile?

420
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,880
He's in the show too?

421
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,300
Didn't I tell you?

422
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,720
If you had told me about this surprising thing,

423
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,950
I would have never forgotten it.

424
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,260
I do want to surprise you.

425
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,770
You will be colleagues

426
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,750
and you will be able to work together every day.

427
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,090
How nice will it be when you can see each other every day.

428
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,730
I'm... I'm so happy.

429
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,970
It's a little cold. I'll go get a coat.

430
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,040
Let's watch the sunset before we go.

431
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,870
How could this be?

432
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,090
Ji Qiu. Your phone is ringing.

433
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,470
[Fu Qile]

434
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,250
It's Fu Qile.

435
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,320
Don't you know him?

436
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,740
Answer it.

437
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:14,940
Okay.

438
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,830
Hello? Ji Qiu.

439
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,530
Who is this?

440
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,810
It's none of your business. Who is speaking?

441
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,790
Where is Ji Qiu? Why are you having her phone?

442
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,340
I am next to her, so I answer the phone for her.

443
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,520
Where is Ji Qiu?

444
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,850
Ji Qiu?

445
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,310
It's inconvenient for her. She is getting dressed.

446
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,730
You pervert!

447
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,620
Well... Tiantian, he is...

448
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,810
You're shameless!

449
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,390
Do you think she will be with you?

450
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,570
What are you doing, you pervert?

451
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,410
Brother, don't worry, I didn't swear.

452
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,280
How dare this guy do this?

453
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,310
I will help you scold him.

454
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,510
What's wrong with your face?

455
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,000
She's scolding me.

456
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,720
What is she saying?

457
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,700
If you dare to do anything to Ji Qiu...

458
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,410
I'll make things very difficult for you! You pervert!

459
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,000
Tiantian.

460
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:22,750
Ji Qiu.

461
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,590
Why do you have such a strange friend?

462
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,700
Okay.

463
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,000
It's a deal then.

464
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,070
Is Rongrong home?

465
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,600
I'll go get the camera tomorrow.

466
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,870
Am I cool?

467
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,990
Don't worry.

468
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,050
He won't have that kind of thoughts about Ji Qiu anymore.

469
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,870
Tiantian.

470
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,460
Do you think it's terrible for a fan

471
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,150
to insult her idol?

472
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,500
How can there be such a person?

473
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,750
She should respect her idol.

474
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,090
How could she insult him?

475
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,940
She's not really a fan at all.

476
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,230
She's an anti-fan.

477
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,140
That's terrible.

478
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,240
How do you know such people?

479
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,610
Who is she? Do I know her?

480
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,230
It's better for you to not know.

481
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,600
Tiantian?

482
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,400
I don't think this name suits her at all.

483
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,170
I think it's better to call her Lala.

484
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,700
She's actually quite cute.

485
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,350
But she probably just thought you were some kind of weirdo.

486
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,890
You should meet her.

487
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,340
Just forget it.

488
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,290
How long till we get there?

489
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,410
If it goes well,

490
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,670
we'll be there in about ten minutes.

491
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,800
You can still get some sleep if you are still sleepy.

492
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,700
This is...

493
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,090
Is the car broken down?

494
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,460
I think

495
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,130
so.

496
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,270
Well...

497
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,090
If you really can't...

498
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,400
Let's...

499
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,040
I can do it.

500
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,010
I can't.

501
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,550
I didn't expect you to fix it anyway.

502
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,780
How about we just hitch a ride on the way?

503
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,670
And see if we can find a repair shop nearby.

504
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,770
Would any car be willing to stop?

505
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,890
That depends on who's asking for help.

506
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,890
What are you doing?

507
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,250
How can you just do something so dangerous?

508
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,140
How is it dangerous?

509
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,680
It's not like I'm standing in the middle of the road.

510
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,200
I'll step back a little bit.

511
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,190
Alright.

512
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:06,970
You are so unreliable.

513
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:07,970
Let me do it.

514
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,370
Can you make it?

515
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,160
Stop trying.

516
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,330
Let's put the car...

517
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,530
Get in.

518
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,560
Seriously?

519
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,100
How old are you?

520
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,910
I'm 26.

521
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,420
Okay.

522
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,570
Hey, how old are you?

523
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,940
Twenty-one years old.

524
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,730
That's just right.

525
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,120
Watch the road.

526
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,460
You are quite lonely back there...

527
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,850
How about I sit next to you?

528
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,910
Dude.

529
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,800
Are you a local?

530
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,340
I lived here for a while before.

531
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,380
Are you from Qiuye Town?

532
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,050
How do you know?

533
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,170
That's right.

534
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,110
You are Zhou Yue, right?

535
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,400
You know me?

536
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,690
I'm Hu Yang. Did you forget?

537
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,760
We used to play together a lot.

538
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,080
Do you remember now?

539
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,470
I just saw this scar on your face, and I was thinking...

540
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,920
I was wondering why you look so familiar.

541
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,750
Then I remembered that

542
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,450
your scar was made by Ji Qiu in the past.

543
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,110
Do you remember Ji Qiu?

544
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,670
At that time,

545
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,740
she had the worst temper.

546
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,510
Her voice

547
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,670
was so loud.

548
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,500
And she was so strong.

549
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,980
She had a boyish personality

550
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,950
and way of doing things.

551
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,040
She was just a hot-tempered girl!

552
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,590
Do you think she should

553
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,250
be a wrestler now?

554
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,470
How long till we get there?

555
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,700
None of us dared to mess with her at the time.

556
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,940
Only you followed her like a fool.

557
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,330
You can't really blame her

558
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,980
for your scar.

559
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,680
After all, she did it to help you.

560
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,260
I remember there were a few kids

561
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,490
bullying you at the time...

562
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,440
Ji Qiu was also quite stupid.

563
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,990
In order to help you fight,

564
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,640
she rushed into the crowd to help you,  but with her eyes closed,

565
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,000
and ended up causing you a wound

566
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,290
on your face.

567
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,660
There seem to be four or five of the kids

568
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,390
who were bullying you at that time.

569
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,280
Five.

570
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,520
Right. Five.

571
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,060
Sorry, I just got too excited...

572
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,050
Who are you?

573
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,780
Ji Qiu.

574
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,220
Although this is just a living room,

575
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,700
it's quite large.

576
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,240
At night...

577
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,600
I'm married.

578
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,110
It can't be too noisy when the child is sleeping.

579
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,200
Otherwise, Zhou Yue,

580
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,870
we could still sleep together.

581
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,850
But it's okay.

582
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,660
I'll bring you a mattress later

583
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,790
and put it here.

584
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,530
Then I'll hang a curtain

585
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,220
in the middle.

586
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,940
It will separate you two.

587
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,540
It will be okay for you to sleep here.

588
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,440
We'll sleep together?

589
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,180
What?

590
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,230
Well...

591
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,000
Don't bother.

592
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,630
We'll go find a hotel.

593
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,680
There should be one around here.

594
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,240
What's wrong with my house?

595
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,710
We're not.

596
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,570
We just thought it would bother you.

597
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,240
It's okay.

598
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,170
It's late now.

599
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,580
Those hotels are probably

600
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,040
out of rooms now.

601
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,410
But...

602
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,300
Alright.

603
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,490
That's it.

604
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,190
We were so close before.

605
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,900
We shouldn't treat each other

606
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,790
as a stranger now.

607
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,390
How about you guys stay in that room?

608
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,810
I think it's fine right here.

609
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:43,990
It's good here.

610
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,670
Okay then.

611
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,930
Take a rest first.

612
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,540
I'll get a mattress for you.

613
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,140
Make yourselves

614
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
at home.

615
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,710
I think it's nice here.

616
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,660
It's...

617
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,690
large enough for us.

618
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,910
I...

619
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,580
I'll sleep on the outside.

620
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,860
Well...

621
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,060
I think it's all right.

622
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,290
I wonder what Rongrong is doing.

623
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,830
You two share one room?

624
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,790
But...

625
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,810
Zhou Ziqian is a gentleman.

626
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,310
You two are siblings.

627
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,590
That's true.

628
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,400
Qiu,

629
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
I am now at the bookstore.

630
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,600
I'd better let you go.

631
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,300
I'm hanging up.

632
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,330
Have fun.

633
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:09,410
Wait... Rongrong.

634
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,710
Ji Qiu,

635
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,220
are you a little...

636
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,050
-Nervous? -Nervous?

637
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,740
How is that possible?

638
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,200
I'm not.

639
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,560
I just think...

640
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,480
it's been too long since I've hung out with other people,

641
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,780
so I'm a little embarrassed.

642
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,220
Am I...

643
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,130
not familiar enough with you?

644
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,780
That's right.

645
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,380
You're right.

646
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,850
You are my brother.

647
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,730
Why isn't that book here?

648
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,240
Has it been moved to another shelf?

649
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,570
Excuse me.

650
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,510
I would like to ask where these picture books are?

651
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,110
Why are you here?

652
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,340
I usually come here to help when I'm free.

653
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,810
Picture books...

654
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,090
We sorted these books before.

655
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,310
Those picture books are on the other shelves.

656
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,200
I'll take you there.

657
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,900
What kind are you looking for?

658
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,430
It's all okay.

659
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,860
They're all here.

660
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,580
Just take a look.

661
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,310
Feel free to ask me if there's anything you can't find.

662
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,630
Okay.

663
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,010
I'll leave you to it.

664
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,870
Excuse me...

665
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,810
Will you be here every weekend?

666
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,920
Only when I have less training.

667
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,680
It's not a sure thing.

668
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,310
Why?

669
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,880
I'm just asking.

670
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,710
Take a rest.

671
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,760
You'll get tired.

672
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,720
Thank you.

673
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,880
You've been organizing books for a long time,

674
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,370
don't you get bored?

675
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,420
There's no one to talk to...

676
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,110
He's here.

677
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,200
Fortunately, he hasn't left yet.

678
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,460
There are still some books that need to be organized.

679
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,180
I have to go now.

680
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,460
Okay.

681
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,350
I haven't even had a chance to speak yet.

682
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,680
How did he just leave?

683
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,870
But he's really handsome.

684
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,980
Calm down.

685
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,750
We are no longer the junior high school students

686
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,560
with double ponytails wearing cartoon hoodies.

687
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,670
Which grade is she in?

688
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,070
Ninth grade?

689
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,360
I don't think so.

690
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,170
I think she's in eighth grade.

691
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,170
Shall I ask her?

692
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,090
Xu Wang.

693
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,070
I have

694
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,560
work to do.

695
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,730
I'm leaving.

696
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,570
Okay.

697
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,980
So she's not a junior high school student?

698
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,170
Adults also like to wear cartoon hoodies?

699
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,460
Who knows.

700
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,750
What am I nervous about?

701
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,550
You can't sleep either?

702
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,920
I'm not used to this place yet.

703
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,020
We can't sleep anyway,

704
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,430
why don't we have a chat?

705
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,260
What do you want to talk about?

706
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,110
Anything.

707
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,140
What do you want to know?

708
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:53,760
Will you answer anything

709
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,940
I ask you?

710
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,670
It depends.

711
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,000
Why can't you

712
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,940
sleep either?

713
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,900
This question is so boring.

714
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,320
I can't sleep because of my professional habits.

715
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,139
Usually I'm still reading materials at this time.

716
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:14,800
Well...

717
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,239
Since this job is so hard,

718
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,679
then why would you still choose this industry?

719
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,080
Variety show director...

720
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,190
It's actually quite simple.

721
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,900
Life is hard enough for people.

722
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,000
I hope everyone can have fun

723
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,380
when they get home and turn on the TV.

724
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,790
It...

725
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,190
It makes me happy to see that everyone is so happy

726
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,050
to watch the variety shows I direct.

727
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,580
When I was a kid,

728
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,429
I used to be alone at home.

729
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,730
I would turn on the TV every time I ate,

730
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,650
because it was very lively.

731
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,429
At that time,

732
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,010
there was a variety show that I liked very much.

733
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,070
Every time I would forget about eating

734
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,210
when watching that show.

735
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,310
I still remember

736
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,130
there was a guest

737
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,300
who would wear a colorful suit every time

738
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,280
and say how smart his cat was.

739
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,910
That's when I realized

740
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,010
that emotions are contagious.

741
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,350
What are you laughing at?

742
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,360
I am substantiating your point.

743
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,660
I am infected by your happiness.

744
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,570
You have indeed changed quite a lot from your childhood.

745
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,740
You weren't very talkative.

746
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,040
So do you think

747
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,140
I'm better

748
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,030
now?

749
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,960
No.

750
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,150
Why?

751
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,780
You were so cute when you were a kid.

752
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,400
And I could play tricks on you.

753
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,310
Every time you were bullied,

754
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,600
you would be aggrieved and say...

755
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,950
Ji Qiu.

756
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,890
Is that scar on your face really made by me?

757
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,330
You never told me before.

758
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,320
But I've never really looked at it either.

759
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,820
Is it really obvious?

760
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:07,920
Then,

761
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,320
do you want to take a look now?

00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,930
