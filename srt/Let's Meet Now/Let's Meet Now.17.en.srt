00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,600
Why are you still here?

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,620
Xu Wang has already arrived.

7
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,360
Aren't you going to check these questions with him?

8
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,570
Do I look normal？

9
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,090
Yep.

10
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,770
Except that your eyes are not very focused,

11
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,320
your cheeks are a little blush,

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,840
and your smile

13
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,150
is a little stiff.

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,330
Whatever. I'm going.

15
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,539
Hey...

16
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,680
Why would she be nervous?

17
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:32,770
Well,

18
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,850
I've sent you the interview script before.

19
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,840
We didn't revise it.

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,090
Is there anything you don't understand?

21
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,030
No.

22
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,729
Well...

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,390
Just wait for a moment.

24
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,300
My colleague should be here soon.

25
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,180
Did you went so far that night alone

26
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,500
because...

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,370
I really wanted to eat the sweet potatoes

28
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,890
sold there.

29
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,640
That was why I went there.

30
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,870
Don't overthink it.

31
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,330
It just occurred to me that you mentioned it before,

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,580
so I brought one for each of you.

33
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,370
Don't go so far away so late at night alone

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,060
in the future.

35
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,260
Sorry for the trouble yesterday.

36
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,579
I will tell...

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,920
Qiu about that in the future.

38
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,220
I want to apologize to you.

39
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,320
That day at the training gallery,

40
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,420
I was actually in a bad state,

41
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,520
so I subconsciously said something.

42
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,020
I don't want you to doubt yourself because of what I said.

43
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,579
You're nice.

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,680
As pale as it is for me to say this now,

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,560
I still want you to know.

46
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,660
It's okay.

47
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,920
I'm actually kind of glad.

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,810
You were at least able to vent in front of me for a short while.

49
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,220
Are you ready, Mr. Xu?

50
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,240
Let's begin then.

51
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,450
You transferred from Suyang team to Jiangyi team this year.

52
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,180
It's been a while.

53
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:18,910
How is it?

54
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,660
How are you settling in?

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,820
Not bad.

56
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,500
I made some friends here.

57
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,860
Do you still keep in touch with your friends in Suyang?

58
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,810
This question is not on the interview script.

59
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,740
It's none of your business.

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,440
Of course.

61
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,610
After all, we'll see each other often on the field.

62
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,430
As we all know,

63
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,790
the National Shooting Championships will begin soon.

64
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,579
And you will be there too.

65
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,540
But unfortunately, it will be sort of special for that day.

66
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,250
Well...

67
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,520
Will it affect you?

68
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,860
Why are you asking this?

69
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,390
If you can't answer, I'll change to another question.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,380
Are you going for the champion this time?

71
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,060
Is it because of your parents?

72
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,390
You've never won a championship since two years ago.

73
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,880
Is it because of your parents too?

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,800
Will it affect you a lot?

75
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,340
We are leaving.

76
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,030
Xu Wang, let's go.

77
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,700
Song Rongrong, you're at work.

78
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,440
Are you going to take responsibility for the accident if you take the guest away like this?

79
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,380
You will regret it.

80
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,240
♫Am I the shining star?♫

81
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,900
♫Are you fond of me?♫

82
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,750
Alas.

83
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:40,640
♫You just stepped in sight, with your sparkly eyes♫

84
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,380
That's not right.

85
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,480
I shouldn't have done it like that.

86
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,180
How could I do that?

87
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,260
How could I...

88
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,770
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,100
♫Am I falling for you?♫

90
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,710
It's all because of me.

91
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,520
How could I just leave like that?

92
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,590
That was not right.

93
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,560
♫Do you feel the same?♫

94
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,690
I should've just sued her in front of everyone,

95
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,020
♫We just soaked in the fire, as no one would care♫

96
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,790
and threw the original script into her face.

97
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:50,860
Ah,

98
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,510
it was all my fault.

99
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,500
I was in a hurry and forgot it.

100
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,700
♫You hold me so tight♫

101
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,050
What do you think?

102
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,380
Should I have been cooler?

103
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,280
♫Like I would slip away♫

104
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,700
You were cool enough back there.

105
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,300
But,

106
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,230
♫The best encounter has arrived♫

107
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,510
if I could be cooler,

108
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,440
you wouldn't have to listen to those questions.

109
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,480
♫I'm thrilled to say the word♫

110
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,180
Thank you

111
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,450
for what you have done.

112
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,770
♫Love is love♫

113
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,300
Come on.

114
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,190
Don't do this.

115
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,670
♫No need to apologize♫

116
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,570
I am still feeling guilty about this.

117
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,700
Don't think about those questions.

118
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,670
♫Love is love♫

119
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,740
Just ignore them

120
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,200
like you never heard of them.

121
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,020
Don't listen to them.

122
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,620
♫In my life♫

123
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,060
In fact, many people have asked me this question.

124
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,390
After my parents passed away,

125
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,450
before I entered the competition,

126
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,020
or when I lost the gold medal,

127
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,760
they would always put the camera and the microphone

128
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,270
in front of me.

129
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,490
It seems that you have to answer.

130
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,050
This is the first time someone told me

131
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,650
that I can ignore them.

132
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,360
But what they did was not right.

133
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:58,830
You know what?

134
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,850
I wasn't planing on get involved with anyone

135
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,890
when I came to Jiangyi.

136
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,230
I came here to win the championship.

137
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,440
I started to learn shooting at 11.

138
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,020
I never thought I was gifted.

139
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,940
I just got luck

140
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,430
to win some gold medals.

141
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,670
Actually, my parents never asked me for anything.

142
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,740
No matter what achievement I got,

143
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,910
they would think it was good enough.

144
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,530
They must be proud of you.

145
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,770
But then they were gone.

146
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,870
And I never won a gold medal again.

147
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,020
Everyone thinks that

148
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,920
I couldn't win the gold medal because my parents were gone.

149
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm the only one who knows it is not the truth.

150
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,470
But I can't prove it.

151
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,270
I can only rely on my grades.

152
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,950
So I must win the championship.

153
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,020
It's not because I want it so bad.

154
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,350
I just don't think that my parents should be

155
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,450
my so-called mental disorder.

156
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,440
They are always

157
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,659
my motivation to get on the stage.

158
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:03,520
♫I've finally got ready to see you♫

159
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,200
Xu Wang.

160
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,590
I think

161
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,360
you've put too much pressure on yourself.

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,970
♫My heart is pounding with all kinds of feelings♫

163
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,920
When I was in college,

164
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,600
I had a high jump competition once.

165
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,440
♫How should I hold the flowers so I don't look nervous♫

166
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,700
When I went on the field,

167
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,460
I just stood in front of the pole and didn't dare to jump.

168
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,170
My teacher just told me

169
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,590
that nothing would happen if I lost,

170
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,270
♫Your city is so big♫

171
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,230
I wouldn't lose anything,

172
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,520
and the world wouldn't come to the end.

173
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,790
♫I'm about to see you♫

174
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,620
I thought about it,

175
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,910
and found out he was right.

176
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,510
It couldn't affect anything.

177
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,610
So I went ahead.

178
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,670
♫I must act more natural than you♫

179
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,190
Then...

180
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,159
I found that he was lying to me.

181
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,260
I couldn't even jump over the pole,

182
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:48,060
♫The eyes that can push my tears away♫

183
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,990
and my legs were scratched.

184
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,780
I just want to tell you.

185
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,880
You can win the championship.

186
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:54,040
♫Why are they avoiding me♫

187
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,150
But it's also okay to lose.

188
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,620
The sky won't collapse.

189
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,750
The air won't disappear.

190
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,440
The earth won't stand still.

191
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,320
♫Let's go find a night♫

192
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,670
And your friends

193
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,230
♫Without other people♫

194
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,250
won't leave you because you lose the competition.

195
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,260
As for everything else, they can be ignored.

196
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,760
♫Without other people♫

197
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,770
Your parents had never asked you for anything before,

198
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,050
and they won't do so in the future.

199
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:15,370
♫I will write a soft love song for you♫

200
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,680
They probably

201
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,160
just want you to enjoy the competition.

202
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,550
♫In your preferred grammar♫

203
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,320
Why are you laughing?

204
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,560
I'm laughing because what you said makes sense.

205
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,180
♫Can we be together♫

206
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,210
You're quite different today...

207
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,820
Different?

208
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,350
...from the way you used to be.

209
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,340
♫It must be so sweet♫

210
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,830
Like a rabbit,

211
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,370
you can bite people when you are fierce,

212
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,720
and you are pretty good at biting.

213
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:45,280
♫I live in the same sunset as you do♫

214
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,710
Are you saying I'm fierce?

215
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,600
Do you want to hear the truth?

216
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:51,980
♫So gentle that you feel tired♫

217
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,480
I want to award you a carrot.

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,160
Yes.

223
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,460
That's why I was so angry.

224
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,920
Fortunately, my director didn't blame me.

225
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,020
Otherwise, I would be unemployed now.

226

♫I won't let you be afraid♫

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,990
Of course not.

229
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,110
I didn't do anything wrong.

230
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:20,720
That's right.

231
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,890
You can never lose your principles.

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,320
I knew it.

235
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,890
But,

236
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,660
♫My heart is pounding with all kinds of feelings♫

237
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,860
I've been working in the office for so long.

238
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,230
It seems

239
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,550
quite exciting to do something like this.

240
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,300
Do you want something

241
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,560
more exciting?

242
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,470
More exciting?

243
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,640
It is weekend tomorrow.

244
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,810
I will take a day off.

245
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,130
How about we going to see a movie?

246
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,940
A horror movie

247
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,280
was released recently.

248
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,480
Okay.

249
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,580
Wait,

250
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,960
I need to tell Xu Wang that it's all settled.

251
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,180
In case he still thinks he has affected my work and blamed himself.

252
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,340
What happened at the interview has been solved.

253
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,460
Don't worry about any influence.

254
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,590
[Dad, I played football today. Mom, I ate my friend's scrambled egg with tomato, and It was a bit burnt.]

255
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,750
[Maybe I ate too much. I want to eat the food you cooked again.]

256
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,570
Dad.

257
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:29,910
Mom.

258
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,180
I was wrong.

259
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,390
Even if I didn't take the first place,

260
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,120
you would still be proud of me, right?

261
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,660
This is your best performance for these days,

262
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,380
even better than the time when you were stable.

263
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,970
Today's training time is almost over.

264
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,640
I want to practice a little bit more.

265
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,430
Okay.

266
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,500
Just be careful.

267
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,040
Why was he so good today?

268
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,470
When the coach passed by,

269
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,760
the temperature was almost zero.

270
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,590
But she immediately got pleasant when talking to him,

271
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,630
and then left with joy.

272
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,840
He's got that level.

273
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,130
He will get high scores when he's in good condition.

274
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,520
When will I get that?

275
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,120
Where are you going?

276
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,370
Aren't you going back to the dorm with me?

277
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,540
Who's going back to the dorm with you?

278
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,740
I have to go.

279
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,340
There must be a catch.

280
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,500
I've always wanted to watch

281
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,260
this movie for a long time.

282
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,560
It seems there are still a few minutes left.

283
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,090
We're a little early.

284
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,020
Rock, paper, scissors.

285
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,420
Switch positions with me if you lose.

286
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,970
I refuse.

287
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,730
By the way,

288
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,220
what movie is this?

289
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,980
A Quiet Place.

290
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,760
Is it good?

291
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,150
Yes.

292
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,380
But it's a little scary.

293
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,480
Scary?

294
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,180
Yes.

295
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,510
Because it's a horror movie.

296
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,240
You are not scared,

297
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,410
are you?

298
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,240
How is that possible?

299
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,490
I believe in science.

300
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,850
Horror movies to me

301
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,880
are no different from cartoons.

302
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,240
Well,

303
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,640
is that so?

304
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,410
Are you scared?

305
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,140
Horror movies are getting boring these days.

306
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,600
Is this makeup effect...

307
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
for the kindergarten concert?

308
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,100
Gosh.

309
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,210
Yes,

310
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,640
I'm a little scared.

311
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,280
So, Ji Qiu,

312
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,930
you must protect me.

313
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,970
Are you that scared?

314
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,790
Ah.

315
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,650
It's not scary at all.

316
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,620
Ah.

317
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,290
Ah.

318
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,470
Ah.

319
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,180
Ah!

320
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:28,910
Well,

321
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,200
it's a little scary.

322
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,560
Here,

323
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,820
hold my arm.

324
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,620
Ah.

325
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,090
What do you think of the movie?

326
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,480
Good.

327
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,130
I think that man did a really good job on his role.

328
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,530
It's not cold?

329
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,900
The whether got cold these days. You should drink less cold drinks.

330
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,450
You are getting more and more nosy.

331
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,380
Thank you.

332
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,060
You're welcome.

333
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:29,770
Ji Qiu.

334
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,020
Jiang Yu.

335
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,730
You still remember me.

336
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,980
I was going to introduce myself.

337
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,450
Long time no see.

338
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,580
Have you been in Jiangyi all the time?

339
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,110
Well,

340
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,950
I just came back recently.

341
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,890
Are these your friends?

342
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,450
Yes.

343
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,400
They are all my friends.

344
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,490
He's the senior from your college debate team, right?

345
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,350
Yes.

346
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,950
Qiu has many friends.

347
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,790
But,

348
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,140
she's still single.

349
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,810
Why are you talking about this?

350
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,680
I see.

351
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,020
Well,

352
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,310
can I have your number?

353
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,520
We should keep in touch.

354
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,320
Sure.

355
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,420
Where is my cellphone?

356
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,500
Right,

357
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,650
my cellphone, please.

358
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,340
Your cellphone?

359
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,880
I think  your cellphone was left at home. Let's go back and get it now.

360
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,470
Wait.

361
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,840
Didn't I ask you to take it for me?

362
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,090
Really?

363
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,360
No.

364
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,700
Wait,

365
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,010
the phone is ringing.

366
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,810
Ah.

367
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,350
Haha.

368
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,450
I have it.

369
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,800
I forgot.

370
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,200
Rongrong did it on purpose, right?

371
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,550
Don't overestimated her.

372
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,600
It's just a coincidence.

373
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,460
Jiang Yu.

374
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,440
Coming.

375
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,180
My colleague is calling me.

376
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,890
I have something to do.

377
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,480
Bye.

378
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,250
Okay.

379
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,460
See you next time.

380
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,130
Bye.

381
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,220
See you next time.

382
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,520
Qiu,

383
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,280
this senior looks quite outstanding.

384
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,339
Well...

385
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:16,960
he's not that good.

386
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,270
Just...

387
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,609
not bad.

388
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,960
What is wrong with you two?

389
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,410
Jiang Yu was the most handsome guy of the debate team back then.

390
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,920
He even invited me to dinner when I graduated.

391
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,700
But I didn't make it because of the exam.

392
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,260
It's a pity to think about it.

393
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,530
Not at all.

394
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,420
Your study is more important.

395
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,860
That's right.

396
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,040
I think

397
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,820
maybe you can develop your relationship this time.

398
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,500
He was just being polite by saying keep in touch.

399
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,360
How is that possible for me and him?

400
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,380
Who is it?

401
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,870
It's Jiang Yu

402
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,700
asking me to watch a movie this weekend.

403
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,650
I knew it.

404
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,310
What movie?

405
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,490
Didn't we just watch one today?

406
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,990
Won't you get tired?

407
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,610
You...

408
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,190
Don't you need to rest this weekend?

409
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:02,850
I'm not tired.

410
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,510
Qiu,

411
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,500
remember to dress gentle.

412
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,510
I'm fine now.

413
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,820
You've known each other for so long.

414
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,040
You don't know him?

415
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,640
Aren't you the same?

416
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,210
Xu Wang.

417
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,430
Just leave this.

418
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,430
We'll have to deal with those later.

419
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,800
Do these books need to be moved to other area?

420
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,420
Yeah.

421
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,370
We are hosting an event,

422
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,580
so the layout needs to be adjusted.

423
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,470
Okay, I'll do it.

424
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,690
By the way,

425
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,050
there's one more thing.

426
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,580
We need a female model

427
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,110
to take some photos to use as propaganda posters.

428
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,960
I think

429
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,560
your friend Rongrong is quite good.

430
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,530
How about

431
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,580
you asking her about that?

432
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,250
Okay, I will.

433
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,210
Thank you.

434
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,780
Taking pictures?

435
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,930
Sure.

436
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,030
Your photo will be displayed in the store

437
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,350
as propaganda.

438
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,530
Okay.

439
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,650
It may take up half a day of your time tomorrow.

440
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,310
No problem.

441
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,190
Aren't you going to ask something else?

442
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,920
It's a favor anyway. You won't cheat me.

Yes, we don't have much time.

454

More natural.

Don't be so stiff.

465

I don't seem to be very good at posing.

475

I think you did pretty well.

477
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,560

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,610
So he told me in the morning that he would not be able to come often in the future.

508
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,970
Indeed.

509
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,750
These athletes train so hard.

510
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,960
Any factor

511
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,900
could affect their competition.

512
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,870
Didn't he say before that every time he comes to help it's very stress relieving?

513
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,530
It's different now.

514
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,650
Now girls keep coming over often

515
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,290
and staring at him

516
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,060
without doing anything.

517
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,050
He couldn't even refuse.

518
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,240
So he didn't relieve his pressure at all.

519
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,290
Have you decided not to appear in front of Xu Wang for now?

520
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,410
Yeah.

521
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,880
I seem to have put a lot of pressure on him.

522
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,040
We were almost misunderstood

523
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,270
as a couple today.

524
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,630
What's more, he has rejected me.

525
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,690
Not only would I be of no help around him,

526
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,610
but I would also influence him.

527
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,300
He has a competition coming up

528
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,020
and can't be influenced by me.

529
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,360
It seems reasonable.

530
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,730
But I feel something is wrong.

531
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,830
Anyway, the competition is the most important thing.

532
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,460
Qiu,

533
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,890
am I being particularly perceptive now?

534
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,380
By the way, Qiu,

535
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,430
are you going to watch a movie with that senior tomorrow?

536
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,070
Yep.

537
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,270
Hm...

538
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,300
So romantic.

539
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,920
What's romantic about watching a movie?

540
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,920
You can't hold my hand.

541
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,900
You can't!

542
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,620
They're going to watch the movie tomorrow.

543
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,190
It's today.

544
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,700
How does time pass so quickly?

545
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,770
What should I do?

546
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:09,950
Tell her I'm sick

547
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,930
and ask her to visit me.

548
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,030
No, no, no.

549
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,830
She won't believe that.

550
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,150
Will there be a dust storm tomorrow?

551
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,210
No.

552
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,370
It may rain tomorrow...

553
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,620
Even so, they can still go.

554
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,040
Sorry.

555
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,970
I'm late.

556
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,840
It's okay.

557
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,930
I just arrived too.

558
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,210
The movie hasn't even started yet.

559
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:53,870
That's good.

560
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,230
[Ticket Center]

561
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,300
-Here you go. -Thank you.

562
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,720
Shall we go in now?

563
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,170
Okay.

564
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,060
Hello.

565
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,700
I'd like a ticket for the next Green Book.

566
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,270
Hello.

567
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,250
I'd like a ticket too.

568
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,400
Why are you here?

569
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,100
Didn't you

570
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,040
come too?

571
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,430
I'd like a ticket for the next Green Book.

572
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,060
Hurry up, please.

573
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,420
Please give me my ticket first.

574
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,590
We have a special offer for this movie.

575
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,340
Twenty percent off for two friends, and fifty percent off for couples.

576
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,050
Those two people just bought couple tickets.

577
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,010
Couple?

578
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,710
Yeah.

579
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,140
They are definitely not a couple.

580
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,330
How could they be a couple?

581
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,470
They don't look close at all.

582
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,500
How can you let them in?

583
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,680
Aren't they a couple?

584
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,130
But they look so good together.

585
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:35,990
They look good together?

586
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,960
How come?

587
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,300
They don't look good together at all.

588
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,810
Would you like to buy the tickets at the original price?

589
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,450
We...

590
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,850
do have a great discount.

591
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,940
We are buying

592
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,600
friendship tickets.

593
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,790
Two of us.

594
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,120
But you don't look like friends.

595
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,250
What's wrong with us?

596
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,460
We...

597
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,500
don't look close?

598
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,900
This movie should be of your favorite theme.

599
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,980
You can look forward to it.

600
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,060
You've seen it?

601
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,780
Yes.

602
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,220
It's wonderful.

603
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:19,970
Emm...

604
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,550
So I want to take you to see it again.

605
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,980
I remember when you first joined the debate team,

606
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,910
you seemed to

607
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,640
hate me.

608
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,080
I didn't.

609
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,220
I couldn't refute your arguments at that time in the first debate.

610
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,060
I didn't hate you.

611
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,770
I was clearly

612
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,020
in awe of you.

613
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,630
Well...

614
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,140
I thought...

615
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,950
It's okay.

616
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,860
It's not too late.

617
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,550
Now you are also very approachable.

618
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,970
It's good to be friends with you.

619
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,840
Really?

620
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,240
What are they talking about?

621
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,980
I can't hear them.

622
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:04,730
What's going on?

623
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:05,750
Emm...

624
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,310
Nothing.

625
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,510
I just saw someone who looks like my friend.

626
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,140
But that shouldn't be him.

627
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,060
Oh.

628
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,120
The movie is about to start.

629
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,420
[But I ain't no butler.]

630
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,400
[I ain't ironing no shirts, and I'm not polishing nobody's shoes.]

631
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,840
[Why you on this road?]

632
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,780
[I told you, we had to make a detour and we got lost.]

633
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,750
How can they watch a couple's movie when they are not so close to each other?

634
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,900
I think that guy must have a crush on her.

635
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,580
It's time for her to go home.

636
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,740
Where are they going?

637
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Follow me.

638
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,130
You're Zhou Ziqian, right?

639
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,720
The shooter who participated in "Meet Now"?

640
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,100
Fu Qile, you're here too.

641
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,170
I... I love that show.

642
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,560
I've been watching you just now.

643
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,820
I didn't expect it would be you.

644
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,130
Keep your voice down please.

645
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,590
We have things to do, so we...

646
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,440
It's really you.

647
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,780
What a coincidence.

648
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,020
You...

649
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,600
Mr. Fu insisted on treating me to a movie.

650
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
I didn't expect to see you here.

651
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,580
What a coincidence.

652
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,210
These are the two friends

653
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,830
you were with yesterday, right?

654
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,310
Yep.

655
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,960
What a coincidence.

656
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,370
Let me send you home.

657
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,470
No need.

658
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,030
I can go back with my friends.

659
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,520
Okay.

660
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,910
How do you feel today?

661
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,690
How do I feel?

662
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,430
Yeah.

663
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,340
I feel pretty good.

664
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,410
The movie is wonderful too.

665
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,840
I should have

666
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,830
let you win that debate match in college.

667
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,660
Otherwise you wouldn't have been so in awe of me for so long.

668
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,880
Are you free this weekend?

669
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,950
How about I treat you to dinner?

670
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,320
I'll make up for the dinner

671
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,340
you didn't make it last time.

672
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,000
Next weekend?

673
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,530
What are they talking about?

674
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,790
Why don't you confess your love to her?

675
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,430
Are you asking me?

676
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,200
You don't dare to do so.

677
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,390
Am I right?

678
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,490
So are you.

679
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,690
So,

680
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,160
The one who suddenly appears...

681
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,910
he will not worry about anything

682
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,640
because he will not lose anything.

683
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,010
Let's go.

684
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,670
I'm hungry.

685
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,590
I'll buy you Oden.

686
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,520
Why are you so generous today?

687
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,190
What do you mean by that?

688
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,820
What are you standing around for?

689
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,080
Coming.

690
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,800
Why are you

691
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,540
still here?

692
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,440
It's so late.

693
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,700
Is something bothering you?

694
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,020
Here's the thing.

695
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,850
I have a friend

696
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,040
who has fallen in love with his best friend.

697
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,460
Do you think he should confess his feelings?

698
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,590
Oh.

699
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,790
The friend you're talking about

700
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,390
wouldn't be the one you said last time

701
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,900
that had a close encounter with his best friend, right?

702
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,270
It's like a drama.

703
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,700
He fell in love with her so quickly?

704
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,220
I don't know if he should confess.

705
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:53,790
I think

706
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,810
it depends.

707
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,610
What do you mean?

708
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,200
Yeah.

709
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,250
Make it clear.

710
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,410
Let me put it this way.

711
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,860
A good friend of mine

712
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,550
had a crush on a girl.

713
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,410
We were good friends from middle school to high school.

714
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,510
After going to college,

715
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,400
he suddenly confessed his love

716
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,230
to this girl.

717
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,360
Since then,

718
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,360
that girl has deliberately kept her distance

719
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,550
and drifted away from him.

720
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,440
It seems

721
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,250
they are now out of touch.

722
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,220
So,

723
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,230
I don't think the phrase

724
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,360
"if two people can't be lovers, they can be friends"

725
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,180
is credible.

726
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,520
Unless the girl

727
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,480
likes him too.

728
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,260
Otherwise,

729
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,160
he should wait a little longer.

730
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,440
It's good to be cautious.

731
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,200
After all, the longer they've known each other,

732
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,650
the greater risk of his failure there would be.

733
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,290
If they were meant to be,

734
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,310
they would have all been together.

735
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,250
Don't they always say that in TV shows?

736
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,350
Huckleberry friend

737
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,980
is not as important as a lover.

738
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,090
Can't you sleep either?

739
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,380
Hm.

740
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,040
I don't know why

741
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,160
I would hesitate to go out to dinner

742
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,260
with my senior.

743
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,160
You seem to be a bit strange.

744
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,310
I feel the same.

745
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,400
Do you think

746
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,080
I should ask the others?

747
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,720
[Do you think...]

748
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,790
♫I've thought about it many times♫

749
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,870

♫I have thrown away this charming and empty thing in vain♫

751
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,370

752
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,940
♫I pick up the pen and only remember your wish♫

753
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,810
Forget it.

754
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,510
Why should I ask him?

755
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,520
♫But my mother said boys can't be too sweet♫

756
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:06,000
♫I want to experience so many things with you♫

757
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,290
Why did I send it?

00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,320
Recall it!

759
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,670
[Yes, I'll go find you.]

760
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,950
♫I wish I could have all the good and bad sides of you♫

♫Learn to be soft-hearted even if you turn a blind eye♫

765
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,450
Good night.

00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,050
♫Clumsy with words but brave for you♫

767

♫Plain and daily but romantic for life♫

768
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,440
You took all the pictures of flowers and trees.

769
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,480
Oh...

770
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,150
And Ji Qiu.

771
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,570
Can't you take some pictures of Zhou Ziqian?

772
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,900
You are in danger now.

773
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,570
In danger?

774
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,930
You're going to lose her

775
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,960
if you don't confess your love to her.

776
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,300
Think about it.

777
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,280
Zhou Ziqian is excellent.

778
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,420
And he gets along with Ji Qiu day and night.

779
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,320
Maybe Ji Qiu will fall in love with him one day.

780
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,600
Alas.

781
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,170
Just think about it.

782
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,500
Grape Ji.

783
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,750
What is it that makes you so anxious?

784
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,790
Nothing.

785
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,780
I...

786
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,270
just want to ask you.

787
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,050
Emm...

788
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,220
What do you think of the movie you watched the other day?

789
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,800
I'd like to treat Zheng Hui and the others to watch it.

790
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,770
Is that why you asked me out?

791
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,540
Yeah.

792
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,470
I would like to know what you think.

793
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,610
It's clearer to say in person.

794
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,600
And...

795
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,470
By the way,

796
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,910
I have a gift for you.

798
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,620
Well...

799
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,710
You helped me before.

800
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,570
Aren't you preparing for the competition now?

801

Here's a wrister for you.

I wish you the best of luck.

803
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,860
You care so much about me?

804
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,970
Yes.

805
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,300

Jiang Yu asked me out this weekend.

820
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,050
He just came back to Jiangyi and doesn't know much about this city.

821
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,310
Could you recommend me a few attractions?

He's been acting strange these days.

875
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,690
All he did was eating and training.

876
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:27,900
♫Why are they avoiding me♫

877

He's even stranger today.

879

He didn't say a single word.
