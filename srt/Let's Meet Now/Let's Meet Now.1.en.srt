00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,270
Take these clothes over.

7
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,410
Get the racks set up.

8
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,800
Hurry up and get these chairs ready.

9
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,490
The guy who's moving the stool, hurry up.

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,630
Contestant number one, the Moment Group, please come here and get ready.

11
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,120
Sister.

12
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,450
Are all the judges here?

13
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,660
This is our first time participating in outdoor recording.

14
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,030
So we are a bit nervous.

15
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,050
Don't be.

16
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,520
Just act like you did during the rehearsal.

17
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,310
Relax.

18
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,410
Thank you.

19
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:33,840
Thank you.

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,660
Come on. This way.

21
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,380
Wait.

22
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,080
It's okay now.

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,700
Thank you.

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,300
Contestant number two, please get ready.

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,160
Miss Ji,

26
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,509
something went wrong.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,509
What's wrong?

28
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,860
Miss Ye is now wearing a blue-colored dress.

29
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,060
C just begged Miss Ye for a long time, but Miss Ye still didn't agree.

30
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,080
C was about to cry.

31
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,900
Now all our guests are wearing red.

32
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,520
Only Miss Ye is wearing blue.

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,550
I'm afraid other guests will be unhappy if they know about this.

34
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,160
If they are not satisfied...

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,510
They won't cooperate with the recording if they get angry about it.

36
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,130
I'm so...

37
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,150
I really don't know what to do now.

38
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,700
And she just didn't even listen to my explanation.

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,750
All right. Slow down.

40
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,660
Did you confirm the clothing issue in advance?

41
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,240
Yes. They did tell me before that

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,130
Miss Ye wanted to change her costume.

43
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,780
But I got too much messages those two days.

44
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,040
So I forgot.

45
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,530
Miss Ji...

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,410
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,590
Miss Ye,

48
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,300
I heard that our staff had a misunderstanding with you.

49
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,040
May I ask if your dress doesn't fit?

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,000
Or...

51
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,230
I just don't like it.

52
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,790
But...

53
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,140
But if you wear blue,

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,540
it will make it difficult for us to explain to other guests.

55
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,480
How about we...

56
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,010
If Miss Ye doesn't like it,

57
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,510
it must be because there is something wrong with the costume.

58
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,090
Just tell me the solution.

59
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,880
I don't want to hear anything else.

60
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,660
Actually,

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,300
it's not because of you

62
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,370
or your dress.

63
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,000
It's because of the backdrop this time.

64
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,370
Miss Ye,

65
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,280
we just went to the site to check.

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,350
The backdrop is blue.

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,550
If you wear blue,

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,570
then won't you become...

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,310
You better be telling the truth.

70
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,750
Miss Ye, don't worry.

71
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,930
The other dress is also custom-made for you.

72
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,560
It won't be ill-fitting.

73
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,010
In the future,

74
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,829
we will definitely prepare costumes for you according to your preference.

75
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,070
You can start preparing now.

76
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,010
It would be bette if Ye Qiao reprimanded us directly.

77
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,300
She's so mean.

78
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,510
It's so hard for us.

79
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,079
No wonder netizens say she won't be popular for long.

80
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,900
She has such a bad temper that she will flop sooner or later.

81
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,810
Stop talking about things that have nothing to do with work.

82
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,810
Ready to record.

83
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,260
Countdown. Three, two, one.

84
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,410
Your work is so hard.

85
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,530
There have been rumors that Ye Qiao has a bad temper.

86
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,050
If I had to spend every day with her like you do,

87
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,320
I'd probably have gone crazy.

88
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,470
I just hope that

89
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,519
after the show is over, she and I will never have to see each other again.

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,690
You're right.

91
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,120
Why isn't Fu here yet?

92
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,720
He must be busy with work.

93
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,230
Why is he so ambitious?

94
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,800
No wonder he can't find a girlfriend.

95
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,230
It's been so many years.

96
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,200
Haven't you gotten used to it yet?

97
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,150
Is there something wrong with my electronic target?

98
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,570
How come I didn't get scores?

99
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,490
I'll go and ask.

100
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,370
I'll go.

101
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,409
I'm going out for a walk.

102
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,050
And I'll bring you something to drink.

103
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,640
You just hit my target.

104
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,740
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,690
I made

106
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,680
a mistake.

107
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,070
It's okay.

108
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,200
I thought it was me who got the 8.9.

109
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,980
This really surprised me.

110
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,530
But I found that

111
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
I hadn't pulled the trigger yet.

112
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,510
I didn't expect

113
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,470
to get such a high score even if I hit the wrong target.

114
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,350
Are you a rookie?

115
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,680
How long have you been here?

116
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,800
This is a shooting gallery run by my friend.

117
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,010
But today is my first time here.

118
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,720
It can be a little hard for you if you don't have anyone to teach you the first time.

119
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,270
It stands to reason that

120
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,530
there should be staff to teach rookies.

121
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,080
They may be busy.

122
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,920
It's okay.

123
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,490
I can

124
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,470
practice on my own.

125
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,920
Or I will teach you?

126
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,030
Although I am not very skilled,

127
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,500
I can do basic operations.

128
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:46,760
OK.

129
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,340
Separate your feet back and forth.

130
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,150
Keep your center of gravity in the middle.

131
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,520
And keep your shoulders flat.

132
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,650
Now, try it.

133
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,810
Wow.

134
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,830

♫Oh. Kiss me. Kiss me♫

Plum wine.

504
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,500
Thank you.

505
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,660
How old

506
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,110
do you think I am?

507
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,390
Twenty-six years old.

508
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,410
Are you a fortune teller?

509
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,400
I'm right?

510
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,670
Yeah.

511
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,880
But this is most likely just a coincidence.

512
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:56,930
Well.

513
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,900
Let me ask you a few other questions.

514
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,290
Okay.

515
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,210
What is my most hated food?

516
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,700
Raw garlic.

517
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,340
I just saw that you didn't eat.

518
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,390
Then this is because you are meticulous.

519
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,150
Let me ask you something else.

520
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,720
What is my constellation?

521
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,950
You only have one chance.

522
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,210
Scorpio?

523
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,360
There's only a 1 in 12 chance.

524
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,110
How can you answer it right?

525
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,960
If I'm not mistaken,

526
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,750
your name represents the last month of autumn.

527
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,080
It means the ninth month of the lunar calendar, right?

528
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,220
So...

529
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,160
What?

530
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,470
My name...

531
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,610
It doesn't sound like you're great at all.

532
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,900
I have to think of a more difficult question.

533
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,840
What's my latest favorite band?

534
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,130
L.N Party.

535
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,000
Brother.

536
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,720
What exactly do you do?

537
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,160
You didn't investigate me secretly, right?

538
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Are you a private investigator?

539
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,960
Spy?

540
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,870
Just...

541
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:18,940
Those are my guesses.

542
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,830
I like this band too.

543
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,050
[Fu Qile]

544
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,900
Have you gone home yet?

545
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,210
Your position is not far from me.

546
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,560
I just finished my potluck dinner. When are you going back?

547
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,410
I can give you a ride.

548
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,240
Do you have something?

549
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:35,900
Yes.

550
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,420
My friend asked if we had finished the meal.

551
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,860
You've met him.

552
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,150
But we haven't finished these two bottles.

553
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,550
Okay then.

554
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,360
Let's finish these two bottles first.

555
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,890
You haven't answered me yet.

556
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,830
What exactly do you do?

557
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,100
Take a guess.

558
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,280
You

559
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,150
packaged these sushi for me, right?

560
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,730
I love this...

561
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,240
This is for you.

562
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,670
Can...

563
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
you go back yourself?

564
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:11,950
Yes.

565
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,500
Sir, I live in uptown.

566
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,570
I'm just a poor migrant worker without a car.

567
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,160
Could you reimburse me

568
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,280
if I take a taxi home?

569
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,020
All right. I'll take you home.

570
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,620
Actually, my shooting skill is not much better than yours.

571
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,760
I think you should

572
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,590
find a more professional coach.

573
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,970
But I think you are a good teacher.

574
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,890
Go back yourself.

575
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,870
What?

576
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,230
I'll reimburse you.

577
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,500
I don't know if you're free this weekend, I'd like to...

578
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,060
No.

579
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,880
You already finished?

580
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,440
We are not available.

581
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,900
We made an appointment to go to the shooting competition that day.

582
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,100
Right.

583
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,780
It happened to be that day.

584
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,460
Okay.

585
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,870
I see.

586
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,820
The competition is quite professional.

587
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,710
It's helpful

588
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,130
for those of us who are amateurs to watch it.

589
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,020
What a pity.

590
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,990
If there are extra tickets,

591
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,330
I'd like to take you there.

592
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,900
There is indeed a lot of room for improvement.

593
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,290
But I don't need a ticket.

594
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,590
I will also

595
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,560
be there.

596
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,720
Did you buy a ticket?

597
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,460
Such a coincidence.

598
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,560
Which row is your seat in?

599
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,490
It's a bit far from the ront row.

600
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,450
I see.

601
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,310
Seats don't really matter.

602
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,400
The important thing is that

603
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
it's good to be able to learn standard movements on the spot.

604
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,280
It's just a pity that we can't sit together.

605
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,780
Our seats are in the front row of Zone A.

606
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,690
Otherwise,

607
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,170
I can teach you some rules.

608
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,550
There will be a chance.

609
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,890
All right.

610
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,220
It's getting late. You should go home.

611
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,320
Is your home far from here?

612
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,990
No.

613
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,690
I'm leaving now.

614
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,480
Bye.

615
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,030
What going on?

616
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,250
Wasn't it because one of my friends is too stupid?

617
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,460
She trusts people too easily.

618
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,690
And she drank with others

619
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,750
before she knew them for long.

620
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,180
I don't know if she's stupid or naive.

621
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,320
You're talking about me?

622
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,540
He's much younger than me.

623
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,780
So he's just a younger brother.

624
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,950
What bad thoughts could he have?

625
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,870
Besides,

626
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,950
even if I was deceived by him,

627
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,330
I won't lose anything.

628
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,100
That's hard to say.

629
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,180
But you have to trust the intuition of a psychology lecturer.

630
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,690
Can you tell me

631
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,090
where the watch I lost last week is

632
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,690
based on your psychology lecturer's intuition?

633
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,920
I can't.

634
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,300
Get in.

No, I have to go to class.

638

Why are you still like this?

639

671
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,980
You're not the only one.

672
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,610
He is handsome, well-educated

673
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,950
and polite.

674
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,310
Most importantly,

675
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,940
he is very good at taking care of people.

676
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,780
Yes.

677
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,880
Chen.

678
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,360
You have to ask him to find out if he is free.

679
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,820
You have such a great opportunity,

680
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,230
take advantage of it yourself.

681
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,260
God.

682
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,740
These young female teachers

683
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,460
always like to talk about people behind their backs.

684
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,790
Look.

685
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,840
He is watching the instructional video again.

686
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,830
He has only one flaw.

687
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,260
Once he gets serious about his work

688
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,390
he won't care about anything.

689
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,140
The previous players were so weak.

690
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,330
I wonder how the afternoon game will go.

691
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,320
Fu,

692
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,390
are you free this afternoon?

693
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,200
Yes.

694
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,560
Chen is going to send some documents to building three.

695
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,820
She is new and unfamiliar with here.

696
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,030
Could you take her there?

697
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,540
I am familiar with building three.

698
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,410
Just sit down.

699
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,390
Okay.

700
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:17,940
Yeah.

701
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,180
These documents are too heavy for her.

702
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,560
She can't carry these. Just do her a favor.

703
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,450
Okay.

704
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,450
I have something to do later.

705
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,300
I'm free now.

706
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,080
Let's go.

707
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,660
Okay.

708
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,570
Take your time.

709
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,400
This guy...

710
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,170
Why are you so annoying?

711
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,400
What?

712
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,500
You want to find a girlfriend too?

713
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,430
It's okay.

714
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,160
When they get together,

715
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,170
I'll help you find one.

716
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,210
When they get together?

717
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,690
You really don't want to help me find a girlfriend.

718
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,220
This is difficult.

719
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,950
Really?

720
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,840
Mr. Fu, thank you

721
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,940
for leading the way for me.

722
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,050
It's okay.

723
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,980
I'm not doing it on purpose.

724
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,900
I'm going to pass through here anyway.

725
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,920
I heard from Ms. Li that

726
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,320
you not only work as a teacher in Jiangyi

727
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,490
but also run a counseling office outside the school.

728
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,870
At your age,

729
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,260
you are so focused on your career.

730
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,570
Haven't you ever thought about relationships?

731
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,570
I have.

732
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,490
Don't we who work in psychology

733
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,910
often do emotional communication?

734
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,660
I didn't expect you to be so fond of joking.

735
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,780
You like jokes.

736
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,210
Then you must be a Sagittarius, right?

737
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,170
I'm Aries.

738
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,610
It is said that

739
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,070
Sagittarius and Aries are actually...

740
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,510
There is actually no scientific basis for constellations.

741
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,670
I don't believe it.

742
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,630
I see.

743
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,730
The weather has changed quite a bit.

744
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,780
It got cold all of a sudden.

745
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,160
You should have worn more today.

746
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,760
Then how about...

747
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,100
we walk faster?

748
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,680
You won't be cold that way.

749
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,180
Mr. Fu...

750
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,470
Hello?

751
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,730
Someone wants a temporary consultation?

752
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,110
Is she in a hurry?

753
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,430
No.

754
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,630
She said she would be here in half an hour.

755
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,890
Now?

756
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,240
So urgent?

757
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,100
No.

758
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,650
There is no need to be in such a hurry.

759
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,560
Okay, I got it.

760
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,980
I'll be right there.

761
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,400
There is something urgent in my consultation room.

762
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,390
Let's hurry up.

763
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,560
Mr. Fu.

764
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,500
Are you avoiding me on purpose?

765
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,740
I said so much just now.

766
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,850
Don't you know what I mean at all?

767
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,340
Actually, I know.

768
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,100
Love

769
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,740
is about being natural.

770
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,130
What do you mean?

771
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,280
I am a psychology lecturer.

772
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,150
There are some things I see more clearly than others.

773
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,790
Like just now,

774
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,510
I could certainly lend you my clothes.

775
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,700
I feel like I'm taking care of my colleagues if I do that.

776
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,380
But you wouldn't think that way.

777
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,670
You will meet someone more suitable for you later.

778
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,720
And,

779
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,900
your future boyfriend will be jealous.

780
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,940
Class will be over soon.

781
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,040
Let's go.

782
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,570
Do you have a girlfriend now?

783
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,880
No.

784
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,210
But I am also afraid that my future girlfriend will be jealous.

785
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,850
So I was just rejected.

786
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,530
What kind of girl

787
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,260
would he like?

788
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,600
I'm leaving now.

789
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,310
Miss Ji,

790
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,020
you're not going to eat with us?

791
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,580
I'm going to the shooting competition with my friends.

792
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,400
Maybe next time.

793
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,510
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

794
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,690
Bye.

795
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,270
She knows about shooting?

796
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,620
Now the real-time broadcast for you

797
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,620
is the men's ten-meter air pistol final of the five-province league.

798
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,840
Players prepare to enter.

799
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,100
The player standing at the No. 1 target

800
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,760
is Zhou Ziqian, who just won the first place

801
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,440
with a score of 590 in the qualifying round.

802
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
This player should be considered the most powerful dark horse today.

803
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,240
It is reported that Zhou Ziqian has been training in France before.

804
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,430
This is his first competition since his return to China.

805
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:26,780
[Zhou Ziqian]

806
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,860
What's going on?

807
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,690
Don't tell me you're going to

808
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,080
let me go alone again.

809
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,510
No.

810
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,410
Didn't Fu send a message just now that he couldn't go?

811
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,980
Do you remember the boy we met last time at the shooting gallery?

812
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,940
He's going to see this competition  too.

813
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,510
But his seat is more backward.

814
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,740
I was just thinking that

815
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,610
Fu is not going anyway, so there is an extra ticket.

816
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,430
I just tried to ask the boy if he was going.

817
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,470
But I haven't reached him until now.

818
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,120
It's okay, the ticket is free anyway.

819
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,510
It doesn't matter if he can't come.

820
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,570
So, can we see your friend from the shooting team today?

821
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,260
Yes.

822
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,470
But he doesn't seem to be very good.

823
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,060
There is a bit of a traffic jam here.

824
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,760
You shouldn't be able to make it to the qualifying matches.

825
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,190
But you can still catch up with the final.

826
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,050
It's okay, sir. Take your time.

827
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,460
You know the competition too?

828
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,420
My son likes to watch shooting matches. I often watch it with him.

829
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,100
By the way,

830
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,060
I heard him say that there is a great player in this competition

831
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,810
who is a local boy from Jiangyi.

832
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,010
Awesome. What's his name?

833
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,980
It's...

834
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,130
What's his name...

835
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,680
Here we are.

836
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,340
Thank you, sir. Bye.

837
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,770
OK. Be careful.

838
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,110
[Zhou Ziqian]

839
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,080
Ten points three.

840
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,500
Zhou Ziqian from Jiangyi City

841
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,070
still played a steady game in this shot.

842
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,280
He currently has the same total score as Zhu Yao,

843
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,290
the winner of last year's five-province league.

844
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,860
They are currently tied for first place.

845
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,810
A sixth place will be awarded after the next round.

846
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,660
At present, the sixth player is Li Yang, who is at the No. 3 target position.

847
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,380
Excuse me.

848
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,080
Excuse me.

849
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,219
Thank you.

850
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,900
Excuse me.

851
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,530
How is the view here?

852
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,429
It's nice.

853
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,550
[We might be late, you can watch the game first]

854
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,010
You didn't even look.

855
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,360
Congrats to Gao Yuan, who is at the No. 6 target position,

856
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,440
for winning the fifth place.

857
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,780
It's a pity that Gao Yuan didn't play well

858
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,280
in these two shots.

859
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,010
He finished fifth.

860
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,670
My friend was eliminated.

861
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:42,960
Yuan.

862
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,130
Yuan.

863
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,860
Did you hit the two shots just now

864
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,020
with your feet?

865
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,719
Enough.

866
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,280
She said she would definitely come.

867
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,719
Why hasn't she shown up yet?

868
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,610
Who are you looking for, Yuan?

869
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,750
Well.

870
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,220
A friend of mine.

871
00:34:59,470 --> 00:34:59,960
Thanks.

872
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:07,980
What surprised us was that

873
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,190
Zhou Ziqian didn't play very well in this shot.

874
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,770
He needs to be more focused.

875
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,510
Qiu.

876
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,140
Yeah?

877
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,670
Look at the guy

878
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,630
at the No. 1 target.

879
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,180
Does he look particularly familiar?

880
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,270
It's a pity that he made a big mistake just now.

881
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,020
But as a first-time competitor in a major tournament,

882
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,560
Zhou Zikian's mental quality

883
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,940
is quite good.

884
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,550
I wonder if he can bring us any surprises

885
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,200
in the last few shots?

886
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,070
♫I want to spend every summer with you♫

887
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,550
♫I want to kiss your face under the sunset♫

888
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,150
♫I like to see you in a daze♫

889
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,870
♫It's the most special dependence♫

890
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,510
♫My promise to you will never be changed♫

891
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,380
♫I want to take a walk with you when flowers bloom♫

892
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,740
Ji Qiu,

893
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,420
what exactly is your relationship

894
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,950
with Ziqian?

895
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,620
We're friends.

896
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,810
Although we just met,

897
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,250
Ji Qiu and I

898
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,170
get along very well.

899
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,310
We both feel very close to each other.

900
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,840
You're exaggerating.

901
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:50,960
I'm leaving.

902
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,600
Ji Qiu,

903
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,660
you're not here for me?

904
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,870
I'm here for work.

905
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,070
Ji Qiu,

906
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,540
have we

907
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,950
met somewhere before?
