00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,789
What is this?

6
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,750
What's going on?

7
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,070
You stole a kid?

8
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,090
No.

9
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,300
Why did you sleep together?

10
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:34,720
My dad said

11
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,160
sleeping together without being married was a rogue.

12
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,080
Which one of you is a hooligan?

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,979
Your dad is a good teacher.

14
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,600
Little girl,

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,100
is your father Hu Yang?

16
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,160
Don't call me little girl.

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,370
My name is Coco.

18
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,850
Okay, little girl.

19
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,780
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,200
Call me Coco.

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,470
My mom has gone out.

22
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,620
My dad said you had to get up.

23
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,700
Hey, little girl.

24
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,010
I'm gonna eat you when I get up.

25
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,230
I'm going to wash up.

26
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,610
I don't like that weird uncle.

27
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,690
Why?

28
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,810
Because he's so childish.

29
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,730
Thank you.

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,350
So you're leaving in a minute?

31
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,560
Why don't you stay for two more days?

32
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,240
I can't help it. We only have two days off.

33
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,780
We're going to walk around Qiuye Town.

34
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,310
Then we'll go back.

35
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,780
Well,

36
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,250
I'll give you a ride later.

37
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,230
Isn't your car broken?

38
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,840
It's fixed.

39
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,160
But we plan to take the bus.

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,880
It's more convenient.

41
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,760
Okay.

42
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,280
These are Coco's drawings.

43
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,640
It's like a real dog.

44
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,320
It's a panda, not a dog.

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,460
Panda?

46
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,500
It does look like a panda now.

47
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,590
Come on.

48
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,610
When she's free,

49
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,810
she likes to draw these things.

50
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,970
See? These are her drawings.

51
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,800
This is

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,060
the first picture Coco drew.

53
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,170
It's a picture of the three of us.

54
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,890
A family photo.

55
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,090
And these.

56
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,680
These are recordings from

57
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,940
when she first learned to speak.

58
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,450
This.

59
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,940
This was made by her mother

60
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,870
when Coco was five years old.

61
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,890
I don't know how it got broken.

62
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,600
I didn't want to throw it away, so I kept it here.

63
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,450
You have so many photos.

64
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,300
As you know,

65
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,120
I used to like taking pictures.

66
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,220
Speaking of photos, I remember.

67
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,130
I think I have photos of yours.

68
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,480
Us?

69
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,780
Let me find them.

70
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,420
Not many.

71
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,390
But they are in good condition.

72
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,160
Zhou Ziqian.

73
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,760
Why are you always crying?

74
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,740
I want to ask you too.

75
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,800
Why do you laugh when I cry?

76
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,160
This picture is nice.

77
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,230
Why haven't I seen this picture before?

78
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,670
There are many things you don't remember.

79
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,980
How about I take another photo of you today?

80
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,700
Don't you have to leave?

81
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,870
Take it as a souvenir.

82
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,070
Do the same thing you did in the picture.

83
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,310
Let's do it again.

84
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,870
Okay?

85
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,780
Okay.

86
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,120
Here.

87
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,840
Here. Look here.

88
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,300
One, two, three.

89
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,020
Coco, let me see what you're drawing.

90
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,220
Coco.

91
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,040
Why am I so thin today?

92
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,450
I'm not cute anymore.

93
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,750
This is not you.

94
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,510
This is weird uncle and pretty aunt.

95
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,690
Dad, I kind of like that weird uncle now.

96
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,620
Why?

97
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,090
Because I feel like he's dumber than I am.

98
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,060
So

99
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,420
you didn't like him before?

100
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,159
No,

101
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,290
because he didn't like me, either.

102
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,040
How is that possible?

103
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,680
Our Coco is so cute.

104
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,030
How could anyone not like you?

105
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,740
Dad, it's true.

106
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,909
He likes that pretty aunt.

107
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,290
How did you know?

108
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,580
Because when he took photos,

109
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,190
he kept staring at her and smiling.

110
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,200
What do you think? Am I handsome?

111
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,070
Don't make my pretty face dirty.

112
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,180
♫Her smile♫

113
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,350
I'm speechless.

♫The second under the sun♫

115

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,250
♫I thought she didn't know♫

118
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,360
♫She's happy and young♫

119
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,670
♫Like a breeze like a warm sun♫

120
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,040
♫My face blushes in June for the first time♫

121
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,250
Psychologically,

122
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,270
attention depends on attraction.

123
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,620
Only when you do something you like,

124
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,570
you're willing to give time and energy.

125
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,670
This is true of almost everyone.

126
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,760
So,

127
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,010
when students are interested in something,

128
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,550
their attention is suddenly focused.

129
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,400
At this time,

130
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,030
if we continue to inculcate them with professional knowledge,

131
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,240
the effect will be more obvious.

132
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,920
That's all I'm going to say this time.

133
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,420
You know what?

134
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,540
Based on what Fu just said,

135
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,400
I'll add two more points.

136
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,580
Let's take a break.

137
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,830
Later we'll discuss

138
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,380
our general teaching plan

139
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,680
after Fu's participation in the show.

140
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,320
Okay, I'm gonna go get some coffee.

141
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,650
You want some?

142
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,550
Give me a cup of coffee.

143
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,460
You look like coffee.

144
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,540
Get me some more.

145
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,610
You're so annoying.

146
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,740
[Are you back today?]

147
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,620
She hasn't come back yet.

148
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
Is she busy now?

149
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,590
By the way, Zhou Ziqian.

150
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,970
Fu Qile?

151
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,070
Why did he call me?

152
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,380
My hand slipped.

153
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,020
I didn't do it on purpose.

154
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,410
Are we almost there?

155
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,170
Ah, it's the next stop.

156
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,520
But I remember it was called Qiuye Courtyard.

157
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,380
Because it was renovated later.

158
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,510
The area of the yard was half smaller.

159
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,820
So its name was changed.

160
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,590
How did you know so well?

161
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,750
I guessed.

162
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,990
Speaking of which,

163
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,980
why did you suddenly want to come back?

164

♫Life comes up, life comes down♫

165

166
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,630
I'm afraid I'll forget.

But I don't want to forget.

172
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,310
♫But I will be here with you always♫

173
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,340
And there are so many things I want to experience again.

174
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,890
♫I used to be the one who calls my folks around♫

175
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,120
For example,

176
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,240
I want to take the bus I used to take every day when I was young.

177
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,860
♫I used to be a boy who loved to sing a song♫

178
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,210
I want to see the populus euphratica that I'm thankful for all summer.

179
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,450
♫I used to be the one that dreamed big♫

180
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,210
♫But now I became the man that wanna be free♫

181
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,420
That's Sycamore.

182
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,500
Most importantly,

183
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,430
♫I wanted to escape the stress and attention♫

184
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,920
I want to see this familiar place

185
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,180
with the same person who has not changed since we were young.

186
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,240
♫I want to get out of this game that everyone's in♫

187
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,890
♫And you will always be my wealth♫

188
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,630
♫Although some are still there, some have gone♫

189
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,610
♫Some have been left♫

190
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,260
Are you gonna thank me for calling you out?

191
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,070
♫Will you stay with me forever?♫

192
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,480
♫Will you stay with me forever?♫

193
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,090
Since you're having so much fun,

194
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,630
do you want me to grant you a request?

195
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,600
Never mind.

196
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,470
What happened to your foot?

197
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,910
I think it's scratched.

198
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,680
It should be fine if I walk slowly.

199
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,070
You can leave if you're in a hurry.

200
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,330
But it's dark now.

201
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,280
Don't be afraid

202
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,320
if you walk in front of me.

203
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,510
You're right.

204
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,680
I'm in a hurry,

205
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,660
but I'm afraid to be alone.

206
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,720
What can I do?

207
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,800
What am I gonna do?

208
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,240
Come on up.

209
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,420
What?

210
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,460
If you don't,

211
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,560
we won't be able to catch the last bus.

212
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,550
Well, thank you.

213
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,500
I've lost weight recently,

214
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,960
so it should be easy for you to carry me.

215
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,380
Am I heavy?

216
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,870
So so.

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:58,460
♫I've finally got ready to see you♫

00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,240
do you remember

220
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,690
you carried me on your back like this when we were young?

221
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,910
♫My heart is pounding with all kinds of feelings♫

222

Really?

223
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,090
Not long after I moved here,

224
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,950
I was bullied by kids in the neighboring street.

225
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:13,380
♫How should I hold the flowers so I don't look nervous♫

226
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,120
My knees got hurt.

227
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,500
I was just crying.

228
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,350
You carried me down

229
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,320
a block and two alleys.

230
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:19,210
♫The city is so big♫

231
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,260
You put me down and picked me up three times.

232
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,350
I remember it very clearly.

233
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,520
Why can't I remember?

234

🎵I'll see you soon🎵

235
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,720
There are many things you don't remember.

236
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,690
But I remember them.

237
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,620
♫I must act more natural than you♫

238

At that time,

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,810
no matter who was bullied,

240
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,680
you would be the first to step forward.

241
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,760
If I got in a fight and get punished by my parents,

♫The eyes that can push my tears away♫

243
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,240
you would be the first to step up.

244
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,580
So you looked up to me when you were a kid?

245
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,640
Do you want to hear the truth?

246
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,310
Never mind.

247
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,290

Yes, but maybe a little late.

274
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,020
I'll wait for you.

275
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,300
It's okay. I'm watching TV.

I haven't finished the drama you recommended to me.

It's just now the hero finds himself in love with the heroine.

He is about to confess his love.

Suddenly...

280
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,690
The power went out.

281
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,950
Blackout?

282
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,020
Was that on TV?

283
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,470
I think our power went out.

284
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,580
How come I've been walking for so long and it's still dark?

285
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,990
If the wiring went down, the whole area would be affected.

286
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,570
Did you find a place with a light?

287
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,600
Soon enough.

Otherwise, I'd be freaking out right now.

[Friend Bookshop]

292

Are you here to see me?

299
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,730
Because I have nowhere to go for the time being.

300
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,440
Why?

301
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,870
Power's out all over our neighborhood.

302
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,930
I couldn't stay at home alone,

so I ended up here.

304
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,200
Did you ask the property what's going on?

305
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,420
There seems to be a wiring fault.

306
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,420
It's gonna take a while to fix the wiring.

I get off work in 20 minutes.

308

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,560
You can go if you need to.

313
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,140
Anyway, that's all that's left.

314
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,630
I can handle this on my own.

How is it going?

325
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,990
There's nothing wrong with the circuits at home.

326
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,230
I guess we'll have to wait

327
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,600
until all the collective lines

328

If you're afraid of the dark,

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,300
I'll stay with you.

332
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,360
Okay.

333
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,920
Let's find a place with a better view.

334
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,470
We should be better adapted to the dark.

335
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,860
-A place with a better view? -Yes.

336
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,660
I know a place.

337
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,330
When there's electricity,

338
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,410
it's covered in little lights

339
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,350
and was all lit up.

340
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,370
It looked so better.

341
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,350
It looks good that way.

342
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,550
But it's dark

343
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,790
and I can't see anything.

344
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,470
♫I haven't written to others since October♫

345
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,920
If you can't see it now,

346
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,300
let's look a little further.

347
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,460
♫I'm just a little composer♫

348
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,660
I never noticed

349
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,100
how beautiful a city could be without lights.

350
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,230
♫Never mind these bad things and put them in the corner♫

351
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,490
You can see things that I can't.

352
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,530
You even know how to repair circuits.

353
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,380
And you know how to fix circuits.

354
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,380
♫Just think about what it's worth♫

355
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,820
I didn't fix it either.

356
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,240
It's just that I haven't completely forgotten the physics

357
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
I learned before.

358
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,570
♫Focus on the things that will make you feel better♫

359
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,640
Then you must have been pretty good at physics back in school.

360
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,090
Not like me, because of the slow reaction,

361
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,460
I know nothing about

362
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,470
♫It will make you happier♫

363
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,280
the magnetic field and circuit.

364
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,220
Slow?

365
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:12,440
♫I've been thinking about you lately♫

366
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,860
When my mom was pregnant with me,

367
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,450
I was born half a month past my due date.

368
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,560
♫You know I'm happy to hear you talk and you are happy to share♫

369
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,250
From then on,

370
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,390
everything I did

371
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,790
was half a beat behind everyone else.

372
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,940
♫The way you look at me I can't help getting close to you♫

373
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,000
I dance half a beat slower than others

374
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,730
and I sing half a beat slower than others.

375
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,740
But, don't get me wrong.

376
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:28,320
♫No one loves you as much as I do♫

377
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,220
I'm not stupid.

378
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,700
I'm just slow.

379
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,730
Do you believe in parallel worlds?

380
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,040
Look.

381
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,840
In this world,

382
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,720
there are so many people.

383
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,630
A lot of slow half children

384
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,210
and a lot of fast half children

385
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,480
will be born.

386
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,780
Then you are a lucky dog.

387
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,500
Because you don't have to be stuck in a rhythm

388
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,700
with so many people.

389
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,510
♫How many days I haven't kept in touch with you?♫

390
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,880
Really?

391
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:54,970
Yes.

392
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,700
♫Do you remember the conversations still?♫

393
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,350
There's power.

394
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,280
So soon?

395
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,050
♫Recall the scene when we first met♫

396
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,020
So soon?

397
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:08,910
I mean, it's all of a sudden.

398
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,880
♫Is there anything different to you♫

399
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,569
It's getting late.

400
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,630
I should get back.

401
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,599
Thank you for today.

402
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,520
♫The air is turning cold♫

403
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,970
You're welcome.

404
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,819
♫All the flowers are out of sold♫

405
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,599
I'm leaving.

406
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,680
Let me see you off.

407
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,720
♫The leaves are falling and the cold wind is roaring♫

408
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,940
♫Do you know how much I miss you♫

409
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:29,030
♫Your eyes are full of stars and the night is so bright♫

410
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:34,140
♫The breeze blows gently and the trees fall asleep♫

411
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,850
♫January is coming♫

412
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,900
The program will start recording on the 23rd.

413
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,880
And I should have sent you all the arrangements.

414
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,720
Remember to prepare.

415
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,530
I'm leaving.

416
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,230
What are you doing tomorrow?

417
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,360
I'll be back at the office tomorrow for a meeting.

418
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,610
What about the day after tomorrow?

419
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,710
The day after tomorrow we'll be ready to record.

420
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,360
Then tomorrow night?

421
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,130
Get some rest.

422
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,660
I'm back.

423
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,570
The circuits were fixed?

424
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,630
I was worried you wouldn't know what to do on your own.

425
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,940
Song Rongrong.

426
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,640
Qiu, you're back.

427
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,610
I was just talking to you.

428
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,350
I don't know who you're talking to.

429
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,030
You're laughing so hard.

430
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,240
Of course you can't hear me.

431
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,880
What are you talking about?

432
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,560
By the way, Qiu,

433
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,680
did anything interesting happen when you got back?

434
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,520
Of course.

435
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,280
I met a lot of funny things.

436
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,850
Although Zhou Ziqian is young,

437
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,450
he is very reliable.

438
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,250
He never lost his way on such a difficult road.

439
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,810
And he's incredibly physically fit.

440
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,180
I couldn't walk anymore.

441
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,360
He carried a lot of the luggage.

442
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,260
Xu Wang is pretty good, too.

443
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,730
Why did you bring Xu Wang up all of a sudden?

444
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,600
Qiu, you don't know.

445
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,080
We lost power today.

446
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,620
Xu Wang helped me check the circuit.

447
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,210
He's so good. He knows everything.

448
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,810
Besides, Xu Wang is not afraid of the dark.

449
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,540
We also went to the rooftop.

450
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,360
I found the rooftop with no lights on was also very beautiful.

451
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,930
And... he also said

452
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,920
I was lucky enough to be in the slow world.

453
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,610
That's the first time I've ever heard

454
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,240
that explanation for slow reflexes.

455
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,670
So happy?

456
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,380
Since he has helped you so much,

457
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,570
you should thank him.

458
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,350
Yes. I already gave him a gift.

459
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,830
Then we'll do what we just said.

460
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,180
Zhou Ziqian is not playing in the fall league

461
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,150
because of the variety show.

462
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,910
By the way,

463
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,790
let him promote the sport of shooting,

464
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,200
so that the public could know about the sport.

465
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,230
I haven't put in

466
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,080
the exact list yet.

467
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,790
Let's postpone it by one.

468
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,730
Plus the fourth place from our last team test.

469
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,550
They are

470
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,490
Gao Yuan.

471
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,570
Thank you

472
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,790
for letting me experience

473
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,080
what it's like to be put in the first one.

474
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,400
Yu Nan and Xu Wang.

475
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,100
The amount of training for the participants during this period should be readjusted.

476
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,920
The rest can be altered in moderation.

477
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,560
Do you understand?

478
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,490
Yes.

479
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,790
Then you can train separately.

480
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,380
You're so lucky.

481
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,370
You can have a place in the competition.

482
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,600
I wonder if someone

483
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,320
will give you the title at Nationals.

484
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,470
You don't have to talk to him. Let's go.

485
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,600
What are you thinking?

486
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,190
Don't worry.

487
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,110
It's just that I couldn't play.

488
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,570
Don't mind what other people say.

489
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,930
Right, Xu Wang.

490
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,980
This time we can finally race together.

491
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,750
Let me tell you something first.

492
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,220
You can't be angry if you lose.

493
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,570
Gao Yuan, how did you say that?

494
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,180
But it's a pity

495
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,480
we didn't have a match on the field.

496
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,590
I won't miss the next one.

497
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,840
Okay. See you at the next race.

498
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,250
By the way,

499
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,360
I see you've been adjusting the counterweight of the gun today.

500
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,320
Is there something wrong with it?

501
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,540
There's a little problem. It's a little too heavy for me.

502
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,080
I've got plenty at home. I'll get you one at night.

503
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,940
But where did I put it?

504
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,050
Let me ask him.

505
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,470
What's wrong?

506
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,050
Hey, do you remember

507
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,740
where I put the counterweight of the gun?

508
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,720
In the third cupboard next to the end table.

509
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,250
Oh.

510
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,400
On the left or right?

511
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,280
Right.

512
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,020
Oh.

513
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,430
I come home early today.

514
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,280
What are we going to eat?

515
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,970
I'll be late.

516
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,420
There's something ready in the fridge.

517
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,000
You can warm it up yourself.

518
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,230
I'll hang up.

519
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,970
This is your elder brother?

520
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,080
My younger brother.

521
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,890
Doesn't he look like me?

522
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,050
I think so too.

523
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,590
His voice is too mature.

524
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,830
You don't seem like a regular brother.

525
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,810
What do you mean?

526
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,750
Don't ask me.

527
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,040
It is essential that

528
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,360
regular older brothers care about their younger siblings' daily lives.

529
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,510
If they're hungry, you should bring them food.

530
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,410
If they're thirsty, you should bring them drinks.

531
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,530
You should remind them to get dressed when it's cold.

532
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,610
You should turn on the air conditioner when it's hot.

533
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,630
You should wake them up and get them to and from school on time.

534
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,690
You also need to keep an eye on your younger sibling's

535
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,270
mental health.

536
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,620
You don't have any brothers or sisters, right?

537
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:04,900
No.

538
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,950
No wonder you said that.

539
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,380
It's a bit exaggerated, but it's close.

540
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,030
Let's try this another way. I want to ask you.

541
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,660
Do you know which class your brother is in?

542
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,510
Class,

543
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,320
we have the last ten minutes.

544
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,580
Let's talk about the last composition.

545
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,700
The last composition was about family members.

546
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,330
Here,

547
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,910
I've picked out two very good essays.

548
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,660
One is written by Fu Tian.

549
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,740
The second is written by Zhou Yubei.

550
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,460
Both of these essays are about older brothers.

551
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,380
But the emphasis is totally different.

552
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,240
Let me read Fu Tian's composition first.

553
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,730
Fu Tian

554
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,150
made his elder brother's care for him

555
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,380
real and natural.

556
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,360
Very touching. Very relatable.

557
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,150
But Zhou Yubei's

558
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,400
was just the opposite.

559
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,080
Let me read you the beginning of Zhou Yubei.

560
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,180
Zhou Yubei wrote,

561
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,900
my brother is good for nothing.

562
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,630
That's kind of new.

563
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,990
Zhou Yubei

564
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,150
used his brother's decadent life

565
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,190
to motivate himself to be positive.

566
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,820
This is a different approach.

567
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,010
Bei, why is your brother so lame?

568
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,460
Just so so.

569
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,130
So you're having a hard time at home?

570
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,230
It's okay. He won't be home the day after tomorrow.

571
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,020
That's all right.

572
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,290
This composition is very emotional.

573
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,280
He deserves praise.

574
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,820
Here, as a teacher,

575
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,390
I wish Zhou Yubei's brother would cheer up

576
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,430
and set an example for Zhou Yubei.

577
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,670
I also hope you could bless Zhou Yubei's brother with applause.

578
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,990
Isn't that just picking him up after school?

579
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,630
I can do it too.

580
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,840
Which class is he in?

581
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,360
No, you can't ask.

582
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,970
You have to be unexpected.

583
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,910
He must be very happy

584
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,930
with such a big surprise.

585
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,560
Yubei.

586
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,160
Poor him.

587
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,920
Right. How did you get a brother like that?

588
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,330
I feel so angry for you.

589
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,110
Don't let me see your brother,

590
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,700
or I'll beat him up.

591
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,140
Bei, Bei.

592
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,140
Breaking news.

593
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,170
Your brother

594
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,690
asks everyone in the hallway if he knows you

595
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,810
and what class you are in.

596
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,900
That's not the point.

597
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,670
The point is he said his name was...

598
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,810
Who cares what his name is?

599
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:37,470
He doesn't even know what class his brother is in.

600
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,710
I want to see what this unreliable brother looks like.

All right, let's get to practice.

831
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,550
Zhou Ziqian.

832
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,650
Come here.

833
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:10,800
Come here.

834
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,340
We've been

835
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,530
pretty free lately.

836
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:17,570
I want Cheng Jia to go to the variety show with you for a few days.

837
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,920
She can help you manage your diet

838
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,330
and shoot some videos.

839
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,920
These videos can be used as promotional videos for our team.

840
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,630
Come with me?

841
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,290
Yes.

842
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,110
I've watched a lot of your games.

843
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,780
They're really good.

844
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,660
Thank you.

845
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,380
But you don't have to follow me around for the variety show.

846
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,410
Not many days in all.

847
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,210
For the sake of the team,

848
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,730
Cheng Jia should follow you.

849
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,750
So I can rest easy.

850
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,020
Right, I can take care of you.

851
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,090
You take care of me?

852
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:40,480
Yes.

853
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,120
Locating shooting is hard.

854
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,190
And I need to record at night.

855
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,110
Actually you following me is...

856
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,300
It doesn't matter.

857
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,800
I was in a wilderness survival club

858
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,060
in college.

859
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,530
I have no problem

860
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,480
camping out on my own now.

861
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,140
But...

862
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,030
It's a deal.

863
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,640
Coach,

864
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,440
I'm gonna go print out their grades.

865
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,260
Okay, go ahead.

866
00:36:59,090 --> 00:36:59,900
Bye.

867
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,540
How energetic.

868
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,250
I can rest easy with her.

869
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,550
Hey, what are you two doing?

870
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,260
I heard you two knew each other before,

871
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,630
so you must have been very close.

872
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:14,910
Just so so.

873
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,550
I don't understand.

874
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,030
Precisely, I don't know.

875
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,900
Hey, Ji Qiu.

876
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,280
Today's weather is so good.

877
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,990
Why don't you come with me to see the stars

878
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,430
and bask in the moon?

879
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,960
