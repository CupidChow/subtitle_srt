00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,390
An artifact that can prevent you from losing keys.

170
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,820
How's it? Isn't it useful?

171
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,300
What's that?

172
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,770
Refrigerator magnet. Isn't it cute?

173
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,540
Yes.

174
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,020
I didn't expect you to be so childlike, Mr. Zhou.

175
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,530
I have some other kinds of magnet.

176
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,470
Let me show you.

177
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,660
Mr. Zhou is so young and enthusiastic.

178
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,000
We might not have enough time.

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,030
Let's split up and take a look.

180
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,570
Okay.

181
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,320
Can we check out other places, Mr. Zhou?

182
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,900
Sure.

183
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,930
Tianyang, you go check the study then.

184
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,470
C and I will be in the living room.

185
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,390
Miss Ji, you...

186
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,700
I'll check the bedroom.

187
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,120
Camera, follow them to the study first.

188
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,140
Okay.

189
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:41,990
Souvenir.

190
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,210
Oh, thank you.

191
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,310
Where should we go now?

192
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,410
The study.

193
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,080
This is the study.

194
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,320
I rarely read, so I don't have many books.

195
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,500
You call this "not many"?

196
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,380
[Zhou Yubei]

197
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,460
Zhou Yubei?

198
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,000
My nickname.

199
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,000
I see.

200
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,930
But the things in the study

201
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,050
are more common.

202
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,650
I wonder how Miss Ji's doing in the bedroom.

203
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,900
In my room, there's...

204
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,520
Ji Qiu's in my room?

205
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,180
Yes.

206
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,160
Nothing special.

207
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,490
So bulging.

208
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,950
What is it?

209
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,560
A doll?

210
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,290

Don't worry. We saw nothing.

Yes. About this,

223

In Zhou Ziqian's house...

227
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,220
It was nothing.

228
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,600
It was just an accident.

229
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,590
Zhou Ziqian is my brother.

230
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,430
We used to role play when we were kids.

231
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,760
That makes sense.

232
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,450
Don't think too much.

233
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,340
No one will remember such a trivial thing.

234
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,260
Zhou Ziqian will forget about it soon.

235
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,830

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,320
Of course he should be responsible.

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,220
Why are you walking around?

498
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,710
You can see me?

499
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,330
Yes, I can.

500
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,070
About what happened last time,

501
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,750
actually I...

502
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,610
Last time?

503
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,610
What happened?

504
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,190
Last Tuesday...

505
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,570
I thought about it for a long time.

506
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,090
Actually...

507
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,300
Tuesday?

508
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,760
Are you talking about what I took away

509
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,970
from your place last time?

510
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,320
If you feel uncomfortable,

511
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,680
you can switch them.

512
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,390
Thank you

513
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,500
for having to think about the variety show right after the competition.

514
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,790
Did you forget, Grape Ji?

515
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,680
You forgot?

516
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,570
Forget it.

517
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,760
I'm hanging up.

518
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,740
Why is he so anxious?

519
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,340
There's nothing left. I'll get more.

520
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,780
-In the cabinet below. -Okay.

521
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,460
What?

522
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,350
Do you know why

523
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,620
Zhou Ziqian called just now?

524
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,430
It must be about Qiu's variety show.

525
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,640
But they've become so close now.

526
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,750
It'll be better if they become colleagues.

527
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,680
I'm a little jealous.

528
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,700
Are you jealous?

529
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,510
Jealous...

530
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,610
Why should I be jealous?

531
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,270
Just between friends.

532
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,190
If she has a better friend than you,

533
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,370
you'll be jealous.

534
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:16,970
Fortunately,

535
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,350
Qiu will be closer to me once I play cute.

536
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,780
It tortured me for so many days,

537
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,780
but she simply forgot it.

538
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,130
How could she forget such a big deal?

539
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,240
Ziqian, are you available for an interview?

540
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,170
-Okay. -This way, please.

541
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,590
You were on the phone, right?

542
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,620
Are you calling your family?

543
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,520
Sort of.

544
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,480
Okay.

545
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,600
Why is it over already?

546
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,270
Why isn't Jiangjiang back from the bathroom?

547
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,400
-I'll get going. -Hey.

548
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,510
You need to stay longer.

549
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,770
Why?

550
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,080
They're still in class.

551
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,970
If you go back now,

552
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,150
everyone will see you. How awkward it will be.

553
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,130
Go back after class.

554
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,080
Then no one will look at you.

555
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,610
And it's getting dark soon.

556
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,850
It's quite far from the classroom.

557
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,010
Aren't you afraid to go back alone?

558
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,410
The classroom is empty.

559
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,020
It's quite scary.

560
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,690
Are you scared?

561
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,940
Of course not.

562
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,170
I grew up watching horror movies.

563
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,960
-You're not leaving? -The class isn't over yet.

564
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,760
Hello?

565
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,120
Who's inside?

566
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,220
Come down.

567
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,610
Weird.

568
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,870
-This is a blind spot. He can't see it. -I saw someone just now.

569
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,700
Don't worry.

570
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,170
You are clearly seen. Come out.

571
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,980
Which class are you from?

572
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,160
Skipping class to watch the game.

573
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,230
This is ridiculous.

574
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,160
I just don't understand.

575
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,730
What's so interesting about this shooting competition?

576
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,650
Is the contestant your brother?

577
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,460
You even sneaked into the computer classroom.

578
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,430
This is a very bad behavior, you know?

579
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,100
No need to say anything.

580
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,180
Run five laps before night study begins.

581
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,930
Sir,

582
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,160
I have a stomachache.

583
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,520
Don't make up excuses.

584
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,860
Look at Zhou Yubei.

585
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,360
He showed up in the computer classroom at the same time with you.

586
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,040
But he must have his reasons.

587
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:21,960
Right?

588
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,770
Zhou Yubei.

589
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,670
If you need something, come to us.

590
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,110
What are you doing in the computer classroom?

591
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,190
Watching the game.

592
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,710
Stop laughing.

593
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,270
You, you and you.

594
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,810
Go run ten laps on the playground.

595
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,530
We are so unlucky.

596
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,150
Just get used to it.

597
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,970
How many laps have you run?

598
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,660
One lap left.

599
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,790
I can't run anymore.

600
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,460
Go ahead.

601
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,590
Take it slow.

602
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,620
Zhou Yubei.

603
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,790
Are you almost done?

604
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,670
Half a lap left.

605
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,640
Actually, if you made up any excuse just now,

606
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,470
he would have believed you.

607
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,880
Why were you so honest?

608
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,370
I did do that.

609
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,740
Wait for me.

610
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,180
What are you watching?

611
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,510
The video of your competition.

612
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,240
Zhang specifically told us to watch it repeatedly.

613
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,350
We've watched it three times.

614
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,830
How's it? Don't you think

615
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,370
I'm quite photogenic?

616
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,600
Look. You have to keep a low profile.

617
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,950
You made a mistake here.

618
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,730
Was it because of the flash?

619
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,030
Only you can see it.

620
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,880
I admire you.

621
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,350
It's almost time.

622
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,450
I'll go practice.

623
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,430
Let's go.

624
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:28,950
Ji Qiu,

625
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,880
are you free tonight?

626
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,910
-You're back? -Yes.

627
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,070
I won the championship.

628
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,080
No reaction from you?

629
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,020
Fine, my treat.

630
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,520
To celebrate your victory.

631
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,750
No problem.

632
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,510
Send me the address later.

633
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,430
See you later.

634
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,810
What are you talking about?

635
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,270
Miss Ji,

636
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,000
let's go out for dinner tonight.

637
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,060
To celebrate the finalization of the guest list.

638
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,490
Actually, it's because the restaurant is very delicious.

639
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,750
It'll be a pity if you don't go.

640
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,460
And our success is all because of you.

641
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,210
Why don't you go and eat?

642
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,140
I had an appointment with someone else.

643
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:07,970
Miss Ji,

644
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,390
there's a new buyers' shop near it.

645
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,280
Didn't you always want to buy vintage bags?

646
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,120
I have checked.

647
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,350
The clothes and bags there are definitely of all kinds.

648
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,790
I want to go with you.

649
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,040
Are you really not impressed, Miss Ji?

650
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,200
Let's go.

651
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,700
But...

652
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,450
But what?

653
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,890
It's been a long time since we last gathered.

654
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,710
The celebration party is meant for you.

655
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,230
How can you not go, our heroine?

656
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,300
-I... -You what?

657
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,860
Look, I've called everyone for you.

658
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,990
Once they heard that the celebration party is for you,

659
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,020
they were very happy to come.

660
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,380
How can you not go?

661
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:57,820
I don't care.

662
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,540
I won't let you go if you don't come with us today.

663
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,840
-Hello? -Well.

664
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,270
I can't make it tonight.

665
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,870
I have to work overtime.

666
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,520
Working overtime?

667
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,980
I'm actually also a little busy.

668
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,560
I have training tonight.

669
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,100
Don't forget what you owe me then.

670
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,800
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

671
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Let's go.

672
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:50,270
Boss, a room please.

673
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,600
Okay, wait a moment.

674
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:54,170
Zhang will praise you again.

675
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,250
Miss Ji,

676
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,200
let me tell you.

677
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,580
I saw this restaurant on yelp.

678
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,670
Although it just opened,

679
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,550
it's very delicious.

680
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,350
Is this the training you mentioned?

681
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,920
Is this the "working overtime" you said?

682
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,330
A team dinner is considered working overtime?

683
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,520
A team celebration is considered a training?

684
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,910
No wonder you were so naggy

685
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,100
when I asked you to come out for dinner today.

686
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,930
So you had an appointment with Miss Ji first.

687
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,560
What are you talking about?

688
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,620
Hey, Miss Ji.

689
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,660
If you had an appointment with Mr. Zhou earlier, we wouldn't have…

690
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,850
Since we've coincidentally run into each other,

691
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,830
why don't we all eat together?

692
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,550
-Okay. -Okay.

693
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,710
Let's go.

694
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,970
My brother is really on a variety show.

695
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,660
With Zhou Ziqian.

696
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,400
What are you doing?

697
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,730
I'm cooking.

698
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,720
I just...

699
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,890
You found him?

700
00:36:54,030 --> 00:37:00,960
