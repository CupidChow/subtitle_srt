00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,060
Did Zhou Ziqian confess his love?

9
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,780
How would I know?

10
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,250
I can't keep an eye on him.

[Gao Yuan]

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,080
I saw Miss Cheng posting her on Wechat moments.

16
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,840
They are having a meeting now.

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,220
There must be something

18
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,780
betweeen them now that they are alone.

19
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,570
They are still together?

20
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,479
What took them so long?

21
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:39,800
Don't they have to rest?

22
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,860
What if they don't feel well the next day recording?

23
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,680
Why would I think so much?

24
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,539
Strange.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,240
Why can't I calm down today?

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,720
I've read the book.

27
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,520
I've done the work.

28
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,080
What else haven't I done?

29
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,410
I haven't run for a long time.

30
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,100
Ah!

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,310
That must be it.

32
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,110
I haven't run for a long time and I'm not in good health.

33
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,760
That's why I'm upset.

34
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,990
I have to run now.

35
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,040
Am I underdressed

36
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,740
wearing this

37
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,810
for a  jogging?

38
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,520
Underdressed.

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,050
This looks good.

40
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,880
It's been hours.

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,330
I'm so hungry.

42
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,050
I saw a special dish nearby this afternoon.

43
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,920
Shall we go?

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,010
Sure. Let's go.

45
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,390
Shall we invite Miss Ji?

46
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:10,970
Sure.

47
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,800
What are you looking at?

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,860
Miss Ji, are you going out now?

49
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,110
Wow.

50
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,790
You dress up hot.

51
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,890
Are you going on a date?

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,870
For a jogging.

53
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,180
Can't you tell?

54
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,020
Jogging?

55
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,930
Dressing up for a jogging?

56
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,490
Is the dressing code so strict now

57
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,250
for a jogging?

58
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,310
I'm always like this.

59
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,130
Enough for this.

60
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,460
I'm going warm up.

61
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,460
Miss Ji

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,090
is a little weird.

63
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,030
Is it because of too much work recently?

64
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,710
It definitely is for a date.

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,700
I can't believe you bought what she said.

66
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,870
Really?

67
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,830
Mr. Zhou.

68
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,320
What?

69
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,100
I'm going out.

70
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,520
What?

71
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,200
You have a date with Miss Ji, don't you?

72
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,550
What do you mean?

73
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,560
It's just that

74
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,210
we just saw Miss Ji leaving.

75
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,390
She dressed up very pretty.

76
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,050
We thought she must have gone for date.

77
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,040
Mr. Zhou

78
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,740
also looks weird.

79
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,970
Calm down.

80
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,880
Relax.

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,490
Ji Qiu.

82
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,350
You…

83
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,080
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

84
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,260
I'm warming up for jogging.

85
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,720
Jogging?

86
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,900
Or else what?

87
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,910
What do you want?

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,180
I...

89
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,400
I'd like to jog too.

90
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,490
I haven't done this for a long time.

91
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,990
Can you take me with you?

92
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,190
You can run by yourself if you want.

93
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,220
Ji Qiu,

94
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,960
did Gao Yuan tell you something before you left?

95
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,000
Maybe.

96
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,970
I can't remember.

97
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,940
I don't like Cheng Jia.

98
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,940
Don't listen to Gao Yuan.

99
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,880
He even said Coach Zhang liked the canteen lady.

100
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,159
And he was punished for two hours.

101
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,140
Why did you tell me this?

102
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,150
I'm not curious.

103
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,140
♫Oh. Love me. Love me♫

104
00:05:59,159 --> 00:05:59,880
Well...

105

♫You are my only one in this colorful world♫

106
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,470
Just chatting.

107
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,970
Trying to have a conversation.

108
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,990
♫You are the only exclusive secret that entered my heart♫

109

♫Oh. Kiss me. Kiss me♫

♫I'm afraid I'll only meet this once in my life♫

113
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,200
Then

114
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,950
you are not jogging anymore?

115
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,220
I just changed my mind.

116
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,090
♫Oh. Kiss me. Kiss me♫

117
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,230
What do you want to do then?

118
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,570
♫Just one of your expressions can make me fall in love with you♫

119
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:21,790
I'm hungry.

120
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,690
I'm going to buy some food.

121

♫I'm afraid I'll only meet this once in my life♫

122
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,740
I'll go with you.

123
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:24,960
I won't treat you.

124
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
Then it's my treat.

125
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,140
What is this?

126
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,250
Hmm.

127
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,430
I met Yan just now.

128
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,420
She asked me to bring it to you.

129
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,280
Aren't you

130
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,710
drafting the next episode's interview plan?

131
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,140
It has all the related information about Xu Wang.

132
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,780
She also asked you

133
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,190
to dig into it.

134
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,010
There are some tip-offs and juicy stories.

135
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,990
Juicy stories?

136
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,460
Like what?

137
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,750
What's juicy about a shooting athlete?

138
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,540
He's already very positive.

139
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,270
[The first time he participated in a shooting competition was when he was 12.]

140
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,260
He used to smile a lot when he was little.

141
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,340
Oh.

142
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,380
I didn't know this about his family.

143
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,490
What happened?

144
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,030
His parents had an accident on their way to watch his game.

145
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,270
And they both died.

146
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,830
And it seemed to be a big blow to Xu Wang.

147
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,650
He never won the championship again since then.

148
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,600
That's why he transferred from Team Suyang to Team Jiangyi.

149
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,050
Right.

150
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,820
That surprised me.

151
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,290
But this kind of story

152
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,240
is juicy.

153
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,450
I don't think

154
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,410
it's proper to ask such a question.

155
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,870
Agreed.

156
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,200
It's not appropriate.

157
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,820
Yes.

158
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,540
I didn't say we have to ask him this.

159
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,010
Let's check more. All right?

160
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,370
Next team.

161
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,460
Coach,

162
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,990
something is wrong with my gun.

163
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,760
What's the problem?

164
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,030
Can you fix it yourself?

165
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,300
It will take some time.

166
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
The gun worked well after my training yesterday.

167
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,299
I want to check the CCTV in the gun storage.

168
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,080
After all, last night,

169
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,340
someone stayed very late in the training field.

170
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,700
What do you mean? Just say it.

171
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,310
There's no need to be so weird.

172
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,880
Didn't you touch my gun last night?

173
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,880
Is it necessary?

174
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:52,560
Enough.

175
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,830
You know our security level.

176
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,520
No need to check the CCTV.

177
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,750
Maybe you broke it when you didn't notice.

178
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,770
Xu Wang did stay late last night.

179
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,340
But he applied for extra training.

180
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,000
Did you get the rabies vaccine? Is that why you are biting for no excuses here.

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,780
What did you say?

182
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,300
What?

183
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,270
Enough.

184
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,370
Gao Yuan, what are you talking about?

185
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,120
Fix the gun.

186
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,150
All the others,

187
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,780
keep training.

188
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,490
Don't you think you are a hypocrite?

189
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,700
I really don't understand why Zhou Ziqian and others are all on your side.

190
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,710
You want to be the champion so much.

191
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,930
Have you considered their feelings?

192
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,070
You make friends because you let them win the champion?

193
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,130
Did you do it?

194
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,180
Can't you hear me?

195
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,140
Is this what your parents taught you?

196
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,240
Well,

197
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,590
I almost forgot

198
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,410
you are a jinx.

199
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,300
Your parents died because of you, right?

200
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,720
Did your dad also

201
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,350
won the championship by such dirty tricks?

202
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,540
What's wrong?

203
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,650
Are you angry?

204
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,450
I haven't finished yet.

205
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,450
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

206
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,400
Is this what your dad taught you?

207
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,630
Xu Wang.

208
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,680
Stop fighting!

209
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,550
Come on!

210
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,150
You don't have to lose your qualification because of him.

211
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,200
Yuan,

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,530
is it really okay to leave Xu Wang alone?

213
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,180
Let him be.

214
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,680
What if Coach Zhang knows about this?

215
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,670
What do you mean?

216
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,380
Did something happen?

217
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,280
Just now.

218
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,890
They...

219
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,320
What happened?

220
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,030
I didn't see anything.

221
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,660
I saw nothing either.

222
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:44,980
I'm hungry.

223
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,770
Let's get some food.

224
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,160
Freshly baked chestnut cake.

225
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,320
It's delicious.

226
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,010
Why are you here?

227
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,030
I was here when I sent you the message.

228
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,880
Gao Yuan said

229
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,260
you might be here. So I came.

230
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,760
Are you hurt?

231
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,980
Wait a minute.

232
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,170
Don't move.

233
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,150
I watched several videos of your games today.

234
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,320
I'm very happy to have a friend like you.

235
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,960
So,

236
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,430
you have to stay on the court for a long time.

237
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,420
You must protect your hands.

238
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,120
Do you like me?

239
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,050
Do you know me?

240
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,690
I...

241
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,340
I'm trying to.

242
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,480
How?

243
00:12:53,150 --> 00:13:00,010
♫I've finally got ready to see you♫

244
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,080
Did I give you a chance to understand me?

245
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,010
I don't like you.

246
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:06,380
♫My heart is pounding with all kinds of feelings♫

247
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,610
Please, don't like me.

248
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,460
There's no need.

249
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,210
I'm not worth it.

250
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,070
♫How should I hold the flowers so I don't look nervous♫

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,890
But

252
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,870
I like you.

253
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,080
♫Your city is so big♫

254
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,920
I'm not asking you to do anything.

255
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,390
I just want to tell you

256
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,080
you are a person worth being loved.

257
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,640
♫I'm about to see you♫

258
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,220
And

259
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,630
I will decide

260
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,370
if you are worth it.

261
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,990
♫I must act more natural than you♫

262
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,070

♫The eyes that can push my tears away♫

264
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,510
you may want to be alone now.

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,870
I...

266
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,920
I'll get going.

267
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:49,810
♫Why are they avoiding me♫

268
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,610
Remember to try the chestnut cake.

269
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,430
It's delicious.

270
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,320
♫Let's go find a night♫

271
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,120
♫Without other people♫

272
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,900
♫There will be candles, strawberries and a guitar♫

273
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:11,390
♫I will write a soft love song for you♫

♫In your preferred grammar♫

275
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,020
The training must be hard.

276
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,490
You should be good to yourself.

277
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,330
♫Can we be together♫

278

282

00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:54,660
♫I've finally got ready to see you♫

284
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,180
What's up?

285
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,610
I think

286
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,670
if I told Qiu about this,

287
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,910
she might keep it in mind.

288
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:01,760
♫My heart is pounding with all kinds of feelings♫

289
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,260
Then she won't be able to work tomorrow.

290
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:58,940
Okay.

291
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,610
You think I won't keep it in mind?

292
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,040
You're different.

293
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,650
You are a friend

294
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,640
and a teacher.

295
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,480
Mr. Fu.

296
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,740
I was dumped today.

297
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,260
I'm a little sad.

298
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,570
But I'm not sad about being dumped.

299
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,050
I learned something about Xu Wang.

300
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,540
When I think about how he's been through this all these years by himself,

301
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,250
I feel bad.

302
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,950
I thought

303
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,590
if only I could have met him earlier,

304
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,960
I could have told him earlier

305
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,840
that he's already great.

306
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
But now,

307
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,340
something bad happened to him.

308
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,330
I don't know how to help him.

309
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,660
Fu,

310
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,150
what should I do?

311
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,060
Actually,

312
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,100
you're just worried about Xu Wang, right?

313
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,820
Yes.

314
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,890
Some things

315
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,500
can only be solved by himself.

316
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,420
Give him some time.

317
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
You have to believe that

318
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,610
he is not a fragile person.

319
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,710
Just do what you want to do.

320
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,500
If you think it's right,

321
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,920
just do it.

322
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,180
You're already 25.

323
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,100
Looks like

324
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,970
your rebellious phase finally is coming.

325
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,030
Okay.

326
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,980
It's okay if he's not in a good mood and doesn't wanna see me.

327
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,560
As long as he got my gifts.

328
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:27,610
Okay.

329
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,250
This place is the closest.

330
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,570
This place is four kilometers away.

331
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,410
And this one.

332
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,830
Why is it so far away?

333
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,390
I didn't expect the last episode coming so soon.

334
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,230
At the beginning of the first episode,

335
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,210
someone complained when it will end.

336
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,350
Gosh.

337
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,500
I really

338
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,050
don't want this to end now.

339
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,319
Will we

340
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,730
have a second season?

341
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,260
It's not the end.

342
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,329
Let's go.

343
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,880
After the last game,

344
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,349
you found the most important clue.

345
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,660
The undercover can only say the opposite.

346
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,099
Others can only tell the truth.

347
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:31,170
So in the last part, Detective Ye Qiao will ask

348
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,320
and find out the undercover protected by everyone.

349
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,170
But be careful.

350
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,280
You can only ask three people.

351
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,820
Don't be nervous.

352
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,090
I'm very gentle.

353
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,180
Is your age on Baidu

354
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,500
true or not?

355
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,740
It's true.

356
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,540
Really?

357
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,660
It's true.

358
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,270
How did you know?

359
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,300
Umm.

360
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,350
Last time,

361
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,530
I accidentally saw your ID card.

362
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,470
Do I look good?

363
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,690
No.

364
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,570
I'll give you another chance.

365
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,100
Nice.

366
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,350
Pass.

367
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,190
Mr. Fu.

368
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,410
Do you have feelings for someone?

369
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,190
No.

370
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,040
He's the spy.

371
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,200
Hey.

372
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,370
You...

373
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,430
You wouldn't even give me a chance?

374
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,490
You should at least ask me.

375
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,600
Besides,

376
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,740
how did you know Fu Qile was lying?

377
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,910
I guessed.

378
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,950
A woman's sixth sense.

379
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,160
The undercover was identified successfully.

380
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,300
Fu Qile failed.

381
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,310
Before we punish him, please take your videotape

382
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,610
and record the last episode.

383
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,370
Miss Ji,

384
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,410
Mr. Fu fancies someone?

385
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,460
I never heard him say that.

386
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,510
Maybe it's someone from school.

387
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,330
Ji Qiu.

388
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,370
Do you have my camera?

389
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,000
It's in the bus by the road.

390
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,020
Fu's is here too.

391
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,640
Thank you.

392
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,390
Thank you.

393
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,670
Did he already take it?

394
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,670
Ji Qiu.

♫I've thought about it many times♫

♫I have thrown away this charming and empty thing in vain♫

398

Ji Qiu, be careful not to fall down.

399
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,310
♫I pick up the pen and only remember your wish♫

♫I wish I could have all the good and bad sides of you♫

♫Learn to be soft-hearted even if you turn a blind eye♫

♫Clumsy with words but brave for you♫

Yes.

416
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,460
You got the wrong one.

417
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,130
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Fu.

418

419

Mr. Zhou.

420

This is the last episode.

Yes.

423

I won't be late again.

424
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,400
You don't have to wake me up anymore. Are you happy?

425
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,510
It's the last day. Pretend to be happy.

♫Life comes up, life comes down♫

I'm coming.

505
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:44,950
Let's take a photo.

506
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,040
♫I was young when I leave the town♫

507
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,620
Come!

508
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,090
Okay. Show a post.

509
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,860
One, two, three.

510
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,290
Yeah!

511
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,240
♫But I will be here with you always♫

512
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,710
Did something happen

513
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,210
between you two?

514
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,670
Nothing.

515
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,650
You have so much luggage.

516
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,190
It's my duty to send you upstairs.

517
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,660
Is this

518
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,290
a lot?

519
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,690
Why don't you two...

520
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,280
That's right.

521
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,860
I think two people is too much.

522
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,470
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

523
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,580
You can go back and rest.

524
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,890
Let's go. I'll send you upstairs.

525
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,170
What are you doing going upstairs?

526
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:36,740
I...

527
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,870
I'm going to visit Rongrong.

528
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,370
I haven't seen her for a while.

529
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,320
Let's go.

530
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,900
I'll go too.

531
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,670
It's so heavy. Mr. Fu can't take it by himself.

532
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,430
Let's go.

533
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,070
Rongrong.

534
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,610
Rongrong.

535
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,040
Is she still working?

536
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,370
Rongrong hasn't been back yet.

537
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,560
Have a seat.

538
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:13,930
I'll pack up first.

539
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,430
Don't worry about me.

540
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,200
Just pretend I'm not here.

541
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,760
I'll keep an eye on him.

542
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,630
Oh.

543
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,480
Well,

544
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,830
help yourselves.

545
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,030
What's wrong?

546
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,410
Anything else?

547
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,660
No.

548
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,420
Weird.

549
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,420
I heard something just now.

550
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,390
She never said she likes you.

551
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,440
Nor did she say she likes you.

552
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,660
That's fair.

553
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,790
I won't give in.

554
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,610
Neither will I.

555
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,390
Where's the tissue?

556
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,400
You don't know, do you?

557
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,030
Is it enough?

558
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,260
There's more if not.

559
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,700
What else do you need?

560
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,540
I'll find it for you.

561
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,230
After all,

562
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,710
you are not familiar with it here.

563
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,830
Why aren't you talking?

564
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:34,930
Nowadays,

565
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,510
it's popular for mind exchange.

566
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,670
What?

567
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,360
Hey, Ji Qiu.

568
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,560
Look how delicious the apple is.

569
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Do you want some? I'll peel one for you.

570
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,550
The fruit knife is on the left of the third cabinet in the kitchen.

571
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,340
Ji Qiu,

572
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,630
it's good for your skin if you eat the apple skin.

573
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,470
I'm not hungry.

574
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,300
Rongrong should be back later.

575
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,870
Let's watch TV.

576
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,140
Mr. Zhou,

577
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,470
don't you need to go back for training?

578
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:06,990
Unfortunately,

579
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,760
the preparation plan doesn't start till tomorrow.

580
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,300
Mr. Fu,

581
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,520
don't you need to go back and prepare for tomorrow's class?

582
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,500
Unfortunately,

583
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,000
I have a day off tomorrow.

584
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,420
You can't do this anymore, right?

585
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,190
Go back if you can't.

586
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,090
What?

587
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,340
I've never been this sober.

588
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,670
You don't believe me?

589
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,170
Look at my eyes.

590
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,970
If you are sleepy,

591
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,010
you can go back.

592
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,640
I'm not sleepy.

593
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,190
Not at all.

594
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:40,900
What?

595
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,950
I'm fine.

596
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,990
I'm going...

597
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,780
Are you going to leave?

598
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:46,960
I'm going to pour a cup of coffee.

599
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,190
Mr. Zhou.

600
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,050
Do you want some?

601
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,150
No.

602
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,050
Thank you.

603
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,800
It's so late. Why hasn't Rongrong come back yet?

604
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,720
She didn't answer my call either.

605
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,700
I'll call her one more time.

606
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,110
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed cannot be connected at the moment.

607
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,360
Please try again later.

608
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,430
I still can't reach her.

609
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,670
Do you think

610
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,350
she's gone to Xu Wang?

611
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,960
It's impossible.

612
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,060
Why?

613
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,370
Rongrong used to go to our team a lot.

614
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,830
She told me something two days ago.

615
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,630
I haven't had time to tell you.

616
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,120
What is it?

617
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,800
She hasn't gone back yet.

618
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,120
She's not in the stadium.

619
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,190
She came here yesterday, but she didn't contact me.

620
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,110
Have you talked about any place before?

621
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,730
Think about it.

622
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,640
Okay, I got it. Don't worry.

623
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,020
Let's go to the places she usually goes to.

624
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:50,860
Okay.

625
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,810
Did she answer?

626
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,370
No.

627
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,650
Let's go.

628
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,080
I'll go with you.

629
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,650
Let's split up.

630
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,190
Xu Wang.

631
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,220
The girl who often comes to see me.

632
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,380
Has she been here?

633
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,210
No.

634
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,300
Hey.

635
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,890
Hey, Ding Ding.

636
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,230
Are you still in the office?

637
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,660
We got off work early.

638
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,910
Did Rongrong say where she was going?

639
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,620
Umm.

640
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,290
No, I don't think she did.

641
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,360
Thank you.

642
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,670
I promised to take you to eat all the delicious food in Jiangyi.

643
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,730
But it seems that everything I introduced to you is what I like.

644
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,530
Is there anything you want to eat?

645
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,930
Me?

646
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,270
Not really.

647
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,800
I remember the first day I came to Jiangyi,

648
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,830
there was a place for roasted sweet potatoes nearby the train station around 10 p.m.

649
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,810
It's really delicious.

650
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,820
I never had time to eat it again.

651
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,340
You're lucky.

652
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,400
You can buy our local specialty at random.

653
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,270
We can go together next time if you want.

654
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,420
So you still want to bring it back for your friend?

655
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:14,650
Yes.

656
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,790
It tastes better when it's hot.

657
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,810
Sir,

658
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,010
how long will it take?

659
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,030
We've been talking for more than 20 minutes.

660
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,080
I came from a long distance.

661
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,560
My phone is dead.

662
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,870
It'll take another half day to go back.

663
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,540
You have to wait till it's cooked.

664
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:30,770
Soon.

665
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,030
How many more minutes?

666
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:32,930
Oh.

667
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,990
You just said

668
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,350
to bring them to your friends.

669
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,250
You bought so many.

670
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,480
Can you finish them?

671
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,300
Yes, we can.

672
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,590
I have many friends. They love it.

673
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,290
That's great.

674
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,370
You have so many friends.

675
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,360
Hey.

676
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,220
Be careful not to burn yourself.

677
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,900
Xu Wang.

678
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,440
Your boyfriend?

679
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,540
A friend.

680
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:16,410
♫I haven't written to others since October♫

681
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,040
Even the competition is not as exciting as tonight.

682
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,050
My heart is still recovering.

683
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,400
♫I'm just a little composer♫

684
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,360
Me too.

685
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,380
From lying on the bed playing with my phone

686
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,760
to eating sweet potatoes on the street.

687
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:27,160
♫Never mind these bad things and put them in the corner♫

688
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,070
It's ups and downs.

689
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,690
You are so timid.

690
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,320
♫Just think about what it's worth♫

691
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,060
And you are not?

692
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,510
Then why are your hands trembling?

693
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,020
I'm sorry.

694
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:38,500
♫Focus on the things that will make you feel better♫

695
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,860
My phone was dead.

696
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,250
I forgot to tell you.

697
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,880
If Xu Wang's call was one minute late, we would've called the police.

698
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,410
♫It will make you happier♫

699
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,340
By the way,

700
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,240
this sweet potato is really delicious.

701
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:49,380
♫I've been thinking about you lately♫

702
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,410
Why did you come here to eat roasted sweet potatoes?

703
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,390
I...

704
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:53,500
♫You know I'm happy to hear you talk and you are happy to share♫

705
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,810
I just want to eat.

706
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,540
You know that.

707
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,880
♫The way you look at me I can't help getting close to you♫

708
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,130
Roasted sweet potatoes are Jiangyi's specialties.

709
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,120
If we have time in the future,

710
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,950
we need to have a group chat with all the food vendors in Jiangyi.

711
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:05,260
♫No one loves you as much as I do♫

712
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,920
If you disappear again,

713
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,270
it'll be convenient to ask

714
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,210
in the group chat.

715
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,410
I agree.

716
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,449
I can be the group manager.

717
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,020
Jiangyi doesn't seem to be cold in autumn.

718
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,570
Not usually.

719
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,080
But it's especially warm this year.

720
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,179
Because there's one more sun this year.

721
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,600
One more sun?

722
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,210
That would be me.

723
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,310
Zhou Ziqian.

724
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,449
♫How many days I haven't kept in touch with you♫

725
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,250
You're so rustic.

726
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,639
♫Do you remember the conversations still♫

727
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,699
I don't know if it will snow this winter.

728
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,730
Probably not.

729
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,409
It didn't snow last winter.

730
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,989
♫Recall the scene when we first met♫

731
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,409
Does it snow in Suyang in winter？

732
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,820
♫Is there anything different to you♫

733
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,060
It snows every year in the winter of Suyang.

734
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,320
If there's a chance,

735
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
I'll show you around.

736
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,760
Sure.

737
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,080
By the way,

738
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,550
Qiu said you were there together.

739
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,980
Why? It's so late.

740
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,930
They...

741
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,920
Of course they were waiting for you.

742
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,230
It's been a long time.

743
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,440
I almost forgot what you look like.

744
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,330
Now I remember.

745
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,940
Is it

746
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,160
that long?

747
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,370
Am I

748
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,780
a plain Jane?

749
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,880
Have some sweet potatoes.

750
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,930
Why do I find my sweet potatoes have different colors?

751
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,910
Let me see.

752
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,880
It's not cooked yet

753
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,600
No.

754
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,170
No wonder it's a bit hard.

755
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,550
I thought Jiangyi's roasted sweet potatoes were all like this.

756
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,060
Alas.

757
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,140
Why is someone so lucky?

758
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,480
Rongrong.

759
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,110
That's all.

760
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,450
Hey.

761
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,060
You can also eat it raw.

762
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,590
Hey.

763
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,720
Stop being pretentious.

764
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,520
Xu Wang.

765
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,820
Do you have an interview tomorrow?

766
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,850
Remember to say something good about me.

767
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:47,570
Zhou Ziqian.

768
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,210
Hey.

769
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,570
It's okay.

770
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,460
It's edible.

771
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,510
You can have my arm.

772
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,550
A friend of mine

773
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,680
fell in love with his best friend.

774
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,520
Should he say it?

775
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,710
Be friends if you can't be couples.

776
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,780
I don't think it's reliable.

777
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,290
After all, the longer you know each other,

778
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,680
the more risky the confession is.

779
