may not be as good as you think.

When I was a freshman in high school,

170
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,950
the bus that is always late,

171
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,540
and the midterm exams that bother you every time.

172
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,870
♫There will be candles, strawberries and a guitar♫

173
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,420
So I studied psychology

174
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,880
because I hope that those who need a listener

175
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:05,470
♫I will write a soft love song for you♫

176
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,160
will feel lucky

177
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,600
when they meet a psychology teacher like me.

178
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,650
♫In your preferred grammar♫

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,240
♫I've finally got ready to see you♫

180
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,080
This is the end of the lecture.

181
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,970
I seem to be a little off-topic today.

182
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,550
♫My heart is pounding with all kinds of feelings♫

183
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,000
I wish you

184
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,370
all the best.

185
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,520
Mr. Fu.

186
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,450
What's the matter?

187
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,110
Is the friend you just mentioned

188
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,650
someone you like?

189
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,190
What makes you think so?

190
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,520
That's what you taught me.

191
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,700
A person's first reaction

192
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,970
can't lie.

193
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,840
There was an emotion in your eyes

194
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,420
when you just said those words.

195
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,140
What is it?

196
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,700
Love.

197
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,120
Mr. Fu.

198
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,370
You must be in unrequited love with her.

199
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,550
What you are doing is not right.

200
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,500
You need to take the initiative if you love someone.

201
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,990
Girls like men who take the initiative.

202
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,610
You have to show her your good qualities

203
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,790
and exude your charm.

204
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,240
And one more thing...

205
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,850
Never be shy.

206
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,510
Mr. Fu, I have to go.

207
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,300
Be sure to remember what I said.

208
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,500
Take the initiative.

209
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,520
Good luck.

210
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,770
-Bye. -Okay.

211
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,570
Why are you laughing?

212
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,890
Because I'm happy.

213
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,560
It's a nice day

214
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,020
and the temperature is comfortable.

215
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,310
I had my favorite ice cream.

216
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,110
And you...

217
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,090
You guys hang out with me.

218
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,210
So I'm very happy.

219
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm done with this book. Here you are.

220
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,350
But this is my gift to you.

221
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,460
But you did not finish reading it.

222
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,710
How did you know that?

223
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,370
You didn't finish your notes.

224
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,650
Let me take a look...

225
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,790
This book definitely belongs to Song Rongrong.

226
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,340
What's so great about this book?

227
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,980
Let me read it.

228
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,850
Didn't you say it was childish?

229
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,510
I won't give it to you.

230
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:46,180
-Give it to me. -No.

231
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,910
Ji Qiu.

232
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,360
Ouch!

233
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,080
What's going on?

234
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,660
You stepped on my shadow.

235
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,520
Hmm...

236
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,010
Do you know there is a saying

237
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,980
that stepping on someone else's shadow

238
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,360
will make you feel emotionally connected to that person?

239
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,380
If I'm not mistaken,

240
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,520
the name of the person who said this was Zhou.

241
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,640
You don't believe me?

242
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,090
Then tell me

243
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,720
what I'm thinking now?

244
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,010
You must be thinking about

245
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,640
why Zhou Ziqian is so childish?

246
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,890
Fine. You win.

247
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,150
Ji Qiu.

248
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,350
I'm just wondering...

249
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,280
What kind of boyfriend do you want?

250
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,190
♫Reading the tales in your eyes♫

251
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,150
Boyfriend?

252

♫Drawing the smile in your mind♫

253
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,130
I haven't thought about this.

254
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,820
♫Bringing all the colours♫

255
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,110
But at least, he has to be a loyal person.

256
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,680
♫If you can be bright♫

257
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,260
Since you fall in love with someone,

258
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,540
you have to

259

♫Packing the stuff and throwing away♫

260
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,880
keep a distance from some people.

Tell me.

268

Did he make you unhappy? Or did he do something else?

269
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,280
No.

Take the initiative.

295

Make them think I'm the one who takes the initiative.

♫All will be fine♫

I'm so tired.

299
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,560
Skating

300
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,810
is not for me at all.

301
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,750
But our flat is so messy.

302
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,890
We haven't cleaned up yet.

303
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,670
I don't want to move.

304
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,280
It would be great if someone would suddenly show up

305
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,750
and finish all our housework.

306
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,060
Who is it?

307
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,080
Coming.

308
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,560
Who is it?

309
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,900
Fu?

310
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,550
Good evening.

311
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,410
You must be hungry.

312
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,710
I brought you some food.

313
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,320
Thank you.

314
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,380
Take the initiative.

315
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,780
Take the initiative.

316
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,010
Fu.

317
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,690
What are you doing?

318
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,790
Nothing.

319
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,830
I had too much food just now.

320
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,300
I'm exercising.

321
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,200
Fu, leave it.

322
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll clean it up.

323
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,800
Have a seat.

324
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,940
It's rare to find a boy

325
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,930
as diligent as you.

326
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,560
Really?

327
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,500
Yeah.

328
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,490
Is that a compliment?

329
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,090
Let me help you sweep the floor.

330
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,000
What is he doing?

331
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,710
Is he working on

332
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,010
some weird psychological subject again?

333
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,210
I got it.

334
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,740
He must be working on

335
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,170
whether cleaning can relieve stress today.

336
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,210
Finished.

337
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,150
Have some water.

338
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,120
Is our flat

339
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,150
really that messy?

340
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,090
No.

341
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,490
Your flat is clean.

342
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,440
Very clean.

343
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,900
Girls like men who take the initiative.

344
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,370
You have to show her your good qualities

345
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,860
and exude your charm.

346
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,050
I'm actually

347
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,880
not tired at all.

348
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,380
Fu,

349
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,350
you are so tired that your neck cramps.

350
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,990
I think it's quite serious.

351
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,130
Why don't you lie down for a while?

352
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,170
Then I'll give you a massage.

353
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,610
I'm fine.

354
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,320
Well...

355
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,050
I just want to know the details

356
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,170
of the next show.

357
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,990
As you know,

358
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
I'm dedicated.

359
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,900
I will send you the schedule of the next recording

360
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,130
in advance.

361
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:53,960
By the way...

362
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,250
Will you watch it with us when the show airs?

363
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,110
If I have class that day...

364
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,290
Zhou Ziqian will be here with us...

365
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,470
What did you say?

366
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,690
I said yes.

367
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,900
When?

368
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,770
Do I need to bring anything?

369
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,520
It's far from your home.

370
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,230
And now it's raining so heavily.

371
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,770
I'm fine.

372
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,970
You really don't need to do anything else?

373
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,069
It's still early.

374
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,890
I think I can...

375
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,010
You've done enough.

376
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,670
Mr. Fu.

377
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,770
Our flat hasn't been this tidy in a long time.

378
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,560
Alright then.

379
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,080
Call me if you need any help.

380
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,370
You should go home now.

381
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,630
I'm leaving.

382
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,220
It's still early anyway.

383
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,460
I'll walk you a while.

384
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,520
You're kind of weird today.

385
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,570
In the past, if you saw our flat in such a mess,

386
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,510
you would just shake your head and sigh.

387
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,160
And you would say that our flat was a doghouse.

388
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,870
But

389
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,140
you actually helped us clean up today?

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,010
That's abnormal.

391
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,710
So are you feeling unsatisfied

392
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,790
with this?

393
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,290
How come?

394
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,500
Actually,

395
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,050
you've been unconditionally tolerating Rongrong and me

396
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,190
♫I'm just a little composer♫

397
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,530
since we were in school.

398
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,160
We always forgot to bring homework,

399
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,860
and you would hide your homework every time.

400
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,110
♫Only think whether it's worth it♫

401
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,600
Also said that you forgot to bring it.

402
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,290
And our head teacher

403
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,440
would never scold us harshly

404
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,570
because she liked you so much.

405
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,200
Then we went to college.

406
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,190
♫It will make you happier♫

407
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,420
You would travel long distances

408
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,520
to come to us.

409
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,170
♫I've been thinking about you lately♫

410
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,360
To make it easier for us,

411
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,520
we met at our school everytime time.

412
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,040
You are so busy with work.

413
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,280
♫You know I'm happy to hear you talk and you are happy to share♫

414
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,710
But as soon as I mentioned to you about letting you participate in the variety show,

415
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,130
you immediately agreed.

416
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,670
♫The way you look at me I can't help getting close to you♫

417
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,260
But I don't think any of this is a big deal.

418
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,610
Is it better for me

419
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,040
♫No one loves you as much as I do♫

420
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,500
to take the initiative?

421
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,670
As a friend,

422
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,550
shouldn't I take the initiative to maintain our friendship?

423
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,630
Maybe it's because

424
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,260
I don't want you

425
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,420
to be compromising for us all the time.

426
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,150
I want you to put yourself first

427
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,940
in every decision you make.

428
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,240
♫How many days I haven't kept in touch with you♫

429
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,730
Then why

430
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,550
Zhou Ziqian can...

431
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,430
♫Do you remember the conversations still♫

432
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,700
About the variety guest thing...

433
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,510
Why could you you be so direct with him？

434
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,780
♫Recall the scene when we first met♫

435
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,990
But you treated me

436
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,730
so differently.

437
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,950
You would be very careful to communicate with me.

438
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,610
♫Is there anything different to you♫

439
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,460
You kept your distance from me

440
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,300
when we were on the bus.

441
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,230
But you sat so close to Zhou Ziqian.

442
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,850
Don't we

443
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,340
know each other longer?

444
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,180
He...

445
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,210
He's just my little brother.

446
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,180
Last time Rongrong asked me

447
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,210
if I would be jealous?

448
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,000
Honestly,

449
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:12,990
I would.

450
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,780
As your friend,

451
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,370
I would.

452
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,910
So,

453
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,070
it's hard enough for you

454
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,450
to take care of other people's feelings

455
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,470
because of your job.

456
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,270
But you don't have to be like that

457
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,020
with us.

458
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:31,820
OK.

459
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,650
But you're suddenly saying this to me...

460
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,130
You're not trying to use me as a subject

461
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,990
to study

462
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,220
applied psychology, right?

463
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,180
You got me.

464
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,960
It's obvious.

465
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,170
You should go home now.

466
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,770
My car is right ahead.

467
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,460
Okay. Be careful.

468
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,870
I didn't treat them any differently, did I?

469
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,990
Even so,

470
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,390
it must be because

471
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,430
he's my brother.

472
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,770
That must be the case.

473
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,180
And no one can treat Zhou Ziqian calmly

474
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,620
all the time, right?

475
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,560
He's

476
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,640
so annoying.

477
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,360
[Boy, mole, fox and horse]

478
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,250
He didn't read

479
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,580
everything I wrote, did he?

480
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,450
I finished the book.

481
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,460
It's wonderful.

482
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,220
Thank you.

483
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,440
Each character in the book can correspond to each of us.

484
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,410
It seems that each character

485
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,080
starts as a lonely boy

486
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,010
and then meets his own friend.

487
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,540
You are as cute

488
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,300
as the mole.

489
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,500
But the difference is that he likes cakes

490
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,820
and you like egg tarts.

491
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,940
I always hear you talk about someone

492
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,850
who is very kind

493
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,360
or good at something.

494
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,720
But I don't know if anyone has ever told you that

495
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,590
you are also a very nice person.

496
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,110
You are the first friend I met when I came to Jiangyi.

497
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,780
It's nice to meet you.

498
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,120
Friend?

499
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,160
What are you reading?

500
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,620
Qiu, listen.

501
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
From today on,

502
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,480
Xu Wang and I are friends.

503
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,610
Weren't you friends before?

504
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,070
It's different.

505
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,710
Now this is a

506
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,390
certified friendship.

507
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,850
Do you have a crush on Xu Wang?

508
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,310
Yeah...

509
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,760
But,

510
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,820
shouldn't we

511
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,130
start as friends first?

512
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,690
And I didn't think that much about it.

513
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,920
I feel happy enough

514
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,990
to know such a person.

515
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,530
Qiu.

516
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,410
You may not know.

517
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,560
He is really nice.

518
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,630
He completely fulfilled all my fantasies about my boyfriend.

519
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,270
Tell me about it.

520
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,120
For example,

521
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,450
he is very gentle,

522
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,320
patient,

523
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,380
sincere to his friends

524
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,450
and serious about shooting.

525
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,300
But he's not a goody-goody,

526
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,260
he also has his own temper

527
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,800
when things go wrong.

528
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,110
Anyway, he's just perfect.

529
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,710
So how did you find out how you feel about him?

530
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,400
It should be similar

531
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,930
for everyone, shouldn't it?

532
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,290
I just

533
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,340
laugh a lot.

534
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,930
Laugh?

535
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,750
You just seemed happy every day before.

536
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,110
How did you start acting like this

537
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,060
after you got back from the skating rink?

538
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,200
Did something else happen

539
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,450
after that?

540
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,100
What's happened to you lately?

541
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:36,610
What?

542
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,370
Don't touch me.

543
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,190
Me?

544
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,500
Touch you?

545
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,730
It's different now.

546
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,170
We have to keep

547
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,210
our distance.

548
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,470
What are you talking about?

549
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,700
You're all here.

550
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,540
I bought some small goldfish

551
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,820
to put in our dorm room.

552
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,490
Does anyone want it?

553
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,290
Are they males or females?

554
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,690
I saw the fish seeds.

555
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,520
They should be females.

556
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,560
No...

557
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,910
Does their gender matter?

558
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,700
I'm different from you.

559
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,630
I've met someone I like.

560
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,910
I'll have to pay attention to that.

561
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,220
What are you mumbling about?

562
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,290
Could you be louder?

563
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,470
I said

564
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,920
I've met someone I like.

565
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,140
So suddenly?

566
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,180
Who is it?

567
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,790
Do we know her?

568
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,480
This...

569
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,050
It's a secret.

570
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,560
Seriously?

571
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,230
We know her.

572
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,320
You guys believe him?

573
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,730
You're keeping it a secret from us.

574
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,650
So we'll just have to trust him.

575
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,130
Is she pretty?

576
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,390
She is.

577
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,130
What's her personality like?

578
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,890
She's nice.

579
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,300
Long hair or short hair?

580
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,560
Is she tall or short?

581
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,680
Is she an athlete?

582
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,610
Male or female?

583
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,060
I...

584
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,160
Stop trying.

585
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,710
I won't tell you.

586
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,670
I'm going to the canteen.

587
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,440
Boring.

588
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,320
Who is

589
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,540
that girl?

590
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,440
Is there really such a girl?

591
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,340
Goldfish, anyone?

592
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:21,800
[Ji Qiu]

593
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,500
By the way,

594
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,750
do you want to come and watch the first edition of the variety show

595
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,070
with us?

596
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,600
[Zhou Ziqian]

597
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,750
Watch it together?

598
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,420
[Ji Qiu: It will be more interesting for us to watch it together.]

599
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:32,850
What's the matter?

600
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,710
Nothing.

601
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,430
Just eat here.

602
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,250
Then you go ahead.

603
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,780
It's a bit crowded.

604
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,450
I'll go over there.

605
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,290
Wait.

606
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,960
I just happen to have something to ask you.

607
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,860
Aren't you going to Jiangxia City in the next two days?

608
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,280
When is your next recording?

609
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,190
I'll prepare in advance.

610
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,410
Well...

611
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,940
You also think it's quite hard

612
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,910
to participate in the recording, right?

613
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,680
You can...

614
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,300
No.

615
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,530
I think it's quite interesting.

616
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,450
And I think everyone is so nice.

617
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,020
Especially Ji Qiu.

618
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,120
I heard you knew each other before.

619
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,820
She told me a lot about you.

620
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,260
About me?

621
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,990
What did she say to you?

622
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,390
She said

623
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,620
you were her little brother since you were kids.

624
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,950
You two are very close.

625
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,150
Just brother?

626
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,510
-Yeah. -Fish Flavoured Shredded Pork with rice?

627
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,570
You're closer than that.

628
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,650
Something is wrong.

629
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,820
Zhou Ziqian usually keeps his distance from even a fish.

630
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,890
How come he doesn't walk away

631
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,870
when that girl is sitting across from him?

632
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,450
We just asked him so many times.

633
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,910
He didn't even tell us.

634
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:55,870
There's must be something...

635
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,840
between them.

636
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,390
[Friendly reminder: Don't fix your hair in front of the camera next time.]

637
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,570
[That's silly.]

638
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,780
[I'm not stupid. I'm handsome, okay?]

639
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,080
Look.

640
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,930
He is smiling.

641
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,280
He is smiling like this in front of Miss Cheng.

642
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,460
It's too obvious.

643
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,940
He wasn't like this

644
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,660
before Cheng Jia came.

645
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,740
It's only been a few days.

646
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,550
That girl

647
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,900
must be...

648
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,710
Cheng Jia.

649
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,520
Just say what you want.

650
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,030
I already know

651
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,050
everything.

652
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,670
I know

653
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,780
who that girl is.

654
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:45,910
So soon?

655
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,520
I'm so smart,

656
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,640
of course I can find out.

657
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,340
Isn't that her?

658
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,690
We all know her.

659
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,180
Isn't this most likely

660
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,440
her?

661
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,090
Is it that obvious?

662
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,920
Yep.

663
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,340
Actually, she doesn't know it yet.

664
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,820
Don't tell anyone.

665
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,020
Don't worry.

666
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,030
It

667
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,000
depends on you.

668
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,480
These are the cakes that Song Rongrong brought yesterday, right?

669
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:16,830
Yes.

670
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,850
I've already finished mine.

671
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,270
Just take it.

672
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,030
I don't like it.

673
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,650
Don't waste it.

674
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,380
Good.

675
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,410
Are you sure you're the only one who knows?

676
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,450
Of course.

677
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,510
Who else in our shooting team

678
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,500
can be as smart as me?

679
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,860
No one.

680
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,350
That's good.

681
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,460
Your shoes

682
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,300
are pretty good.

683
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,600
You're...

684
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,030
You disagree?

685
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,350
Fine.

686
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,370
I'll

687
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,300
talk to them then.

688
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,550
After all,

689
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,110
it's hard to get them to keep your secret.

690
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,990
Wait, we...

691
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,490
we can

692
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,680
discuss on that.

693
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,710
Good.

694
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,620
But I'm afraid

695
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,960
these cakes won't be enough.

696
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,300
Your shoes

697
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,640
don't quite fit me.

698
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,790
I have used my football

699
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,950
for a long time.

700
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,020
I have one at home

701
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,220
that I've wanted to give you for a long time.

702
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,870
By the way,

703
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,630
I know you bought a game console a while ago.

704
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,890
I've been wanting to buy one,

705
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,770
but haven't had the time.

706
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,520
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

707
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,210
You can use mine.

708
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,070
You can give it back to me

709
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,720
anytime.

710
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,790
Or you can

711
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,450
keep it.

712
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,340
I think the sweater Ji Qiu bought for you last time...

713
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,020
No.

714
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,880
Absolutely not.

715
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,030
You said no?

716
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,630
Anything other than this.

717
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,680
Then

718
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,210
I will...

719
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:52,700
Do you have to...

720
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,680
let others know that you like Cheng Jia.

721
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,110
Cheng Jia?

722
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,130
Cheng Jia.

723
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,860
I'm the only one who knows

724
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,290
your feeling for Cheng Jia.

725
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,430
I'm really going to tell them.

726
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,150
Do as you please.

727
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,290
You...

728
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,580
Clean up the shoes and send them back to me tomorrow.

729
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,320
Hey...

730
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,370
Why did you change your mind so soon?

731
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,580
Aren't you afraid I'll tell someone else?

732
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,880
What about my dinner?

733
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,240
Are you going to send these to Xu Wang?

734
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,110
Yes.

735
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,000
How many days have you been doing this?

736
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,920
Did it work?

737
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,700
You don't understand.

738
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,710
I'm not the kind of person

739
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,540
who is impressive.

740
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,550
But if I appear in front of a person

741
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,040
every day,

742
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,270
he may remember me.

743
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:43,950
Xu Wang!

744
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,120

here for you.

Pretty good.

779
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,370
But there is still room for improvement.

780
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,950
For example,

781
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,900
delete the bet section...

782
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,130
Not bad.

783
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,250
It would be better

784
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,620
if there were more games

785
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,920
like rock-paper-scissors.

786
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,500
I didn't ask you two.

787
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,870
What do you think, Rongrong?

788
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,610
I have a serious question.

789
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,040
Qiu,

790
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,230
When will the next episode broadcast?

791
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,840
I am looking forward to watching the next episode.

792
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,580
We recorded two episodes last time.

793
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,290
The second episode will be aired next weekend.

794
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,420
What about the other episodes?

795
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,100
We'll record them next time.

796
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,930
But not so soon.

797
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,110
With our relationship...

798
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,500
Can you tell me something

799
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,070
before the next recording?

800
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,950
What do you mean by

801
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,650
our relationship?

802
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,840
We...

803
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,970
are...

804
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,020
very close.

805
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,220
No way.

806
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,680
My professional integrity always comes first.

807
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,250
Right.

808
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,960
I think Ji Qiu is right.

809
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,590
Don't tell me anything

810
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,940
about the next recording.

811
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,070
Freshness is important.

812
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,620
So next time

813
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,510
we continue to sleep together.

814
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,600
Will you really think so?

815
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,929
I've thought about it.

816
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,620
Well...

817
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,540
It's good

818
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,679
to have us prepared in advance.

819
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,590
A lot of things are unknown before the show airs.

820
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,900
It's useless for you to ask me now.

821
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,610
Well, Qiu.

822
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,840
Do you have an autographed photo

823
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:31,830
of Xiao Chen?

824
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,179
My colleague admires him very much.

825
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,800
I want to bring her one.

826
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,090
I've asked for two in advance.

827
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,850
I'm so smart, right?

828
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,810
Qiu, you're awesome.

829
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,370
You asked for his autograph?

830
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,679
Why didn't you ask me for it?

831
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,630
To use your autograph

832
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,730
as a bookmark?

833
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,159
You girls all like Xiao Chen's type, right?

834
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,219
Not really.

835
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,900
I like someone who...

836
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,190
Don't you have an ideal type?

837
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:01,950
You don't have?

838
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,050
Think about it.

839
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,460
For example...

840
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,900
Handsome?

841
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,540
Mature?

842
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,220
Warm?

843
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:12,880
Reliable?

844
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,770
Young?

845
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:15,550
Old?

846
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,720
What are you talking about?

847
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,780
There is no standard for such thing.

848
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,950
But...

849
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,740
Those two boys at the skating rink last time were pretty good,

850
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,520
right?

851
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,530
I think so too.

852
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,510
They are just very ordinary.

853
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,290
Besides,

854
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,660
how could you hold hands with him

855
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,470
when you first met?

856
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,570
What does it matter to you

857
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,310
who she held hands with anyone?

858
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,370
Who did you hold hands with?

859
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,000
What's wrong with it?

860
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,400
It's dangerous.

861
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,040
What if...

862
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,330
What if he's a bad guy?

863
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,710
I agree with him this time.

864
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,190
It's good to be vigilant.

865
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,000
Mr. Fu is right.

866
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,880
But they are so handsome.

867
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,540
I don't think they're bad guys.

868
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,060
Studies have shown that

869
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,590
good-looking people are generally unreliable.

870
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,810
Except me.

871
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,090
And me.

872
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,730
Rongrong, have some potato chips.

873
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,340
Hello?

874
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,090
Is it so urgent?

875
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,880
Okay, I'll go back now.

876
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,560
Something urgent came up in the consultation room.

877
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,070
I have to go back now.

878
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,270
Is it that urgent?

879
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,730
Yeah.

880
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,290
Mr. Fu.

881
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,440
Take care.

882
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,170
Be careful.

883
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,680
The mineral water is gone.

884
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:49,870
Ji Qiu,

885
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,620
let's go get it.

886
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:52,870
And try the kind of popsicles

887
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,670
we used to eat when we were kids.

888
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,220
Okay.

889
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,590
Do you want to go with us, Rongrong?

890
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,710
I have to write the interview for tomorrow.

891
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,810
But I can go eat first and then come back to you.

892
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,100
Rongrong,

893
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,610
work is more important.

894
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,490
How can you let something like buying popsicles

895
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,850
get in the way of your work?

896
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,830
I want to have one.

897
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,550
Don't worry.

898
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,550
We'll get it for you.

899
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,160
Go for it, Rongrong.

900
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,220
Won't it melt

901
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,080
when you come back?

902
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,270
It tastes exactly the same as it did before.

903
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,000
Right?

904
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,020
Ji Qiu.

905
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,190
This way.

906
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,600
My flat is this way.

907
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,980
It's still early.

908
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,930
Since we've all bought popsicles,

909
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,830
why don't we go to the playground we used to go?

910
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,120
Let's go.

911
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,290
Now?

912
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:49,980
Yes.

913
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,080
Look at my clothes.

914
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,150
Pretty good.

915
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,890
No.

916
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,360
No.

917
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,280
Didn't you say before that it depends on the mood?

918
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,010
Why do you start caring about your clothes now?

919
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,100
Ji Qiu.

920
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,420
Did you enjoy

921
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,280
watching the variety show today?

922
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,100
Yep.

923
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,070
But...

924
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,500
Alright, let's go.

925
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,830
Just think of it

926
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,130
as me kidnapping you.

927
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,470
♫Oh. Love me. Love me♫

928
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,840
♫You are my only one in this colorful world♫

929
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,240
♫You are the only exclusive secret that entered my heart♫

930
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,960
♫Oh. Kiss me. Kiss me♫

931
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,350
♫Just one of your expressions can make me fall in love with you♫

932
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,720
♫I'm afraid I'll only meet this once in my life♫

933
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,000
♫26℃ in a summer night♫

934
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,430
♫You will always remember the most profound kiss♫

935
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,830
♫Others are jealous that I got you♫

936
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,040
♫I am very impressed with the taste of your lipstick♫

937
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,700
♫The long summer is your eyes♫

938
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,030
♫Your friends are all your decorations♫

939
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,710
♫You are pure air without carbon dioxide♫

940
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,820
♫And the summer sweetheart that I fantasize about dominating♫

941
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,590
♫I will warn anyone who wants to approach you again and again♫

942
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:23,230
♫You are the pink carbonated drink that only belongs to me♫

943
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:23,980
Ji Qiu.

944
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,830
♫My thoughts about you are never complicated♫

945
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,610
I wish you a good dream tonight.

946
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,410
♫Because you are my pink soda♫

947
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,730
♫Popping bubbles flowed down my throat♫

948
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,330
I will grow up with you together.

949
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,860
♫Like the blooming plush of a flamingo♫

950
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,510
♫Oh. Love me. Love me♫

951
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,020
I used to think the results were more important.

952
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,950
♫You are my only one in this colorful world♫

953
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,680
Later I realized that

954
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:42,040
♫You are the only exclusive secret that entered my heart♫

955
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,880
the process is actually very important.

956
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,960
♫Oh. Kiss me. Kiss me♫

957
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,380
♫Just one of your expressions can make me fall in love with you♫

958
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,540
We didn't have a good time at the amusement park last time we came together.

959
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,840
♫I'm afraid I'll only meet this once in my life♫

960
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,540
Today let's have a good time

961
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,140
to make up for the regret of last time.
