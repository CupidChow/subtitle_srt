505
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,040
let it do the talking, okay?

506
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,170
Stop crying. Stop crying.

507
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,760
You won't look good if you keep crying.

508
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,570
Ji Qiu,

509
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,060
♫Am I the shining star?♫

510
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,340
can you stop crying?

511
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,100
Ji Qiu.

512
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,720
♫Are you fond of me?♫

513
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:33,460
♫You just stepped in sight, with your sparkly eyes♫

514
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,840
Ji Qiu.

515
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,140
Stop crying, Ji Qiu.

516
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,890
Why are you still crying?

517
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,610
Ji Qiu.

518
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,920
♫Am I falling for you?♫

519
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,870
Why are you crying?

520
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,260
Stop crying, Ji Qiu.

521
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,380
♫Do you feel the same?♫

522
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,890
Stop crying. Stop crying.

523
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,840
♫We just soaked in the fire, as no one would care♫

524
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,420
Ji Qiu.

525
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,530
♫You hold me so tight♫

526
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,770
Ji Qiu, you're smiling.

527
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,110
♫Like I would slip away♫

528
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,060
♫The best encounter has arrived♫

529
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,050
Ji Qiu smiled.

530
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,300
♫I'm thrilled to say the word♫

531
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,270
Wow.

532
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,820
Ji Qiu, you're so good.

533
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,920
You can eat one at a time.

534
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,640
It's all Zhou Ziqian's fault today.

535
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,110
He is childish

536
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,050
and boring.

537
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,400
And he always pisses you off.

538
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,210
He's not cute at all.

539
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,640
Do you think so?

540
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,950
I think you're right.

541
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,520
But sometimes he's quite cute.

542
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,890
Right?

543
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,990
Ji Qiu.

544
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,080
I knew it.

545
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,880
How could you not praise yourself?

546
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,850
Why are you suddenly in my office today?

547
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,600
I saw Zheng Hui's moments,

548
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,230
and I found that you've been working overtime every day.

549
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,730
I thought I'd stop by and treat you to a nice dinner,

550
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,970
you would be happy.

551
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,890
But I didn't expect you to cry

552
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,630
when you saw me.

553
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,680
I was a little flattered.

554
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,860
I've been holding up pretty well.

555
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,210
I hardly ever cry.

556
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,140
But...

557
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,990
Why can't you cry?

558
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,880
Why can't I cry?

559
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,500
Isn't it normal to cry

560
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,770
when you're say, angry

561
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,460
and stressed?

562
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,840
Don't worry.

563
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,880
Ji Qiu, your nose didn't even run

564
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,130
when you cried.

565
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,190
You still look so good.

566
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,820
So don't be afraid to cry anymore.

567
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,290
I'm warning you.

568
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,600
Don't say anything

569
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,210
about tonight.

570
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,640
Tonight?

571
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,340
What was it?

572
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,490
I was going to treat you to a big dinner.

573
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,870
As a result, we only had

574
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,550
some Oden.

575
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,550
Ji Qiu,

576
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,740
on the field,

577
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,710
we all stick to

578
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,100
the last second.

579
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,090
Because we don't know

580
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,460
what the next shot's gonna be.

581
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,140
I still remember when I first came back,

582
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,180
the first day I met you,

583
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,330
you tried

584
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,480
again and again.

585
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,980
So you were really following me?

586
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,680
You caught me.

587
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,730
So you've been out there looking at me in disgrace

588
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,630
for a long time?

589
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,310
It was just for a second.

590
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,010
Ji Qiu,

591
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,830
I mean

592
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,090
whatever happens, it will pass.

593
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,510
6. Last time and this time.

594
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,190
I am a person who never loses face.

595
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,910
Why do you always see me being embarrassed?

596
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,530
We got through it last time, and we can get through it this time.

597
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,690
But don't worry.

598
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,910
I didn't let you down last time

599
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,910
and I won't let you down this time.

600
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,290
Wow.

601
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,380
Ji Qiu, why are you so good?

602
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,290
Childish.

603
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,710
Did you hear that? She said you were childish.

604
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,760
I was talking about you.

605
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,680
This is for you.

606
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,690
You're about to leave Zhou Ziqian,

609

But you're about to have Ji Qiu,

610

a beautiful and strong sister.

611
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,210

612
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,660
Yes.

♫I've thought about it many times♫

617
