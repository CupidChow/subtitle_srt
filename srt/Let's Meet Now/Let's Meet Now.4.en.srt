I don't know what the result will be,

I'll stay out of this.

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,800
It used to be able to last for a day.

173
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,830
Young lady,

174
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,290
You're still out at this hour.

175
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,900
Who are you?

176
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,180
Why should I tell you?

177
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,940
Let's be friends.

178
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,090
Uncle.

179
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,800
Go home if you're drunk.

180
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,180
Stop walking around.

181
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,710
Don't call me uncle.

182
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,540
Call me brother.

183
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,600
Drink with me.

184
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,900
I'll call the police if you keep doing this.

185
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,920
What police?

186
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,580
Hey.

187
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,580
I told you to wait here.

188
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,170
There's only strawberry flavor left.

189
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,050
Do you want some?

190
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,410
Yes.

191
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,630
You're friends?

192
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,660
Let's go.

Let's be friends next time.

196
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,440
Take care.

197
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,090
Thank you.

198
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,610
You're welcome.

199
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,940
I remember you.

200
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,230
Thank you for guiding me this morning.

201
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,360
Here's your ice cream.

202
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,820
It's just an ice cream. My treat.

203
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,200
It's getting late.

204
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,880
You'd better go home now.

205
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,270
Okay.

206
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,960
Is your house far from here?

207
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,990
It's at the intersection ahead.

208
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,690
I have an appointment.

209
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,850
I have to wait for him here.

Well,

00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,940
it's just a Chinese competition.

226
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,820
I've seen all kinds of big events.

Don't worry.

Did you participate in other competitions?

No.

230
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,920
But someone said

231
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,620
you need to forget everything before going on stage

232
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,690
and ignore the influence caused by this.

233
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,700
That's the best way to play.

234
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,150
Who said that?

235
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,170
Zhou Ziqian.

236
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,830
How brilliant he is!

237
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,590
That's my classmate.

238
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,450
You can go back to work.

239
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,430
I'll go by myself. Bye.

240

I think

241
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,700
I have met this guy before.

242
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,410
Yes.

243
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,500
He's the top student in our class.

244
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,900
Are you close?

245
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,040
Yes.

246
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,090
We are classmates.

247
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,130
I have to go. Bye.

248
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,290
Zhou Yubei.

249
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,640
He didn't look like a good student to me last time.

250
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,210
But now,

251
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,720
I found him more annoying.

252
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,880
And his surname is Zhou.

253
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,430
It sounds even more unreliable.

254
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,390
Zhou Yubei.

255
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,390
Why are you also in this Chinese competition?

256
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,690
Why didn't you tell me?

257
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,430
Why should I?

258
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,470
To help each other.

259
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,420
Did you bring your pass?

260
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,640
Did you bring the pen?

261
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,020
Did you bring the spare pen?

262
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,210
If I asked you in advance,

263
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,520
you can check it in advance.

264
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,090
If you forgot anything,

265
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,100
I can lend it to you.

266
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,540
Don't I need to lend it to you?

267
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,630
How is that possible?

268
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,910
I have everything with me.

269
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,060
There's more than an hour before the exam.

270
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,270
Why are you here so early?

271
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,150
Aren't you here, too?

272
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,220
My brother works here.

273
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,410
So he brought me here.

274
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,040
Did your brother send you here, too?

275
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,100
Your brother is unreliable.

276
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,110
Everybody knows that.

277
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,640
You're right.

281
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,030
You always look mature.

282
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,280
Yet, you're still forgetful.

283
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,460
You're too young to be mature.

284
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,010
At the critical moment,

285
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,780
you have to rely on me.

286
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,670
I remember I brought it.

287
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,540
Where's my pen?

288
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,800
Why can't I find one of them?

289
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,050
Didn't you say you...

290
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,470

00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,100
Why does it take so long to borrow a pen?

294
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,330
I'm not familiar with this place.

295
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,860
I don't know where the stationery store is.

296
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,780
If I miss the exam because of a pen,

297
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,690
it's not only miserable but also embarrassing.

298
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,320
If I embarrass myself,

299
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,460
I'll embarrass our class.

300
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,850
If our class is embarrased,

301
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,920
it means you will be embarrassed, right?

302
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,530

In the past two years,

what's been attracting the audiences is not love story

406

but the competition among female guests

407
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,960
and the fight among male guests.

408
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,620
As for high audience ratings,

409
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,760
it's more likely that the audience came to complain about it.

Apart from the name of the show,

411
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,329
there's nothing else about love.

412

This kind of show came out early

413

419
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,390
I think it's because the same gender knows more about themselves.

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,120
This is the first time I've seen him.

505
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,370
A new classmate.

506
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,610
Please introduce yourself.

507
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,580
I...

508
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,020
I heard that Mr. Fu's class is very good.

509
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,860
Someone specially recommended me to take your class.

510
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,790
Really?

511
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,440
What do you think now?

512
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,620
I think it's great.

513
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,120
Especially the atmosphere in class.

514
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,350
I just gave a feedback to the recommender.

515
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,920
Mr. Fu's class is very popular.

516
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,370
Especially...

517
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,800
Especially...

518
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,780
It's especially popular among girls.

519
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:02,930
Sit down.

520
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,530
Listen to the lecture carefully.

521
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,210
I will treat you equally.

522
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,280
I think you're done.

523
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,170
Done?

524
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,950
Why?

525
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,940
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

526
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,400
Is it that obvious?

527
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,290
Isn't it obvious?

528
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,940
You asked me 13 questions in the class.

529
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,190
13 times in one class?

530
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,490
I never sat down ever since I stood up.

531
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,430
You sneaked in during my class.

532
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,380
You already broke the rule.

533
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,050
Can't I ask you questions like I usually do?

534
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,760
I didn't say anything.

535
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,410
Speaking of which,

536
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,480
Mr. Fu's class

537
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,250
is really popular among female students.

538
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,460
I saw that most of them are girls.

539
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,830
There are many girls in psychology faculty.

540
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,480
You have a problem?

541
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,320
Of course not.

542
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,570
You don't have a problem with me, do you?

543
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,670
I have an appointment tonight.

544
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,780
If you want to see around the school,

545
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,610
suit yourself.

546
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,700
I'm leaving.

547
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,840
Are you trying to avoid me?

548
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,050
Do you look like

549
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,480
you have an appointment?

550
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,570
I have an appointment with Ji Qiu.

551
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,140
Suit yourself.

552
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,410
Let's go. Why did you stop?

553
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,130
Why are you following me?

554
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,880
No, I didn't.

555
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,400
I'm going this way too.

556
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,600
You first.

557
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,590
No, I respect the old.

558
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,570
Why are you nervous?

559
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,750
Why are you feeling guilty?

560
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,230
I need to go to the office.

561
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,170
It's okay. I'll wait for you.

562
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,200
Only staff is allowed in our office.

563
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,330
It's okay. I'll wait for you outside.

564
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,600
Mr. Fu.

565
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,090
You have a date tonight?

566
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,220
[-Don't text me unless necessary! -Okay.]

567
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,440
Don't forget about dinner tonight.

568
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,140
Yes.

569
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,460
Zhou Ziqian.

570
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,180
You know him?

571
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,730
Yes.

572
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,880
That famous shooting anthlete.

573
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,420
I have to go.

574
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,090
See you tomorrow.

575
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,420
[Zhou Ziqian: I queued up for half an hour to buy it. There are too many people in Jiangcheng University.]

576
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,730
They seem to be arguing.

577
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,020
[Fu Qile Zhou Ziqian]

578
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,920
But somehow it's harmonious.

579
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,210
This is called tacit understanding?

580
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,030
I didn't know this before.

581
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,320
Ji Qiu,

582
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,800
Look at this kind of TV show.

583
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,310
We don't have this in China, do we?

584
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,120
Do you have any reference?

585
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,890
Yes. I'll find it for you later.

586
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,600
Look, this is it.

587
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,520
♫Life comes up and life comes down♫

588
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,030
♫ Got me thinking of my old days♫

589
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,140

♫I used to be the one who calls my folks around♫

592
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,950
Miss Ji, we are leaving.

593
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,820
♫I used to be a boy who loved to sing a song♫

594
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:30,860
Get some rest.

00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,870
Take care.

596
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,400
Okay.

597
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,980

♫You are all my treasure♫

605
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,140

♫Some of them left, some of them stay♫

607

♫Some of them stay♫

609

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,290

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,440
♫Would you stay?♫

612
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,030
I lost track of time.

613
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,090
I'm coming back now.

614
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,880
Why are you here?

615
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,500
He followed me here from school.

616
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,290
I can't get rid of him.

617
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,680
Who's following you?

618
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,160
Why you can come and I can't?

619
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,010
Then why are you here?

620
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,050
Since we graduated from university,

621
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,300
we gather every half a month.

622
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,120
Then I'm going to join it, too.

623
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,640
Don't you think you understand each other in a tacit way?

624
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,490
No.

625
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,810
I think so, too.

626
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,380
Since when

627
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,310
did you two become so close?

628
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,210
No, we didn't.

629
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,490
Why did you go to Jiangcheng University today?

630
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,670
To deliver something

631
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,290
and take Mr. Fu's class.

632
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,760
That scene.

633
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,770
What about it?

634
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,590
Most girls go for Mr. Fu.

635
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,350
I didn't expect Mr. Fu to be so popular.

636
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,190
No way.

637
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,130
But after Mr. Zhou came in,

638
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,200
the students who were attentive to the class

639
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,400
looked back from time to time.

640
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,630
Speaking of being popular,

641
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,640
Mr. Zhou is more attractive to girls.

642
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,530
No, no.

643
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,190
Mr. Fu is more handsome.

644
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,060
Mr. Zhou, you are so modest.

645
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,580
You are exactly what girls would like.

646
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
I know that.

647
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,670
But I didn't expect

648
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,420
I'm also this handsome in your eyes.

649
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,440
You still don't admit that you have a tacit understanding?

650
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,940
Is it popular now to give each other compliment?

651
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,560
I heard from Rongrong that

652
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,720
you've been working overtime lately.

653
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:46,830
Are you busy?

654
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,570
I'm planning a new show.

655
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,280
But no matter how hard I try,

656
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,450
I can't come up with any good idea.

657
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,950
Do you have any ideas?

658
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:54,990
Anything.

659
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,950
Maybe you can give me some inspiration.

660
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,130
A show?

661
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,530
I think when a few people sit together

662
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,300
and talk about psychology,

663
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,620
economics and modern medicine,

664
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,900
isn't it quite interesting?

665
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,930
Is this a show?

666
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,170
It's hypnosis, right?

667
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,250
Only those who don't study well think so.

668
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,300
I think

669
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,640
we should set the venue in the shooting gallery.

670
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,210
A group of young people shoot together.

671
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:18,920
How passionate.

672
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,590
You can invite some best actors or best actresses.

673
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,290
I'll be their shooting guide.

674
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,890
Boring.

675
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,590
Is your idea fun?

676
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,390
It's more interesting

677
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,430
to watch people play mahjong than to watch your show.

678
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,340
What about yours?

679
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,190
Shooting?

680
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,660
Isn't it more convenient to hold a competition directly?

681
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,430
Are you objecting on purpose?

682
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,930
You shouldn't have asked them.

683
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,300
They are unreliable.

684
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:38,920
Exactly.

685
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,250
In my opinion,

686
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,230
we should find a bunch of handsome guys

687
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,610
and form a two-people system...

688
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,600
You're no better than them.

689
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,750
How about this?

690
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,610
Let's play a game.

691
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,500
Qiu will take the idea of whoever that wins.

692
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,450
What game?

693
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,220
Ta-da!

694
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,940
If you turn your head in a different direction from your hand, you win.

695
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,700
I think this is good.

696
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,030
The loser will dance.

697
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,000
Deal.

698
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:19,510
Dance.

699
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,750
Fine.

700
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,080
♫I have a special hobby♫

701
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,020
♫I'd write a song when I miss you♫

702
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,960
♫Maybe I speak without thinking♫

703
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,800
♫But I love you more than what I expressed♫

704

♫Give me a nameless ticket♫

705

♫Let me get on the train to your heart♫

706
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,150
♫I've had a dream since I met you♫

707
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,800
♫In the dream I'm singing this song♫

708
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,770
♫I'm singing in the galaxy and in the wind♫

709
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,520
♫I dreamt of all the heart-pounding moments♫

710
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,650
♫How many times do I have to tell you this is not the point♫

711
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,610
I think I know.

712
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,850
Know what?

713
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,170
♫The point is I'm in love with your face♫

714
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,320
The show I want to do.

715
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,660
♫I like it warmer so I don't like winter♫

716
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,970
That's the feeling.

717
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,590
♫I dreamt of all the heart-pounding moments♫

♫How many times do I have to tell you this is not the point♫

♫The point is I'm in love with your face♫

720
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,430
♫I like it warmer so I don't like winter♫

721
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,340
♫Given that you are by my side♫

722
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,970
♫On the day I met you♫

723
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,670
♫All the stores are vending love♫

724
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:47,870
What do you think?

725
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,370
What do you mean?

726
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,930
You've been working overtime for days, but you don't know what to do.

727
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,330
Do you have any idea now?

728
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,930
About work,

729
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,330
you need to be serious and also relaxed.

730
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,850
Or else, you're still upset about it.

731
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,310
By the way, Ji Qiu,

732
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,690
what about you?

733
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,430
♫I'm just a little composer♫

734
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,570
What kind of show

735
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,570
do you want?

736
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,140
I want to

737
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,750
present a show with a sense of belonging.

738
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,380
I hope in my show,

739
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,170
♫Only think whether it's worth it♫

740
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,720
people may have different occupations

741
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,170
and different personalities

742
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,720
with different age,

743
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,910
but they can

744
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,110
let their guard down.

745
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,600
No matter what they say or do,

746
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,620
♫It will make you happier♫

747
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,360
it's all real reaction.

748
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,390
Their WeChat group

749
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:46,330
♫I've been thinking about you lately♫

750
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,120
will be the one that stops people from muting it.

751
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,330
They always give each other a sense of security.

752
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,580
♫You know I'm happy to hear you talk and you are happy to share♫

753
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,900
They have advantages

754
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,220
and weaknesses.

755
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,850
Some are introverted.

756
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,720
♫The way you look at me I can't help getting close to you♫

757
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,300
Some are sharp-tongued.

758
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,640
But they...

759
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:02,020
♫No one loves you as much as I do♫

760
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,050
won't doubt you

761
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,350
just because you missed one or two events.

762
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,520
They won't kidnap you emotionally.

763
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,240
Wherever they are together attracting each other,

764
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,650
there will be the sense of belonging.

765
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,320
They are like stars.

766
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,340
Everyone is independent and glows.

767
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,520
But only when they are together,

768
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,200
they shine the best.

769
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,320
♫How many days I haven't kept in touch with you♫

♫Recall the scene when we first met♫

It's so big.

Thank goodness I came with you.

779
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,020
Otherwise, you must be scared.

780
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,010
I'm scared?

781
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,460
Weren't you afraid of the dark when you were little?

782
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,870
Not anymore?

783
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,650
It's okay if you are still afraid.

784
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,000
I'll protect you.
