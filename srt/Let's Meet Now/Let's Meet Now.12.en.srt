What's wrong with her?

12
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,830
She's been like this recently.

13
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,880
Is she in love?

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,320
I think so.

15
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,700
There's a competion today. I don't think he'll be here.

16
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,960
What if he is?

17
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,210
Are you here for Xu Wang?

18
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,789
How do you know?

19
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,310
Many girls came here

20
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,420
for him these days.

21
00:01:58,970 --> 00:01:59,670
Same with those girls.

22
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,770
Xu Wang is very popular now.

23
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,850
Thanks to him,

24
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,220
our business has improved a lot.

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,860
But he'll be in the competition soon.

26
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,840
He hasn't been here recently.

27
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,350
I see.

28
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,850
By the way,

29
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,730
have we met before?

30
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,050
I remember now.

31
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,520
You left early with Xu Wang that day.

32
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,680
Are you his sister?

33
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,930
I envy you for having such a good brother.

34
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,770
I'm not his sister.

35
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,540
Then, are you also here for...

36
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,480
No.

37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,470
I don't like him.

38
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,329
I'm his friend.

39
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,160
Yeah, just a friend.

40
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,480
I have to go. Bye.

41
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,180
Aren't you here to buy books?

42
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,500
Logically speaking,

43
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,410
Xu Wang is such a brilliant guy.

44
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,270
It's not surprising that so many people like him.

45
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,630
But why am I so unhappy?

46
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,320
No.

47
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,200
He must be training now.

48
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,350
I can't disturb him.

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,560
Not bad.

50
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,290
Remember how you feel today. Keep it till the competetion.

51
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,930
Everything will be fine.

52
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:26,860
Thank you, Coach.

53

Yu Nan,

54
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,780
did you find that

55
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,010
Zhang's eyes are sparkling when he looks at you lately?

56
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:40,840
Really?

57
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,950
Of course.

58
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,370
Last time this happened to him was when he looked at Zhou Ziqian.

59
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,610
Do you guys

60
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,890
have a secret

61
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,780
to make uncles like you so much?

62
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,890
I can't do that.

63
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,770
Every time he looks at me...

64
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,210
Gao Yuan.

65
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,860
What are you doing?

66
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,980
What do you think of my grades?

67
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,500
I think it's okay.

68
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,710
But I still have to

69
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,870
learn from you.

70
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,460
Coach,

71
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,370
what can I do for you?

72
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,700
I can tell you are doing nothing meaningful

73
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,380
the very moment I look at you.

74
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,040
Tell me.

75
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,110
Is it today that Zhou Ziqian should be coming back?

76
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,010
Yes, it's today.

77
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,870
He should still be on his way.

78
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,450
Thank goodness, it's finally over.

79
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,170
Our shooting went well.

80
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:25,940
That's true.

81
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,350
At least nothing went wrong.

82
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,170
We're fine.

83
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,000
Actually, it is you...

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,320
If you don't rest well,

85
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,380
your dark circles will get darker.

86
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,240
Come on, you two.

87
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,960
My bad. My bad.

88
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,730
I was just joking.

89
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,180
Sorry, it's taken.

90
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,190
She'll be here soon.

91
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,210
It's fine.

92
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,060
I'll sit here.

93
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,700
Ji Qiu.

94
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,750
Here.

95
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,570
It's a long journey. I won't take your space.

96
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,600
You'll feel more comfortable to have the seat to yourself.

97
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,570
He needs to be comfortable,

98
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,550
what about me?

99
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,970
Move over.

100
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,610
Give me some space.

101
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,040
What are you looking at?

102
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,990
Why didn't I notice

103
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,680
you've got so small eyes.

104
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,860
My eyes are small?

105
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,320
Smaller than mine.

106
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,270
Take a closer look.

107
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,400
♫I've thought about it many times♫

108
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,120
♫I have thrown away this charming and empty thing in vain♫

109
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,550
♫I pick up the pen and only remember your wish♫

110
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,060
Childish.

111
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,130
♫But my mother said boys can't be too sweet♫

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,610
♫I want to experience so many things with you♫

113
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,560
♫I wish I could have all the good and bad sides of you♫

114
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,140
♫I hope we can be the only light♫

115
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,710
♫That we can see in each other's eyes♫

116
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,330
Wow,

117
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,620
I like this one.

118
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,130
This is cute, too.

119
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,980
I'll bring one to Jiangjiang later.

120
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,730
Brother,

121
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,630
You brought me so many gifts this time.

122
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,090
You must be having fun recording.

123
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,409
Not bad.

124
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:55,750
Brother,

125
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,760
You took so many photos.

126
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,420
Why didn't you take some photos of Zhou Ziqian?

127
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,160
Let me ask you a very serious question.

128
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,120
Go ahead.

129
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,090
From a girl's point of view,

130
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,580
who is better

131
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,110
between me and Zhou Ziqian?

132
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,700
Brother.

133
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,530
It's so obvious.

134
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,820
My brother, you are so excellent

135
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,360
and a university lecturer.

136
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,440
You are knowledgeable.

137
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,400
Besides,

138
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,340
you don't social much.

139
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,340
You are very reliable.

140
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,570
And you've never had a girlfriend

141
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,960
since you were born.

142
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,960
You are pure.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,520
In general,

144
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,800
I choose Zhou Ziqian.

145
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:43,909
Why?

146
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,190
You don't need a reason to like someone.

147
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,490
Zhou Ziqian doesn't need anything special.

148
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,640
As long as he's on the court,

149
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,120
he's the best.

150
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,070
When he smiles,

151
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,970
I feel he can overcome all difficulties.

152
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,000
When he shoots on the court,

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,960
It's just...

154
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,800
Brother, aren't these all for me?

155
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:03,990
I changed my mind.

156
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,220
Don't be like this.

157
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,240
You don't even like them. What are you keeping them for?

158
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,780
I'll donote them.

159
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,910
What are you doing?

160
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,420
I'm so nervous. Tomorrow would be the competetion day.

161
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,010
But I heard from Zhou Ziqian that

162
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,370
it's not a big competition, just a warm-up test.

163
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,410
Why are you so nervous?

164
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,340
If you're so worried,

165
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,760
why don't you just call and ask?

166
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,980
No.

167
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,370
What if I disturbed him?

168
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,080
He took thing seriously.

169
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,480
Even if this is a small competition, he cares so much about it.

170
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,320

00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,010
Objectively speaking,

335
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,880
it should be out of psychological effect.

336
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,480
What do you think? Am I objective?

337
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,410
There's nothing wrong with him.

338
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,650
It should be a simple nervousness

339
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,440
that made him miss the last shot.

340
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,270
Wow.

341
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,860
Looks like I was subjective.

342
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,420
As long as there's nothing wrong with his mentality.

343
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,860
Where's Xu Wang?

344
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,550
I met him in the changing room.

345
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,850
He was in a bad mood.

346
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:47,900
I think

347
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,290
we need to leave him alone for a while.

348
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,100
So I came out first.

349
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,310
Alright, I know you were surprised.

350
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,870
I was more surprised than you were.

351
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,070
That was his last shot.

352
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,330
But he made such a big mistake.

353
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,850
Don't make that face.

354
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,070
It must be harder for Xu Wang.

355
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,660
I was just talking to Rongrong that...

356
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,970
Where's Rongrong?

357
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,600
Didn't she come out with you?

358
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,410
Yes.

359
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,780
But we lost her like in a second.

360
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,300
I need to make a call.

361
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,300
Wait.

362
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,120
Why don't you text Xu Wang

363
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,130
and ask him to bring the Rongrong back.

364
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,000
No way.

365
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
He's already so depressed.

366
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,680
There's something you didn't know.

367
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,170
Although Rongrong looks like she's slow,

368
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,850
but she has this special gift that

369

as long as you are with her,

371
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,940
you can never be too depressed.

372
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,330
Really?

373
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,340
Why do I become depressed

374
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,970
every time I see her?

375
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,000
Because

376
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,110
positive times positive gets negative?

377
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,030
I can't find the way out.

378
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,910
Let me take you out.

379
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,030
Let's sit for a while.

380
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,530
I'll take a rest.

381
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,240
I read a book recently.

382
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,620
But I always feel it's lying.

383
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,190
Because it says when someone is unhappy,

384
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,330
he doesn't need any friend.

385
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,190
What do you think?

386
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,020
It's a lie.

387
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,450
Do you think I'm not happy?

388
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,510
You didn't say it.

389

But it's all on your face.

I have failed in the last shot.

the last time this happened to you.

395

I couldn't tell you this.

We're friends.

503
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,240
It's normal.

504
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,230
I know.

505
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,040
Let's go.

506
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,180
But they said they would wait for us here.

507
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,110
What?

508
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,860
Surprise!

509
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,350
To celebrate Xu Wang winning the second place,

510
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,500
I paid a lot to purchase this bouquet of flowers.

511
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,240
You picked it on the street, didn't you?

512
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,820
♫I want to spend every summer with you♫

513
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,050
Ignore the details.

♫I want to kiss your face under the sunset♫

515

Thank you.

516
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,710
I'll give you candies.

♫I like to see you in a daze♫

518

No matter what the result is, as long as you participate,

519
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,310
♫It's the most special dependence♫

520
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,710
you'll be rewarded with candies when you were a kid, right?

00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,180
♫My promise to you will never be changed♫

522
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,820
You also deserve one.

523
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,920
♫I want to take a walk with you when flowers bloom♫

524

♫I want to hold your sleeves and sit by the sea♫

Here.

527
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,850
Thank you.

♫The wind blows your skirt and it starts dancing♫

529

I don't get one because I was not on the court?

530
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,870
♫You are my only one. I just want to be with you♫

531

You're lucky.

532
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,100
Here's one more.

533
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,780
♫The secret in the fragrance of flowers♫

534
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,490
♫How poetic this moment is♫

535
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,660
I've learned about the bonus

536
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,970
of the second place.

537
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,750
What should we have for dinner?

538
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,420
♫Can you be with me on rainy days?♫

539
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,510
I've booked a restaurant.

540
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,340
You can't escape this.

541

♫Can you stay with me forever?♫

542

-Is this... -Yeah.

543
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,410
Since you are the first one of Team Jiangyi

544
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,200
♫Can you take adventures with me?♫

545

to have won a bonus,

546
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,780
I asked Gao Yuan to book

547
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,030
a cheaper place.

548
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,770
♫To the end of the world♫

00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,910
I'll give you a day off tomorrow.

♫Can we never change?♫

552
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,980
If you treat us to play,

553
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,420
it would be better.

554

♫Hold your hand and take you to the mountain top to see shooting stars♫

How about the skating rink?

556
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,630
I think it's okay.

557
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,320

570

♫I've always believed♫

Gao Yuan.

[The journey continues]

582
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:32,950
That's it.

583
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,760
Add some sound effects.

584
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,920
It's almost like special effects.

585
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,530
Lin Xiao is so cute.

586
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,710
Ye Qiao got this amazing

587
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,720
lady style.

588
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,170
Zhou Ziqian and Fu Qile

589
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,040
sitting together, they make such a cute...

590
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,350
They are so cool.

591
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,580
What do you think?

592
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,630
Do you think

593
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,370
if there's anything else to modify?

594
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,320
I think most are fine.

595
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,950
But there are some noise.

596
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,320
I might need to fix it.

597
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,030
It's nothing.

598
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,570
Thank you.

599
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,590
See you.

600
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,980
Bye.

601
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,100
We've been worried for so many days.

602
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,820
We can finally rest assured.

603
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,370
This version is much better than the previous version.

604
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,130
The previous version

605
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,630
surprises people in every bad way.

606
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,330
They would edit a family dinner into a spy movie.

607
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,360
They maliciously made Ye Qiao look that way

608
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,500
in the last version.

609
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,820
Luckily we watched it in advance,

610
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,100
which left us some time to modify.

611
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,220
Otherwise, it would be total disaster.

612
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,740
But now the effect is not bad.

613
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,760
Everyone seemed unnatural in the beginning.

614
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,020
But people get used to it in the second half.

615
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,080
To be honest,

616
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,420
if it weren't for this recording,

617
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,710
I wouldn't have known

618
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,150
Lin Xiao has such a bold soul

619
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,490
in such a small body.

620
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,160
Ye Qiao is so cold.

621
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,450
But she often tells cold jokes.

622
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,640
We can finally be free for a while.

623
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,960
Shall we have dinner together tomorrow?

624
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,260
What do you think?

625
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,920
Hotpot or barbecue?

626
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,720
Anything is fine.

627
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,720
You guys go.

628
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,750
I have something to do tomorrow.

629
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,110
Something?

630
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,730
A date?

631
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,990
Sort of.

632
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,440
A man?

633
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:08,870
Yes.

634
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:09,950
Is he handsome?

635
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,460
Which one?

636
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,460
Me, of course.

637
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,140
The focus on the skating rink

638
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,290
has to be me.

639
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,420
I'm not bragging.

640
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,720
I used to skip class

641
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,600
and went skating in the skating rink.

642
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,490
Those days weren't for nothing.

643
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,260
Back then,

644
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,800
I was known as the prince of the skating rink.

645
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,270
All those years,

646
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,980
I've heard too much of

647
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,150
the girls' admiring screams.

648
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,160
You have never experienced it.

649
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,530
I'll show you later.

650
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,510
Little Prince.

651
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,090
Are you sure?

652
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,990
You don't know yet, do you?

653
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,130
The skating rink

654
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,010
has a nickname.

655
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,110
Does it?

656
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,550
The skating rink is also known as

657
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,860
a sacred place for dating couples.

658
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,330
Think about it.

659
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,710
Some physical contact

660
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,790
with gentle and patient guidance from time to time.

661
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,780
On the skating rink,

662
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,570
You hold my hand.

663
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,720
I hold yours.

664
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,170
What's the probability of the love story?

665
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,920
Don't worry.

666
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,880
Take your time.

667
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,110
I trust you.

668
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,660
Who is it?

669
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,300
I saw you smiling from afar.

670
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,020
What are you smiling about?

671
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,180
Nothing.

672
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,390
Nothing?

673
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,640
Can we go now?

674
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:47,980
It's almost time.

675
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,680
Let's go.

676
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,880
Ji Qiu,

677
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,650
Follow me if you don't know how.

678
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,130
That's right.

679
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,170
With our skills,

680
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,110
you can totally trust me.

681
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,040
Don't bother.

682
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,430
-I'll teach her. -I will.

683
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,190
-I will. -I will.

684
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,780
What's there to fight about?

685
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,740
Don't worry. You'll all get your chance.

686
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,540
Listen carefully.

687
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,850
Let me teach you some move first.

688
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,990
Watch your feet.

689
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,510
And then,

690
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,970
keep your balance on one foot.

691
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,230
OK.

692
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,480
Change to your left foot.

693
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,140
Try it.

694
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,780
Come on, try it.

695
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,510
We shouldn't have trusted them.

696
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:24,880
That's right.

697
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,280
What about the other leg?

698
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,960
Lift it up.

699
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,660
Right.

700
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,060
Keep it up,

701
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,920
and change to your other leg.

702
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,080
You are doing all right.

703
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,010
It's very standard.

704
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:33,970
You are very potential.

705
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:34,890
You all try it.

706
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,040
Where are you going?

707
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,440
Aren't you the prince of the skating rink?

708
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,570
Why do you have to drag us into this?

709
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,820
Can I go to the bathroom?

710
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,420
Don't you think I know what you are up to?

711
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,240
Didn't you just come back from the bathroom?

712
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,580
You don't undertand.

713
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,550
Together, we have more people and more power.

714
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,700
If we split up,

715
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,340
the girls' focus will be dispersed.

716
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,890
Right?

717
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,440
-Don't go. -Please teach us.

718
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,000
Don't worry.

719
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,590
I will teach you all today.

720
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,140
I didn't know he had this side.

721
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,830
It's Gao Yuan's style.

722
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,730
Tell me about it.

723
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,740
Stand properly. Yes.

724
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,730
Then kneel down and kick out.

725
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,020
It's called a  brake.

726
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,790
Or else, it'll be awkward if you hit someone, right?

727
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,150
Change your legs.

728
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,220
Focus on your right leg.

729
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,610
Yes, kick out.

730
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,990
Kick the snow.

731
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,680
Look. Like this.

732
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,500
Shovel it with your shoe.

733
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,950
I can forgive that they left us behind.

734
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,450
But Zhou Ziqian is showing off to me.

735
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,340
What did he say?

736
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,940
He said

737
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,420
look at these girls.

738
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,690
They're all fascinated with me.

739
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,310
Now, stand straight.

740
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,970
Put your weight in the middle of your legs.

741
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,220
Yes. And then?

742
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,340
Kneel.

743
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,940
And kick. That's right.

744
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,650
What did he say now?

745
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
He told us to go away.

746
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,640
-Why would he do that? -Let's continue.

747
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,630
-I'll bear this in mind and revenge. -Yes, stand straight.

748
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:52,790
Kneel.

749
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,030
What's wrong, are you having Parkinson's disease?

750
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,140
Come on, let's continue.

751
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,780
OK. Stand straight first.

752
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,310
Put your feet together.

753
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,530
Bend your knees and put your weight to one leg.

754
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,630
And the other leg

755
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,440
and slide out.

756
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,650
Yes, like this.

757
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,880
And dig a hole, OK?

758
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,450
Yes, make this circle.

759
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,660
Let's go. Look.

760
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,380
-Here comes the skating team of Jiangyi University. -This is so cool.

761
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,200
Hello.

762
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,530
May I ask

763
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,510
who they are?

764
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,920
They are from the skating team of Jiangyi University.

765
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,990
They often come here.

766
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,280
Most importantly, they are all handsome.

767
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,460
Qiu, I'll take you there.

768
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,900
Practice more.

769
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,070
Who's here?

770
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,290
The skating team from Jiangyi University is here.

771
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,350
What a grand scene!

772
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,340
Oh.

773
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,160
What's going on?

774
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,850
I'm so touched.

775
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,620
You are still here for me.

776
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,080
Don't  worry. I'll teach you everything I've learned.

777
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,130
Uncle.

778
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:02,480
What?

779
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,760
I'm not good at skating.

780
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,720
There's a group of handsome guys.

781
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,090
Can you help me there?

782
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,520
Uncle.

783
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,700
You'd better walk there by yourself.

784
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,370
You can do it.

785
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,230
Annoying.

786
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:18,730
Uncle.

787
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,970
It kinda suits you.

788
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,200
I don't think the girls are interested anymore.

789
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,050
Can I leave now?

790
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,600
Where are they?

791
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,430
To your left.

792
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,700
What are you doing?

793
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,810
Can't you tell?

794
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,320
Checking out the handsome guys.

795
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,510
Can you tell me

796
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,630
who they are?

797
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,520
These people

798
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,160
are from the skating team of Jiangyi University.

799
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,720
They always come here on Sunday.

800
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,150
Every time they come, it is the best time for business.

801
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,610
I heard they won an award for Jiangyi City.

802
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,110
But I think it's mainly because they are handsome.

803
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,900
How did you know?

804
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,120
That girl said it.

805
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,420
You have a good memory.

806
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,320
There's nothing wrong to make friends.

807
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,270
But it's too much

808
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,510
to make friends in groups.

809
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,350
Wow, they are really handsome.

810
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,250
They're so good at skating.

811
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,200
They are really professional.

812
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,940
And they look sunny and energetic.

813
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,900
Exactly.

814
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,770
Their moves are not standard.

815
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,620
Right.

816
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,950
They've only been studying for two days.

817
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,260
They are not that good.

818
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,230
They are just okay.

819
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,690
Can you move aside?

820
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,590
I can't see anything.

821
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,370
Ji Qiu,

822
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,260
I checked for you.

823
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,050
It's boring.

824
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:45,800
Let's go skating.

825
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,970
We don't know how to skate.

826
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,080
No, we are not going.

827
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,950
Do you want to play with us?

828
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,530
She said she didn't know how.

829
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,530
Can I?

830
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,140
Do you want to join us?

831
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,170
We have social phobia.

832
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,410
-It's very bad. -Yes.

833
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,240
Look.

834
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,810
He's very sick.

835
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,370
See you around.

836
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,460
Grape Ji.

837
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:15,870
You've gone too far.

838
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:17,600
You...

839
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,790
How can you

840
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,830
look at other boys like that?

841
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,520
What's worse is that you think other boys are handsome.

842
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:29,360
What does it have to do with you?

843
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,820
Why do you care so much?

844
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,230
I...

845
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:32,940
Because...

846
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,830
I...

847
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,790
Because Xu Wang is angry.

848
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,230
He was very angry.

849
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,040
Like I would believe what you said.

850
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,639
Get angry.

851
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,719
I'm angry.

852
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,580
If I were him, I would be angry too.

853
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,909
It's not easy that Xu Wang come to hang out with us.

854
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,480
But you didn't talk to us at all.

855
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,500
How can he not be angry?

856
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,520
Do you want to play now?

857

Okay. Let's go.

I'm going too.

860

What should I do if you leave, Rongrong?
