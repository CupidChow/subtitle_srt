(Exhuma)

2
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,159
Miss, we'll be landing soon.

3
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,128
Would you like
a glass of the same wine?

4
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,599
No, that's okay.

5
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,001
By the way,

6
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,536
I'm Korean.

7
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,905
Is that so? My apologies.

8
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,840
Have a comfortable flight.

9
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:07,394
The chairman's main business
is real estate.

10
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,830
He owns a ton of land in Korea

11
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,066
and has investments here too,

12
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,103
you know those people,
the ones born into money.

13
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,740
The filthy rich ones.

14
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,744
(St. Joseph
Medical Center)

15
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,920
I don't get it.
Do whatever you want.

16
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,203
He calmed down with sedatives,

17
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,040
but he has not stopped crying
since birth.

18
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:57,577
All top doctors here
have examined him,

19
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,914
but he's medically sound.

20
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,817
So we've heard.

21
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,193
My apologies, but could we
have the room to ourselves?

22
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,327
Pardon?

23
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,736
There're others with
the same condition in your family.

24
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,438
His father and...

25
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,941
grandfather.

26
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,984
Is she talking about Ji-yong,
and his father?

27
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,419
That expressions...

28
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,657
changing from suspicion to shock.

29
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,863
They live in the light

30
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,266
and look towards bright spaces.

31
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,935
(Chapter 1
Yin Yang and Five Elements)

32
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,706
Bright lights are needed
in the world for us to see.

33
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,876
And people only believe in things

34
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,378
that they can see and touch.

35
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,283
A world with bright lights.

36
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,988
And the back side of it.

37
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,530
People knew of the beings
living in the darkness

38
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,799
for a long time,

39
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,368
and called them by many names:

40
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,439
ghosts, devils, goblins, ghouls.

41
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,374
These beings are always jealous

42
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,410
and long for the light,

43
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,215
and sometimes
would cross the line.

44
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,987
That's when people ask for me.

45
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,926
Yin and Yang.

46
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,562
Science and superstition.

47
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,565
I exist between them.

48
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,702
I'm shaman Lee Hwa-rim.

49
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,604
My wife told me you'd be coming.

50
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,105
I'm Park Ji-yong.

51
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,287
My brother committed suicide
in the mental ward,

52
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,289
then it began with me,

53
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,225
and...

54
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,795
now my newborn son.

55
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,566
When I close my eyes,
I hear a scream.

56
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,869
And a sensation of being choked.

57
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,640
First borns... Tainted blood...

58
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,243
Normally, genetics is blamed,

59
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,845
then the land
their house is built on,

60
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,647
and finally they move around.

61
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,781
Shadow...

62
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,951
I saw a shadow here
as soon as I arrived.

63
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,921
It's pressing down
on its descendants.

64
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,525
It's likely the shadow
of your grandfather.

65
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,327
My grandfather?

66
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,698
It's known in my field as
"Grave's Calling."

67
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:44,537
Simply, one of your ancestors
is having a tantrum.

68
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:46,573
Are you certain?

69
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,109
Yes, 100%.

70
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,448
Then what do I have to do?

71
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,185
You have to spend money
and use people.

72
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,020
I can't do this on my own,

73
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,556
we have to retain experts.

74
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,226
Dammit...

75
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,896
Wicked faces just passed by...

76
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,027
- Exhumation!
- Exhumation!

77
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,699
How dare you stare at
your ancestor's awakening!

78
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,035
I'm so sorry.

79
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,870
Let's head back.

80
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,708
One, two, three!

81
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,786
No sign of water.

82
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:11,091
I'm sorry for waking you up.

83
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,693
It's very clean.

84
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,296
Mellifluous.

85
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,733
This coffin is stuffed.

86
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,634
Man, oh man.

87
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,972
I told them not to put

88
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,907
any metals inside for her sake...

89
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,110
Chairman Jin,

90
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,147
I've found your mother's

91
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,282
and ancestors' plots, right?

92
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,117
Yes, that's correct.

93
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:43,189
You're all healthy and
business is good, right?

94
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,924
Yes, thanks to you.

95
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,395
No matter how I look at it,

96
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,229
this is one of the finest plots

97
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,433
in my 40-year career.

98
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,804
It's got all five elements
right here, no?

99
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,808
I really gave you a good deal.

100
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,209
For sure.

101
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,012
Set aside your worry,

102
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,182
do the right thing
and re-bury her.

103
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,819
If you say so,
it's the right call.

104
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,454
But why does she keep showing up

105
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,222
in my children's dreams?

106
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,491
Even my wife said she saw her.

107
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:20,894
Mr. Ko!

108
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,697
What's taking so long?
I'm starving.

109
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,667
I'm hungry too, and so is she.

110
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,570
Someone shrouded her
without checking.

111
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:31,738
- Count is good?
- Yes.

112
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:32,705
Good.

113
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,022
Someone has grandma's teeth.

114
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,594
Who took grandma's false teeth?

115
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:10,043
Did you take grandma's teeth?

116
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,146
Sang-hyun,
the thing in your closet,

117
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,514
was that her teeth?

118
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,416
Why did you...

119
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,285
All her stuff was burned,

120
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,788
and now she's gone...

121
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,157
Dad...

122
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,426
I wanted something
that was hers...

123
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:30,430
Grandma is hungry,
let's return it to her.

124
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,331
What about me?

125
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,567
What do I remember her by?

126
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,870
There's nothing...

127
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,372
Sang-hyun, right?

128
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:45,111
Sang-hyun,
grandma is always by your side.

129
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,687
Bloodline.

130
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,524
You can't escape it even in death,

131
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,695
a group that shares
DNA and physical attributes.

132
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,099
When a person's
body activity ends,

133
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,101
it turns into dirt and earth.

134
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:13,005
As we drink from that dirt
and walk on that earth,

135
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:17,610
we live, die and are born again
in a cyclical nature.

136
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,480
In other words,
dirt and earth connect

137
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,082
and cycle everything.

138
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,687
Screw those that are ignorant.

139
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,889
To the top 1%,

140
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,559
feng shui is religion and science.

141
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,229
I'm a feng shui expert.

142
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:40,900
I find soil for
the dead and the living,

143
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,736
I'm geomancer Kim Sang-duk.

144
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,606
(Noble Funeral Home)

145
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,074
Many domestic companies see the

146
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:51,844
current economic situation
as a prolonged downturn.

147
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,412
According to the findings...

148
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,316
Let it to cook, will you?

149
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:00,186
I can't wait that long,
one grill is plenty.

150
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,455
To be honest, Mr. Kim,

151
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:05,224
was it really a pristine plot?

152
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,295
What are you talking about?
They're my regulars.

153
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:14,600
It looked like it was
facing North awkwardly,

154
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,037
and the site aura felt weird...

155
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,973
You're almost a geomancer.

156
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,777
If you got the chops,
you should go on your own.

157
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,512
So, I've been doing some thinking.

158
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:31,017
250,000 people die every year
in Korea on average,

159
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,818
and 30% of that gets buried.

160
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,456
Imagine how many people
are buried in good plots

161
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,892
since the Joseon era
in this tiny country.

162
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,363
And yet, there are
still more pristine plots...

163
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,566
- I don't know...
- That plot...

164
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,602
was 65 out of 100.

165
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,537
Yeah, it was not a 100.

166
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,207
They're drying up,
there aren't any more.

167
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:59,378
Funeral directors like you
are hired by corporations,

168
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,581
and men like me who sell plots

169
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,883
are poking around
construction sites.

170
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,587
It's all over,
we're the last ones standing.

171
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,988
Have a drink.

172
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,490
Hold on, they're here already.

173
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,726
You came so early.

174
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,660
It's been a while.

175
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,629
- Good evening.
- Hey there.

176
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:21,234
I smelled pine mushrooms
all the way in Seoul.

177
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,535
He ate all of them.

178
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,403
What are you talking about?

179
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,038
- Have you been well?
- Come on in.

180
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,573
Sorry for not calling often.

181
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,809
Can't be helped if you're busy.

182
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,912
- Bong-gil, you've got prettier.
- What? Really?

183
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,480
Don't even mention it.

184
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,417
Ladies all want him around,
it's inflating his ego.

185
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,386
How long has it been? 3 years?

186
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,622
Yes, time really flies.

187
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,825
How's business lately?

188
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,461
So-so, you know, it's off-season.

189
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,731
Which is why I brought...

190
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,766
Wait, wait, Mr. Ko...

191
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,769
Do you smell anything?

192
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,338
What smell? Smell of this?

193
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,974
Yup, it's the smell of money.

194
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,376
Jeez.

195
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,912
I tried my best to hide it.

196
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,314
You got me.

197
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,151
Spill it already.

198
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,687
You gents clue in so quickly.

199
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,662
We visited a weird family
in the States

200
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,898
upon a request
from a doctor friend.

201
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,700
Mr. Park Ji-yong.

202
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,670
The patriarch is
a Korean national,

203
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,172
but the client and the rest
are American citizens.

204
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,940
They're apparently...

205
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,576
Rich, filthy rich.

206
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,277
That's a great start.

207
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,082
All the firstborns are haunted,
including a newborn.

208
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,319
They suffered long enough.

209
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,621
It's not possession?

210
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,023
It's not at that stage,

211
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,129
but it's obviously
Grave's Calling.

212
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:02,535
Are you really going to do that
to your grandfather's grave?

213
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,706
It's been almost
one hundred years.

214
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,210
I don't need your approval.
I've made up my mind.

215
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,549
You really believe in such things?

216
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:21,187
And you think your aunts
in Korea will agree on this?

217
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,159
I'm the head of family.

218
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,661
So I make the decisions.

219
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,734
I don't trust those people.

220
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,804
This could get out of hand.

221
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,706
The baby will get better.

222
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:46,712
Let's pray together,
and seek treatments.

223
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:03,629
We just have to live
quietly away from everything.

224
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,186
Who cares if her belly's full
during wedding,

225
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,687
it's a gift.

226
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,190
But even so, a grandchild?

227
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,725
One with blonde hair no less.

228
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,827
His eyes will be blue!

229
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,729
What an old fart.

230
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,565
Then will she live in Germany
after the wedding?

231
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,401
No way, she has to live in Korea.

232
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:49,408
Anyway, I was worried about
the money for her wedding,

233
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,776
and we caught
a big game just in time.

234
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,977
Indeed.

235
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,514
Our Lord sends me a pension

236
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,317
when the time's right.

237
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,252
Amen!

238
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,556
How rich do you think they are

239
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,158
to pay us $500,000 to relocate?

240
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,727
They probably paid more.

241
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:09,762
What? More?

242
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:13,365
You know Hwa-rim,

243
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,000
you think she didn't take a cut?

244
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:20,039
Yeah, she wouldn't
hesitate to exploit us.

245
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:24,944
(Hongcheon Service Area)

246
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:28,748
May I get your grandfather's
name and hometown first?

247
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,251
I check the family's reputation

248
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,221
and occupation before the job,

249
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,623
but since you're in a rush...

250
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,228
Shouldn't you earn
the trust of the employer first?

251
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,734
Trust?

252
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,970
Very well.

253
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,206
If you're not up for it,
we can call this off.

254
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,242
Can you promise me 2 things?

255
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,946
From here on,
keep everything confidential.

256
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,582
And cremate him right away.

257
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:05,484
With the coffin.

258
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,354
With the coffin?

259
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,289
Don't bother opening it?

260
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,525
Does it matter?

261
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,929
I'm told that it's either
relocation or cremation.

262
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,898
Under normal circumstances,

263
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,967
we need to notify the town office,

264
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,169
open the coffin
and the mortician needs

265
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,971
to check the status of bones,

266
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,176
and then it can be
relocated or cremated.

267
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,084
Let's check out the plot first.

268
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,454
My parents and relatives
are against this adamantly.

269
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,889
It has to be done swiftly...

270
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,458
Let's check the plot first.

271
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:51,430
(Chapter 2
Nameless Grave)

272
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,799
Northern Gangwon...

273
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,168
I got a bad feeling about this.

274
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,972
I find it weird that
he doesn't want the coffin opened.

275
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,075
Shouldn't the bone condition
be checked?

276
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,144
Which means shrouding is skipped.

277
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,716
Is something inside it?

278
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,319
(Boguk Temple)

279
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,814
(No Entry: Private Property)

280
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,794
Ever seen a site
at a mountain peak?

281
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,863
It's rare.

282
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,699
Do you know this mountain?

283
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,701
Never been here before.

284
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,738
You claim to know
very inch of this land,

285
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,106
how could you not?

286
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,376
I only seek pristine plots.

287
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,809
What an incredible view,
very nice.

288
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,478
North Korea is visible from here,

289
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,680
you see that?

290
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:35,054
The grave itself is quite plain
for this grand plot.

291
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,153
Is something there?

292
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,091
There's no name.

293
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,773
Is it possible to know
who found this plot for you?

294
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:30,242
A famous monk at the time

295
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,278
found the most auspicious plot

296
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,781
because grandfather made
a significant contribution...

297
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,449
- to the country.
- A monk?

298
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,119
Yes, I heard he went by
the Buddhist name "Gisune."

299
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,955
Gisune?

300
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,024
That's a unique name.

301
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,961
The tombstone feels very plain.

302
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,163
Due to rampant grave robberies,

303
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,166
I'm told they decided on
a nondescript one.

304
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,045
What do you think?

305
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,147
I'll finalize a date.

306
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,885
Is something off?

307
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:19,892
Mr. Park.

308
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:23,829
I don't think I can take this job.

309
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,934
He's screwing us again.

310
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,169
Mr. Kim!

311
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,871
He's being so dramatic...

312
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:34,907
Is it that bad?

313
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,910
Is there no way?

314
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,714
Why aren't you talking?

315
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,687
It's got a great view,
what's the matter?

316
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,524
You know how much this job pays.

317
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,794
Sir, what's going on?

318
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,899
I'm sure you all understand,

319
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,369
what happens if we
mess with the wrong grave.

320
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,538
I've been selling plots
for 40 years,

321
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,440
but this one is a plot
I've never heard of.

322
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,075
It's vile.

323
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,480
No human should
ever be buried here.

324
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:22,354
Dealing with that could get
everyone involved killed.

325
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:23,755
Do you understand?

326
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,924
Hwa-rim, you saw the foxes?

327
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,697
Foxes at a gravesite
is an ominous sign.

328
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,201
It's the vilest plot.

329
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,648
This is the last time
I saw my son smile.

330
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,852
We conceived twice before him.

331
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,587
But for unknown reasons,
they were miscarried.

332
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,956
We managed to
give birth at our age.

333
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,561
Mr. Kim, do you have any children?

334
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:04,596
Yes, I do.

335
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,132
I got a daughter
who's about to get married.

336
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,001
Congratulations.

337
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,336
Don't even mention it.

338
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,639
Is your daughter
in the same line of work?

339
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,541
She majored Aerospace Engineering,

340
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,411
and works for an airline
in Germany.

341
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,614
She's going nuts
trying to get married...

342
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,083
Very interesting.

343
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,653
A geomancer father and
an aerospace engineer daughter.

344
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,025
The thing is, if you look at
both fields together,

345
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,895
there are many similarities.

346
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,831
Yin-yang and the five elements
are about studying

347
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,101
water, fire, metal, wood
with earth as basis,

348
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,971
it's about analyzing the nature
under these conditions,

349
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:48,574
- and aerospace is about...
- Then,

350
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,644
could you save my child?

351
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,285
You're hiding something from us.

352
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,090
What do you mean?

353
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:08,627
38.3417, 128.3189.

354
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,929
Longitude and latitude.

355
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,165
They were engraved
behind the gravestone.

356
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,868
I don't know who Gisune was,

357
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:20,472
but it's absolutely clear,

358
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,741
that he had some intention.

359
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,984
No, I don't know what you mean.

360
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,087
And I'm not hiding
anything from you two.

361
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:40,692
Relocating a grave
from an unknown plot

362
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,494
is extremely dangerous.

363
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,596
It's like digging for a mine
with bare hands.

364
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,697
We could try a withdrawal ritual.

365
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,370
I knew you'd say that.

366
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,175
We can do it while relocating.

367
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,278
You already know the answer.

368
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,380
I don't trust anything
that I haven't done before.

369
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,316
That combo will be a first

370
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,019
but it's not
theoretically impossible.

371
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,021
Wait...

372
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,259
Why do I need your permission?

373
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,461
You're not the only
geomancer in Korea.

374
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,498
This is why it's tough
working with geezers.

375
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,734
- Watch it.
- A child is in pain.

376
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,445
This hotel is on a good plot.

377
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:40,118
"Passing of Misfortune" is
a type of deception ritual.

378
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,188
Get 5 diggers
with the same zodiac sign,

379
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,290
and 5 sacrificial animals
tied together,

380
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,293
and get them to dig the grave.

381
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:52,030
Vile energy from the ground
is transferred to the animals,

382
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,066
where I whisk it away.

383
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,636
Your aunt is here.

384
00:28:57,703 --> 00:29:00,872
Seems like your mother
shared what's happening.

385
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:51,616
Let's go!

386
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,625
Let's go!

387
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,500
Let's go!

388
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,406
All right!

389
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,085
Let's go!

390
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,740
All right!

391
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,611
Go for it!

392
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,617
- Appease the guardian!
- Appease the guardian!

393
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,555
All right!

394
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,058
Exhumation!

395
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:08,693
Exhumation!

396
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:10,862
Exhumation!

397
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,435
Appease the guardian!

398
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,270
Mountain guardian!

399
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,811
Appease the guardian

400
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,605
There it is.

401
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,615
Reveal!

402
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,417
Reveal!

403
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,033
The chill is immense.

404
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,451
It's too old to make anything out.

405
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,503
What's this?

406
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,171
A coffin made out of juniper tree.

407
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,807
Only the royal family used this.

408
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,110
I can't believe seeing this here.

409
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,349
Coffin removable!

410
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,353
Good, good, let's go slowly.

411
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,023
Lower the head!

412
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,393
We'll put the coffin
in the hearse.

413
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,028
We're heading to the crematorium,

414
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:32,964
bury the tombstone
and clean it up, please.

415
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,733
Let's swap ropes.

416
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,336
- And don't eat meat today.
- Okay.

417
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,411
Thank you for everything.

418
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:56,521
Yes?

419
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,691
A soul that has not been
shrouded is riding with you.

420
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,359
Let's be respectful.

421
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,065
Come on, I'm Ko Young-geun,
who shrouded the president.

422
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,035
The job is done, loosen up.

423
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:15,040
(May thy rest in peace)

424
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,185
Let's see...

425
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,122
Nothing's here.

426
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:38,963
Jeez!

427
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,866
What's this...

428
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,168
Dammit...

429
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,816
What in the world?

430
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,372
Mr. Park.

431
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,574
Because of
this unexpected rainfall,

432
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,010
we must delay the cremation.

433
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:03,681
How so? It's not done outdoors.

434
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:07,218
When cremation takes place
on a rainy day,

435
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:10,355
the soul cannot reach
a good afterlife.

436
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,458
It may sound superstitious to you,

437
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:14,492
but I wanted to let you know

438
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,827
for professional
and ethical reasons.

439
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,765
This happens from time to time.

440
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:25,169
We can hold the body
in a nearby hospital morgue,

441
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,872
and reschedule the cremation
when the weather improves.

442
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,974
If we go to the hospital,

443
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,876
don't we have to
submit a funeral report?

444
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:33,411
Mr. Kim!

445
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,213
Mr. Kim, I got connected!

446
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,081
Good to go!

447
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,752
Don't worry, we know these people.

448
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,291
Why the entire coffin
even after relocation?

449
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,894
Head mourner
doesn't let us open it.

450
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,062
Here.

451
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,997
Come on, it's all right.

452
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,934
Don't be that way, take it.

453
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,837
Jeez...

454
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:02,907
Today's last group left,
so it's quiet inside.

455
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,609
That's great.

456
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,211
Rain on the cremation day...

457
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,747
He's got a long trip
to the afterlife.

458
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,783
(Funeral Home /
Goseong Hospital)

459
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,058
Reschedule the cremation?

460
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,026
Yes.

461
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,596
Can you really trust them?

462
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,233
I paid them enough and
we're on a need-to-know basis.

463
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:30,435
You don't need to worry.

464
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,705
Since we got some time,

465
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:38,109
let's consider moving him
to our family gravesite.

466
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,280
I still disagree
with the cremation.

467
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,984
He was my father,
I have the right to choose.

468
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,487
Get some rest.

469
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,495
Since we can't open it,

470
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,263
let's leave it here.

471
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,099
I'll manage the humidity level.

472
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,168
Thanks again.

473
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,970
That coffin...

474
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,741
He must've earned
some royal favors.

475
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,310
Good to see you.

476
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,414
Head mourner and his family
all returned to Seoul.

477
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,285
Still, Hwa-rim will be here.

478
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,221
It's an eerie day,

479
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,623
go have some hot soup.

480
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,326
I need to step out for a bit.

481
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:30,295
Okay.

482
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,217
(Boguk Temple)

483
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,752
I haven't seen you before,
can I help you?

484
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,320
Pardon me for intruding.

485
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:33,925
I saw a sign on the road
while passing by.

486
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,760
Is that so?

487
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:37,528
It's just that,

488
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,598
I noticed the geomancy
symbol on it,

489
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,301
so, I thought I'd come visit.

490
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,370
Are you a geomancer?

491
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,842
Yes, I was
a protégé of Master Choi,

492
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,411
and I'm barely making ends meet

493
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:55,346
by selling plots on my own.

494
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,615
This place may look shabby now

495
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,151
but it has existed
for over 100 years.

496
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:04,322
The head monk
who established this temple

497
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:08,125
was renowned for
his geomancy expertise.

498
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:13,164
I see, I can tell just by
looking at the site it's on.

499
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,465
Speaking of which,

500
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:19,404
was the head monk's name
Gisune by any chance?

501
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,973
Gisune?

502
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,208
No, he was called Wonbong.

503
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,378
May I ask why you're inquiring?

504
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:34,685
There is a nameless grave
at the peak of that mountain,

505
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,520
do you know about that?

506
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,655
Of course.

507
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,191
I'm not sure if it's still there,

508
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:43,895
I've heard a lot of rumors
a long time ago.

509
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,999
What kind of rumors?

510
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,601
Don't stay alone
in this eerie place,

511
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,937
go have some hot soup
across the street.

512
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:55,139
Sure, don't worry.

513
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,275
- I'm off.
- Take care.

514
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:03,181
Why's everyone picking
my dinner menu?

515
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:14,859
There were rumors of treasures
buried in the grave.

516
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,828
Treasure?

517
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,431
People said it was the grave

518
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,266
of the richest man in Joseon,

519
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,002
or that of an unknown king.

520
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:29,373
That's why a lot of grave robbers
came to this area.

521
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,809
Grave robbers?

522
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:34,478
Some of them were rounded up,

523
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:37,615
while others crossed
the border to North Korea.

524
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:39,984
So they never got to
rob the grave?

525
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:41,952
Probably never got a chance to.

526
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:44,789
I heard it belonged to
a high-ranking official,

527
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:47,091
so, it was hard to
even approach it.

528
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:52,430
These were their tools.

529
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,874
Why are you asking
about that grave?

530
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:08,546
Because I...

531
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,115
dug it up today.

532
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:22,026
So? Were there treasures?

533
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:39,477
Excuse me?

534
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:40,745
What are you doing?

535
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:42,547
Hey!

536
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,288
Hwa-rim...

537
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:51,856
Stop!

538
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,158
Are you okay?

539
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:57,395
(Chapter 3
Spirit)

540
00:44:58,596 --> 00:44:59,630
What?

541
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,966
What are you saying?
The coffin is opened?

542
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:05,603
Those sticky fingers of his...

543
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,638
I paid him enough,
he should've left it alone.

544
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,173
I knew he felt off.

545
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,844
What happened?

546
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,381
Something flew past her.

547
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:19,784
What? What did?

548
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,462
Something came out of it.

549
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:33,864
Something very vicious.

550
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,373
Father...

551
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:21,312
Father...

552
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,385
Jong-soon...

553
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:30,454
My son...

554
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,925
Open the window.

555
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:38,562
Father...

556
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,934
Come inside...

557
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,131
Father...

558
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:55,473
My loyal puppy...

559
00:47:57,675 --> 00:48:02,146
Milk and honey flow here...

560
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:09,220
Your father is cold and hungry.

561
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:12,256
I'm sorry...

562
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,589
The spirit must be
flying around everywhere.

563
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,058
The head mourner is in danger.

564
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,928
Get to Seoul right away.

565
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:27,498
Meanwhile,
we'll try to summon it here.

566
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:30,267
You'll summon it from here?

567
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,770
He screamed for a century,

568
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:34,672
but no one came to free him.

569
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,974
Only his resentment remained.

570
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:40,845
He will visit every
one of his descendants.

571
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:50,554
What a mess we're in.

572
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,055
Raining cats and dogs,
coffin's open,

573
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,056
a ghost on the loose...

574
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:56,927
- What in the world…
- I don't really want to do this.

575
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,200
Will you be okay doing
2 rituals in a single day?

576
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,503
We'll be fine.

577
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,872
Mr. Ko, you have to
get the timing right.

578
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,407
When it enters,
hold onto the rope tightly.

579
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:11,442
Okay.

580
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:05,796
Come forth, come forth!

581
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,043
Here he comes!

582
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:06,256
Come forth!

583
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:11,662
He's here!

584
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:13,931
Bong-gil!

585
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:15,766
Hold tight!

586
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:55,105
Gramps, who's there?

587
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,207
Who is it?

588
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:00,611
Bong-gil, hang onto him!

589
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,984
What got you riled up?

590
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:09,253
Could you talk to me?

591
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:12,256
Let it all out tonight.

592
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,426
Don't go off somewhere, okay?

593
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:21,465
My children...
I'll take them back.

594
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,103
You can't do that.

595
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:54,832
We lost him.

596
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,401
What do we do?

597
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,209
Hello?

598
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:09,113
This is Kim Sang-duk,
is everything okay?

599
00:54:10,314 --> 00:54:12,949
Yes, what's going on?

600
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,785
That's great...

601
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:17,154
It's just that
we have a situation,

602
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:19,523
so I'm on my way to you.

603
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,692
I know it's late,
but could I talk to you?

604
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,862
What? What's going on?

605
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:29,232
Are you still at the same hotel?

606
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,336
I'm almost there,
I'll be right up.

607
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:33,871
One moment.

608
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:35,739
Who is it?

609
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:37,908
It's me, Kim Sang-duk.

610
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:42,346
Hello? What's going on?

611
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,981
Mr. Kim, are you outside my room?

612
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,483
Excuse me, Mr. Park?

613
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,785
No, no way!

614
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,153
It's not me!

615
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,622
Your grandfather's coffin
has been opened.

616
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:53,557
What?

617
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,626
- Please open this door!
- My grandfather's coffin?

618
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,262
My apologies, but it was unsealed.

619
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,997
Is something going on inside?

620
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:04,401
Don't ever open that door,
and just stay put.

621
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,770
- I'm heading your way.
- Mr. Park!

622
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:10,340
Only listen to me and act calmly.

623
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,642
Mr. Park, listen carefully.

624
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:15,512
Walk away from the door
and get to the window.

625
00:55:18,382 --> 00:55:20,217
Please open the door!

626
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:22,853
It's an urgent matter,
I have to explain it to you!

627
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,355
Don't answer, don't listen!

628
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:28,024
Go to the window and open it.

629
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:31,161
Your grandfather will protect you,
you must serve him.

630
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:32,229
Hey, Mr Park!

631
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,965
You have to believe me, hurry!

632
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,304
Open the window!

633
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:22,512
Mr. Park!

634
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:28,785
Mr. Park?

635
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,426
Are you okay?

636
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:45,402
Proud young men of the peninsula!

637
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,573
Do you hear hundreds of
airplanes and artillery?

638
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,176
Push forward, sons of the Empire!

639
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:58,515
Raise your bayonets
under the Rising Sun flag!

640
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,652
For the unification of
the Greater East Asia,

641
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:06,256
offer your devotion
to the Japanese Empire!

642
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:21,371
Ambulance... Call the ambulance.

643
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,608
Call the ambulance now!

644
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,710
Ambulance!

645
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,285
I saw it with my own eyes,

646
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:37,387
this could lead to
a series of funerals!

647
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,521
We're going to the crematorium!

648
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:39,656
I understand, just get going.

649
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:43,126
Get their permission,
I'll stand by from there.

650
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:05,749
Your grandfather's coffin...

651
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,484
The fox severed the tiger's waist.

652
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:10,520
Pardon?

653
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,896
The fox severed the tiger's waist.

654
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:36,213
The fox severed the tiger's waist.

655
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,810
Mother, is everything okay?

656
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:10,280
She must be tired from the trip.

657
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:13,417
I need to get some rest.

658
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:23,226
Joseph's condition seems
better today, doesn't it?

659
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:26,563
Anyways, I can't reach anyone
at home. So I'm going to go check.

660
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:28,732
Sure, I'll be here.

661
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:36,973
It's because
this is an urgent matter!

662
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,375
Have I asked for
a favor like this before?

663
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:39,809
It's really late...

664
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,112
We'll be there soon,
so, please hurry!

665
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:44,647
Cremating in this weather
is nonsense.

666
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:45,648
What did the mourner say?

667
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:48,318
Something came out of the coffin!

668
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:50,353
Do you understand?

669
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,721
He needs to be
cremated immediately,

670
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:54,491
please call his family
in the States.

671
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:56,826
Pardon? What do you mean?

672
00:59:56,893 --> 01:00:00,564
You saw what happened,
the baby is next.

673
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:30,260
No one's answering.

674
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,263
Then...

675
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:56,253
I heard he was exhumed,
but wasn't shrouded?

676
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:58,088
You'll cremate the entire coffin?

677
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:01,858
If the town office finds out,
things will go down.

678
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:08,865
Father's coffin?

679
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:11,067
I don't quite
understand it myself.

680
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,336
But he said it has to be
cremated immediately.

681
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,105
What do you mean?

682
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:18,808
Ma'am, we must hurry.

683
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:22,279
Your father is heading
to the baby in the States.

684
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,269
- I'll fire it up.
- Wait a minute.

685
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:48,371
The mourner has not
given us the go.

686
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,240
We can't reach
your family in the States.

687
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,408
You'll have to give us permission

688
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:53,743
to cremate the coffin.

689
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,534
Is this really the only way?

690
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:36,853
Very well.

691
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:38,688
Please proceed.

692
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:39,889
Yes, ma'am.

693
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,126
Burn it.

695
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:08,018
Terrible fate...

696
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,253
He won't reach a good afterlife.

697
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:04,474
Off on a journey

698
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:10,880

Divine Retribution)

705
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,571
Remember Chang-min?

706
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:12,175
He said he got sick
after the exhumation.

707
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:15,678
When things cool down,
could you give him a visit?

708
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,116
The hospital's clueless.

709
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:22,385
They just ran tests
and wasted my money.

710
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:28,258
I have nightmares
and hallucinations.

711
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:30,693
Sir...

712
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:35,732
I think I'm getting
punished by the gods.

713
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,438
While wrapping up the exhumation,
I saw something.

714
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:43,673
It looked so weird.

715
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:46,209
A snake...

716
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:48,311
What? A snake?

717
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:52,382
Dammit, I should've
let it alone...

718
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:55,552
Let me ask you a favor...

719
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,821
Find the snake that I cut in half

720
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:00,223
and say a prayer for it...

721
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,729
I didn't want to
go there that day...

722
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,164
I really hated it...

723
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:12,235
Sir, that place felt weird
to start with, right?

724
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,338
Why was a grave there
in the first place?

725
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,011
Double interment.

01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:04,914
Yeah, I'm busy.

727
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:06,649
I'm doing a Bible study
with church people.

728
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:09,586
Here's $50, there you go.

729
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:11,454
What?

730
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:14,991
Double interment?

731
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:16,859
Yeah, just under the coffin.

732
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:18,962
Mr. Ko,

733
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:21,998
have you seen
a coffin buried vertically?

734
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:27,303
Yes?

735
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,573
Hwa-rim?

736
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:34,777
Here we go!

737
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:53,663
Coffins could go vertical
when the ground shifts...

738
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:56,466
Still, it's too big.

739
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:59,769
What the heck is it?

740
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:06,576
What's that about?

741
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:17,020
I think this chain...

742
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,989
is to prevent someone
from opening it.

743
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,493
- Or...
- Or what?

744
01:09:24,027 --> 01:09:24,927
Or the opposite.

745
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:30,333
Let's pull it out and examine it.

746
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,168
For what?

747
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:34,403
We should contact
the mourners first.

748
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:35,972
We got the payment issue
left to discuss too.

749
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:39,442
Let's not mess with this.

750
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,748
Let's pull it out first.

751
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:48,150
I'm sure it belongs to the family.

752
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,687
We can't just leave him like this.

753
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,823
But how do we...

754
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,158
Let's pull it out, go get a rope.

755
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:57,460
The sun is setting.

756
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:03,299
Pull hard on the count of three!

757
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,935
One, two, three!

758
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:23,019
Is that really for a human?

759
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,637
Where is he going?

760
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,244
(Boguk Temple)

761
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:34,957
What's going on?

762
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:36,625
As I told you on the phone,

763
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,728
we had an emergency exhumation,

764
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:41,330
please allow us to stay overnight.

765
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,568
The mourner is on her way,

766
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:48,538
is there space
to store the coffin?

767
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,126
What...

768
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,962
exactly is that?

769
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:19,669
Could I trouble you
for some sweet rice?

770
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:36,652
Bong-gil.

771
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,387
Get horse blood from the car.

772
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,461
You know this is not a good thing.

773
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,902
Double interment?

774
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:54,871
What does it mean?

775
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:59,041
Please tell us
everything you know.

776
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:00,743
I don't know.

777
01:13:01,444 --> 01:13:03,312
I really don't know...

778
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,917
why that thing was buried there.

779
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:12,688
And why my father was buried
in such a bad plot...

780
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,125
It was written on the tombstone,

781
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:20,730
"Vice Chairman of
the Central Advisory Committee."

782
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:25,534
Your father was quite a figure,
he sold our country.

783
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:29,471
So the monk was punishing him...

784
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,073
Yes, I know...

785
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,377
That's why I don't understand.

786
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,281
That monk named Gisune...

787
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,218
he was not a Korean,

788
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:45,922
but a Japanese.

789
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:47,056
Pardon?

790
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:48,490
A Japanese?

791
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:51,861
His real name was Murayama Junji.

792
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:58,868
I heard he knew
every inch of this country.

793
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,570
My father pledged
allegiance to them,

794
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:05,608
so why bury him in
the worst plot in the country?

795
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:12,147
I've received a call
from the States

796
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:13,482
that the baby is well.

797
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:17,887
I'll honor the payment
Ji-yong promised you all,

798
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:22,358
so, get rid of that coffin
as you see fit.

799
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,087
Let's burn it right away.

800
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,223
Yeah.

801
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,360
Let's burn it first thing
in the morning.

802
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:00,763
I agree, I'll feel so much better.

803
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:03,599
Excuse me.

804
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:07,269
I made some noodles,
come warm up for a bit.

805
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,804
Thank you.

806
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,606
- Shall we?
- This way.

807
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:11,640
I knew that grave was off.

808
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:14,143
It had a good view for nothing.

809
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,846
We haven't eaten anything all day.

810
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:25,955
Please have a drink of this.

811
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,024
Thank you so much.

812
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:30,326
Thank you for the meal.

813
01:15:30,393 --> 01:15:32,127
Cheers to our health!

814
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:33,929
This scent...

815
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:39,001
This is really precious stuff.

816
01:15:39,435 --> 01:15:41,136
Have a drink.

817
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,705
That's warming me up...

818
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:45,641
Was this acorn jello...

819
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:54,717
(Chapter 5
Illusion)

820
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,854
Yeah, Murayama Junji.

821
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:03,525
You don't remember?
Master mentioned him a few times.

822
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:06,996
He was a...
Fox Diviner in Japan.

823
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,867
That's right, Diviner Murayama.

824
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:14,336
Master met him once
a long time ago,

825
01:16:14,804 --> 01:16:17,639
she said his energy was
too intense to be a human.

826
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:19,475
She was sure he was a fox.

827
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:21,110
Why do you ask?

828
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:22,144
Where are you?

829
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:24,814
It's nothing, I got it.

830
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,249
Thank you.

831
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:29,485
I'll call back soon.

832
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:39,728
Granny, granny...

833
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,502
I have a bad feeling...

834
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:47,429
My liver was taken, my liver...

835
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:49,131
My liver...

836
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:55,304
My liver was taken...

837
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,706
Someone took my liver.

838
01:17:57,773 --> 01:17:59,074
Someone took my liver...

839
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:01,777
Someone took it,
I said someone took my liver.

840
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:03,245
My liver was taken...

841
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:05,314
Where are my clothes?

842
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:07,416
My clothes, my clothes...

843
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:10,119
Dammit...

844
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:13,188
Someone took
my liver and my clothes...

845
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,089
My liver...

846
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:08,504
Hwa-rim.

847
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:25,821
Goddammit...

848
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:36,332
Dammit, what a stench...

849
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:54,316
It went through the roof
because of the seal.

850
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,222
This thing...

851
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:03,725
What the hell is it?

852
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:04,727
Say it!

853
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:11,567
I think this thing is
at the shed right now...

854
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:13,969
Wake everyone up.

855
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:15,537
Okay.

856
01:22:33,482 --> 01:22:35,717
The gate has been opened.

857
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:39,588
Is there a human?

858
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:46,862
I came for my helmet.

859
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:49,097
Is there a human?

860
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:55,938
No, my lord, I am not a human.

861
01:22:56,872 --> 01:22:59,341
I am your servant.

862
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:04,913
Very well.

863
01:23:05,881 --> 01:23:09,818
Then have you brought me
sweetfish and melons?

864
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:18,026
Do you not hear your lord?

865
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:23,899
I've brought the head of
the enemy general.

866
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,676
I'm sorry, my lord.

867
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,913
I'll prepare sweetfish for you.

868
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,644
A human.

869
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:31,833
Run away...

870
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:33,702
Bong-gil...

871
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,005
Bong-gil...

872
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:32,260
A pagoda...

873
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,525
Bong-gil.

874
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,327
Bong-gil!

875
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:47,829
Bong-gil, Snap out of it!

876
01:27:47,896 --> 01:27:50,398
Deacon Jung Gyu-in, $350,

877
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:54,235
Sunny Café Kim Young-ja, $750...

878
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:58,707
- Bong-gil, wake up!
- ... they owe me $2,000...

879
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:02,110
Mr. Kim, please help!

880
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:04,513
I need help!

881
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:09,384
Please help! Please!

882
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:13,622
Bong-gil, please don't die...

883
01:28:26,735 --> 01:28:30,105
A wild bear attack
terrorizes the villagers.

884
01:28:30,172 --> 01:28:31,639
Your temperature is not dropping,

885
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:33,475
I'll give you something for that.

886
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:35,977
The local police found animals

887
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,680
that were shredded to pieces,

888
01:28:38,747 --> 01:28:42,751
as well as two human bodies
near the scene.

889
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:45,186
The victims are found
to be a local monk

890
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:47,889
and a migrant laborer
from a pigsty.

891
01:28:47,956 --> 01:28:50,291
Town officials are working

892
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:52,894
with the military to capture...

893
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:56,364
(Operating theater)

894
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:23,992
I'm sorry.

895
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:27,395
I shouldn't have
asked to pull it out...

896
01:29:28,897 --> 01:29:33,969
Sorry about Bong-gil,
and the monk too...

897
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,139
Bong-gil was...

898
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,208
first chosen by the spirits
while playing baseball,

899
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:46,081
and was abandoned by his family,
and came to master,

900
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:49,317
we all told him not to
become a shaman...

901
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:56,258
But he said he'd be okay
when he was with me...

902
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:06,902
I got scared and froze...

903
01:30:16,044 --> 01:30:17,545
It had a footprint.

904
01:30:18,313 --> 01:30:19,781
And a shadow too.

905
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:24,085
There are established
theories in shamanism.

906
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:28,156
Souls are incomplete,
and ghosts lack physical bodies,

907
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:31,793
so, we trump over them

908
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:35,363
since we have complete minds
and physical bodies.

909
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:40,568
But that thing is something
completely different.

910
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:44,773
It's not a vengeful soul,
but rather an anima.

911
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,075
An anima?

912
01:30:47,142 --> 01:30:48,543
Human or animal souls attached

913
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:51,146
to objects evolve together.

914
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:55,750
It should absolutely not
exist in our country.

915
01:30:59,888 --> 01:31:01,990
I couldn't feel anything at all.

916
01:31:03,358 --> 01:31:06,328
What its identity is,
where it came from,

917
01:31:07,262 --> 01:31:09,564
and why it was
in the Park family's grave...

918
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,672
He suffered damages
to his abdominal organs.

919
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,741
And he lost tons of blood.

920
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:23,411
The real problem is
the damage to the spine.

921
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:26,114
He must be sent
to a general hospital.

922
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,851
Since it was an animal attack...

923
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,458
(Backbone of the Peninsula)

924
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:38,993
(Backbone…)

925
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:42,430
The fox severed the tiger's waist.

926
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:04,285
Due to rampant grave robberies,

927
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:06,220
I'm told they decided
on a nondescript one...

928
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:11,126
The grave robbers' tools are
still stored in the shed.

929
01:32:40,688 --> 01:32:43,891
Our land, my comrades...

930
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:45,193
"Blood Iron Alliance?"

931
01:32:51,466 --> 01:32:54,102
We've prevented
further organ damage for now,

932
01:32:54,169 --> 01:32:57,538
we'll need to conduct more tests,

933
01:32:57,605 --> 01:33:00,241
but he needs to
regain consciousness...

934
01:33:01,276 --> 01:33:02,777
It's quite unusual...

935
01:33:03,545 --> 01:33:05,546
What in the world...

936
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:07,915
Thankfully, he's out of the woods

937
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:09,917
but he injured his spine.

938
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:11,052
Will he be able to walk?

939
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:12,420
He'll have to work through it,

940
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:14,155
but at least he's still healthy.

941
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:17,892
What the hell have you been doing?

942
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:19,427
Spill it.

943
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:22,497
- Gwang-sim,
- Yes.

944
01:33:22,564 --> 01:33:24,165
I smell a stench from him.

945
01:33:27,235 --> 01:33:29,104
I know, that's why I called you.

946
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:32,107
Let's play goblins for once.

947
01:33:33,975 --> 01:33:35,410
Ja-hye, get it together.

948
01:33:35,477 --> 01:33:36,844
Go lock the door.

949
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:42,617
(Chapter 6
Iron Stake)

950
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:49,457
Bae Ji-dang, Lee Chung-gu,

Jeon Tae-hwan, Im Chung-sin...

955
01:34:06,841 --> 01:34:07,976
I get it…

956
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:11,846
They look too resolute
to be grave robbers...

957
01:34:40,975 --> 01:34:44,145
Ladies, it's been so long.

958
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:45,813
Is everyone here?

959
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,748
I just got here.

960
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:51,018
The harvest is over
and it's getting cold,

961
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:52,120
everyone well?

962
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:54,956
With you all here,

963
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:57,291
I should've cooked something.

964
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:58,960
Don't you worry,

965
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:02,864
I brought rice cakes
and boiled some pork.

966
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:06,501
I knew I smelled something tasty,

967
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:08,136
did you bring enough?

968
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:10,938
I brought so much.

969
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:13,040
There's more than
enough for everyone.

970
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:15,143
Should I get Mr. Jang over yonder

971
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:16,777
and the Mrs. Jecheon too?

972
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:19,113
Why fetch those busy bees?

973
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:21,182
Let's just eat quietly
by ourselves…

974
01:35:21,249 --> 01:35:23,417
Yeah, let's not bring others.

975
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:25,720
Did you bring some sweetfish?

976
01:35:31,526 --> 01:35:32,360
Who's that?

977
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,996
I think Mr. Yoon is here.

978
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:38,366
No way, didn't you hear
what happened to him?

979
01:35:38,433 --> 01:35:42,203
Yeah, there's no way he came.

980
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:45,206
What are you talking about?
Fill me in, will you?

981
01:35:45,273 --> 01:35:46,808
Don't even mention it.

982
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:50,711
I heard he met
something really vicious.

983
01:35:50,778 --> 01:35:53,014
How vicious was it for him to be
bedridden?

984
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:55,149
How vicious was it for him
to be bedridden?

985
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:56,117
You haven't heard?

986
01:35:57,518 --> 01:36:00,221
He met someone
in the middle of the night.

987
01:36:01,556 --> 01:36:03,491
What a load of crap...

988
01:36:05,193 --> 01:36:07,061
Oh gosh, Mr. Yoon?

989
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:10,999
What made you scared like this?

990
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:15,069
He looks fine.

991
01:36:16,371 --> 01:36:20,708
Who was it? The one you met.

992
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:23,111
Can you let us know?

993
01:36:25,913 --> 01:36:28,850
Lord.

994
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:33,554
Lord? Which one?

995
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:42,764
Spit it out.

996
01:36:50,872 --> 01:36:54,809
My lord, the one
who cut down 10,000 foes.

997
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:01,783
Where...

998
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:05,253
is your lord now?

999
01:37:26,474 --> 01:37:30,244
38.3417, 128.3189.

1000
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:33,414
38.3417, 128.3189.

1001
01:37:34,248 --> 01:37:37,719
38.3417, 128.3189.

1002
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,155
A Japanese ghost...

1003
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:47,328
He's the general
who protects that site.

1004
01:38:03,845 --> 01:38:05,146
What the ...

1005
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:10,618
Lord! Look at me!

1006
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:15,323
I'm right here!
I want to be your vessel!

1007
01:38:30,671 --> 01:38:33,174
I'll offer him that meat...

1008
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:36,811
Ja-hye.

1009
01:38:37,512 --> 01:38:39,280
Come closer.

1010
01:38:39,347 --> 01:38:41,282
Please help me, Ja-hye...

1011
01:38:48,055 --> 01:38:51,325
Idiots, you're all going to die.

1012
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:07,341
Hwa-rim! Don't do this.

1013
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:08,943
It's a Japanese ghost.

1014
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:10,378
I know.

1015
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:13,347
They'll kill anything and everyone

1016
01:39:13,414 --> 01:39:15,516
for just being nearby!

1017
01:39:16,717 --> 01:39:18,285
You saw what happened in Japan.

1018
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:20,788
Don't you dare go near it.

1019
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:24,392
Even if your grandma
protects you,

1020
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:26,994
this is not right.

1021
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:28,329
Let's go, Ja-hye.

1022
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:29,597
What about Bong-gil then?

1023
01:39:33,401 --> 01:39:35,236
I'll call you, let's go.

1024
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:52,487
So that thing was
really buried down there?

1025
01:39:54,088 --> 01:39:56,257
It means it's back in
its original spot...

1026
01:39:57,625 --> 01:40:00,194
Why were you there
in the first place?

1027
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:02,363
Huh?

1028
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:04,832
Park Ji-yong said to me
before he died,

1029
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:09,704
"The fox severed
the tiger's waist."

1030
01:40:11,472 --> 01:40:12,740
What does it mean?

1031
01:40:12,807 --> 01:40:14,975
In geomancy, our peninsula

1032
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:17,445
is metaphorically
compared to a tiger,

1033
01:40:18,412 --> 01:40:20,881
one that is grasping
the continent.

1034
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:21,849
So?

1035
01:40:21,916 --> 01:40:25,119
And the coordinates
written on the gravestone.

1036
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:26,587
Where could it be?

1037
01:40:27,255 --> 01:40:29,223
You see, that's the spot.

1038
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:30,525
Exactly where
the tiger's waist is.

1039
01:40:31,526 --> 01:40:34,061
That Fox Diviner
Hwa-rim mentioned,

1040
01:40:35,196 --> 01:40:39,667
that fox bit down!

1041
01:40:40,268 --> 01:40:42,336
He inserted a stake in there.

1042
01:40:47,275 --> 01:40:49,710
What about Park's coffin
on top of it?

1043
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:54,281
Since these resolute looking men

1044
01:40:54,348 --> 01:40:56,450
were going around
to pull them out,

1045
01:40:56,517 --> 01:40:57,618
they intentionally buried

1046
01:40:57,685 --> 01:40:59,286
a high ranking official
on top of it.

1047
01:40:59,353 --> 01:41:00,788
So that they couldn't
even go near it.

1048
01:41:00,855 --> 01:41:03,090
Then why is a ghost there?

1049
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:05,660
Hm?

1050
01:41:07,795 --> 01:41:12,833
He's the general
who protects that site.

1051
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:21,509
38.3417, 128.3189.

1052
01:41:22,343 --> 01:41:23,444
The ghost was...

1053
01:41:24,645 --> 01:41:26,581
probably protecting
the iron stake.

1054
01:41:41,329 --> 01:41:42,596
Hwa-rim,

1055
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:45,333
we have a business relationship,

1056
01:41:46,567 --> 01:41:48,335
but let me ask you a favor
that won't make you money.

1057
01:41:48,402 --> 01:41:50,504
Don't say anything
you'll regret later.

1058
01:41:50,571 --> 01:41:52,506
Do you still believe

1059
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:54,375
in national spirit,
or how Korea was divided

1060
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:55,876
in half with iron stakes?

1061
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:57,645
Those stakes at the temple

1062
01:41:57,712 --> 01:42:00,180
were for land surveying,
you know that.

1063
01:42:00,247 --> 01:42:03,284
They said 99% of them were
fake at the conference.

1064
01:42:03,351 --> 01:42:04,251
1% then?

1065
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:08,222
- Mr. Ko.
- What is it?

1066
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:10,724
You know that's not
an ordinary grave.

1067
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:13,227
This was planned meticulously.

1068
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:18,032
You saw people die
because of that grave.

1069
01:42:18,099 --> 01:42:19,266
Do you really want to be next?

1070
01:42:20,101 --> 01:42:21,168
Mr. Kim.

1071
01:42:21,235 --> 01:42:26,407
Stake or not, we lived good lives
without much trouble.

1072
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:28,208
So, why the change of heart?

1073
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:29,310
Fine.

1074
01:42:30,044 --> 01:42:34,949
You and I lived well by
selling land to rich pricks.

1075
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:37,017
That's what bothers me.

1076
01:42:37,084 --> 01:42:39,153
Mr. Ko, this is about the land!

1077
01:42:40,855 --> 01:42:42,523
Land that my unborn grandchild

1078
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:44,224
will step on and live on.

1079
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:47,127
Land for all of us,

1080
01:42:47,194 --> 01:42:48,696
and our future generations.

1081
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:54,969
Hwa-rim, you said it's an anima.

1082
01:42:55,036 --> 01:42:57,571
If it's an anima
attached to the iron,

1083
01:42:57,638 --> 01:43:00,140
we just have to
pull out that iron stake.

1084
01:43:00,207 --> 01:43:03,210
With that done,
Bong-gil will recover.

1085
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:12,753
But that general is
guarding that place.

1086
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:14,722
How the heck do we pull it out?

1087
01:43:14,789 --> 01:43:17,625
You saw the size of that thing...

1088
01:43:19,393 --> 01:43:21,395
Summon like a beast,

1089
01:43:23,764 --> 01:43:24,865
speak like an anima.

1090
01:43:28,569 --> 01:43:30,604
You really think it's doable?

1091
01:43:30,671 --> 01:43:32,940
There are things we can
pull off and things we can't.

1092
01:43:33,007 --> 01:43:37,111
I'm sorry to say,
that ghost cannot be eliminated.

1093
01:43:38,245 --> 01:43:39,380
Japanese ghosts will not hesitate

1094
01:43:40,281 --> 01:43:43,884
to kill even without a reason.

1095
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:48,422
It can't be eliminated,

1096
01:43:51,792 --> 01:43:53,360
but I can distract it for a bit.

1097
01:43:55,029 --> 01:43:57,064
I can buy us time.

1098
01:44:06,107 --> 01:44:07,241
Bong-gil!

1099
01:44:10,611 --> 01:44:13,247
Could I get some more betadine?

1100
01:44:13,314 --> 01:44:15,616
Wipe it with saline,
and apply gauze.

1101
01:44:15,683 --> 01:44:16,650
Yes, ma'am.

1102
01:44:17,485 --> 01:44:18,853
Wait a minute...

1103
01:44:23,891 --> 01:44:25,793
That idiot avoided the tattoos.

1104
01:44:27,027 --> 01:44:28,496
What kind of tattoos are those?

1105
01:44:29,797 --> 01:44:31,065
It's a Buddhist scripture.

1106
01:44:56,257 --> 01:44:57,658
My apologies,

1107
01:44:58,359 --> 01:45:00,895
we had some reports of
wild animal activities here.

1108
01:45:03,597 --> 01:45:05,499
You, uh...

1109
01:45:05,566 --> 01:45:07,134
Where...

1110
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:10,171
are you going?

1111
01:45:11,205 --> 01:45:16,043
We're here to weed out
graves in that mountain.

1112
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:19,780
I see, the military is
conducting a search

1113
01:45:19,847 --> 01:45:22,416
starting with that mountain.

1114
01:45:22,483 --> 01:45:26,453
We'll finish quickly and
come back down soon.

1115
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:27,688
Very well.

1116
01:45:28,088 --> 01:45:29,590
Let them through!

1117
01:46:25,813 --> 01:46:28,248
Pull out, pull out,
return to base...

1118
01:46:28,315 --> 01:46:29,950
We gave it what it wanted,

1119
01:46:30,017 --> 01:46:32,286
it'll wake up after midnight.

1120
01:46:33,621 --> 01:46:35,356
If you can lure it
to the yew tree,

1121
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:38,525
I'll buy us as much time as I can.

1122
01:46:38,993 --> 01:46:41,662
We'll pull it out quickly,

1123
01:46:41,729 --> 01:46:44,231
just get us 30 minutes.

1124
01:46:44,298 --> 01:46:46,700
When you pull out
the iron stake...

1125
01:46:49,904 --> 01:46:52,406
make sure to cleanse it
with horse blood immediately.

1126
01:46:54,975 --> 01:46:56,377
Mr. Kim.

1127
01:46:56,977 --> 01:47:00,881
That iron stake
should be there, right?

1128
01:47:04,885 --> 01:47:06,420
100%.

1129
01:47:14,261 --> 01:47:16,563
Please look after
Bong-gil tonight.

1130
01:47:17,197 --> 01:47:19,466
If things go wrong,
he'll be in danger.

1131
01:47:41,355 --> 01:47:44,591
Stop staring, she said
it'll show up after midnight.

1132
01:47:57,671 --> 01:47:59,039
Mr. Ko,

1133
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,442
thank you for coming with me.

1134
01:48:02,509 --> 01:48:04,144
"One person can be
vulnerable alone,"

1135
01:48:04,211 --> 01:48:06,413
"but two, standing together,
can conquer."

1136
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,149
"Three are even stronger,
like a tightly woven cord."

1137
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:11,585
Ecclesiastes 4:12.

1138
01:48:14,355 --> 01:48:15,222
Amen.

1139
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:37,011
I wish we don't have to kill it.

1140
01:48:38,412 --> 01:48:40,247
It'll die instead of him.

1141
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:45,586
And you like fried chicken,
what's the matter?

1142
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,969
Have you filled your belly?

1143
01:52:06,653 --> 01:52:07,621
It's here.

1144
01:52:19,967 --> 01:52:22,202
Is someone there?

1145
01:52:27,174 --> 01:52:29,676
My mountain is being disturbed.

1146
01:52:34,314 --> 01:52:38,118
Does this mountain belong to you?

1147
01:52:40,554 --> 01:52:43,924
Indeed, this is my mountain.

1148
01:52:44,725 --> 01:52:48,028
Stupid old tree god...

1149
01:52:48,729 --> 01:52:52,833
How is it that I do not hear
any guns or bayonets?

1150
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:55,302
You are mistaken.

1151
01:52:56,837 --> 01:52:58,405
The war has ended a long time ago.

1152
01:52:58,472 --> 01:52:59,806
No!

1153
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:03,176
Our war has not ended yet!

1154
01:53:15,422 --> 01:53:19,459
Why have you come here?

1155
01:53:22,129 --> 01:53:27,567
That fox brought me
here on the battlefield,

1156
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:30,470
instead of the Namsan shrine

1157
01:53:30,537 --> 01:53:32,606
when I was kept in Daitoku-ji.

1158
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:37,377
Probably under Katahito's order.

1159
01:53:37,444 --> 01:53:40,747
Or Makoto's.

1160
01:53:48,722 --> 01:53:50,924
This is a quaint land now.

1161
01:53:51,525 --> 01:53:53,593
You do not belong here anymore.

1162
01:53:57,497 --> 01:54:00,267
No, no.

1163
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:03,770
We must continue heading North.

1164
01:54:04,204 --> 01:54:06,773
Raise your bayonets
and head North!

1165
01:54:07,274 --> 01:54:09,709
Head North!

1166
01:54:09,776 --> 01:54:13,647
A brave warrior never retreats.

1167
01:54:21,888 --> 01:54:22,789
I don't get it.

1168
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:24,458
There's nothing here.

1169
01:54:29,596 --> 01:54:31,865
As the ruler of this place,
I will ask again.

1170
01:54:32,933 --> 01:54:35,135
Since when have you been here?

1171
01:54:36,303 --> 01:54:38,338
Retain your respect for me!

1172
01:54:39,606 --> 01:54:43,176
I am the embodiment of fear.

1173
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:45,578
This is my land!

1174
01:54:45,645 --> 01:54:46,479
I'll ask you again,

1175
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:48,548
what are you?

1176
01:54:55,288 --> 01:54:57,424
It's not here...

1177
01:54:59,793 --> 01:55:00,927
There's nothing here!

1178
01:55:00,994 --> 01:55:01,962
You said you were 100%!

1179
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:13,206
It must be here...

1180
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:15,475
Remember.

1181
01:55:16,777 --> 01:55:21,514
At Sekigahara,
I've already transcended

1182
01:55:21,581 --> 01:55:23,583
the mortal form.

1183
01:55:23,650 --> 01:55:26,119
I am the god of the battlefield!

1184
01:55:26,186 --> 01:55:30,490
My undecaying lord.
You are a burning sword!

1185
01:55:31,258 --> 01:55:34,794
38.3417, 128.3189.

1186
01:55:34,861 --> 01:55:37,397
The fox has put a curse on me.

1187
01:55:37,464 --> 01:55:40,333
I must protect this site.

1188
01:55:52,913 --> 01:55:55,315
Do you have someone captive?

1189
01:55:57,584 --> 01:56:01,121
Please free the human
you hold captive!

1190
01:56:02,055 --> 01:56:03,056
Now!

1191
01:56:03,890 --> 01:56:05,158
I beg of you!

1192
01:56:14,267 --> 01:56:15,202
A human.

1193
01:56:16,903 --> 01:56:18,438
Forward.

1194
01:56:19,573 --> 01:56:21,374
Forward.

1195
01:56:21,942 --> 01:56:23,143
Forward.

1196
01:56:25,545 --> 01:56:27,147
Forward.

1197
01:56:37,123 --> 01:56:39,493
An old hag...

1198
01:57:10,457 --> 01:57:11,357
Did you find it?

1199
01:57:11,424 --> 01:57:12,826
It's not there. There's nothing...

1200
01:57:12,893 --> 01:57:13,793
What do you mean?

1201
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:16,196
We couldn't find anything,
we have to pull out!

1202
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:34,080
Mr. Kim!

1203
01:57:38,051 --> 01:57:40,186
This can't be...

1204
01:57:41,421 --> 01:57:44,024
It must be here…

1205
01:57:52,799 --> 01:57:55,969
38.3417, 128.3189!

1206
01:57:56,036 --> 01:57:59,506
My lord, please return!

1207
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:03,643
38.3417, 128.3189!

1208
01:58:03,710 --> 01:58:05,679
Kim Sang-duk!

1209
01:58:18,258 --> 01:58:20,927
Mr. Kim! Get out of there!

1210
01:58:34,107 --> 01:58:36,276
Then why is that ghost there?

1211
01:58:36,343 --> 01:58:38,244
He said he's a general
protecting the site.

1212
01:58:38,311 --> 01:58:40,146
It means it's back
in its original spot...

1213
01:58:40,213 --> 01:58:42,382
Have you seen
a coffin buried vertically?

1214
01:58:46,486 --> 01:58:47,954
Fire...

1215
01:58:49,022 --> 01:58:51,958
And it digs into the ground.

1216
01:58:53,026 --> 01:58:54,461
Get out!

1217
01:59:09,476 --> 01:59:11,144
Will you become my servant?

1218
01:59:13,847 --> 01:59:15,482
If not,

1219
01:59:16,349 --> 01:59:18,418
will you offer your liver to me?

1220
01:59:23,056 --> 01:59:26,860
It has been over 500 years
since I memorized

1221
01:59:28,728 --> 01:59:30,597
the scripture on your body.

1222
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:35,402
The metal piercing the ground,

1223
01:59:37,103 --> 01:59:39,272
and the fire that protects it.

1224
01:59:40,173 --> 01:59:41,608
Devour...

1225
01:59:43,143 --> 01:59:44,577
the liver, lord.

1226
01:59:45,712 --> 01:59:47,547
A fresh liver!

1227
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:54,520
No!

1228
01:59:54,587 --> 01:59:55,555
Horse blood!

1229
02:00:09,769 --> 02:00:11,671
Blood of the white horse!

1230
02:00:13,239 --> 02:00:14,407
So hot...

1231
02:00:20,013 --> 02:00:21,748
Please retreat...

1232
02:00:22,649 --> 02:00:26,853
You cannot be exposed anymore.

1233
02:00:29,756 --> 02:00:30,924
An anima.

1234
02:00:31,658 --> 02:00:33,359
Human or animal souls attached

1235
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:36,162
to objects evolve together.

1236
02:00:39,332 --> 02:00:41,735
Yes, iron...

1237
02:00:43,903 --> 02:00:47,040
You are the burning metal.

1238
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,581
Mr. Kim!

1239
02:00:55,648 --> 02:00:57,016
Snap out of it!

1240
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,384
Hurry, we have to get out.

1241
02:01:57,443 --> 02:01:58,878
Earth...

1242
02:02:01,414 --> 02:02:03,149
and wood...

1243
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:06,085
Based on the energy of the

1244
02:02:06,152 --> 02:02:08,755
earth, fire, water, wood and metal

1245
02:02:08,822 --> 02:02:10,990
form the four cardinal directions.

1246
02:02:15,995 --> 02:02:18,298
Fire and water are opposite poles,

1247
02:02:19,332 --> 02:02:22,035
and so are metal and wood.

1248
02:02:30,877 --> 02:02:32,011
That's it.

1249
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:52,832
The burning metal...

1250
02:02:55,201 --> 02:02:56,703
Opposite of that...

1251
02:02:58,104 --> 02:02:59,939
is wet wood...

1252
02:03:10,316 --> 02:03:12,819
Water conquers fire...

1253
02:03:20,894 --> 02:03:21,995
and wet wood...

1254
02:03:25,098 --> 02:03:26,900
is tougher than metal.

1255
02:03:42,849 --> 02:03:43,850
Gwang-sim, wait!

1256
02:03:45,151 --> 02:03:45,952
His blood is dark.

1257
02:04:08,107 --> 02:04:10,843
One last blow...

1258
02:04:55,888 --> 02:04:56,789
Are you okay?

1259
02:05:04,831 --> 02:05:06,265
Mr. Kim...

1260
02:05:06,332 --> 02:05:07,867
What do we do...

1261
02:05:07,934 --> 02:05:09,135
Mr. Kim!

1262
02:05:09,936 --> 02:05:11,938
What do we do?

1263
02:05:13,673 --> 02:05:15,208
I'm dying...

1264
02:05:16,209 --> 02:05:19,045
Thankfully, it's not that painful.

1265
02:05:19,112 --> 02:05:20,813
Hey, Kim Sang-duk!

1266
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,281
Don't die on me!

1267
02:05:22,348 --> 02:05:25,485
I always lived so close to death.

1268
02:05:27,687 --> 02:05:32,458
Yeah, this is my turn now.

1269
02:05:35,228 --> 02:05:37,964
Dying is about returning to earth.

1270
02:05:40,099 --> 02:05:42,001
Comfortably...

1271
02:05:43,970 --> 02:05:47,573
Wait, my daughter's wedding...

1272
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:50,543
Grant him the courage
to overcome the surgery.

1273
02:05:50,610 --> 02:05:53,312
Envelope him
with your precious blood, Lord.

1274
02:05:54,514 --> 02:05:56,916
All life rests within your hands.

1275
02:05:56,983 --> 02:05:58,418
Oh Lord...

1276
02:06:03,389 --> 02:06:05,658
Several people died,
and a few others

1277
02:06:05,725 --> 02:06:07,960
were injured in the past few days.

1278
02:06:08,394 --> 02:06:10,329
(Black Bear Captured This Morning)

1279
02:06:10,396 --> 02:06:12,832
After several days of searching,

1280
02:06:12,899 --> 02:06:15,968
soldiers captured a bear,

1281
02:06:17,070 --> 02:06:19,939
and the media had many debates

1282
02:06:20,006 --> 02:06:21,541
whether to kill
this innocent bear.

1283
02:06:23,810 --> 02:06:26,679
For the safety of villagers...

1284
02:06:26,746 --> 02:06:29,248
Huh? He opened his eyes.

1285
02:06:31,150 --> 02:06:32,351
Mr. Kim.

1286
02:06:32,985 --> 02:06:35,121
Are you awake?

1287
02:06:35,188 --> 02:06:37,189
Thankfully,
Mr. Kim's recovery was rapid

1288
02:06:37,256 --> 02:06:39,559
despite his age.

1289
02:06:41,127 --> 02:06:42,695
And Bong-gil...

1290
02:06:43,563 --> 02:06:44,430
Well...

1291
02:06:44,497 --> 02:06:46,265
Speak of the devil.

1292
02:06:47,066 --> 02:06:48,668
Seriously?

1293
02:06:49,635 --> 02:06:50,870
This is our meal.

1294
02:06:50,937 --> 02:06:52,138
How could you eat without me?

1295
02:06:52,205 --> 02:06:54,140
- Here, eat.
- Give me a slice.

1296
02:07:07,019 --> 02:07:08,754
Is this a diner?

1297
02:07:08,821 --> 02:07:10,690
Why are you always eating here?

1298
02:07:11,190 --> 02:07:12,958
You think I'm eating
because I want to?

1299
02:07:13,025 --> 02:07:15,061
I'm stuffing myself
because it's so good.

1300
02:07:15,128 --> 02:07:16,495
It's good.

1301
02:07:16,562 --> 02:07:19,799
You have to fast,
so someone has to eat these.

1302
02:07:20,433 --> 02:07:22,735
Think of it as a diet.

1303
02:07:29,876 --> 02:07:33,980
Winter has passed and
we all went back to our lives.

1304
02:07:36,582 --> 02:07:38,017
As if nothing had happened...

1305
02:07:38,084 --> 02:07:39,252
Let's go!

1306
02:08:02,608 --> 02:08:07,680
While I live briefly
in this world,

1307
02:08:07,747 --> 02:08:12,652
always singing praises

1308
02:08:13,186 --> 02:08:18,457
When the day fades away,

1309
02:08:18,524 --> 02:08:24,096
I shall proceed in glory

1310
02:08:24,163 --> 02:08:25,698
Through the gate of heaven...

1311
02:08:25,765 --> 02:08:28,901
I told you it has to
face West, did I not?

1312
02:08:28,968 --> 02:08:32,104
Facing South isn't
always a good thing!

1313
02:08:32,171 --> 02:08:34,140
So, what should we do?

1314
02:08:44,483 --> 02:08:48,054
Bride and groom will
now bow the parents.

1315
02:08:48,788 --> 02:08:50,489
Bow.

1316
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:06,105
All families of bride and groom,
please step forward.

1317
02:09:06,172 --> 02:09:07,640
Hey, Mr. Ko!

1318
02:09:08,808 --> 02:09:09,909
Get over here!

1319
02:09:11,177 --> 02:09:13,779
It's a family photo,
why should we be included?

1320
02:09:16,549 --> 02:09:18,150
Let's just take one photo.

1321
02:09:18,217 --> 02:09:19,852
Just one photo,

1322
02:09:19,919 --> 02:09:21,620
- we're practically family.
- Let's just go...

1323
02:09:21,687 --> 02:09:23,289
But it's a family photo...

1324
02:09:26,259 --> 02:09:27,826
The tall gentleman in the middle,

1325
02:09:27,893 --> 02:09:29,828
please take a step up.

1326
02:09:29,895 --> 02:09:33,466
The gentleman in glasses,
please come closer.

1327
02:09:34,166 --> 02:09:35,534
Make sure you don't...

1328
02:09:35,601 --> 02:09:39,638
Father and daughter's bellies
are the same size.

1329
02:09:39,705 --> 02:09:41,207
Here we go.

1330
02:09:42,541 --> 02:09:45,311
Bride's father, please look ahead.

1331
02:09:45,378 --> 02:09:47,613
That's great, everyone!

1332
02:09:48,414 --> 02:09:49,982
Let's all smile.

1333
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:52,218
One,

1334
02:09:52,285 --> 02:09:53,085
two,

1335
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:53,919
three!

1336
02:09:53,986 --> 02:09:59,392
