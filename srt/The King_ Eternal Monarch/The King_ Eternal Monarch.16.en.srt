ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,982
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,069
EPISODE 16

4
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,836
When is she getting home? Goodness.

5
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,634
Dad, I'm on a stakeout tonight.
I have to go pretty far.

6
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,718
Gosh.

7
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,401
Catch that jerk no matter what.
And make sure you don't skip a meal.

8
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,237
I'm doing fine, so don't worry.

9
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,452
Talk soon, Dad.

10
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,696
Walk.

11
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,927
KINGDOM OF COREA, 1994
THE NIGHT OF THE TREASON

12
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,116
Tell me what needs to be done.
I'll lead the way.

13
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,785
The traitors will arrive here
in about 20 minutes.

14
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,622
Yeong, I want you to stay here
and stop them from getting away.

15
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,125
Shoot them all down
as soon as you spot them.

16
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,711
Then will you be going to
Cheonjongo alone?

17
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,423
If I fail my mission at Cheonjongo,

18
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,176
you must kill Lee Lim at all costs.

19
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,221
Your Majesty, what on earth
are you planning to do?

20
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,684
Don't tell me...

21
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,855
No. No way.

22
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,608
This is my last order.

23
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,907
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

24
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,369
I must go to Cheonjongo.

25
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,204
I...

26
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,249
must protect my king.

27
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,543
That is my duty.

28
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,921
You cannot.

29
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,257
Yeong.

30
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,801
This is our last chance.

31
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,971
The same goes for me.

32
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,100
This is my last chance

33
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,479
to protect Your Majesty.

34
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,402
I hoped everything would unfold
exactly the same as it did that night.

35
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,282
Take care, Your Majesty.

36
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,803
At what point did things start to change?

37
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,935
FOUR TIGER SWORD

38
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,195
Beautiful equations are always simple.

39
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,950
Not everyone in the world can be brave.

40
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,035
So I decided to be brave.

41
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,454
-Captain!
-Captain!

42
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,624
No, I'll go.
Do I just have to go with this jerk?

43
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,841
Tonight,

44
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,260
I'm not alone.

45
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,387
FOUR TIGER SWORD

46
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,140
We just haven't

47
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,184
reached our destination yet.

48
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,489
So?

49
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,575
What's your plan?

50
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,368
I will wait.

51
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,997
Until Gon stops you in the past

52
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,541
and puts everything back in its place.

53
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,669
If he fails,

54
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,630
I will stop you.

55
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,177
But if my nephew restores order,

56
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,930
your memories of him will be gone.

57
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,893
That's why

58
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,770
I'm heartbroken.

59
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,941
All those radiant memories

60
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,570
are engraved deep in my heart.

61
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,001
You can't shoot here.

62
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,546
-Here, everything is at a standstill.
-How would you know

63
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,425
if no one's ever tried to fire a gun
here before?

64
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,502
Do you really think
you can hurt me with that?

65
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,343
I will try!

66
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,518
I am awaiting your order.

67
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,149
Kill him.

68
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,346
There's an emergency in Cheonjongo.
Calling all Royal Guards.

69
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,264
Royal Guards assemble immediately.

70
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,001
Why did the Manpasikjeok...

71
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,881
I must have obtained

72
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:57,967
the whole Manpasikjeok.

73
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,431
Finally, I got my hands

74
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,269
on the whole Manpasikjeok.

75
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,433
If mine is gone,

76
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,979
the other half that my nephew had
is probably gone too.

77
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,106
What now?

78
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,152
This means that Gon can never come back.

79
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,324
And you're stuck here with me
for an eternity.

80
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,084
Your Majesty!

81
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,669
-Your Majesty.
-Your Highness.

82
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,506
-Your Majesty!
-Your Highness!

83
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,466
-Where is His Majesty?
-Your Highness!

84
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,634
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

85
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,678
-Your Highness, where are you?
-Are you okay?

86
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,471
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

87
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,807
-Your Highness!
-Where are you?

88
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,433
-Your Majesty!
-Your Highness!

89
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,143
Your Highness!

90
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,735
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty.

91
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,571
-Your Highness!
-Your Majesty...

92
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,823
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

93
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,409
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

94
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,785
-Your Majesty.
-Are you all right?

95
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:34,582
Take His Majesty and His Highness
to the hospital at once!

96
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,833
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness.

97
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,975
From now on,
you are the Unbreakable Sword.

98
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,981
Mom.

99
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,276
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

100
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,198
It's a very long story.

101
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,033
Gosh, my dear son...

102
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,035
There's something

103
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,038
-dad's been hiding from you.
-Look how you've grown.

104
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,122
To be exact,

105
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,960
it's about your son, Kang Sin-jae.

106
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,378
My baby...

107
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,927
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

108
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,888
Sin-jae.

109
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,475
I had no idea.

110
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,770
You.

111
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,939
When did you find out?

112
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,733
That Sin-jae...
The fact that my son is in this mess.

113
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,528
How long have you been
hiding this from me?

114
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,489
What will you do about this?

115
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,033
Bring my son back!

116
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:38,789
What will you do?
What are you going to do about this?

117
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,625
Gosh, I can't believe this.

118
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,672
My poor baby...

119
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,610
Sin-jae!

120
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,116
Sin-jae!

121
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,453
Mom.

122
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,130
I'm sorry.

123
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,758
I should have given you a hug.

124
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,012
You're also my son.

125
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,848
I know it's not your fault.

126
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,018
I should have given you a hug first.

127
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,228
I'm...

128
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,439
I'm really sorry.

129
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,232
Sorry.

130
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,451
Mom.

131
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,337
I was right.

132
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,006
I was right after all.

133
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,971
This must be the door to another world.

134
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,722
Traitor Lee Lim.

135
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,381
Who the hell are you?

136
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,176
Why are you after me?

137
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,638
And why do you have the Four Tiger Sword?

138
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,851
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea,

139
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,062
the rightful owner
of the Four Tiger Sword,

140
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,609
and the one who will carry out
your capital punishment.

141
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,943
The King?

142
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,030
The King just died at my hands.

143
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,366
So how could you be the King?

144
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,579
I suppose my dear nephew has failed

145
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,166
seeing how I'm still alive and well.

146
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,339
No, you're not.

147
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,010
If Gon has failed, you won't be for long.

148
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,649
I must say, it is quite entertaining
to watch how foolishly hopeful you are.

149
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,112
But I will no longer tolerate
your insolence.

150
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,870
TAEKWONDO

151
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,866
"The sky bestows the heart upon us,

152
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,452
and the ground helps the spirit."

153
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,121
"The sun and the moon are formed.

154
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,167
As the mountains and streams form,

155
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,754
lightning strikes."

156
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,215
You must be the Crown Prince.

157
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,015
This must be the power
of the Manpasikjeok.

158
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,851
You are

159
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,937
Lee Gon.

160
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,193
"A sage is moved to defeat
the evil of the mountains and streams."

161
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,196
"Wield it with deep thoughts

162
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,658
and make things right."

163
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,828
Traitor Lee Lim.

164
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,957
I sentence you to a beheading.

165
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,028
I thought this would break.

166
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,156
But it sprouted instead.

167
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:33,495
The door will close,
and only the memories will remain.

168
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,414
-What's with you, seriously?
-Right?

169
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,792
-I'd be happy if I didn't fail.
-Hey, you're the worst.

170
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,585
Hey.

171
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,546
I'm sorry.

172
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,389
Should I break it?

173
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,142
Or just let it be?

174
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,538
You did it.

175
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,877
Then I guess

176
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,839
you won't be able to come back.

177
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,839
If our worlds flow differently
from the present,

178
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,717
then I won't

179
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,595
be able to remember you.

180
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,766
Then I'll live without knowing you.

VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

182
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,460
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, 1994

183
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,920
I guess there is a god.

184
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,257
My husband just died.

185
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,347
I prayed every day that he'd die.

186
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,808
I thought I would

187
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,396
end up either dying or killing him

188
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,067
before leaving this house.

189
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,494
But...

190
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,914
someone else killed him

191
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,125
for me.

192
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,178
Ji-hun and I...

193
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,642
have nowhere to go, Seong-jae.

194
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,396
So...

195
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,153
you'll have to go.

196
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,743
Don't worry.

197
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,788
I won't do what Ji-hun's dad did.

198
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:42,262
I can't look after you at home
because I have to work.

199
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,725
Ji-hun and I will visit you
at least once a month.

200
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,524
I love you, Uncle. From Ji-hun.

201
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,946
Let's just die together.

202
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,198
-Let's die together.
-No!

203
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,825
-Hyeon-min!
-Mom!

204
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,494
-Let's die together.
-Don't do this.

205
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,455
-Mom, no!
-Hyeon-min!

206
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,623
-Mom! Stop!
-I'm really sorry!

207
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,043
It will only take a second. Hyeon-min!

208
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,129
-I'm so sorry!
-Stop...

209
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,089
-I'm sorry.
-Stop!

210
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,341
Don't mind us and just be on your way!

211
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,968
-Mom, no...
-What on earth are you doing?

212
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,428
-Mom!
-Come here.

213
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,889
All of you.

214
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,726
Back off.
You scared this lady and her son.

215
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,352
Mom.

216
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,529
Kiddo, here's your shoe.

217
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,823
Here. Oh, hold on.

218
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,744
There.

219
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,040
Prince Buyeong?

220
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,962
Yes, that's me.

221
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,131
What is your name?

222
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,930
I'm Kang Hyeon-min.

223
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:11,392
I assume it's "Hyeon" as in "to shine,"
and "Min" as in "jade."

224
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,480
Your name means that you're someone
who "shines like a jewel."

225
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,614
Why would a member of the royal family
bother to talk to people like us?

226
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,659
I'm talking to you as a parent,

227
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,787
not as a member of the royal family.

228
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,665
Your choices determine your destiny,

229
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:38,628
but no one gets to choose their parents.

230
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,923
So change this choice of yours

231
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:47,554
for the choice you make will determine
this boy's fate.

232
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,646
How about we go have a cup of tea?

233
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,649
That's what I'd prescribe to you
as a doctor.

234
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,954
KINGDOM OF COREA, 1999

235
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,247
-Is this it?
-Yes.

236
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,833
-Have a nice day.
-You too. Take care.

237

KOO SEO-RYEONG

238
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,307
Look at that.

239
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,143
How dare you glare at me? You thief.

240
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,194
How old are you? And what's your name?

241
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,155
This kid doesn't have a name.

242
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,366
I'm sure she's stolen
from every vendor at this market.

243
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,453
I do have a name. I'm Luna.

244
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,373
That's such a pretty name.

245
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:02,086
My daughter is very strong, isn't she?

246
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,839
I want to apologize to you on her behalf.

247
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,382
Do you want to come in for food?

248
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,468
What are you talking about?
You need to call the police.

249
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,595
What are you? A charity worker?

250
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,642
It's all right. Here, come on.

251
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,110
Have some food first,

252
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,029
and you can take this.

253
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,114
You can't take the whole thing.

254
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,283
I didn't sell much today.

255
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,757
Why would you give me this?
Is it too little?

256
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,427
I'm paying for the food.

257
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,139
Really?

258
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,017
You're paying too much.

259
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,146
You'll have to eat a lot, okay?

260
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,505
Are you all right? Do you need some help?

261
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,340
-Isn't that a gun?
-That's blood!

262
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,134
What is going on? She's bleeding!

263
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,517
My goodness. What do we do?

264
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,645
-We should go.
-Where am I?

265
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,732
Is this the Republic of Korea?

266
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,610
What's the date today?

267
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,612
Yes, this is the Republic of Korea.

268
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,407
And today is April 25, 2020.

269
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,497
I'm a police officer.
Can I use your phone to make a quick call?

270
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,633
Chief Park?

271
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,719
Chief Park.

272
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,471
It's me, Tae-eul.

273
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,683
Where's Jangmi?
What about Detective Shim and Sin-jae?

274
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:43,331
For me, only about a week had passed.

275
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,836
KIND CIVIL POLICE
ALWAYS BY THE CITIZENS' SIDE

276
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,963
-There she is.
-Here she comes.

277
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,842
-Why did you kill your fellow actress?
-Was it because of the role?

278
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,344
-Any comments?
-How do you feel?

279
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,929
-Anything you'd like to say?
-Tell us!

280
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,597
-What was your motive?
-Do you admit to the crime?

281
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,600
The world seemed unchanged,
yet some things

282
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,727
had unfolded differently.

283
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,812
What did you say?

284
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,647
I was still a lieutenant.

285
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,065
Are you running a charity?

286
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,734
And I still tried to do something nice
for my dad once a month.

287
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,913
And I lived everyday

288
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,542
with my memories of him still intact,

289
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:33,422
in a world where he or Sin-jae

290
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,926
no longer exists.

291
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:47,979
It's not you, right?

292
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,107
-Pardon?
-You're not the one

293
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,692
who keeps calling my hubby out.

294
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:56,988
It is me.

295
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,573
I did that.

296
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,617
-Get going.
-Okay.

297
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,672
CIRCLE MART, ILSAN CITY BRANCH
BACKPACK, SNEAKERS 110,000 WON

298
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:18,176
The person who keeps calling my hubby over
must be starting school next year.

299
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,853
Bo-gyeong!

300
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,324
You...

301
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,204
Hee-ju.

302
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,416
When snow piles up,
it can make some roofs collapse.

303
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,628
The weight of snow

304
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,923
can be unbearable to some 16-year-old kid.

305
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,051
Is that your solitude?

306
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,677
Yes.

307
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,471
You could say that.

308
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,974
Do you remember Seong-min's friend?

309
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,852
-Yes.
-That's his grandmother and sister.

310
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:13,814
As you can probably guess,
his grandmother is very ill.

311
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,068
He couldn't pay the hospital bills,

312
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,197
so he stole money from the safe
at his job.

313
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,658
-And?
-And

314
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,662
he asked me for a favor
before he got arrested.

315
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,875
He asked me to buy his sister
a bag of steamed buns.

316
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,293
And he also asked me

317
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,589
to remove snow from their roof.

318
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:45,596
That's why I started visiting her,
and here I am.

319
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,517
She needs hope
to get through it all, you know?

320
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,897
But I had no idea I'd see you here.

321
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:58,609
My goodness, seriously.

322
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,405
Come on. I thought you were
here to plow snow.

323
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,825
Honey, shall we hold hands?

324
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,036
Well, how about I build a snowman for you?

LEE JI-HUN

326
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,184
If that door closes,

327
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,771
I'll open every single door
in the universe.

328
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,230
And

329
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,609
I'll come to you.

330
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,000
You promised you'd come.

331
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,768
Who might you be?

332
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,186
Can I help you?

333
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,897
I'm looking for someone,

334
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,609
but it doesn't look like
she's in this world.

335
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,863
All right, then.

336
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,131
Can I help you?

337
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,804
Even here,

338
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,641
you're busy protecting someone.

339
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,769
JEONG EUN-KYEONG
REPUBLIC OF KOREA ARMY

340
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,609
-Tae-ra, we're here.
-Okay.

341
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,153
Tae-ra, be careful
not to step on the dress.

342
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,905
Hold on. Here.

343
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,615
Hyeong-taek.

344
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,201
Where's my trophy?

345
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,036
My trophy for the Grand Prize.

346
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,329
It's in the boss' car.

347
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,955
-I'll bring it tomorrow.
-Grand Prize,

348
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,875
Jeong Tae-ra!

349
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,508
Once again, I'd like to sincerely thank
Hyeong-taek, Yeong-han, Eun-gi

350
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,886
and Hye-yeon. I owe it all to you guys.

351
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,809
Hey, who's that handsome man?

352
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,730
Are you a member of Tae-ra Byte?

353
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,275
Sorry, no photos.
I'll take those flowers though.

354
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,069
It seems like

355
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,613
you already received flowers.

356
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,574
These flowers

357
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,660
are not for you.

358
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,121
I can't believe what I just heard.

359
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,124
Why aren't they for me?

360
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,212
I'm Jeong Tae-ra,
the winner of the Grand Prize.

361
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,923
I won the Grand Prize today.

362
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,234
Who are you?

363
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,571
Hyo-jin!

364
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,199
Mom, why did you buy so much stuff?
It must be heavy.

365
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,993
-I should have gone with you.
-It's okay.

366
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,453
Oh, who's this young man?

367
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,166
Are you here to see Hyo-jin?

368
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,043
Mom, no.

369
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,631
I'm sorry, but who are you looking for?

370
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,427
In this world,

371
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,929
you're with your mother.

372
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,349
I'm glad.

373
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,400
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, 2021

374
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:33,986
Hey, Na-ri.

375
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,863
Tae-eul, don't be surprised.

376
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,948
I think your dad bought a horse.

377
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,659
-A horse?
-Yes.

378
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,705
There's some guy on a white horse
at the Taekwondo center now.

379
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,540
I guess he's selling the horse.

380
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,209
This guy looks like a pro.

381
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,466
Na-ri, I have to go.

382
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,374
You exist

383
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,126
across every universe.

384
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,465
And you still don't recognize me.

385
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,931
But you...

386
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,184
Why are you crying?

387
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,355
You seemed happy
in every world that I saw you.

388
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,482
It was the only thing that comforted me.

389
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,697
But you...

390
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,412
Why do you look
as though you recognize me?

391
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,665
Why do you look

392
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,336
as though you remember
everything about me?

393
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,433
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

394
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,820
Is it you?

395
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,659
Jeong Tae-eul.

396
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,789
Is it really you? Yes?

397
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,711
You came?

398
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:58,881
You really

399
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:00,841
came for me?

400
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,012
You've finally

401
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,431
arrived.

402
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:13,979
Finally.

403
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,525
I finally got to see you,

404
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,237
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

405
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,833
What took you so long?

406
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,628
I kept waiting for you.

407
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,130
Every single day,

408
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,133
I waited for you.

409
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,269
After I slew the traitor,

410
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,939
I had to go back and get Yeong.

411
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,487
DECEMBER 13, 1994, EMERGENCY ALARMS
WENT OFF IN CHEONJONGO AT 23:15

412
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:09,117
KINGDOM OF COREA, 2021

413
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:16,625
DECEMBER 14, 1994, TRAITOR LEE LIM
FOUND DEAD IN THE BAMBOO GROVE

414
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,058
So I had to find my way back again,

415
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,020
which meant I had to open
every single door in the universe.

416
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,566
That's why it took me so long.

417
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,987
And I didn't think you'd remember me
even if I did find you.

418
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,075
Yet you still

419
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,245
kept looking for me?

420
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,163
Even if you forgot all about me,

421
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:56,915
I still wanted to see you.

422
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,752
I was going to tell you again
if you had forgotten me.

423
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,299
That I am the King
of the Kingdom of Corea,

424
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,968
and that my name, which is not
supposed to be called,

425
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,971
is Lee Gon.

426
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,061
But how do you

427
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,231
still remember me
when the two worlds flowed differently?

428
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,733
Let's skip that.

429
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,279
I've also been through many things myself.

430
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,075
And now, this.

431
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,944
Do you still

432
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,322
hate flowers?

433
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,119
No, I like flowers.

434
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,541
Especially this flower.

435
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,304
I realized I haven't told you this.

436
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:39,935
I love you.

437
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,313
I am deeply...

438
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,526
in love with you.

439
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,327
So this is

440
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,748
how everything comes together.

441
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,170
I love you too.

442
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,507
I...

443
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,552
love you so much too.

444
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:46,168
KINGDOM OF COREA, 2022

445
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,795
The twins are doing well?

446
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,381
I'm stressed from babysitting them
all by myself.

447
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,009
Why did my parents
have to get back together?

448
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,511
What are their names again?

449
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,890
They go by their nicknames.

450
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,018
Eun-bi and Kka-bi.

451
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,230
Don't you miss him?

452
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,697
I'm all right.

453
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:20,118
Jo Eun-sup wouldn't remember me anyway.

454
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,793
Here's what Your Majesty
asked me to look into.

455
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:42,349
PERSONNEL FILE
HAEUNDAE POLICE STATION

456
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,786
I'm here.

457
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,287
Hey, man.

458
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,915
I told you not to call me like that.

459
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,292
You need to be quick
when your senior summons you.

460
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,254
I'm off today.

461
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,590
Gosh, I really wasn't going to say this.

462
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,758
It's my birthday today.

463
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,969
-I know.
-Really? How do you know?

464
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,053
I was forced to find out.

465
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,722
I got another one of these.

466
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,599
Chief told me to cuff you.

467
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,018
Well, it's not like all offenders
hang out at parking lots.

468
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,312
They're out in the streets.
They can be anywhere.

469
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,858
You called me over on my day off
just to give me this?

470
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,193
No, I wanted to buy you a gift.

471
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,782
You can't take it back.
I'll go pick something, then.

472
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,877
Yes, this is Kang Hyeon-min
at Violent Crimes Squad 3.

473
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:06,558
MAY 27, 2022

474
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,282
-Have you eaten yet?
-I have, of course.

475
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,826
-Did you sleep well last night?
-I sure did.

476
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,787
Hey, you should be asking me
these questions.

477
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,789
Don't you think you should be asking me

478
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,875
if I've been eating and sleeping well?

479
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,754
How I've been eating and sleeping!
And my appeal!

480
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:36,963
Do you not care?

481
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,633
Do you think cops in the Kingdom of Corea
have that much free time?

482
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,885
Had you wanted to eat and sleep well,

483
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,345
you, as an assemblywoman,

484
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:46,389
shouldn't have stolen
the people's tax money like that.

485
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,099
-Hey!
-What?

486
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,646
It's the law that's messed up.

487
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,190
Shouldn't I receive immunity
as an assemblywoman?

488
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,903
Gosh, this is why
I should've become Prime Minister.

489
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:00,820
Inmate 5827.

490
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,448
Keep it down in the visitation room.

491
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:08,995
How's Mom doing?

492
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,873
If you have time to visit me,
take better care of Mom.

493
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,959
If you want to be a good daughter,
do it yourself.

494
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,586
Take care of her yourself,
after you're released.

495
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,213
As much as I want to get out...

496
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,341
Get me a new lawyer at once!

497
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,843
-Hire someone expensive.
-Inmate 5827, keep it down!

498
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,347
Gosh.

499
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,393
Can you get me a new correctional officer?

500
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,607
His orders really get on my nerves.

501
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,318
I'm all done.

502
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,362
-Be well.
-Hey!

503
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,738
Koo Seo-gyeong!

504
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,035
-Hey, newbie.
-Yes, ma'am.

505
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,122
The NFS called. You left your phone there.

506
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,165
Really? I bought that phone yesterday.

507
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,710
Oh, it's here.

508
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,838
Can I really entrust you
with this important task?

509
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:00,922
Is it a case?

510
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,049
It will be if you don't do this properly.

511
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,553
All right.
Shred all the documents in this box.

512
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:10,432
As for these plastic bottles,
remove the lids and labels

513
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,643
-and recycle them. Go.
-Got it.

514
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,896
By the way, where do you go every weekend?

515
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,982
Why do you ask?

516
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,443
Chief told me to look into it...

517
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:26,406
Gosh, that old man. He's the one
being fishy with that solitude of his.

518
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,160
I go on a trip every weekend. Have fun.

519
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,454
See you later!

520
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,206
Gosh, they're very expensive.

521
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,042
And so many of them.

522
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,211
How could you sell all of them
every single time?

523
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:45,717
Seriously, where have you been going
every weekend?

524
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:50,388
Every single time,
you're not back until dawn.

525
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:54,559
No matter where that place actually is,
you must call it "the study."

526
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,021
I'll try to sell less buttons this week.

527
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,899
Oh, my head.

528
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,234
Oh, my heart.

529
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,488
If you have to sell them,

530
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,157
sell the ones on your sleeves first.

531
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,909
Keep your jacket buttoned up

532
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,620
since it's cold.

533
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,916
You're getting pretty good at this.

534
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,461
Put it back.

535
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,172
What can I do?

536
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,801
I need to do this
to be able to sleep at night.

537
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,052
Put it back.

538
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,349
All right, fine.

539
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,155
Perhaps Tae-eul's threats worked.

540
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:54,869
Thanks to her, we're doing all the things
that we've skipped.

541
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,706
We even have some know-hows now.

542
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,876
First, we find out what year we're in

543
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:06,840
to make sure
we won't run into our counterparts.

544
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,385
Oh, it's the rotary dial phone,
not the push-button one.

545
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,971
It means it's before 1981, so we're safe.

546
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,806
Let's go.

547
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,187
That's a model from the early 90s.

548
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,064
We're fairly safe.

549
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,071
I'm not sure about this one.

550
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,948
What year could this be?

551
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,244
Oh, hold on a second.
I see some newspapers over there.

552
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,042
This is still refreshing.

553
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:46,754
Your Majesty!

554
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,093
Please leave.

555
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,352
That man recognized me.

556
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,729
Yes, we've got to run.

557
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:06,191
You exist in this world.
Apparently, you're a tyrant here.

558
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,109
What?

559
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:13,448
This is another parallel world.

560
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,493
Lee Gon here must have had
a bad upbringing.

561
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,620
I guess he grew without
Head Court Lady Noh, his uncle,

562
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,997
and someone's identification card.

563
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,458
He must've been scared and lonely
while growing up.

564
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,878
Let's leave. It's dangerous to stay
where our counterparts live.

565
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:28,963
Okay.

566
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,093
And that's how we travel together,

567
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,431
although our destinations
are a little extraordinary.

568
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,935
THE NEW MILLENNIUM,
A NEW BEGINNING

569
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,862
"The new millennium"?
Then it must be the year 2000.

570
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,447
It should be pretty safe.

571
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,283
Gosh, so many people thought
the world was going to end in 2000.

572
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,494
We're near Corea University now.

573
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,789
Come with me.

574
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,208
I know someone who wants to meet

575
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,418
the woman who insists the earth is flat.

576
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,437
By the way, who's the person
that wants to meet me?

577
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,702
Excuse me. Are you looking for this?

578
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,663
Yes, thank you.

579
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,123
Have a nice day.

580
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,708
Thank you. You too.

581
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,432
Is he

582
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,893
the person who wanted to meet me?

583
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:06,853
Yes.

584
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,314
And he met you just now.

585
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,900
He's the uncle who raised me.

586
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,245
But the thing is,

587
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:28,458
the woman who used to insist
that the earth is flat no longer exists.

588
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,461
My earth has become round as well.

589
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,046
Really?

590
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:34,881
Because of me?

591
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,092
As if. Because of gravity, obviously.

592
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,261
And that's also the reason
apples fall to the ground.

593
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,181
What else?

594
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,434
It's also what creates tides.

595
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,187
-What else?
-I love you.

596
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:50,938
My goodness.

597
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,776
Why am I startled every time I hear this?

598
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,278
Me too.

599
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,282
By the way, I hope we end up
in the Joseon dynasty

600
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,701
or the late Joseon period next time.

601
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,620
Why that specific time period?

602
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,832
I took a quick look around,
and we've finally come to Joseon.

603
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,000
Where's my hanbok?

604
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,252
Why did you want to travel
to the Joseon dynasty so much?

605
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,964
I must find my great-grandfather
and tell him

606
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,550
to buy the pear field in Apgujeong-dong
when he's older.

607
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,553
Where's the traditional hairpin?

608
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,645
What is this?

609
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,523
Why did you bring these leaves?

610
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,983
Because we never know where we'll end up.

611
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:39,320
Based on our experiences so far,
there's no guarantee

612
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,280
we won't end up in that time period.

613
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,286
Yes. I mean, the chances are slim,
but we should be--

614
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,500
We should be prepared.

615
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,046
-It's very important.
-Look for my hairpin.

616
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,299
Why would you put that back?

617
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:06,431
BUS STOP
PYEONGCHANG MUNHWA INTERSECTION

618
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,779
Darn it.

619
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,240
I got your ball.

620
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,742
Stay there.

621
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,203
I'll throw it over.

622
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,750
Thank you.

623
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,169

625
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:39,672
Oh, wait.

626
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:44,218
Where are you headed?
I'll tell you the bus routes.

627
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,141
There's been an accident.

628
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,352
Bye. I've got to run home
and report the accident.

629
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,403
-Hey.
-I got us some bus tokens.

630
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,574
What is it? Did something happen?

631
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,619
I think I know why the door brought us

632
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,622
to this time on this day.

633
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,931
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, 2022

634
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,852
Hold on a second.

635
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:36,562
-Here.
-I'm curious.

636
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,524
-This is Eun-bi, and this is Kka-bi.
-I see.

637
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,692
-They're already in elementary school.
-Really?

638
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,611
-They're adorable.
-They look like you.

639
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,404
-You think they look alike?
-Do they?

640
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,323
These were the good days.
Do we look alike?

641
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:48,407
-Well...
-Not really.

642
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,210
Why is that guy staring at me?

643
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,296
Hold on.

644
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:15,560
Excuse me. Do I know you?

645
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,729
How are things with you?

646
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:24,193
Oh, do you work here too?
Which department?

647
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,738
Did you get a driver's license?

648
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:29,991
Yes, Class 1-special.

649
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:33,411
Wait, why do I keep answering
your questions?

650
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,496
Who are you?

653
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,336
Confident and strong.

654
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,131
It was nice meeting you.

655
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,509
To me, you'll always be
the Unbreakable Sword.

656
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:50,094
What?

657
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:54,056
"The Unbreakable Sword"?

658
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,603
NA-RI NA-RI MYEONG NA-RI

659
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,231
Hi, honey.

660
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:05,693
What? Yes, I had lunch. What about you?

661
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,863
Oh, you're on a diet?

662
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:11,324
Come on. You don't need to lose weight.

663
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,535
Oh, you do?

664
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,872
Then you should've told me.

665
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:21,417
Every time I see you, I can't believe
you're real because you're so perfect.

666
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,171
Okay, I'll be home soon. Bye.

667
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:27,632
What a lunatic.

668
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:39,810
Wait.

669
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,897
What? Where are we now?

670
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,107
Those are 1,200-lumen flashlights.

671
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,651
The Royal Guards use them.

672
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,364
We came to the same period
in the Kingdom of Corea.

673
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,158
Damn it. I left just a little while ago.

674
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,826
Yeong must be looking for me.

675
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:56,953
What?

676
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,128
Your Majesty?

677
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,634
The Royal Guards are
to take ten steps back at once.

678
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,178
Yeong, you too.

679
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:15,721
You guys totally startled me.

680
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,267
I'll take a roundabout way to the palace.

681
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:23,312
I'll go through the beach
so that no one will see me.

682
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,405
-Your Majesty.
-Yes, Yeong.

683
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:34,740
It's that situation.

684
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:48,170
Gosh, I almost couldn't breathe.

685
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,425
Who's after Yeong?

686
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,552
Who finds out next?

687
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,430
-Head Court Lady Noh?
-Head Court Lady Noh.

688
01:06:59,056 --> 01:06:59,890
Your Majesty.

689
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,610
The talisman must've worked.

690
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,572
I'm letting her use my personal item.

691
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,198
You should know what that means.

692
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,829
I've been wondering

693
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,749
when the Royal Ancestral Shrine
will be completed.

694
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,002
Will it be completed next year?

695
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,217
Drink up. All of it.

696
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:36,927
Will do.

697
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,487
You're the only one who uses this?

698
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:58,324
Of course. But you can use it anytime.

699
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,242
What are you doing?

700
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,079
I shouldn't leave my fingerprints on this.

701
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,539
Luna lives in this world, you know.

702
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:09,460
This is very popular in my world.

703
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,174
What about the security footage?

704
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:16,801
I must've been caught on the cameras.

705
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,512
I'll clear the control tower.

706
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:28,437
My gosh, talk about tight security.

707
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,024
How do I shut this off?

708
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:37,196
Look. Isn't that Jo Yeong?

709
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,744
Jeez, him and his temper.

710
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,372
What's he saying?

711
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:53,504
Oh, you're a detective,
so you can probably read lips.

712
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:56,173
Of course.

713
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,550
Let me see.

714
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,931
Lee.

715
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,225
Gon...

716
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,269
Son of...

717
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,606
We showed up out of the blue.

718
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:13,983
You know?

719
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:16,652
I'll be upset If Chief Park gives me work

720
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:17,987
just when I'm about to take off.

721
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:19,822
So what did he say?

722
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,825
Did he call me a dog? Bow wow?

723
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,787
Yeong? The man I've trusted
since I was four?

724
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,874
Most Royal Guards are science and
engineering majors.

725
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,834
I can't believe they lost.

726
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,045
Yeong would never do that.

727
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,381
He doesn't keep any secrets from me.

728
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:38,299
My gosh.

729
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,302
What's going on over there?

730
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,596
Looks like he has a secret after all.

731
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,681
What genre would this be?

732
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,683
A romantic comedy? A spy film?

733
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:51,687
Oh, no. Here comes the disrupter.

734
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:54,523
I like this movie.

735
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,275
It's already a big hit.

736
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:59,528
I'm on my toes right now.
This is a thriller.

737
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,739
No, this is a melodrama.

738
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:25,763
Just like that,
we even watched our own movie.

739
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,818
I don't want to leave.

740
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:43,948
I'm off.

741
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:46,951
That's it?

742
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,955
I'm late. I have to sprint.

743
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,207
-See you on the weekend.
-Wait.

744
01:10:57,878 --> 01:11:00,756
Why the weekend?
The holidays begin on Wednesday.

745
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,383
Really? That's not the case in my world.

746
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:03,384
What kind of holiday?

747
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,762
The King's Birthday.

748
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,223
Bye.

749
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:12,059
Be well.

750
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,603
You too. See you, Lee Gon.

751
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:17,356
See you, Jeong Tae-eul.

752
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,858
We return to our daily lives

753
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,403
after we walk each other to the obelisk

754
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,321
instead of our homes.

755
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:27,700
Stop right there, punk!

756
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:32,079
God damn it!

757
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:45,551
Shit.

758
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:51,765
You see, I have a lot of respect for those
who try to change the future,

759
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:54,727
but it'd be better for you
to just get caught now.

760
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,104
If you want to be able to walk
to the police station, that is.

761
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,439
In your dreams.

762
01:11:58,605 --> 01:12:00,941
Climb over the wall,
starting with the one at the very back!

763
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,443
-Go.
-Hey, move it.

764
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,194
What? Who's that prick?

765
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,447
-Who is he?
-Hi.

766
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,533
I'm Jang Michael
from Violent Crimes Unit 3

767
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:10,784
of Jongno Police Station.

768
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,661
-Damn it.
-You bastards.

769
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:14,371
Jeez.

770
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,962
Jangmi, easy.

771
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,715
This means we have to carry them now.
Hey, newbie. Hurry.

772
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:26,633
I'm Lieutenant Jeong
from Jongno Police Station.

773
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:30,429
You are under arrest for violating

774
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,181
the Narcotics Control Act.

775
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,267
I accept the people's wishes,

776
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:39,396
and allow Prime Minister Mo
to form the cabinet.

777
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:49,490
I will do my very best, Your Majesty.
Please trust me.

778
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,533
I always have.

779
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:55,329
Just know that I will keep my ears open
and will support you any way I can.

780
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:59,875
I will be a Prime Minister
who mostly gives written reports.

781
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:03,587
I'd prefer it if you reported
everything to me in person every week.

782
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:06,590
You can't possibly expect to receive
the weekly report in person...

783
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,844
Fine. Then let's have it half and half.

784
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,602
What are you doing, Mom?
Are you receiving an award?

785
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:20,854
Well...

786
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:24,650
I had to bring him
because I couldn't find a babysitter.

787
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:28,529
Who are you, mister?

788
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:33,659
Nice to meet you.

789
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,954
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

790
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,623
My name is Lee Gon.

791
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,407
-Newspapers! Get your newspapers here!
-Come take a look.

792
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:16,034
-Come and have a look!
-Get your newspapers here!

793
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:19,246
Newspapers!

794
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:21,832
Get your newspapers here!

795
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:24,293
Come and have a look!

796
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:30,966
BAREFOOTED YOUTH

797
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:32,634
SHOWING TODAY

798
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:38,682
No matter what kind of a door
opens before us in life...

799
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,352
And even if the moments we share

800
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,022
make us sad at times,

801
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:49,401
-I wish to be able to love tirelessly.
-I wish to be able to love tirelessly.

802
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:55,115
Just like that,

803
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,659
we decided to love the fate

804
01:14:58,619 --> 01:14:59,912
that chose us.

805
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:09,796
Just for today

806
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:11,882
and only today.

807
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:15,761
And forever.

808
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:26,707
