THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,967
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,815
JUWON: He left like that
and I stayed behind.

4
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,279
The ANSP was downsized the next year,

5
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,365
so the Black Team was disbanded.

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,788
I was the only one left in the bygone era.

7
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:48,715
MOVING

8
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,885
WE WORK IN THE SHADOWS
TO PROTECT THE SUNLIT LAND

9
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,264
JUWON: With the reorganization,

10
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,683
I had to get into any department.

11
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,685
(sighs)

12
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,606
JUWON: I couldn't lose my job.

13
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,402
Everything seemed foreign.

14
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,571
I had to make a living.

15
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,115
GENERAL AFFAIRS TEAM 2

16
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,124
JUWON: Excuse me.

17
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,709
Sorry.

18
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,877
Excuse me.

19
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,962
Excuse me.

20
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,048
Sorry.

21
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,385
Oh!

22
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,512
Hey, my bag!

23
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,429
Ugh!

24
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:38,807
Ahh!

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,350
JIHEE: Jang Juwon!

26
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,644
Goodness.

27
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,521
Did you leave your bag again?

28
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,108
(sighs)

29
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,820
(chuckles)

30
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,201
(exhales sharply)

31
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,121
You should've stayed home.

32
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,956
Why did you come out?

33
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,749
I was getting groceries.

34
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,586
My goodness.

35
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,549
-JIHEE: Are you hungry?
-Yeah.

36
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,425
Let's have barbecue for dinner.

37
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:25,687
SANGROK, CIVIL SERVANTS

38
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,985
Here comes the bride and groom.

39
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:42,120
(both humming "Bridal Chorus")

40
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:46,457
EPISODE 13: JANG JUWON

41
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,252
-JUWON: Gosh, I'm hungry.
-JIHEE: Go wash up. Let's eat barbecue.

42
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,378
GENERAL AFFAIRS OFFICE

43
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,467
(indistinct chatter)

44
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,147
-I'll take these.
-Okay.

45
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,674
THIS FORMULA HAS AN ERROR

46
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,053
(breathes deeply)

47
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,598
(computer blaring)

48
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,892
THE PROGRAM IS NOT RESPONDING

49
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,018
(sighs)

50
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,445
(Juwon exhales heavily)

51
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,326
JUWON: By the way,

52
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,870
is today a special day?

53
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,083
It's just the day
we eat barbecue once a month.

54
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,003
It feels strange
to eat pork belly without soju.

55
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,672
Why didn't you get any?

56
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,591
What fun is it to drink on my own?

57
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,720
You don't drink alcohol for the fun of it.
You drink it like water.

58
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,474
Have you never been drunk?

59
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,309
I don't get drunk
no matter how much I drink.

60
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,560
Isn't that a good thing?

61
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,980
Not necessarily.

62
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,565
What is it like to get drunk?

63
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,568
It depends.

64
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,863
Sometimes I drink to feel good

65
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,491
and sometimes I drink
to forget something bad.

66
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,451
I wish...

67
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,621
I could get drunk.

68
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,836
Has work been tough?

69
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,594
It's tough...

70
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,681
because it isn't tough.

71
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,897
Do you miss being in the field?

72
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,275
I feel like...

73
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,698
I'm worthless to this world.

74
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,539
(Juwon mumbles)

75
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,458
(coughs)

76
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,004
You have worth to me.

77
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,594
And I have worth to you.

78
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,852
JIHEE: Hmm?

79
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,314
Are you crying again?

80
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,316
(Juwon gulps)

81
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,235
The wrap was too big.

82
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,154
Whatever.

83
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,409
What do we have to worry about?

84
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,913
We have a home we can live in,
we have each other,

85
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,416
we can have barbecue once a month, and...

86
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,421
Anyway, that's all I need.

87
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,966
There's nothing we can't do as a family.

88
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,511
Do what you want.

89
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,729
Do what you want, okay?

90
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:47,865
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

91
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,244
(light music)

92
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,799
(exhales sharply)

93
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,647
EXTENSION OF RENTAL HOUSING
FOR CIVIL SERVANTS

94
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:25,069
(keyboard clacking)

95
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,864
(clears throat)
Excuse me.

96
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,326
How do you do this?

97
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,290
Ah.

98
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,792
You live in the rental housing
for civil servants, right?

99
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,211
-Yes.
-You want to continue living there?

100
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,839
Yes.

101
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,175
Then you must apply for this
before the term expires.

102
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,428
How do I do that?

103
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,014
You're renewing this
every two years, aren't you?

104
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,517
Submit your property tax certificate,
family relation certificate,

105
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,602
and most importantly,

106
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,938
include proof of your employment
as a civil servant.

107
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,190
Got it?

108
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,360
(keyboard clacking)

109
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,445
Only...

110
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,115
civil servants can apply for this, right?

111
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,617
EMPLOYEE 1: Of course.

112
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,415
(background chatter)

113
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,920
(exhales deeply)

114
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,390
-JUWON: Ma'am.
-OWNER: Yes?

115
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,392
-JUWON: One more bottle, please.
-OWNER: Yes, sir.

116
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:51,906
CHOIR (singing national anthem on TV):
♪ Long live Korea, our country ♪

117
00:08:53,407 --> 00:09:00,164
♪ Mugunghwa, three thousand li ♪

118
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:06,629
♪ Such a glorious land ♪

119
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,339
What are you doing there?

120
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,722
The motion sensor light went out.

121
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,224
(sniffing)

122
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,518
Did you have a drink?

123
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,395
Yeah.

124
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:23,980
How much?

125
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,649
I drank 24 bottles.

126
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,442
And you aren't drunk?

127
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,486
No.

128
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,865
I want a new bag.

129
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,247
Okay.

130
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,541
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,793
Let's get you a new bag.

132
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,378
JUWON: I'm happy.

133
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,672
That's all that matters.

134
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,135
I'll just live like this.

135
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,393
(calm music)

136
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:09,650
(keyboard clacking)

137
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,122
-(grunting)
-(passengers clamoring)

138
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,707
Stop pushing.

139
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,169
(calm music)

140
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,545
(sighs)

141
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,768
(sighs)

142
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,607
(mumbles)

143
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,459
(Jihee laughing)

144
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,472
EMPLOYEE 2: Got it.

145
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,474
EMPLOYEE 3: We're on the move.

146
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,394
EMPLOYEE 4:
We're shredding them right now.

147
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,688
EMPLOYEE 5: It's an emergency, sir!

148
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,359
-EMPLOYEE 6: We're on the way.
-EMPLOYEE 7: We're going.

149
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,529
REPORTER 1: Breaking news.

150
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,155
The Ministry of Defense

151
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,491
has discovered
a wrecked North Korean submarine

152
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,660
early yesterday morning in Gangneung.

153
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,246
Based on the tracks left on the beach,

154
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,998
armed spy agents
seem to have infiltrated our borders.

155
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,667
The entire army has been...

156
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,257
Excuse me.

157
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,469
My computer is acting weird.
What should I do?

158
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,054
Restart it.

159
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,808
But everything I wrote will get deleted.

160
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,227
That's why you should've taken
computer courses.

161
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,021
It's not the computer's fault.

162
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:13,858
See you tomorrow.

163
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,906
(mutters)

164
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,949
(clicks tongue)

165
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,493
(sighs)

166
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,415
AN ERROR HAS OCCURRED

167
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,500
(ominous music)

168
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,835
(Juwon exhales deeply)

169
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,090
YONGJUN: This sure suits you.

170
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,138
A shirt and a tie.

171
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,099
What are you doing here?

172
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:48,893
What?

173
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,021
Did you think you'd never see me again?

174
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,275
Have you returned to your job?

175
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,527
I'm getting prepared.

176
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,280
I thought you were permanently demoted.

177
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,284
If you know a lot of secrets,

178
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,745
they can't do that to you.

179
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,081
By the way,

180
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,585
do you think this suits you?

181
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,630
Stuck in this office,

182
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,381
staring into your monitor.

183
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,550
Checking the pay scales

184
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,552
to collect your petty salary.

185
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,971
Jeez.

186
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,017
This doesn't show your worth.

187
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,313
Don't you miss the old days?

188
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,152
Back then,
you did things only you could do.

189
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,158
Let me make you an offer.

190
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,415
You're being given a chance.

191
00:13:56,293 --> 00:14:00,297
A chance to prove your worth to the world.

192
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,179
REPORTER 2: North Korea used a submarine

193
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,890
to infiltrate 20 armed spies
into the East Sea this morning.

194
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,434
One was captured,
and eleven committed mass suicide,

195
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,647
but the remaining eight spies escaped.

196
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,316
We have a reporter
at the scene of the incident.

197
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,361
This is Reporter Kim at the scene.

198
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,696
What you are currently seeing...

199
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,532
RESIDENT: Who the hell is smoking?

200
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,285
-(cigarette hisses)
-The smell is going to get everywhere.

201
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:34,123
REPORTER 2: Under the cliff is the
submarine the armed spies had been on.

202
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,750
These armed spies are estimated
to have arrived at about 1:00 a.m...

203
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,751
(blows air)

204
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,338
(flesh squelches)

205
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,683
(sighs)

206
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,855
JUWON: Do I miss the old days?

207
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,446
(sighs)

208
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,743
Is something on your mind?

209
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,707
No.

210
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,926
Don't think about it too much.

211
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,846
I'll always be by your side.

212
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,100
Do what you want.

213
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,191
(soft music)

214
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,459
REPORTER 3: It has been one week since
the armed spies infiltrated Gangneung.

215
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,628
Of the 26, one was caught.

216
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,713
It's barbecue day, so come home--

217
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,509
REPORTER 3: The bodies were found,
but there has been no concrete progress.

218
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,428
So the search operation
is expected to drag on for some time.

219
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,472
The joint search team
of the military and police

220
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,600
found an armed spy who fled after shooting

221
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,813
near Gimabong, Okgye-myeon,
and started the search operation,

222
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,273
but the search was unsuccessful.

223
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,652
It is estimated that five armed spies
remain on the run...

224
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,947
OCTOBER 1996

225
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,618
INJE, GANGWON-DO

226
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,164
(guns clank)

227
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,003
(rustling)

228
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,424
It was just a water deer.

229
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,342
That scared me.

230
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,553
All right. Rest for five minutes.

231
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,929
SOLDIERS: Yes, sir.

232
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,014
SOLDIER 1: Watch duty.

233
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,682
-To your places.
-SOLDIERS: Yes, sir.

234
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,560
SOLDIER 2: Sir, do you think these guys
already escaped to the North?

235
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,479
They couldn't have slipped through.

236
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,606
It has already been over ten days.

237
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,316
So many have died on our side, too.

238
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,779
By the way, who is the man
all the way in the back?

239
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,531
Who?

240
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,325
Ah.

241
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,618
Don't worry about him.

242
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,495
SOLDIER 2: He was following us
since this morning,

243
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,080
but even the commander left him alone.

244
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,624
He told us to not even speak to him.
He seems to be a civilian.

245
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,170
SOLDIER 1: I heard he's a secret
special agent sent by the government.

246
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,671
-ANSP?
-(shushes)

247
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,841
How would I know the details?

248
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,801
We just do as we're told.

249
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,721
ILHWAN: Secret agents.

250
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,014
Is that even real?

251
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,309
I'm sure that's why he's here.

252
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,312
Get some rest.

253
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,739
SOLDIER 3: Hey, is there any kimchi?

254
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,199
SOLDIER 4: I'll look for some, sir.

255
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,663
-Enjoy the food.
-SOLDIERS: Enjoy the food, sir.

256
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,961
-Enjoy your food, sir.
-You, too.

257
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,679
SOLDIER 1: May I come in?

258
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,224
Yes, come in.

259
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,894
Is there anything I can get for you?

260
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:24,812
I'm fine.

261
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,688
I thought you might be hungry.

262
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,776
-It's still ho--
-(hissing)

263
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,248
I'm the company commander
of the third special forces brigade.

264
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,084
I was given the orders to work with you.

265
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,253
-Well, I'm...
-It's all right.

266
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,339
I was ordered
not to ask for your identity.

267
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,341
I see.

268
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,845
What is your shoe size?

269
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,721
(mutters)

270
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,515
I wear 280.

271
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,267
Same as me.

272
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,644
I'll lend you my combat boots.

273
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,105
I'll also get you a uniform,
so please wear it.

274
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,107
Your civilian clothing stands out.

275
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,194
It might put our team in danger
during an operation.

276
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,487
I understand.

277
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,365
The noodles will get soggy. Enjoy.

278
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:19,950
Thank you.

279
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,800
SOLDIER 2:
How can we see the spies with that?

280
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,760
The sound of the helicopter
will scare them away.

281
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,222
It's already been three weeks.
We must do whatever we can.

282
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,019
(gunshots)

283
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,604
-SOLDIER 5: Run!
-SOLDIER 6: At twelve o'clock!

284
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,189
-SOLDIER 7: Hurry!
-SOLDIER 8: At nine o'clock!

285
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,816
-SOLDIER 9: Hurry and move!
-SOLDIER 10: Hurry!

286
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,987
(groaning)

287
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,156
SOLDIER 2: What kind of guys can evade
even the helicopter?

288
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,824
Those fucking North Korean bastards.

289
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,873
(raindrops pattering)

290
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,311
(gloomy music)

291
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,673
SOLDIER 1:
Hands up! If you move, we'll shoot!

292
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,050
-SOLDIER 1: Butterfly!
-RAEHYUK: Railroads!

293
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,469
-RAEHYUK: I'm not someone shady.
-SOLDIER 1: Identify yourself!

294
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,137
RAEHYUK: I'm from the ANSP.

295
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,935
I heard an agent
was already dispatched here.

296
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,618
RAEHYUK: Chief Min sent me.
I heard a lot about you.

297
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,538
I'm Jo Raehyuk. I used to be
in Anti-communist Division Three.

298
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,872
I'm Jang Juwon.

299
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,501
You seem older than me,
so speak comfortably to me.

300
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,712
Rank is all that matters
in an organization.

301
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,755
I'm a Grade Seven Junior Manager.

302
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,633
I worked for 20 years,
but I'm lower than you.

303
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,884
(chuckles)

304
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,845
You said you're
in Anti-communist Division Three?

305
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,263
I used to work there.

306
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,766
But I was replaced

307
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,935
after getting caught
pocketing some public funds.

308
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,228
(chuckles)

309
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,232
Thankfully, Chief Min called me back.

310
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,568
Anyway, I heard legendary stories

311
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,321
about the Black Team
while I was working there.

312
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,661
Back then, I used to wonder
if those stories were real.

313
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,499
Well, I'm honored
to be working with you from now on.

314
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,709
I hope we work well together.

315
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,961
What do you mean, "from now on"?

316
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,921
You didn't know?

317
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,759
Chief Min is trying to restart everything.

318
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,804
We have a very good opportunity.

319
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,099
So we have to make this
a grand success no matter what.

320
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,227
We'll be able to proudly make
a contribution.

321
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,898
This will become the basis
for rebuilding our organization.

322
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,149
(chuckles)

323
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,068
What organization do you mean?

324
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,111
Guryongpo.

325
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:50,827
Chief Min has been assembling people with
powers that were hidden within the ANSP.

326
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,873
Thanks to that, I have been chosen, too.

327
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,168
Do you have some kind of ability, too?

328
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,379
Heavens, no.

329
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,131
I don't even have a code name.

330
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,677
There's one thing
I have been acknowledged for.

331
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,848
How should I put it?
I'm good at investigating.

332
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,850
Investigating?

333
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,852
Yes. Locating.

334
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,315
I'm very good at locating people.

335
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,735
No matter who it is, I can find them.

336
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,989
Everyone leaves a trace behind, you see.

337
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,741
(Raehyuk scoffs)

338
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,495
Wherever they run away to
or wherever they hide,

339
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,998
I never miss that trace.

340
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,376
(sniffing)

341
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,586
I always pick up on the scent.

342
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,589
Don't worry.

343
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,634
From tomorrow,
all you have to do is follow my lead.

344
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,722
(laughs)

345
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,238
(tense music)

346
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,587
Let's go that way.

347
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:24,838
Yes, sir.

348
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,866
(exhales deeply)

349
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,582
49TH DAY OF THE SEARCH
NORTHERN PART OF INJE
49TH DAY OF THE SEARCH
NORTHERN PART OF INJE

350
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,212
-Is this the right way?
-Yes.

351
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,589
What are you actually looking for?

352
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,341
I'm looking for traces.

353
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,225
RAEHYUK: Based on the tracks
left on the ice,

354
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,769
they passed this place
about 30 minutes ago.

355
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,565
It's that way.

356
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,861
Wait.

357
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,157
There was something strange
in their tracks.

358
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,825
Something strange?

359
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,120
The one guarding
the rear seems to have powers.

360
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,290
The tracks and the strides are different.

361
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,042
RAEHYUK: That's one person's stride,

362
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,835
but a normal person can't run like that.

363
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,796
A normal person's stride is about 60 cm.

364
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,007
A trained soldier's quick pace stride
is about 90 cm.

365
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:54,344
But even though it's on ice,

366
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,012
those strides are over two meters.

367
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,765
You don't think...

368
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,394
"If the South has them,
the North can have them, too."

369
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,273
-What?
-Chief Min told me that.

370
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,402
Some of the spies may have powers.

371
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,321
That's why he dispatched you.

372
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,574
That's excessive speculation.

373
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,908
It isn't just speculation.

374
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,202
After July 1994,

375
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,413
we got intel that the North

376
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,748
has been training people with abilities
in response to the South.

377
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,918
We must confirm that now.

378
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,422
That way, we can rebuild the organization
to fight against that.

379
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,507
July 1994 was...

380
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,550
Isn't it strange?

381
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,176
Over 30 military units

382
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,097
were sent to join the search team.

383
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,141
Hundreds of thousands of reservists
were mobilized.

384
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,185
A total of two million searched for them
for over 40 days,

385
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,605
but they all failed to find them.

386
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:51,067
This is solid evidence
that some of them have powers.

387
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,237
Let's go after a little while.

388
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,196
(yelps)

389
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,281
It'll only take a moment.

390
00:26:56,906 --> 00:27:00,952
The truth is, they only passed here
about ten minutes ago.

391
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,207
There will soon be a shoot-out.

392
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,500
-What?
-Wait.

393
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,628
Did you forget?

394
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,755
We must proudly accomplish something.

395
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,716
Our accomplishment will shine
when we do something normal people can't.

396
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,010
We must show up
when the normal people are in danger.

397
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,845
Wouldn't that be more dramatic?

398
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,889
What the fuck are you saying, you bastard?

399
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,974
(suspenseful music)

400
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,404
(gunshot)

401
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,199
SOLDIER 1: Get down!

402
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,575
Open fire!

403
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,410
(gunshots)

404
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,287
(distant shouting)

405
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,226
SOLDIER 1: Spread out and fire!

406
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,688
Keep firing!

407
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,608
(groans)

408
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,903
(gunshots)

409
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,114
SOLDIER 1: Fire!

410
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,574
Keep firing!

411
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,993
(suspenseful music)

412
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,347
Cover him!

413
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,599
SOLDIERS: Cover him!

414
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,606
Charge!

415
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,400
SOLDIERS: Charge!

416
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,590
-SOLDIER 1: Hold fire!
-(groans)

417
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,674
Are you okay?

418
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,634
SOLDIERS: Hold fire!

419
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,392
Grenade!

420
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,436
(soldiers shouting)

421
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,983
(explosion)

422
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,659
(grunting)

423
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,581
What? No way.

424
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,756
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

425
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,146
(groans)

426
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,491
SOLDIERS: Sir!

427
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,409
Eleven o'clock mortar fire!

428
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,791
(blasts)

429
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,044
(flesh squelches)

430
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,233
SOLDIER 11: Rockslide!

431
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,527
SOLDIERS: Run!

432
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,827
Charge!

433
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,372
(soldiers shouting)

434
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,375
(rocks rumbling)

435
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,461
Watch out!

436
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,050
(background grunt)

437
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,848
Watch out!

438
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,449
(exhales deeply)

439
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,301
(soldiers screaming)

440
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,560
(panting)

441
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,487
Rocks falling! Watch out!

442
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,631
(panting)

443
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,401
So you're the one with abilities.

444
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,989
The South continues
to train sons of bitches.

445
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,574
(grunts)

446
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,786
(suspenseful music)

447
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,549
(screams)

448
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,010
(groans)

449
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:21,976
(sighs)

450
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,353
I will come back

451
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,148
and seek revenge for the Republic.

452
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:38,201
(panting)

453
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,058
(exhales heavily)

454
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,624
What a shame about our accomplishment.

455
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,710
Is your face okay? How was that guy?

456
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,754
So there really was
a strange guy as I said.

457
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,132
It's a shame that we lost him,

458
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,008
but it's fine
since we confirmed his existence.

459
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,635
(Raehyuk sniffs)

460
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,555
We have a reason
to rebuild the organization.

461
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,015
(chuckles)

462
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,768
Don't let me see you ever again.

463
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,273
I'll kill you.

464
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,110
(sniffs)

465
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,078
(somber music)

466
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,045
REPORTER 4: During the operation,
13 armed spies were killed,

467
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,299
11 were found dead,
and one was captured alive,

468
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:20,553
while our forces lost 21 in the battle
including three colonel-level officers,

469
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:24,765
seven noncommissioned officers,
and 11 enlisted men, and 31 were wounded.

470
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,645
Meanwhile, there's no trace
of one armed spy who didn't get caught.

471
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:36,110
Our military is contemplating
whether the remaining armed spy...

472
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,904
You fixed the light.

473
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,531
(TV chatter)

474
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,449
JIHEE: I did.

475
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,021
(soft music)

476
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,868
Thank you for coming back.

477
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,080
(sobbing)

478
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,711
I want some ramyeon.

479
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,553
YONGJUN (in English): Hey, Mark.

480
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,598
(in Korean) Why didn't you tell me

481
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,559
that the North
was training people with powers?

482
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,106
(in English) If you knew,

483
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,984
there might have been
an unforeseen skirmish.

484
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,238
(in Korean) An unforeseen skirmish?

485
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,740
(snickers)

486
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,034
I suppose so.

487
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:13,374
MANY HIDDEN ASPECTS
IN THE MOP-UP OPERATION OF ARMED SPIES

488
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,710
YONGJUN: We have confirmation
of the enemy's existence.

489
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,796
He was treated as missing,

490
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,549
but there's a much higher possibility
that he returned to North Korea.

491
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,845
As long as we know the enemy's existence,

492
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,763
I'll be returning to the central soon.

493
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,015
And you will be forming

494
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,893
a new Black Team under my command.

495
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,564
Guryongpo, who played an active role
in this operation, will take the lead.

496
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,733
He's an original member.
Say hello to each other.

497
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,947
I'm Bongpyeong.

498
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,700
I was part of Team Mirim,
which is now disbanded.

499
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,411
I'm old, but I don't have
a lot of experience in the field.

500
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,332
I'm Naju.

501
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,044
I was in Mr. Shin's
Overseas Operations Team Two.

502
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:04,175
I heard that there was
an amazing character

503
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,677
among the original members.

504
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,346
I'm Jincheon.

505
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,474
I'm Jang Juwon.

506
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,769
JINCHEON: I used to catch
communist college students

507
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,938
back when I was at
the Anti-communist Investigative Office.

508
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,983
But there was a small incident
that got me demoted.

509
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,611
I'm fine in every other way,

510
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,031
but sometimes I just can't control
my own strength.

511
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,617
-(hand crunching)
-(grunting)

512
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,327
(Jincheon groans)

513
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,831
(ominous music)

514
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,023
Consider yourself lucky.

515
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,403
(door shuts)

516
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,825
(scoffs)

517
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,127
(chuckles)

518
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,217
(door shuts)

519
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,640
(breathes deeply)

520
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,776
(door shuts)

521
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,822
(somber music)

522
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,166
JIHEE: Another business trip?

523
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,043
I'll find out when I get there.

524
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,005
It's barbecue day, though.

525
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,301
(Juwon sighs)

526
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,178
Let's have it later.

527
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:13,846
I'm off.

528
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,389
It's only once a month.

529
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,812
Do you know what "once a month" means?

530
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,148
(scoffs)

531
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,317
We get to eat barbecue?

532
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,988
We can actually eat barbecue any day.

533
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,033
Then what is it?

534
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,580
On that day, I hoped you wouldn't
work late and come home early.

535
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,959
That's why I lured you with barbecue.

536
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,962
What kind of day is it?

537
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,218
It's my ovulation day.

538
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,222
You didn't know, did you?

539
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,769
Did you want to have a baby?

540
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,526
But I couldn't get pregnant.

541
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,070
We've been together for a long time.

542
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,366
I became more and more desperate.

543
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,827
I wanted to have a daughter
that took after you.

544
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,457
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

545
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,837
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

546
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,298
Why not?

547
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,598
(sobs)

548
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,229
Because I thought it was my fault.

549
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,276
What?

550
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,116
Don't you remember where and how we met?

551
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,498
I wondered if this is all because...

552
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,712
I lived like that.

553
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,549
(somber music)

554
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:17,928
(sobs)

555
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,047
I'm sorry.

556
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,523
(lively music)

557
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,749
Bye, Dad.

558
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,460
Bye, Dad.

559
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,384
Daddy.

560
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,886
ON A BUSINESS TRIP

561
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,862
-Let's say goodbye.
-Have a safe trip, Dad.

562
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,197
It's for the country.

563
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,241
Do it with a sense of duty.

564
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,995
(lively music)

565
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,838
JIHEE: Let's say goodbye.

566
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,340
-Have a safe trip, Dad.
-Have a safe trip.

567
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,425
Huisoo.

568
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,509
(smooches)

569
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,494
Shall we eat something yummy?
What should we eat?

570
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:48,996
What should we eat?

571
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,462
ENTERING KOREA

572
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,930
(background chatter)

573
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:27,743
Anyway, where did our great leader
run to in such a rush?

574
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,996
His phone battery died,
so I guess he went to call his family.

575
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:31,955
(scoffs)

576
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,333
Despite the way he looks,
he cares deeply for his family.

577
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,377
I want to go back
and see my daughter, too.

578
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,339
Jeez. I'm not close to my son.

579
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:43,175
We've been chosen as the Black Team
by our country.

580
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:47,387
Why do we worry about our families
like civilians?

581
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,189
JUWON: Yes.

582
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:01,735
Yes.

583
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,577
(tense music)

584
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,086
(siren wailing)

585
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:32,808
EMERGENCY PATIENT ENTRANCE

586
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:41,984
(breathing heavily)

587
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,409
(somber music)

588
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:53,597
(Juwon sobbing)

589
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,854
(Juwon wailing)

590
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:11,281
(wailing continues)

591
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,515
(somber music)

592
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,649
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

593
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,677
CHIEF MOURNER OF THE LATE HWANG JIHEE

594
00:50:55,761 --> 00:51:02,392
(wailing)

595
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,255
(Juwon sobs)

596
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,300
(exhales heavily)

597
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,019
I'm here.

598
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,113
Don't worry.

599
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,785
I'll take good care of Huisoo.

600
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:13,672
(sobbing)

601
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,559
(closing theme music)
