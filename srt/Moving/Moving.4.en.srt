BONGSEOK: Huisoo!

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,364
Oh, my god. Are you floating?

7
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,950
Please, get something!

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,203
-You can't come down from there?
-I can't control it! Please. My bag!

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,663
Your bag... Oh, your bag.

(grunts, hisses)

11
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,212

-BONGSEOK: What are you doing?
-HUISOO: Uh, hold on.

15
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,727
BONGSEOK: You're not gonna try
and jump, are you?

16
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,521
-You can't! Don't!
-I won't get hurt, it's okay.

17
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,690
Don't do it, Huisoo!

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,026
(Bongseok groans)

19
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,572

00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,698
Right, the bag.

-Get off! Get off! Get off!
-Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,208
Why are you floating again?

26
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,668
It's 'cause you're hugging me.
Can you let go, please?

27
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,586
Huh?

28
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,379
Don't let go!

00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,465
-(grunts)
-Okay, let go.

30
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,675

Don't let go!

(grunts)

32
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,806

-BONGSEOK: Hold on a sec. Huisoo, just...
-HUISOO: I'll let go of this, okay?

34
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,810

HUISOO: Hey.
Get your head straight! Focus!

37
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,606

40
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,736
-Huh?
-BONGSEOK: Oh, sorry.

41
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,155
HUISOO: How much longer
will you be like this? Damn it.

42
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,452
Hey, listen to me. Just...
Whoa, hey, listen to me!

43
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,287
-Listen to me. Step by...
-Sorry, sorry.

44
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,706
-There you go. Slowly... Hey!
-Oh!

45
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,291
Pull yourself together!

46
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,209
Sorry.

47
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,253
-It's pouring, hey!
-(whimpers)

48
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,261
Is it this way?

49
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,596
Mm-mm.

50
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,597
This way.

51
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,603

58
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,224

(rings)

60
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,274
Good evening, how...

61
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,194
Hey, Ma.

62
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,737
Oh, hello.

63
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,284
Who are you?

64
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,787
I'm Bongseok's friend.

65
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,834
You... You're Bongseok's...

66
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,171
His friend.
(chuckles)

67
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,466
You're... You're a girl.

68
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,927
A friend, who's a girl.

69
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,347
You're pretty, though.

70
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,682
Oh, you're too kind.

71
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,437
(gasps)
Oh, my! Oh! Oh, you're Bongseok's...

72
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,940
You're his friend!
Oh, get in here, get in here!

73
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,525
Oh, Bongseok has a friend! Oh, wow!

74
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,945
-Oh, what a pretty girlfriend you are.
-(chuckling nervously)

75
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,322
And I... No, what I...

76
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,825
What I mean is that you're his friend,
and you're a girl, and...

77
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,328
and Bongseok's friend,
who's a girl, is really pretty!

78
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:09,374
-(all laughing)
-Oh, gosh, what am I saying?

79
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,416
Oh, goodness, where...

80
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,335
-I'm glad to meet you!
-Oh, of course, likewise!

81
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:16,756
Oh, do you... I'm not his sister,
actually, I'm his mother.

82
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,757
You look so young.

83
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,050

85
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,345
Wow.

86
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,138
Jang Huisoo is my name.

87
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,598
-Huisoo?
-Yes.

88
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,976
-Oh, even your name's pretty.
-(chuckles)

89
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,435
Goodness.

90
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,563

MIHYUN: Here you go.

95
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,246
Oh, I don't know
if it'll be to your liking.

(chuckles)

97
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,501
Thank you for dinner.

00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,177
HUISOO: Hey.

101
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,221
This is so much.

102
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,933
Double king. Secret menu.

103
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,852
BONGSEOK: It's what I eat all the time.

104
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,854
Mm. Eat up.

105
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,398
We just had some ramen not too long ago.

106
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,984
You mean, you're not gonna eat?

107
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,448
-Of course, I'll eat.
-Mm.

We're already closed tonight.

114
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,539
Could you cut my hair?

115
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,377
How's the water?

116
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,963
Oh, I'm not thirsty right now.

117
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,174
(chuckles)

118
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,217
You're not thirsty?

119
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,261
No, not that, the temperature.

120
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,305
Is the water temperature
all right for you?

121
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,516
Ah. Ah, my mistake.

122
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,018
Uh, the temperature's just fine.

123
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,314
Uh, I have something to ask.

124
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,775
Sure, you can ask whatever.

125
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,487
Um, what's the word you'd use
to describe, um, "kids"?

126
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,114
Huh?

127
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,616
I don't mean toddlers, son and daughter.

128
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,078
Uh...

129
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,914
Oh, um... Oh, children.

130
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,666
Children?

131
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,875
Yes, children.

132
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,587
Son and daughter is for "children,"
so that's the word you're looking for.

133
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,131
Children.

134
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,799
-Hm...
-Mm-hm.

135
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,718
Then do you have children?

136
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,513
What?
(scoffs)

137
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,473
Why do you ask?

138
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,475
Hm, just curious.

139
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,727
Hmm...

140
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,064
That's private.
(chuckles)

141
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,816
FRANK: Mm.

142
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,947
Then... Then why are you running
this hair salon in this neighborhood?

143
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,451
What do you mean?

144
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,911
I was thinking,

145
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,539
your children,

146
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,543
they go to Jeongwon High, don't they?

147
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:45,923
(water running)

148
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,176
(clinks)

149
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,554
You know who I am?

150
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:54,932

(blasts)

182
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,201
(shouting)

183
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,204
(groans)

184
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,390
Tell me. Tell me where your children are!

185
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,227
(grunts)

186
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,824
(choking)

187
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,159
Please, just end it.

188
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,541
You're... You're just a second-string.

189
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,712
Guryongpo will kill you, asshole.

190
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,838
(gasps)

191
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,137
You all try

192
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,266
so hard to hide your children. Why?

193
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,982
(thunder rumbles)

194
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,694
If you do have any children,

195
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,989
I'll see them at your funeral.

196
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,242
(blood squelching)

197
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,955
FRESH CHICKEN
FRESH CHICKEN

198
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,623
(cell phone buzzing)

199
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,460
Hello?

200
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,337
Oh, Huisoo.

201
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,048
Where are you calling?

202
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,260
You're at a friend's?

203
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,721
My bad, then you'll...

204
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,390
Oh, well, thank them for dinner.

205
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,559
-Wait, who's your...
-(phone rings)

206
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,394
Oh, hold on! I got an order!

207
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,149
Hi, Fresh Chicken,
still fresh when it's dead.

208
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,026
Oh, yes, yes.

209
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,195
Sure, one chicken,
but a portion like it's two.

210
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,113
Yep. Yangnyeom.

211
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,533
Lots of pickled radish, sure.
And a large cola.

212
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,119
Ah. Oh, yes. You want...

213
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,705
You also want a pack of smokes?
Yes, I'll be right there.

214
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,124
One second, please,
can I get your address?

215
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,921
Oh, Myeongil-dong, oh, yes, yes.
Okay. Suite 305. Cool.

216
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,966
Yes, it'll only be a moment, yes.
I'll be there soon. Yes, thanks. Goodbye.

217
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,178
Huisoo, I just...

218
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,393
Now, uh... Whoo!

219
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,814
Okay, then.

220
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,898
MYEONGIL-DONG SHOPPING CENTER, SUITE 305

221
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,399
JUWON: Chicken...

222
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,236
BONGSEOK: Mm.

223
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,031
You don't have to eat it all.
It's okay, I mean it.

224
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,534
Of course, I need to.

225
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,412
(Huisoo and Mihyun chuckle)

226
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,498
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:56,335
Honestly, you're the first friend
that I've had over.

228
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,256
-First?
-Mm-hm. You're the very first.

229
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,007
Really? In your entire life?

230
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,552
I told you already, I have zero friends.

231
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,764
That's why your mom was...

232
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,432
And it's just...

233
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,852
It's... It's pretty late right now.

234
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:17,565
And I think that my mom, that she...
that she really thought that you're,

235
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,400
-you know, my--
-Your girlfriend?

236
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,652
So what?

237
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,824
I mean, it's just out of the question.

238
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,040
(chuckles)
There isn't a lot I can offer right now.

239
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,003
But here you go. I've got all these apples
I use to make donkatsu sauce.

240
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,380
I used to grow apples,
and these are really great.

241
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,632
MIHYUN: They're really sweet
and delicious.

242
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,510
Have some as a palate cleanser.
(chuckling)

243
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,596
Mom.

244
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,764
How are we supposed to eat it all?

245
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,517
-Too much, huh?
-Oh, no!

246
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,396
I've never seen apples cut so perfectly.

247
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,565
'Cause my dad can't make this.

248
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,358
Your father?

249
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,902
Yeah.

250
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,033
Thank you so much!

251
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,329
Take all the time in the world.
Our house is your house.

252
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,541
Oh, man, she has to go home.
It's way too late now.

253
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,959
Why, what's the...
(gasps)

254
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,337
Oh, wow! Oh, goodness, it's so late!

255
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,630
I bet your dad's worried sick.

256
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,216
I called him earlier and said
that I was having a meal with a friend.

257
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,718
It's cool.

258
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,766
-Here we go. This place is really good.
-Welcome!

259
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,975
We've got a large group here.

260
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,769
Uh, sit over here, there's more room.

261
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,021
(overlapping chatter)

262
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,147
Oh, this is good.

263
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,816
Let me know if you need anything else.

264
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,196
Uh, so, do you think that I can go change?
I got soaked out there.

265
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,865
Oh, you should've said so,
you're freezing, huh?

266
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,825
Did you bring extra clothes?

267
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,327
Yeah, I have another outfit.

268
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,412
Bongseok, take her upstairs
and get her a towel,

269
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,666
-I need to go to work.
-Mom, what should I do with these?

270
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,833
Let's take these with us.

271
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,629
(raindrops pattering)

272
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,926
(sighs)

273
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,265
Hey, slow down!
Why are you eating in such a rush?

274
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,183
Okay.

275
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,272
I'm gonna have the rest of these.

276
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,817
You said that you were full.

277
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,568
Yeah, so?

278
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,198
Sorry.

279
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,825
Hm?

280
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,120
I followed you without your permission.

281
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,749
Regardless of how curious I was,
that wasn't cool.

282
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,047
Sorry. That was wrong.

283
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,927
Okay. Apology accepted.

284
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,941
(breathes deeply)

285
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,987
HUISOO: I found a way to go to college.

286
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,824
And I decided I was gonna do
whatever it took to get in.

287
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,994
The vertical jump is my weakness.

288
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,456
I kept failing no matter what I tried.

289
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,877
I guess that's why I was so impatient.

290
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:27,963
I guess that's why.

291
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,968
I noticed there was
something different about you

292
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,386
once we started getting close.

293
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,725
I thought I'd check for myself.

294
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:44,730
I thought if I'm right,
you were such a lucky guy.

295
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,985
I was super jealous, you know?

296
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,072
I wanted to know what your secret was.

297
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,179
But it turns out...

298
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,475
to be a real secret.

299
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,478
Don't be jealous.

300
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,607
Hey. Come here.

301
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,754
(light music)

302
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,611
It must have been so hard,

303
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,655
your body always floating.

304
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,202
Then...

305
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,539
you can't really control
your floating, can you?

306
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,124
Mm-hm.

307
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,127
That thing you asked before, 3.14...

308
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,920
That helps control it.

309
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,339
-Pi digits?
-Uh-huh.

310
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,300
Yeah, when I start to float, I say it.

311
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,093
Math wasn't my greatest subject, so...

312
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:39,761
Why?

313
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,013
Oh.

314
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,307
I don't know exactly why,

315
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,100
but my emotions control it.

316
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,603
My body gets heavy when I'm calm.

317
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,354
But I float if I get excited.

318
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,315
(scoffs)

319
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,774
Why?

320
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,112
You kept getting it wrong.
You would say the wrong order.

321
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,698
(scoffs)
Oh, wow.

322
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,617
Hey, I just forgot some of it, you know?

323
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,411
I got used to it as I grew older,
and you know what?

324
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,748
I mean, I didn't need it anymore
until recently.

325
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,584
(inhales deeply)

326
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,629
You didn't need it anymore,
what could've changed that?

327
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,592
What is it? Why are you looking at me?

328
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,178
We met pretty recently.

329
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,555
Right.

330
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,227
But I've already seen you reciting pi
a bunch of times.

331
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,731
Are you excited when I'm around?

332
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:35,776
Wait.

333
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,444
Are you confessing how you feel?

334
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,403
Mm-mm.

335
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,700
Do you like me?
(gasps)

336
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,618
(thuds)

337
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,621
Don't mind that,
we're moving things upstairs.

338
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,373
(chuckles)
Thanks so much!

339
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,125
(overlapping chatter)

340
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,131
BONGSEOK (echoes):
Three-point-one-four-six-nine...

341
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,217
Three-point-one-four...

342
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,177
Three-point-one-four...

343
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,055
Three-point-one-four
one-five-nine-three...

344
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,974
Come down, I'll stop asking.

345
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:07,891
Uh...

346
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,269
Three-point-one-four...

347
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,187
Three-point-one-four-one...

348
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,105
Five!

349
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,357
Nine-three-five-seven-nine-eight-nine...

350
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,358
(yelps)

351
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,862
(chopping)

352
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,418
I didn't... I didn't expect that.

353
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,337
What?

354
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,340
You weren't really all that surprised.

355
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,427
Wasn't I?

356
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,469
Oh.

357
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,513
Well, I've never been caught and...

358
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:51,893
I always dreaded what would happen
if this day should ever come, but I...

359
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,272
I think I was even more shocked
that you weren't.

360
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,276
I was shocked.

361
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,945
How could I not be after seeing that?

362
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,325
I was shocked.

363
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,455
Oh, you... Then you didn't make
a big deal.

364
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,541
I mean, you accepted it really quickly.

365
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,254
There's all kinds of people
in this world, you know.

366
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,008
There are other people
like you and me out there.

367
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,849
I'll keep it. Your secret.

368
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,606
Okay.

369
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,107
BONGSEOK (echoes): Thank you.

370
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,362
I bet you're pretty good at hiding things.

371
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,407
You weren't even surprised
at how weird I was.

372
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,453
You are not.

373
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,872
You're just different.

374
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,585
Just different? It's not weird to you?

375
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,170
Why's that weird?

376
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,506
You're special, aren't you?

377
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,179
You're not weird at all,

378
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,016
just a bit special, Bongseok.

379
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,562
(light music)

380
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,589
I appreciate that.

00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,703
Mom, are you crying?

384
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,829
Chopping onions.

385
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,414
Oh, you cleaned the plate.

386
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,792
They were delicious.
Thank you again. They were so good.

387
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,045
I'm sorry for staying so late.

388
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,797
-Oh...
-I'll get going now.

389
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,300
You can come back whenever,
and get home safe.

390
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,178
I will. Good night. See ya.

391
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,137
Bye.

392
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,895
BONGSEOK: Wait, wait for me.

393
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,317
-You should go.
-What?

394
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:49,321
I got a raincoat, so it's all good.
And the bus stop is right over there.

395
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,363
Go ahead.

396
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,367
Oh, I think I should make sure
you get there.

397
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,244
Why do you wanna do that?

398
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,665
Because you helped me get here.

399
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,211
Well, that was a special case. It's okay.

400
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,546
BONGSEOK: Are you sure, though?

401
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,132
Yeah, I want to run all the way
to the stop,

402
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,760
and I'll be late if I'm waiting
for you to catch up.

403
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,595
Really, it's okay! Go on!

404
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,151
What's wrong with you?

405
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,153
-Sorry?
-What's wrong with you?

406
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,696
With me?

407
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,491
Why would you send off
your girlfriend alone, so late?

408
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,537
That... That's not what we are.
She's just...

409
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,914
a friend.

410
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah, that's right,
just a friend, who's a girl,

411
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,045
a girl that you like.

412
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,257
It's really obvious.

413
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,304
Oh? Oh?

414
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,931
Goodness me, you moron.

415
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,767
What kind of girl would come over
to the house

416
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,394
of a guy she doesn't even like?

417
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,814
Hanging in your room for hours talking,
you really believe that, do you?

418
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,524
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,401
You know how much cabbage I chopped
because of you?

420
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,652
What do I do with that?

421
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,406
(sighs)

422
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:19,244
There's some things you can say
without words, you got that?

423
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,455
You're familiar with reading
between the lines?

424
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,959
She ate the whole plate, yeah?

425
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,380
You want some advice, huh?

426
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,801
Once it's left, there's no point
in flagging down a bus.

427
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,556
-Ma.
-Hm?

428
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,933
-Where's my raincoat?
-Raincoat?

429
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,269
-I need to catch her! Give me something!
-Wait, just call--

430
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,063
She doesn't have a phone!
Come on, Mom, I need something, quick!

431
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,941
Oh, goodness gracious.
Seriously, you're a handful!

433
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,486
BONGSEOK: Mom! What is this?

434
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,488
MIHYUN: It's this or nothing.
Just wear it.

435
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,868
Be careful!

00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,022
Oh, really?

537
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,232
Yeah, we, uh, prac...

538
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,942
No, cramming, for real.

539
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,652
You're not lying?

540
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,530
All my weights are tied on,
and the bag's all filled and...

541
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,115
-BONGSEOK: I'm gonna go now!
-MIHYUN: Hey!

542
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,873
But that hairstyle is...
(breathes deeply)

543
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,418
(chuckles)
Goodness, that sweet little thing.

544
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,377
(cell phone dings)

545
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,254
(sighs)

546
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,008
#CASES

547
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,051
TONS OF POLICE OFFICERS
AT MYEONGIL SHOPPING CENTER

548
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:26,934
I DON'T FEEL SAFE
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ANYMORE.

549
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,191
What is that?

550
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,027
BONGSEOK: Doesn't it kind of look
like a handprint?

551
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,529
HUISOO: No way.
It's way over five meters high.

552
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,658
-Was it you?
-No.

553
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,665
(sighs)
Forget it, let's work out.

554
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,676
I'm doing handball today.

555
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,429
Oh, this?

556
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,557
This... Oh!

557
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,269
Okay.

558
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,523
Did you do something to your hair?

559
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,987
(scoffs)
It's not really "in."

560
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,907
Yeah. It's not.

561
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,703
(sighs)

562
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,084
Swish. Pow. Toss.

563
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,964
BONGSEOK: Swish. Pow. Toss.
Swish. Pow. Toss. Swish. Pow. Toss.

564
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,259
Swish. Pow. Toss.

565
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,401
Oh.

566
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,154
It's your last semester.

567
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,699
Yeah.

568
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,743
Can you really hang out? Your mom know?

569
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,122
-No, she doesn't.
-I know where you live now.

570
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,623
But it's a secret!

571
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,042
I got all your secrets, now what?

572
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,169
BONGSEOK:
You have to keep my secret. Okay?

573
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,089
Will you answer?

574
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,634
Huisoo, hey.

575
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,598
There's ways to keep people's secrets.

576
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,438
We learn
what the other person's secret is.

577
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,732
Then we keep each other's secret,
you know?

578
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,777
'Cause everybody's keeping
a secret or two.

579
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,740
You're keeping a secret?

580
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,783
You're a fool.

581
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,077
-Huh?
-I told you multiple times already.

582
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,705
Oh?

583
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,091
I'm gonna tell you my secret now,
and I'll keep yours also.

584
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,470
You keep my secret, too.

585
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,890
Yeah.

586
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,518
Do you know why I transferred?

587
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,773
Isn't it a little strange?

588
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,319
Who transfers
as a senior to another school?

589
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,237
And go to one that's farther away,

590
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,240
with only one semester to go
until college.

591
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,247
I got kicked out of school.

592
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,042
Hmm?

593
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,418
Seventeen against one.

594
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,339
-Huh?
-I fought against the juvies, 17 to 1.

595
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,840
And I won.

596
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,217
Aren't I crazy strong?

597
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,593
(chuckles)

598
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,764
I didn't have one scratch on me,
but the juvies got so hurt

599
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,683
that dad paid
their treatments, settlement.

600
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,561
He lost it all trying to get that settled.

601
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,898
And that's how I got kicked out.

602
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,359
Oh.

603
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,278
Ah.
(laughs)

604
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,074
Wait, the 17 to 1?
The legendary school fight of the century?

605
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,119
(laughs)
This is great. Huisoo, you're hilarious.

606
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,745
How do you fight 17 at once? Huh?

607
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,665
Are you ducking and weaving like this?
Duck, fight, weave!

608
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,167
(laughing)

609
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,295
Wait, seriously?

610
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,425
You can touch the sky.

611
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,222
I can't ever get hurt at all.

612
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,432
It's okay, I won't get hurt.

613
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,517
Yeah, it's okay, I didn't... It's fine.

614
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,812
There's all kinds of people
in this world, you know.

615
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,607
There are other people
like you and me out there.

616
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,326
This is a secret kept between us.

617
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,086
(closing theme music)
