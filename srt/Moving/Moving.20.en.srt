my mom,

83
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,780

(yells, panting)

85
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,078
Do you want to die?

86
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,542
JUNHWA: This won't do.

87
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,544
I guess you want to die.

88
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,464
(Mihyun panting)

89
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,383
Stop!

(gasps)
Mom.

91
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,220
Drop your gun!

92
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,306
(Mihyun panting)

93
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,772
MIHYUN (whispers): Bongseok, fly away.

94
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,775
Now.

95
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,820
Go.

96
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,989
Listen to your mom.

97
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,616
I'll take care of it.

98
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,705
Why aren't you shooting?

99
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,417
You have fast hands.

100
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,548
Is he your family?

00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,361
I'm sorry.

HUISOO: Are you okay, sir?

110
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,956
(Huisoo gasps)

111
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,877
I think you need to see a doctor.

112
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,091
Are you crying?

113
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,843
Are you in pain?

114
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,311
Are you all right?

115
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,774
You're bleeding a lot.

116
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,860
Does it hurt a lot?

117
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,823
-It's all right.
-(Yongdeuk wailing)

118
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,371

119
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,048

(grunting)

124
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,800
Please listen to me.

125
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,636
MIHYUN: Please.

126
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,389
Lightning...

127
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,267
Lightning...

128
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,982
What will you do now?

129
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,151
(tense music)

130
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,403
BONGSEOK: Mom.

131
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,280
You should listen to me.

132
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:21,991
(Mihyun gasps)

133
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,326
-No!
-Lightning...

134
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,913
power!

135
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,249
(intense music)

136
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,838

138
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,216
(blood squirts)

139
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,179
(groaning in pain)

140
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,894
(relieved exhale)
Bungaeman.

141
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,063
(grunting)

142
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,484
(sighs)

143
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,360
Can you move?

144
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,529
(whimpering)

145
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,822
Go while I stop them.

146
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,074
But sir!

147
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,035
You're not going anywhere, you bastard!

148
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,661
-(gunshot)
-(groans)

149
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,538
Go!

150
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,584
You have a reason to go.

151
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,962
DEOKYOON: You have a family.

152
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,007
(whimpers)

153
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,350
Why don't you drop your empty gun?

154
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,062
How many shots do you have left,
you bastard?

155
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,898
(grunting)

156
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,442
(groans)

157
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,910
What's my mission?

158
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,996
CHIEF:
Destroy their plan to train the gifted.

159
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,207
Clean up everybody that's involved

160
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,709
and bring that file to me.

161
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,504
So we'll take the adults down,

162
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,757
but what about the kids?

163
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,393
The kids weren't in the plan.

164
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,229
They're just kids.

165
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,067
(Mihyun gasps)

166
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,486
(Mihyun grunts)

167
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,905
(thuds)

168
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,741
(yelling)

169
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:29,952
(both grunt)

170
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,497
What's your purpose here?

171
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,876
Shouldn't this end with our generation?

172
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,340
(both grunting)

173
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,678
Let go, you bastard.

174
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,973
(Juwon grunts)

175
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,601
(grunts)
What about Kim Doosik?

176
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,436
Is he alive?

177
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,319
Can't we just take down the head?

178
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,154
The head?

179
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,657
The one who made the plans
and issued the orders.

180
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,576
(Chief scoffs)

181
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,661
He's very thorough.

182
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,707
He's hiding like a mole,
and it's near impossible to locate him.

183
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,711
But we shouldn't just stay still.

184
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,464
We must prepare too.

185
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,384
Isn't this a repeat of the past?

186
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,887
What?

187
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,431
This has repeated for 50 years.

188
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,559
What the hell are you saying?

189
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,812
The republic sent Kim Shinjo,
and the South sent Kim Doosik.

190
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,523
-The republic--
-(shouts) Are you lecturing me?

191
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,900
(shouts)
In that process!

192
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,741
Countless innocent people died.

194
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,828
Can you take responsibility...

195
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,456
for what you just said?

CHIEF: Don't forget.

198
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,421
A slip of the tongue can make you...

199
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,384
a traitor.

200
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,720
Sacrifices are inevitable.

201
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,766
The people are innocent.

202
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,813
Those who force sacrifices are to blame!

203
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,151

You shouldn't have come here!

Starting today, you are no longer
simply high school students,

272
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,524

Wherever they run away to
or wherever they hide,

353
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,077
I never miss that trace.

354
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,079

357
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,056
did it fall through?

JUNHWA: Yes.

359
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,894
They died in honor.

360

No, the file.

361
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,900
Did you not even find a trace of the file?

362
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,526
I apologize, sir.

363
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,864
I heard your arm got blown away.

364
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,159
But you still have a wrist.

365
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:51,247
Tell me what happened there in detail.

366
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,502
Do children of the gifted from the South

367
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,797
also have special abilities?

368
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,216
Let me ask you something first.

369
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,803
What is it?

370
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,558
Wasn't it enough
to just kill those related to the project?

371
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:15,563
Why did you order us to bring the file?

372
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,151
I needed to check it
for us to get started with it too.

373
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,029
(tense music)

374
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,242
What is that?

375
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,329
-(gunshot)
-(Chief groans)

376
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,500
(suspenseful music)

377
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,383
(door opens)

378
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:47,095
YEAR 1995, MOUNT SURI

379
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,520
Who are you anyway?

380
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,982
I'm someone who was selected before you.

381
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,233
Selected?

382
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,362
-It's more like I was caught.
-(sighs, inhales sharply)

383
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,533
Can you fly too?

384
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,702
No.

385
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,496
I'm just strong.

386
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,584
Then why didn't you resist?

387
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,589
For the same reason as yours.

388
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,384
Because of your family?

389
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,681
I'll become a father soon.

390
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,309
I'm expecting a baby.

391
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,439
Be quiet.

392
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,530
(metal door rattles, opens)

393
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,073
JUNHWA: Kim Doosik.

394
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,828
They'll be taking advantage of your child
as they did with you.

395
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,176
(footsteps receding)

396
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,397
SOLEMN DEVOTION SOLELY TO THE PROTECTION
AND HONOR OF OUR NATION

397
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,691
WE WORK IN THE SHADOWS
TO PROTECT THE SUNLIT LAND

398
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,778
-(groaning softly)
-(blood squirting)

399
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,908
YONGJUN (in weak voice): You idiot.

400
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,245
You actually bought what they said?

401
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,708
(wheezing)

402
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,669
I'm worried...

403
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,508
for this country.

404
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,972
You damn bastard.

405
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,019
We are...

406
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,606
useless now.

407
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,062
(door bell jingling)

408
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,775
NAMSAN DONKATSU
WE ARE OPEN

409
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,277
HOST (on TV):
...together with the performances,

410
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,320
there will be a ceremony on the fourth

411
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,073
and an airshow
by the Air Force demonstration Team,

412
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,700
-Black Eagles on the fifth.
-(sniffing)

413
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,826
JUWON (shouts): Hey, you!

414
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,120
-You fool!
-(soft gasp)

415
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,873
-What do you think you're doing?
-(grunts)

416
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:06,377
The oil is 180 °C.
Why are you frying your hands?

417
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,629
-Just fry the chicken!
-YONGDEUK: I'm sorry.

418
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,840
JUWON: Don't lick your fingers.

419
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,091
YONGDEUK: Sorry, sir.

420
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,093
JUWON: It's for the customers,
for goodness' sake.

421
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,345
Be careful not to get hurt.

422
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,514
You're killing me.

423
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,308
Hi, Huisoo.

424
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,684
-Dad.
-Yes?

425
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,227
Stop grilling Uncle.

426
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,562
I mean...

427
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,191
he looks so hideous
that I can't even make him wait tables.

428
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,650
JUWON: He's such a nuisance.

429
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,277
What's wrong with Uncle?

430
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,987
"Uncle"?

431
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,447
I look at your face everyday.

432
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,116
How can you call this face "uncle"?
Stop smiling!

433
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:39,994
(device chimes)

434
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,497
-JUWON: Can you?
-Uncle, we're getting an order.

435
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,124
HUISOO:
Uncle's good at finding directions.

436
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,712
-Wear a helmet and a mask, you punk.
-Yes.

437
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,422
-JUWON: Cover your face, got it?
-Yes.

438
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:52,965
JUWON (shouts): Go then!

439
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,176
Look alive, damn it.

440
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,762
(indistinct TV chatter)

441
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,306
-Dad.
-Yes?

442
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,475
Should we change
the name of our restaurant?

443
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,144
To what?

444
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,480
World's Safest Fried Chicken Place.

445
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,440
JUWON: Hmm...

446
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,526
REPORTER (on TV): Breaking news.

447
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,196
About 30 minutes ago,
a fire broke out at a skyscraper in Seoul.

448
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,949
People trapped on the top floors
were waiting for a rescue helicopter

449
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,910
as the firefighters
were unable to reach that height.

450
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,538
-The mysterious figure appeared again...
-Why pick yellow?

451
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,705
It's so tacky.

452
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,251
No, I think it's cool.

453
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,837
REPORTER: The man saved people
from the burning building

454
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,756
-and disappeared again without a trace.
-JUWON (sighs): All right.

455
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,427
He showed up in the yellow raincoat again
and safely rescued the people.

456
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,763
His exact identity is still unknown,

457
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:44,475
but he is now nicknamed Yellow Man.

458
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,271
Like a flying hero from a movie,

459
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,649
-Yellow Man flies through buildings...
-You got this.

460
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,484
...and rescued the people.

461
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,738
Does Yellow Man really have
the supernatural power to fly?

462
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,825
As you can see in the video
provided by the citizens,

463
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,579
he is clearly seen to be flying
even if he's obscured by black smoke.

464
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,081
-I'm back.
-Hey, son.

465
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,960
REPORTER: This is a video
filmed from a different angle...

466
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,005
Choose a good one
and remove the fat clean.

467
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,216
Mom, how much meat?

468
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,801
About 20 geun.

469
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,803
-About 20 geun?
-Yes.

470
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,974
She says business is going well
at the new place too.

471
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,646
MAN 1: His Alzheimer's
is only going to get worse.

472
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,816
-MAN 2: The real estate agent next door...
-MAN 1: Yes.

473
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,860
-MAN 2: He's gone.
-MAN 1: Really?

474
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,945
-MAN 3: Already?
-MAN 1: Oh, no.

475
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,782
-MAN 1: I'm worried about that guy.
-(exclaiming)

476
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,285
I told you.

477
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,078
(laughs)

478
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,124
Hooray!

479
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,210
(uplifting music)

480
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,340
(yawning)

481
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,009
-Hey, thanks.
-(soft chuckle)

482
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,346
You look tired.

483
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,139
Well, I'm old now.

484
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,018
If you feel tired,

485
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,146
listen to the radio music as you drive.

486
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,731
Should I?

487
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,609
Which music should I listen to?

488
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,488
-Classical music?
-Classical music, you say?

489
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,365
(Gyedo and bus driver chuckle)

490
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,705
(calm music)

491
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,371
MIHYUN: Bongseok, I'll take down
the laundry. Stay downstairs.

492
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,872
BONGSEOK: No, I can do it.

493
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,292
-MIHYUN: I said I'll do it.
-BONGSEOK: It's okay.

494
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,378
MIHYUN: You're being strange today.
Why are you being so nice?

495
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,922
(footsteps approaching)

496
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,132
(Mihyun pants)

497
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,224
(soft music)

498
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,246
(soft music continues)

499
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,749
(soft chuckle)

500
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,756
(soft chuckle)

501
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,784
We just got the delivery out.
It'll be there soon.

502
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,203
-Yes, thank you. Bye.
-(engine starts)

503
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,788
I'm off.

504
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,831
Be careful on the way.

505
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,306
(bright upbeat music)

506
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,728
Does it have a happy ending?

507
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,773
(soft chuckle)

508
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,948
(bright upbeat music continues)

509
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:22,878
Yes.

510
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,357
(tinkles)

511
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,755
(closing theme music)

512
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,700
(sighs)

00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:02,663

00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,679
(tense music)

516
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,856
(door closes)

517
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,825
(sighs)

518
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,455
What is it?

519
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,083
At your service, sir.

520
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,549
Let's dedicate our lives...

521
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,761
to our country.

522
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,279
(tense music continues)

523
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,376
(suspenseful music)

524
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:38,634
(sighs)

525
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,526
-SERGEANT (in English): Alex.
