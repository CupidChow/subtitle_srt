-GANGSTER 4: You're here, sir!

00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,193
What took you so long?

16
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,320
Did you get lost again?

17
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,739
GANGSTER 5: All right, come at me, punk.

18
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,075

00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,046
Out of the way.

00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,632
Hey, what's your deal?

24
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,467
JUWON: Move.

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,384
(scoffs)

26
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,220
Take a look at this clown.

27
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,387

00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,555

29
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,770
JUWON: All I had was a strong body.

30
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,983
But it was way too strong.

31
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:54,739
I chose to do the easiest thing
I could do with it.

32
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,660
People called me the Monster.

Excuse me?

00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,388
Oh, my goodness.

38
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,556

EPISODE 10: THE MONSTER

00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,060
Hey.

41
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,938
This is just nuts.

42
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,314

JAESUNG: Was it you?

45
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,133
I tried to knock some sense
into the country bumpkins in Pohang,

46
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,969
but one persistent bastard
kept getting in my way.

47
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,395
What is this?

48
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,565
A business transfer contract
for this nightclub.

49
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:12,859
Sign it.

50
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,739
Do you really think
you can take over here?

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,283
Sign it.

52
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,784
You think this is over?

53
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,869
Sign it.

54
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,628
You bumpkins should be
catching saury in Pohang.

55
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,381
How dare you bring
your sorry asses down to Ulsan?

56
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,674
Who struck first?

57
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,720
Aren't you the one who dragged us in?

58
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,766
What crap are you spewing?

59
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,476
If you don't know, then who will?

60
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,103
You damn lowlife.

61
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,314
You bastard.

62
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,818
You've got a lot of gall.
Should I rip the bladder out for you?

63
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,737
What are you going to do
with my gallbladder?

64
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,530
What?

65
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,325
Should I take it out and show you?

66
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,000
(ominous music)

67
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,377
(groaning)

68
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,629
Let me see.

69
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,257
Where's my gallbladder?

70
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,633
(Minki grunts in disgust)

71
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,935
JUWON: Is it here?

72
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,316
Are you even human?

73
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,819
What are you?

74
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,613
Sign it.

75
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,366
You monstrous bastard.

76
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,577
That's right.

77
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,121
What?

78
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,832
JUWON: Sign it.

79
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,917
(suspenseful music)

80
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,928
BUSINESS TRANSFER CONTRACT

81
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,639
I AGREE TO TRANSFER THE BUSINESS ABOVE
TO THE PERSON STATED BELOW

82
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,475
TRANSFERER: JEON JAESUNG
TRANSFEREE: KIM GWANGJIN

83
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:15,857
Here you go, sir.

84
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,070
-Thank you, boss.
-MEN: Thank you, boss.

85
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,138
(Juwon grunts)

86
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:50,767
(Juwon sighs)

87
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,149
Hey.

88
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,693
You should run a knife store
or something, boss.

89
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,195
(laughs)

90
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,072
It's going to hurt a bit.

91
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,365
(groans)

92
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,783
(grunts)

93
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,826
(sighs)

94
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,912
Jeez.

95
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,497
Are you okay, sir?

96
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,248
I'm fine.

97
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,750
The big boss gave me the car keys,

98
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,003
so we could go to a sauna
and have dinner somewhere fancy.

99
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,047
-(chuckles)
-Forget about the sauna.

100
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,674
-Hey.
-Yes?

101
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,885
You can have the boys drive the car.

102
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,595
Why would you run such a petty errand?

103
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,597
It's because I want to.

104
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,182
I'm your right-hand man.

105
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,102
-Jeez, you're sucking up to me again.
-(laughing)

106
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,646
Is everything settled outside?

107
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,941
Of course. The Monster came here himself.

108
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,736
You were like, "Sign it."

109
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,030
It was so cool.

110
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,281
-(laughing)
-Whatever.

111
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:53,204
Goodness. We started
from a tiny port in Pohang.

112
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,914
But we took over Gyeongju

113
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,793
and even came down to Ulsan,
all thanks to you.

114
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,629
Everyone freaks out
when the Monster shows up.

115
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,005
Shut it, you brat.

116
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,340
(laughs)

117
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,008
Do you remember, sir?

118
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,972
The Ulsan boys sent so many butchers
just to bring you down.

119
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,224
And it was all for nothing.

120
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,143
You're called the Monster for a reason.

121
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,730
-Are you making fun of my nickname?
-No, boss.

122
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,566
What was yours again?

123
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,443
The Yangdeok-dong Boar.

124
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,402
Boar?

125
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,903
(both laughing)

126
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,238
That's crazy.

127
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:32,660
I'm honored to be able to serve you, boss.

128
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,537
What are you saying?

129
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:39,459
In this field, we're all family.

130
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,210
That's right, boss.

131
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,256
Take your time.
I'll turn up the AC in the car.

132
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,342
Oh, right.

133
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,053
Did you know this is the ladies' room?

134
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,597
Is it?

135
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,265
(both laugh)

00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,143
GANGSTER 6: The boss is out.

138
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,270
I love you, boss.

139
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,980
I love you, boss.

140
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,148
Thank you, boss.

141
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,150
Thank you, boss.

142
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,943
-Thank you, boss.
-Thank you, boss.

143
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,904
-You have my respect, boss.
-I love you, boss.

144
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,031
-Thank you, boss.
-Thank you, boss.

145
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,700
-(stomach rumbles)
-Huh?

146
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,496
(laughs)

147
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,500
What do you want to have, boss?

148
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,709
Just name it.

149
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,755
They wouldn't have sunfish here,
would they?

150
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,048
Sunfish?

151
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,300
Why do you want sunfish?

152
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,139
Are you craving Pohang food already?

153
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,390
(laughs)

154
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,728
MINKI: I think sunfish tastes too bland.

155
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,688
I don't really like it.

156
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,148
What are you saying?

157
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,151
You can't call yourself a Pohang native
if you can't eat it.

158
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,530
Oh, sunfish...
(clicks tongue)

159
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,115
I doubt it's common here.

160
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,535
Never mind.

161
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,205
I hear mulhoe in Ulsan
is as good as that in Pohang.

162
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,040
Let's just have mulhoe.

163
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,917
Thank you, boss.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,460
(both laugh)

165
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,713
(sighs)

166
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,633
(calm music)

167
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,311
My goodness.

6 MONTHS LATER

169
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,443
DRIVER 1: What do I do?

170
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,112
There's so much blood.

171
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,908
I'll call an ambulance.

172
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,956
-Hey.
-Yes?

173
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,461
You're awake!

174
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,006
Thank goodness.

175
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,134
No, don't move. Stay still.

176
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,595
I'll call an ambulance right now.

177
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,097
Stay here for a moment.

178
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,140
Hey.

179
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,391
Yes?

180
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,310
What is it?

181
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,853
Come here.

182
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,439
But you have to see a doctor at--

183
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,149
Just come here.

184
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,943
Okay.

185
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:16,407
Are you just going to report
that you run someone over?

186
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:17,867
What?

187
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,161
(sniffs)

188
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,122
Are you drunk?

189
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,499
Well...
(sighs)

190
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,545
I'll settle with you.

191
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,882
No, sir. You need to see
a doctor first and--

192
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,759
Just calm down.

193
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,304
I'll take care of the treatment.

194
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,514
So just pay me money.

195
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:45,394
But your ankle...

196
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,523

-DRIVER 1: No, don't!

197

00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,120

200
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,145
Where am I?

201
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,356
I'm lost again.

00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,872
Hello, boss.

212
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,708
Hello, boss.

213
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,418
-Did you eat?
-Hello, boss!

214
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,504
(upbeat music playing)

215
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,758
Hello, boss.

216
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,180
GWANGJIN: Thank you.

217
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,731
Hey. You're here.

218
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,819
What on earth...

219
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,155
What's that punk doing here--

220
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,115
We're having an important conversation.

221
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,909
It's nothing serious, though.

222
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,204
Why, you...

223
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,873
-GWANGJIN: Come on.
-No, it's okay.

224
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,876
Did you say your name was Gwangjin?

225
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,295
Speak to my boss with respect,
you lowlife.

226
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,630
Hey, Monster.

227
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,509
Can't you read the air here?

228
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,760
Shut your mouth.

229
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,639
Boss, what is going on?

230
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,767
-I thought we took over Ulsan.
-(snorts)

231
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,144
That's not it.

232
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,522
Jeez.

233
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,567
What should I do with this idiot?

234
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,321
You don't get the situation, do you?

235
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,949
Shut it if you don't want to die.

236
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,661
Hey, Gwangjin.

237
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,164
I really can't stand this guy.

238
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:38,502
Call my boss by his name again,
and I'll kill you.

239
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,755
Just try me.

240
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,799
(scoffs)

241
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,095
What the hell are you looking--

242
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,847
-Shut your mouth!
-Boss!

243
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,932
-Stay outside for a bit.
-(cackles)

244
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,935
Let's have a drink together
with Minki later.

245
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,020
But, boss!

246
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,063
I said stay out.

247
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,734
(snickers)

248
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,614

250
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,951
MINKI: Isn't this sunfish?

251
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,664
The big boss prepared this for you.

252
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,041
(Minki laughs)

253
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,418
Here, sir.

254
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,297
Minki told me that you craved sunfish.

255
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,761
Are you missing the dishes back in Pohang?

256
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,603
(sighs)

257
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,275
GWANGJIN: Ah, it's not bad.

258
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,196
Juwon, listen carefully.

259
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,116
We can't take over Ulsan, anyway.

260
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,953
Pohang can never take Ulsan.

261
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,955
What are you talking about?

262
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,625
That scum signed the transfer contract.

263
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,918
Come on.

264
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,920
-That's not it.
-Then what is it?

265
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,423
(sighs)
They offered a merger.

266
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,884
GWANGJIN: It's like an agreement.

267
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,387
A merger? An agreement?

268
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,806
What are we, a company?

269
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,474
I already told you.

270
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,145
They have so many heavy industries here.
And a huge automobile factory.

271
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,690
GWANGJIN: Ulsan is way bigger
than Pohang in scale.

272
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,024
What scale?

273
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,735
-Can't you tell? Money, of course!
-(thumps)

274
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,946
Boss.

275
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,698
So, is this about money?

276
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,660
What else did you think, then?

277
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,454
Being a gangster is a job.

278
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,581
Why are you a gangster, then?

279
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,583
Like other gangsters,

280
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,919
we're all here to make money.

281
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,837
No.

282
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,338
What are you saying?

283
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,215
I did it all to protect our boys.

284
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,845
It's not even been that long
since we've arrived here,

285
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,888
and you're already persuaded
by his money talk.

286
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,600
Is it wrong to be persuaded by money?

287
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,772
Juwon, why do we stab people for a living?

288
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,150
Isn't it all for money?

289
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,570
Have you ever been stabbed for a living?

290
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,448
I have.

291
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,908
Many times at that.

292
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:22,207
But I've never stabbed someone else
for a living.

293
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:25,961

Oh!

311
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,697
I paid you yesterday.

312
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,699
That was for your overdue payment.

313
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,119
You said you'd keep staying.
Pay me for your future stay.

314
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,955
A long-term stay must be paid in advance.

315
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,500
All right. I'll pay you
as soon as possible.

316
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,377
How much longer will you stay here?

317
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,713
Don't pay me a week's worth each time.

318
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,509
Just pay a month's worth at once.

319
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,511
I'll give you a discount.

320
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,972
I'll pay a week's worth at a time.

321
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:01,932
Yeah?

322
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,393

I'm with Ulsan, sir.

-Who?
-Bae Minki.

His office is on the left

338
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,444

-Yes, sir.

00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,033

I'm sorry, sir.

347
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,966
I had a late lunch with the boys.

348
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,218
Did you?

349
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,719
What is this thing?

350
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,262
Okay. I'll eat on my own.

UMJI: I don't want it.
I'm not in the condition for it today.

366
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,148
GUEST 7: Condition?

367
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,985
Who cares? I'm all right.

368
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,862
-UMJI: You lousy pervert!
-(objects clatter)

369
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,406
Just get out of my face.

370
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,491
GUEST 7: What? Pervert?

371
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,576
-Lousy pervert?
-GUEST 8: What's going on?

372
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,328
GUEST 7: Have you lost your mind?

373
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,957
You're here to sell coffee,
but you never act pretty.

374
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,000
As if.

375
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,460
Why don't you ask
your little sister to do it?

376
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,962
You fucking bitch.

377
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,089
Hey, give me my 10,000 won back.

378
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,048
(sighs)

379
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,092
Why should I give it back to you?

380
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,093
(scoffs)

381
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:46,430
Are you kidding me?
A cup of coffee can't be 10,000 won.

382
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,514
GUEST 8: What's with him?

383
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,725
(sighs)

384
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,438
It's 1,200 won if you have it at the shop.

385
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,732
UMJI: And since we take
at least two cups for delivery,

386
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,692
it's 10,000 won
with a late-night surcharge.

387
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,864
Didn't you know?

388
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,282
Fuck you, that's...

389
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,659
That's what I pay to touch you.

390
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,828
It's for delivery, you fucker.

391
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,790
And talk to me with respect, kid.

392
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,542
I'm old enough.

393
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,712
Don't fucking look down on me
just because I make deliveries, you scum.

394
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,131
Even a dog doesn't mess with its own bowl.

395
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,633
Fucking hell.

396
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,177
GUEST 9: She's coming.

397
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,054
-GUEST 7: Fuck.
-(door closes)

398
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,555
GUEST 7: Fuck!

399
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,744
(car approaching)

400
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,626
(grunting)

401
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,176
-(body squelches)
-(tires screech)

402
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,931
(breathing shakily)

403
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,144
(driver 2 whimpering)

404
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,489
It's worth 15 days
if you pay 4,000 won more.

405
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,449
Do you have 4,000 won?

406
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,993
-No.
-(scoffs)

407
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,037
I'm leaving one room out for you,

408
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,164
even though
our place is always fully booked.

409
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:41,002
And we're the only motel
that allows a long-term stay in the area.

410
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,004
I know.

411
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,256
Gosh.

412
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,008
Fine.
(clicks tongue)

413
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,760
I'll give you a discount.

414
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,389
Just don't use too much water.

415
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,933
And you seem to be keeping
your lights on every night.

416
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,017
What do you do?

417
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,354
Just go to bed early.
Let's save on electricity.

418
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,481
And you always keep the windows open.

419
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,400
Turn the heater off
if you're going to do that.

420
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,694
You're being too strict.

421
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,863
You don't even clean the room.

422
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,031
Oh, my!

423
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,408
(laughs)

424
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,205
Cleaning service is not an option
for long-term stays.

425
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,958
This is not a hotel.

426
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,751
Just get a hotel room, then.

427
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,922
Excuse me. Which room is it, lady?

428
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,467
MOTEL OWNER: Hi. Record here first.

429
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,427
Here.

430
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,599
UMJI

431
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,310
So, which room is it?

432
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,687
Room 413.

433
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,941
But why do you always call me "lady"?

434
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,278
Others call me auntie... No, by my name.

435
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,572
It's not like we're that close.

436
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,240
(scoffs)

437
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,826
That little brat.

438
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,244
(sighs)

439
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,789
Anyway, I gave you a 4,000-won discount.

440
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,876
UMJI, HWANG 1, 413

441
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,004
UMJI: Hey.

442
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,882
You've got blood on you.

443
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,303
Oh, yes.

444
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,597
I knew that.

445
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,182
So you know.

446
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:42,165
(muffled chattering)

447
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,836
REPORTER: It's been a year in which
various heinous crimes were rampant

448
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,631
to the point that a war on crime
had to be declared.

449
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,550
Now that we're nearing
the end of this year,

450
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:55,428
what score would you give
for public safety?

451
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,846
We have reporter Lee Hyeonjae

452
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,058
to look into the effects and problems
of the war on crime.

453
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,396
(applause)

454
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,486
I hereby declare war on crime and violence

455
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,365
that paralyzes our communities.

456
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:21,746
SPEAKER: With every presidential right
deriving from the Constitution...

457
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,083
UMJI: Bye.

458
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,794
-Oh!
-My goodness!

459
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,005
(objects clatter)

460
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,382
Gosh, darn it.

461
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:35,844
What was that?

462
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,886
"Gosh, darn it."

463
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,639
I meant that it was a waste.

464
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,182
-Gosh.
-I'm sorry.

465
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,977
Don't apologize.
We bumped into each other.

466
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,020
Goodness.

467
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,440
It's like a scene from a TV show.

468
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,860
A man and a woman run
into each other in a hallway,

469
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,863
drop something, and pick it up together.

470
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,531
Is that how it is in TV shows?

471
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,203
I bet you don't know.
You only watch wrestling.

472
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:05,999
(exhales sharply)

473
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,293
The walls are quite thin, aren't they?

474
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,170
How old are you?

475
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,089
Why?

476
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,592
It's hard to guess your age,
because of your beard.

477
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,511
You have a weird way of talking,

478
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,222
but not a lot of people talk
to someone like me with respect.

479
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,517
What do you mean by someone like you?

480
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,354
Don't you know? A coffee lady.

481
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,272
So what?

482
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:36,321
Most old men I meet
at a place like this talk to me rudely.

483
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,324
(clears throat)

484
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,617
(mutters)

485
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,743
I'm not old.

486
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,995
You look like you're at least 40.

487
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,707
Is she blind or what?

488
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,545
GUKBINGWAN NIGHTCLUB

489
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,588
GANGSTER 8: Right.

490
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,131
(men laughing)

491
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,009
BATTA: You can't trust girls.

492
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,260
-I don't trust her.
-Boss!

493
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,637
-Hello, boss!
-Hello, boss!

494
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,971
BATTA: All right.

495
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,056
Oh, hey.

496
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:05,809
JUWON: Batta.

497
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,727
What are you doing here?

498
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,355
Goodness.

499
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,526
The Monster remembers me. What an honor.

500
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,027
Why are you snooping around here?

501
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,404
Want another beating?

502
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,571
What are you saying?

503
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,531
What?

504
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,532
What's your deal?

505
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,283
-What?
-What?

506
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,080
Say "what" again, and I'll kill you.

507
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,207
(scoffs)

508
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,130
Ah...

509
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,258
That idiot doesn't know
he's been tossed out.

510
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,718
Huh?

511
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,302
MINKI: I feel great, boss.

512
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,347
Let's drink. It's good to see you, boss.

513
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,686
Hello, boss.

514
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,939
Oh, hey.

515
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,024
GWANGJIN: What brings you here?

516
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,235
MINKI: Right. What brings you here, sir?

517
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,278
(Minki laughs)

518
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,989
Why are you here again?

519
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,116
MINKI: It's not like that, boss.

520
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,911
The Ulsan big boss and our big boss
have something to discuss--

521
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,414
Juwon, don't just stand there.

522
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,916
Come join us for a drink.

523
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,460
GWANGJIN: I'll explain everything.

524
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,465
Juwon, I'm your boss.

525
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,300
Listen to me, okay?

526
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,177
No, that's not it.

527
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,512
What are you doing, Gwangjin?

528
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,806
I make the call, remember?

529
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:33,938
I told you not to call my boss
by his name.

530
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,858
He's still so stiff.

531
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,321
This really won't do.
What should we do, Gwangjin?

532
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:42,947
I'm sorry, boss.

533
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,742
Boss.

534
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,078
You're calling him "boss"?

535
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,872
JAESUNG: Sure.

536
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,709
If you want to join us, call me "boss."

537
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,919
-Then I'll let you in.
-You...

538
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,921
Knock it off!

539
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,130
Boss!

540
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,258
Have you already forgotten
how many of our boys

541
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,968
got hospitalized because of that scum?

542
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,678
I'll compensate them all.

543
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,264
But things have got to work.

544
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,974
Once we join hands
with our boss over here,

545
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,977
-compensating them will be a piece of--
-Stop calling him "boss"!

546
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,896
What's wrong with that?

547
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,273
GWANGJIN: I can call him that
countless times.

548
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,109
It's not that hard to call him "boss."

549
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,946
Everything's going well,
but because of you...

550
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,156
Boss.

551
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,368
How can you say that to me?

552
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,453
I can't do it.

553
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,624
Have you forgotten
that I got stabbed by his minions?

554
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,126
I got stabbed on your behalf

555
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,588
and was beaten up even more
from Pohang to Ulsan.

556
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,965
Fuck!

557
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,176
You don't feel pain, anyway.

558
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,222
You're a monster.

559
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,148
JAESUNG: Hey, Monster.
This is your last chance.

560
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,485
Go ahead and call me "boss."

561
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,493
Just keep stuffing your face.

562
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,168
Remember that I told you
that this was your last chance.

563
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,716
(engine zooming)

564
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,800
(groans)

565
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,597
(engine roaring)

566
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,435
Why that...

567
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,772
A hit-and-run?

568
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,816
A hit-and-run?

569
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,700
Hey, you hit-and-run bastard!

570
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,202
UMJI: What did you say? A hit-and-run?

571
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,497
Hey, you hit-and-run bastard!

572
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,000
That car hit and ran?

573
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,003
Did it hit you?

574
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,422
Should I chase it?
It probably hasn't gone too far.

575
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,093
Actually, chasing it alone won't do.
Want to hop on?

576
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,181
But if we catch the culprit,
we split the money.

577
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,142
(panting)

578
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,103
What? Are you giving up?

579
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,564
But why?

580
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,900
I can't catch up.

581
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,446
And I was caught running around fine,
so it won't work.

582
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,367
You were caught?

583
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,745
Just go on your way.

584
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,916
All right, then. Bye.

585
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,584
Wait.

586
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,211
Look.

587
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,172
Do you know the direction
to Saemaeul Bank?

588
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,467
I remember it was near some market.

589
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,719
The one across Freedom Market?
What about it?

590
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,180
I might be able to find
the motel from there.

591
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,642
Motel? You mean, Motel Plus?

592
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,481
Are you bad with directions?

593
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:04,691
(clears throat)

594
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,861
But it's a little too far to walk there.

595
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,905
I'll be fine.

596
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,575
Then again, you won't be able
to get a taxi from here.

597
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,122
Do you see the church tower over there?

598
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,291
-That one over there.
-JUWON: Yes.

599
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,378
The red cross.
It's confusing with too many alleys here.

600
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,797
So just walk straight toward that cross.

601
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,299
And you'll get to the intersection
with Sangok Supermarket.

602
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,803
You'll see Samyong Apartment
across the supermarket.

603
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,180
Go along that side street,
and Freedom Market will show up.

604
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,641
You'll see the Saemaeul Bank there.

605
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,603
Hey, what are you daydreaming about?
Did you hear what I said?

606
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,605
Yes.

607
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,441
Uh, okay?

608
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,445
Is there an easier way?

609
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,280
An easy way to go straight to the motel.

610
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,575
There are so many roads here.
You can't go straight to the motel.

611
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,745
No wonder you get lost all the time.
Take one step at a time.

612
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,746
Again.

613
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,663
Okay.

614
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,791
Walk straight toward the cross.

615
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,377
Sangok Supermarket.
The intersection. Freedom Market.

616
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,212
Bye.

617
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,646
The church.

618
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,981
Sangok Supermarket.

619
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,401
Freedom Market. Sangok Supermarket.

620
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,445
JUWON: Sangok Supermarket.

621
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,866
(quirky music)

622
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,393
Sangok Supermarket.

623
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:37,927
Boss!

624
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,595
(laughing)

625
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,224
Boss, sorry I made you wait long.

626
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:50,439
Ma'am, you have
the big sunfish ready, right?

627
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,024
Bring it over here.

628
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,112
Why did you order a big one
when you don't even like it?

629
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,780
Because I'm joining you.

630
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,161
Come on. Stay seated.

631
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,292
GWANGJIN: Juwon.

632
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,011
(laughs)

633
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,889
MINKI: Goodness, boss.

634
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,099
Have a drink and make up.

635
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,019
We're all working
to make the best out of things.

636
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,272
Here.

637
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,816
Boss, let me pour you a drink.

638
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,485
Goodness.

639
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,156
What a big plate of sunfish.

640
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,743
(laughing)

641
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,914
Come on, drink up.

642
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,752
I had to prepare this delicious sunfish
in advance for today.

643
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,879
It wasn't easy for me.

644
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,756
You don't even like sunfish.

645
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,591
Hey.

646
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,643
(sniffles)

647
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,272
MINKI: Here's a piece for you.

648
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,900
(Minki chuckles)

649
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,029
One for you, too, big boss.

650
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,121
How nice.

651
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,336
MINKI: Boss.

652
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,587
(Minki chuckles)

653
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,547
Are you okay?

654
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:42,551
Goodness, my head is spinning.

655
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,470
-(breathes deeply)
-GWANGJIN: Ah...

656
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,473
I wanted to beat Juwon
with drinking at least,

657
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,141
but I guess that's out of the window.

658
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,145
Juwon, what do you drink for?

659
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,898
You don't get drunk,
no matter how much you drink.

660
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,861
I seem to be getting tipsy today, though.

661
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:01,779
(grunts)

662
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,116
My head is killing me.

663
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,410
Are you feeling dizzy, boss?

664
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,704
What are you saying?

665
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,790
I'm fine, you punk.

666
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:19,505
(groans) Come to think of it,
Minki, you've grown so much.

667
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,715
Come on, boss.

668
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,550
GWANGJIN: See?

669
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,846
You used to call me "big boss,"

670
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,514
but now you just call me "boss."

671
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,391
He has grown a lot.

672
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,354
You even made him
the administrative manager.

673
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,023
GWANGJIN: What?

674
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:38,941
I did?

675
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,819
You sure are drunk, aren't you?

676
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:49,285
What is this about? Huh?

677
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,830
You little...

678
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,499
Boss!

679
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,543
-Boss?
-Boss.

680
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,253
Boss!

681
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,672
MINKI: What's wrong with...

682
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,052
What's going on?

683
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:08,971
Boss?

684
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,392
(foreboding music)

685
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,854
MINKI: Boss.

686
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:19,732
Boss!

687
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,071
GANGSTER 9: Chairman Jeon,
the anchor's down.

688
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,405
Should we get started?

689
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,490
Yes.

690
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,036
Oh, dear. Chairman Jeon.

691
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,747
This punk's waking up.

692
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,831
JAESUNG: What?

693
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,000
Move aside.

694
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,335
(cackles)

695
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:41,921
Whoa...

696
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,800
He sure is a monster. Huh?

697
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,927
JAESUNG: We drugged him
a whole bunch and he's already awake.

698
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,762
Batta.

699
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,350
Hey.

700
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,435
Hey. Goodness.

701
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,271
He's really awake.

702
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,108
JAESUNG: He really is a monster.

703
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,029
What is this?

704
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,698
JAESUNG: Can't you tell?

705
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,701
I did tell you it was your last chance.

706
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,830
You never listen.

707
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,876
Boys, push it in.

708
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,794
GANGSTERS: Yes, sir!

709
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,296
JUWON: What are you doing?

710
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,048
What the hell are you doing?

711
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,883
Let's go!

712
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,009
What the hell?

713
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:30,928
What are you doing?

714
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,180
(grunting)

715
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,307
Stop right now!

716
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,143
JUWON: Stop!

717
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,901
What are you waiting for? Push harder!

718
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,319
GANGSTER: Yes, sir!

719
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,989
BATTA: Are you starved or what?

720
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,949
Let's have fun sailing!

721
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,409
Set the boat afloat!

722
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,535
GANGSTERS: Heave-ho!

723
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,661
Untie me now!

724
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,371
-GANGSTERS: Heave-ho!
-(grunts)

725
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,833
We've made so much effort to tie you up.
Why would we untie you?

726
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,042
JUWON: You lowlife.

727
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,128
Once I'm free, I'll kill you!

728
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,130
That is exactly why you're going to die.

729
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,717
Didn't I say I'd kill you
if you ran your mouth?

730
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,636
Remember? So why did you have to act up?

731
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,055
-GANGSTERS: Heave-ho!
-JUWON: Boss, wake up!

732
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,183
Gwangjin, wake up!

733
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,685
-Gwangjin!
-JAESUNG: He's not going to wake up.

734
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,563
He's not a monster like you.

735
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,525
JUWON: Gwangjin!
(yells)

736
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,445
(suspenseful music)

737
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,531
Gwangjin...

738
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,283
Spare him.

739
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,910
I was against it,

740
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:40,122
but Gwangjin agreed
to the merger and the agreement!

741
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:41,832
Please!

742
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,543
Please spare him.

743
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,380
Move aside.

744
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,052
JAESUNG: What should I do with this idiot?

745
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,179
I feel so bad for you.

746
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,723
Hey, Monster.

747
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,518
The merger? The agreement?

748
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,895
It wasn't my offer.

749
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,773
Your boss suggested it first.

750
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,691
Don't you get it?

751
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,153
You said you were from Guryongpo, Pohang?

752
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:15,491
Your tiny countryside town
is not even worth taking over.

753
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,453
Ah... Do you know who started the fight?

754
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,082
It was you, Pohang bastards.

755
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,501
Your boys in the hospital

756
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,087
were sent here by Gwangjin,
that's how they got hurt.

757
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,505
You had no idea, didn't you?

758
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,549
Gwangjin, that scum,

759
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,719
pushed it all the way here
with you as his human shield.

760
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,931
You really didn't know anything?

761
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:46,313
(shouting)

762
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,365
Then who do you think leaked the info?

763
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,744
Minki.

764
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,289
Sorry I made you wait long.

765
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,876
He told me you wouldn't die

766
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,838
even if we stab you or bash your head in.

767
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,508
He said he knew all about you
and gave me a tip.

768
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,426
(Jaesung laughs)

769
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,054
That this is the most certain way

770
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,723
to kill you.

771
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,059
-(taps on car)
-Let's go, boys.

772
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,397
BATTA: Farewell!

773
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,982
Let's go, boys!

774
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,734
(gangsters grunting)

775
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,703
-JAESUNG: Bring me the peanuts.
-GANGSTER 9: Here, sir.

776
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,458
Here you go.

777
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,418
(all laughing)

778
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,464
Batta.

779
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,549
Get the boys a drink.

780
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,925
Goodness.

781
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,177
Let's go for a drink!

782
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,345
-Thank you, sir!
-Good work!

783
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,680
-Thank you, sir!
-Thank you, sir!

784
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,909
(suspenseful music)

785
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,998
(muffled scream)

786
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,326
(distant bellowing)

787
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:04,636
(deep bellowing)

788
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,497
(Juwon pants)

789
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:46,220
(panting)

790
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,440
(horn honks)

791
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,279
What are you doing here?

792
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,990
Are you still lost?

793
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,284
That was forever ago.

794
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,745
(sobs)

795
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:12,704
What's going on?

796
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,001
Are you crying?

797
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,673
Are you okay?

798
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,183
I can't find my way.

799
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,901
What's with you? You're a grown man.

800
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,113
JUWON: I always...

801
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,159
chose to go the easiest way.

802
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,837
(waves crashing)

803
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,193
(foreboding music)

804
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:37,789
(Minki sobbing)

805
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,378
I'm sorry.

806
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,673
MINKI: I'm sorry.

807
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,763
I'm sorry.

808
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,307
Boss, I'm sorry.

809
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,475
(whimpers)

810
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,860
I'm sorry.

811
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,409
MINKI: Thank you, boss!

812
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,870
Thank you, boss!

813
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,456
Thank you, boss.

814
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,666
JUWON: "Boss" my foot...

815
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,005
Boss?

816
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,340
Boss.

817
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,386
(Minki whimpers)

818
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,137
-(handcuffs clink)
-I'm sorry, boss.

819
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,228
No, boss.

820
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,481
Boss--

821
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,276
No!

822
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,738
(whimpering)

823
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,864
MINKI: Boss!

824
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,254
(Minki whimpering)

825
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:26,523
(applauding)

826
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,984
Thanks for the story.

827
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,905
I heard about the monster
and came to see him, but I was late.

828
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,534
So use all the men you have to get him.

829
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,327
If you get him,

830
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,956
I'll exclude this district
from the war on crime.

831
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,499
Do you mean it?

832
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,044
Goodness, you idiot.

833
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:49,880
Think wisely.

834
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,216
You said he's a monster.

835
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,137
I'd like to check him myself,

836
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,265
just how useful he may be.

837
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,644
(closing theme music)
