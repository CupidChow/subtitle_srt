00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,072
Sorry.

29
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,323
What were you saying?

30
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,494
I asked you when you started teaching.

31
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,997
Oh, right.

32
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,251
Well, it's been about ten years.

33
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,628
How was it...

34
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,048
being a teacher?

SPECIAL FORCES: 1996-1999
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE: 2001-

38
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,674
So you joined here with your experience
as a national kendo athlete and a soldier?

39
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,009
Yes, sir.

40
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,178
-And you want to be a black agent?
-Yes, sir.

41
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,390
We're a classified group within the NIS,
so how did you find out about us?

42
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,726
I met Mr. Jo Raehyuk for the first time

43
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,603
during the armed spies mop-up
eight years ago.

44
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,648
So why do you want to be a black agent?

45
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,526
To exterminate North Korea's
dark ambition that threatens our peace

46
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,570
and repay the country

47
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,490
with all my body and soul!

48
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,116
Not that.

49
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,078
Be honest with me.

50
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,790
In Gangneung eight years ago,

51
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,918
I couldn't do anything
while my comrades were dying.

52
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,878
I felt helpless.

53
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,798
That was when a black agent saved us.

54
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,052
I heard there was a group
consisting of elite black agents.

55
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,555
I'd like to be a helping hand to them.

56
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,892
A helping hand?

57
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:32,981
Come here.

58
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,322
Do you know what a black agent is?

59
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:49,455
A black agent works for the country
with their identity hidden.

60
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,875
Hiding one's identity

61
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,213
means they have a secret to keep
from their family as well as friends.

62
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,425
Can you handle it?

63
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,759
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,014
And you don't care
whatever task you're given?

65
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,558
No, sir.

66
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,019
Your mission

67
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,481
is to find potential talents
and develop them to work for the country.

68
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,985
It's an essential project
for national security.

69
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,615
You must be thoroughly objective
when looking for potential talents.

70
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:25,908
Yes, sir.

71
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,329
Judge the students
in a strictly objective manner.

72
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,041
Subjective and personal feelings

73
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,917
will only hinder your judgment.

74
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,840
So keep your head cool at all times
and put useless emotions aside.

75
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,300
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,220
No matter how much time passes,

77
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,849
you must keep this principle.

78
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,768
Yes, sir.

79
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,604
Choi Ilhwan.

80
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:55,980
Yes, sir!

81
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,608
You are a black agent.

82
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,860
Thank you, sir.

Sir, I want a different partner.
I can't do this with him.

105
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,348
Hey, swap partners with me.

106
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,309
-Go do it with him.
-STUDENT 5: No.

107

-What's the deal with the battery?
-STUDENT 7: Who cares?

122
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,931
He's letting us slide for smoking.

RAEHYUK: Let's try taking
the simple route.

126
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,859
It'll be the easiest and most precise.

127
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,279
Is it really necessary?

128
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,699
If he gets beaten up to a pulp,

129
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,951
he'll use whatever he can to survive.

130
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,494
But he's still young.

131
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,834
Look, Mr. Choi. He will graduate soon.

132
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,876
We have no time.

133
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:50,089
We at least need to report
a definite yes or no.

134
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,341
-Still--
-Hey, Choi Ilhwan.

135

-Here.
-What?

144
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,828
Get it done quick.

Hey, what...

147
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,500
That's not going to get you home.

148
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,794
You fucker.

149
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,130
-You bastard.
-Fucking bastard.

00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,424

A Broadcasting and Entertainment major?
That's so out of the blue.

(exhales deeply)

164
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,323
Your practical exam scores
aren't quite good enough…

165
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,368
for a PE major.

166
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,247
You told me to prepare for a PE major

167
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,458
so that's all I've been doing.

168
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,339
The school thought
you were talented in sports,

169
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,676
but it wasn't the case.

170
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,930
The principal told my mother
that I had potential.

171
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,099
That's why I even transferred here.

172
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,728
Sorry about that.

00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,297
RAEHYUK: This is the time for us
to make some results.

364
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:32,179
Agent Yoon, you are to report
everything to me in detail from now on.

365
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,016
Yes, sir.

366
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,686
(Raehyuk sniffles)

367
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,439
I can take care of my own students.

368
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,652
Your students?

369
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,157
Goodness.

370
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,367
RAEHYUK: We told you to act
like a teacher.

371
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,662
Do you think you're actually a teacher?

372
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,915
I said greet each other.

373
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,588
Salute.

374
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,183
(sighs)

375
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:33,281
RAEHYUK: Make sure to pay extra attention
to Kim Doosik's son.

376
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,163
Remember that you're not
actually a teacher.

Are you the homeroom teacher
of 12th-grade class 3?

403

Yes, I'm Choi Ilhwan.

Thank you for your time.

411

-I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
-No problem.

412
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,947

We only have green tea here.

418
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,316
Would that be all right?

419
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,443

00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,259
CLEANER: Open the door.

422
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,638
I need to clean.

423
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,558
Why aren't you opening the door?

424
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,229
I saw you go in here.

425
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,774

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,798
SUNGWOOK (groans): Are you kidding me?

433
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,968
-Jeez.
-Thank you.

00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:45,969

Fuck...

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,952
I didn't even get to do...

442
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,209
GYEDO: I think the battery malfunctioned
all of a sudden.

443
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,421
OFFICER 2: Goodness, there was a problem
with the battery?

444
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,881
All right.

445
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,799
-Let me get your personal info.
-HUISOO: Let's go.

446
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,717
Hm?

447
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,510
-OFFICER 2: Your name?
-I lied to my dad.

448
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,887
And you lied to your mom.

449
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,305
Mm.

450
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,598
-Right.
-So let's go.

451
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,515
Okay.

452
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,644
-HUISOO: Let's hurry.
-It's 4028...

453
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,106
OFFICER 2: So you're currently working
for Donga Traffic Service,

454
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,233
-on bus number 304?
-GYEDO: Yes.

455
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,027
(Huisoo gasps)

456
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,695
Your charger.

457
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,864
I think I dropped it.

458
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,243
It's okay. I'm close to Bungaeman.
I can look for it later.

459
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,955
-Are you sure?
-Yes, it's all right.

460
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,541
-Then let's go.
-Okay.

461
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,012
(tense music)

462
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,739
JUWON: There's a trace of someone

463
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,992
unscrewing the rusty nut.

464
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,620
The parent who just left

465
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,665
is someone I used to know.

466
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,003
Her child and my child,

467
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,631
I assume they're in the same class.

468
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,592
And the boy who saved my daughter,

469
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,887
I assume he's in their class, too.

470
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,140
Yes.

471
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,145
I remember seeing someone
with similar moves

472
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,107
as that boy who saved my daughter.

473
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,278
I think I know...

474
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,657
who his parent is.

475
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,660
And...

476
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,122
after my daughter got expelled
from her previous school,

477
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,542
no other school took her in
except for this school.

478
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,920
(watch beeping)

479
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,588
JUWON: She joined your class.

480
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,467
Three children of those
who used to know each other

481
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,220
are in the same class at the same school.

482
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,890
Could this be a coincidence?

483
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,309
ILHWAN: That's...

484
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:41,853
JUWON: One more thing.

485
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,440
The CCTV cameras
that monitor the children.

486
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,025
(Juwon sighs)

487
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,818
I wondered what it was about.

488
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:54,198
CHOI ILHWAN

489
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,324
JUWON: At first,

490
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,911
I suspected you,
because you were their homeroom teacher.

491
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:00,788
However...

492
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,417
right here...

493
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,842
there's another surveillance camera
in the ceiling.

494
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,954
You need to come in.

495
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,166
One on the first-floor hallway
of the main building.

496
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,086
Two in the Career Guidance Room
on the fourth floor.

497
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,337

498
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,839
One in the Teachers' Office 1
on the second floor.

499
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,426
One on the third-floor study hall
of the annex building.

500
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,681
You wouldn't be monitoring yourself.

501
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,519
Did you not know...

502
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,814
that someone was watching you?

503
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:10,983
No.

504
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,487
(sighs)

505
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,864

I'm a parent.

529
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,460
-Is the principal in?
-Oh.

530
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,628
He has left for the day.

531
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,339
You're working late.

532
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,217
I need to clean every single thing.

533
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,122
Gosh...

534
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,252
JISUNG: Hey, you!

535
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,213
-What are you doing?
-Uh...

536
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,800
Well, I left something behind at school.

537
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,885
The school's already locked.
Come tomorrow.

538
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,762
But I really need it.

539
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,139
Read this.

540
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,100
DO NOT ENTER AFTER SUNSET
DUE TO SAFETY INSPECTION

541
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,393

542
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,395
