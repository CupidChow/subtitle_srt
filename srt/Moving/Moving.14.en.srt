MOVING

00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,215
Dad.

5
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,092
Are you crying?

6
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,848
No, I'm not crying anymore.

7
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,479
You hungry?

8
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,357
Let's eat.

9
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,541
INFORMATION IS OUR POWER

10
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,168
Why do you want a desk position again?

11
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,880
I'm afraid I can't go on business trips.

12
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,552
So you need to look after your kid now?

13
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,472
I can't leave her alone at night.

14
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,893
And I have to drop her off
at kindergarten.

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,980
She's already going to kindergarten?

16
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,898
Is she better already?

17
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,816
Yes.

18
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,702
Put Jang Juwon off the waiting list
and assign him to a desk job.

19
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,078
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,498
It's only for the time being.

21
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,709
I'll call you in if needed.

22
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,421
Answer the call
if you want to keep your job.

23
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,217
Do you understand?

24
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,095
Yes.

25
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,847
You may leave.

EPISODE 14: THE IDIOT

31
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,822
Hey, Jaeman!

32
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,035
Jaeman, you're with us, right?

33
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,790
Oh, I'm sorry.

34
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,625
I forgot.

35
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,835
Did you hear about the construction

36
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,630
to restore Cheonggyecheon?
They're kicking us all out.

37
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,216
They're going to tear down the overpass,
make a water path,

38
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,842
and remove all the street stalls.

39
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,346
If we don't stay focused,
we'll get kicked out without getting paid.

40
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,515
We settled down here a long time ago.

41
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,352
So we need you, our strong man,
to take the lead and--

42
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,312
What are you talking about?

43
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,818
Don't try to lure my husband,
and just do your work.

44
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,987
We didn't lure him.

45
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,114
It's just that he should join
the co-op by now.

46
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,241
-He's one of us.
-As if.

47
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,452
It's been over two months
since he arrived here.

48
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,663
But now you want him involved
because you're in trouble.

49
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,707
Don't you dare bring it up to him again.

50
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,001
Or I will make you all pay!

51
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,837
For a young woman, you're too...

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,879
All right.

53
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,381
This isn't about someone else's...

54
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,465
Why you...

55
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,094
All right, Ms. Shin.

56
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,805
Honey, don't listen to them.
Just deliver the goods.

57
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,807
Okay.

58
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,892
Let's go back to eating.

59
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,311
Come.

60
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,896
Hold on.

61
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,693
Do you have a lot left to do?

62
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,737
Yes.

63
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,196
Hurry back when you're done.

64
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,157
We should eat too.

65
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,409
Okay.

66
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,535
Go on.

67
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,794
Why wouldn't it move?

68
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,504
Go, Korea, go!

69
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,675
Mom! I think it wants to go out.

70
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:48,389
Four T-shirts for 10,000 won!

71
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,684
World Cup T-shirts on sale!

72
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,105
Don't listen to whatever they say.

73
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,526
I don't want you to get involved
in such a thing.

74
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,236
Do you understand?

75
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:08,785
You could get in serious trouble, okay?

76
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,873
I wonder if he ate.

77
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,335
I mean Ganghoon.

78
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,632
You barely talk. But when you do,
it's always about our son.

79
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,552
I'm sure he must have eaten
at the nursery.

80
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,847
What? Are you worried?

81
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,183
I'm just wondering...

82
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,435
if he's well.

83
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,063
Don't worry.

84
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,234
Our son talks very well,

85
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,152
and he's really smart.

86
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,154
The nursery teacher says

87
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,449
that our Ganghoon is good friends
with the other kids too.

88
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,827
She says he'll be a model student
when he grows up.

89
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,414
I'm glad...

90
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,458
he takes after you.

91
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,169
He takes after you too.

92
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,014
What is this for?

93
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,728
It's for Ganghoon.

94
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,648
Aww.

95
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,235
Eat slowly.

96
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,035
You should finish this, then--
Finish eating before...

97
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,539
There he goes again.

98
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,681
BUNGAEMAN

99
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,225
AQUARIUM SHOP

100
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,143
Thank you.

101
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,856
This is really not necessary.

102
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,192
-Did you have your meal?
-Thanks to you.

103
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,652
By the way, where's your husband?

104
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,529
He went to pick up Ganghoon.

105
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,075
I need to send Sungwoo to the nursery too.

106
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,662
He just wouldn't stay away from the fish.

107
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,709
I guess your husband picks up
your son every day.

108
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,836
One of us has to keep the store,

109
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,713
so he drops off and picks up the kid.

110
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,759
Then he's basically raising the kid
by himself.

111
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,012
Yes, that's what he wanted.

112
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,140
Then again,
he can't even do a simple math...

113
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,229
That's not what I meant.

114
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,191
I meant that you're meticulous
at doing business.

115
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,486
It's what my husband wanted.

116
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:54,116
Gosh. I'm just jealous of you
for having a husband.

117
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,454
Sungwoo. Let's go inside.

118
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,540
I want to stay here with the fish.

119
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,335
3 YEARS AGO

120
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,878
Don't move. Or I'll shoot you.

121
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,214
Don't shoot.

122
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,967
He was the one who picked a fight.

123
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,429
My husband isn't a bad person.

124
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,057
I get it, so put your hands up.

125
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,187
Honey. It's okay.

126
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,815
If you go to the police station,

127
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,859
it will be revealed that you're innocent.

128
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,946
It's okay.

129
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,281
Honey.

130
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,199
I'm all right.

131
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,535
Don't.

132
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,956
Make sure Ganghoon isn't sick.

133
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,293
That he isn't hungry.

134
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,172
Don't worry. I'll be there soon with him.

135
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,141
-What's that?
-A fire!

136
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,644
Fire! It's a fire!

137
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,979
-A fire!
-Oh, no.

138
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,731

142
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,699

143

It's your dad.

147
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,508
Say hello to him.

148
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,978
Dad.

149
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,246
-Long time no see.
-How have you been?

150
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,124
You look so well.

151
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,585
-I know.
-Your voice is so nice.

152
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,173
Mom!

153
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,259
-Mom!
-Hello.

154
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,052
-You're here.
-How was your day?

155
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,305
-I'm here.
-Did you have fun?

156
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,558
Let's go to your dad.

157
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,195
Your dad got you a pretty T-shirt.
Lucky you, Ganghoon.

158
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,033
Let's go home, Ganghoon.

159
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,641
-Dad, my dress.
-Oh, okay.

160
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,519
There you go.

161
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,901
Put it all in your mouth.

162
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:39,902
There you go.

163
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,447
We have to go.

164
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,410
All right. Let's go.

165
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,487
-Thank you.
-Hello.

Clap three times. Clap, clap, clap!

172
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,596
Be there on time later.

173
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,765
-I'll go after my customers leave.
-Okay.

WE FIGHT TOGETHER

175
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,226
We have onion mincers and garlic mincers.

176
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,906
Let's go in, Sungwoo.

177
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,912

You're giving me the bigger one?

181

at the construction site
of the Cheonggyecheon Restoration,

184
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,411
the city of Seoul has revealed
that they would take measures

185
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,787
to prevent recurrences.

186
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,958
By inspecting the sites on whether it has
proper fall prevention systems

187
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,043
for laborers and objects...

188
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,646
Let's go, Dad!

189
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,916
-Please take good care of her.
-Sure.

190
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,336
I'll be home by seven.

191
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,589
So please stay until then.

192
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,508
I'm supposed to leave work at six.

193
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,428
I can't stay until too late.

194
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,931
Then I'll drop her off at kindergarten
from tomorrow.

195
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,475
So you can come to work an hour late.

196
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,518
I'll try not to be late.

197
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:42,936
All right.

198
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,356
Huisoo, be a good girl.

199
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,901
-Okay. Have a good day, Dad.
-All right?

200
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:05,209
Call off the forceful demolition
that threatens people's right to live!

201
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,211
Call it off!

202
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,339

204
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,969
Guarantee the street vendors' right

205
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,097
-Guarantee it!
-Guarantee--

206
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,681
Call off the forceful demolition

207
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,475
-that threatens people's right to live!
-Jaeman!

208
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,019
-Come on. What are you doing?
-Call it off!

209
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,688
Young people like us should take the lead.
Come to the front.

210
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,607
-Guarantee it!
-Come on!

211
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,234
Honey.

Call off the forceful demolition
that threatens people's right to live!

213
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,280
Call it off!

214
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,533
You shouldn't be a part of this.

215
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,162
They only need one of us to do it.

216
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,915
We don't know how things will turn out.

217
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,585
You already have a criminal record,

218
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,087
so you must not get arrested.

219
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,923
Get arrested?

220
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,466
You won't.

221
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,302
Honey, think of Ganghoon.

222
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,890
If you get arrested, you won't be able
to see him again for a while.

223
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,061
It's time to pick him up. Go on.

224
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,521
Hurry.

225
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,689
-Go.
-Ganghoon.

226
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,525
Call off the forceful demolition!

227
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,026

Dear civilians...

235
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,922
This is an illegal protest.

236
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,299
Call off the forceful demolition...

237
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,550
Please dismiss yourselves.

238
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,968
...that threatens people's right to live!

239
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,928
We will soon dissolve the protest.

240
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,847
-Guarantee...
-Please dismiss yourselves.

00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,975

Guarantee it!

246
00:19:56,111 --> 00:20:00,073
Call off the forceful demolition
that neglects people's right to live!

247
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,075
Call it off!

248
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,536
Guarantee
the street vendors' right to live!

249
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,787
Platoon One, get ready.

250
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,456
Guarantee it!

251
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,503
Do you want to get out?

252
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,048
Stop it and go inside.

253
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,926
Mom, I think it wants to get out.

254
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,219
Just come here.

255
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,103
Let's go home, Dad.

256
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,532
Dad, let's go.

257
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,285
Okay.

258
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,058
I COULDN'T REACH YOU
SO I'M LEAVING FIRST AGAIN

Get them!

265
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,740

Mom, the fish--

271
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,487
Stop talking nonsense and just sleep.

272
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,702
You bastards!

273
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,245

00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,625
Get rid of them!

00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,892
-Move!
-No!

279
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,685

Load them up!

282
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,610
I said, load them up!

283
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,489
No.

284
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,618
No!

285
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:53,432
I'll go get your mom.

286
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,892
It won't take long.

287
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:02,274
I'll come back before you go to bed.

288
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,693
I go to bed at ten.

289
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,281
I always keep my promises.

290
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,366
Really?

291
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:17,581
Really.

00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,500
Okay.

00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,426
Okay.

295
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:49,529
I'll keep my promise, okay?

296
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,324

Honey! No!

309
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,889
Honey, don't do it.

Get the water cannon ready.

00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,459
Ganghoon.

315
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,753
Think of Ganghoon.

316
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,970
Honey!

317
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,181

UNKNOWN CALLER

322
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,221
Hello?

323
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,848
We have a situation here.

324
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,600
A monster showed up.

325
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,395
He smashed one whole
combat police company alone.

326
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,314
The police are severely injured.

327
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,691
You're going to have to deal with him.

328
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,110
I cannot go on a business trip.

329
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,071
Have you forgotten our deal?

330
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,323
Do you want to resign for good?

331
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,410
You have a child. Think wisely.

332
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,079
We're at Cheonggyecheon 9-ga.

333
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,305
I'll take you home, Fishy.

334
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,317
Platoon One,
block the alleys on the left.

335
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,653
Platoon Two, block them on the right.

336
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:17,570
Yes, sir!

337
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,282
Someone saw
the culprit go into the sewers.

338
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,076
Keep the people under control.

339
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,496
The culprit is found
in the sewers! Cordon off the area!

340
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,926
FIELD COMMAND POST

341
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,516
Get off the bus!

342
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,353
Sir, please take me to my husband.

343
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,313
He won't listen to the others.

344
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,524
My husband is an idiot.

345
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,569
He's a moron.

346
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,196
-He's retarded and stupid.
-Move.

347
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,908
Please. He's an idiot.

348
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,161
Sir.

349
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,206
-What?
-About the monster...

350
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,458
Which one?

351
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,419
The one in the sewers.

352
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,004
What about him?

353
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,464
He's mentally handicapped.

354
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,967
He can't speak properly,
and he is intellectually disabled.

355
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,014
I'll have to see him for myself.

356
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,827
You're up.

357
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,455
Can you have dinner alone?

358
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,372
Yes.

359
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,291
I'll come back soon.

360
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,002
-See you later.
-Okay.

361
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,902
We don't have much time.
What's taking him so long?

362
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,698
You're here.

363
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,910
-Where is he?
-Inside down there.

364
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,746
This is the only exit. Explain it to him.

365
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,374
About 50 combat police companies
have been mobilized.

366
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,584
We're blocking
every manhole and escape route

367
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,503
in the Cheonggyecheon region.

368
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,006
It's assumed that the culprit is hiding
between 9-ga and 5-ga.

369
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:46,386
His name is Lee Jaeman.
He has a history of violent crime.

370
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,222
All right. Go get him.

371
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,308
His wife has been arrested.

372
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,353
He also has a four-year-old son
named Lee Ganghoon.

373
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,900
Be careful, sir. He's a monster.

374
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:39,022
SNEAKERS AVAILABLE
SHOES

375
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,663
Hey.

376
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,916
It's blocked there.

377
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,584
Come down.

378
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,671
There's only one way out.

379
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,923
Just come with me.

380
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,973
Who are you?

381
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,393
I'm the man who came to get you.

382
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,312
No.

383
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,065
Don't you want to get out?

384
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,526
You can go out with me.

385
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,821
I can't be caught.

386
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,490
Ganghoon.

387
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,326
What are you saying?

388
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:28,965
You little...

389
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,633
Come here.

390
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,678
You...

391
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,725
No.

392
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,536
Nice to meet you, monster.

393
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,415
I'm a monster too.

394
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,250
Let's go home.

395
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,171
Your son's waiting.

396
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,637
Ganghoon, right?

397
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,225
Ganghoon.

398
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,274
Your eyes changed.

399
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:37,885
Sungwoo.

400
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,763
Sungwoo?

401
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,103
Sungwoo!

402
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,440
Sungwoo!

403
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,870
Sungwoo.

404
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,682
Got you.

405
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,064
Sungwoo!

406
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,483
-You can't come here.
-Just a minute.

407
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,776
-It's dangerous.
-Just a moment!

408
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,278
Please help.

409
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,281
I think my son fell in a manhole.

410
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,867
Calm down, ma'am.

411
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,661
We'll look for him.

412
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,038
It's dangerous here.
Take her somewhere safe.

413
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,958
-We'll look for him.
-This way, ma'am.

414
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,794
Please help.

415
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,880
Let's go home.

416
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,808
His name is Choi Sungwoo.

417
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,353
He went missing
at Cheonggyecheon 7-ga 20 minutes ago.

418
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,398
We don't know where he would be
or how far he got swept away.

419
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,650
We must find him before it floods.

420
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,447
The police will search upward from here.
Do you understand?

421
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,656
Yes, sir!

422
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,535
The squad will search
the underground water path with me.

423
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,453
Yes, sir!

424
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,133
Help!

425
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,679
Mom! Help me!

426
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:15,061
Mom! Save me!

427
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,192
Help!

428
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,277
Hey, kid.

429
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,739
-Kid!
-Help!

430
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,574
Kid.

431
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,743
-Please help.
-It's okay.

432
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,911
I'll get you.

433
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:33,788
Just stay there.

434
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,437
Hey, kid!

435
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,856
-Stay back!
-Help!

436
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,982
Stay back!

437
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,980
What are you doing
in the midst of the operation?

438
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,857
A boy went missing.

439
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,111
Are you sure he's down there?

440
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,446
We aren't sure.

441
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,072
You aren't sure,

442
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:54,243
but the police dare go
against the NIS's order?

443
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,246
We need to do our job.

444
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,837
This country has become a fucking mess.

445
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,048
-Sungwoo!
-Sungwoo!

446
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,217
-Sungwoo!
-Sungwoo!

447
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,637
-Sungwoo!
-Sungwoo!

448
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,806
-Sungwoo!
-Sungwoo!

449
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,683
We found him!

450
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,817
Sungwoo, it's okay.

451
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,903
It's okay.

452
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,199
-Thank you, sir.
-No problem, ma'am.

453
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,533
Okay.

454
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,708
I told you to get a monster,
and you rescued a kid instead.

455
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,211
Where is he?

456
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,299
He's probably on his way home.

457
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,343
What?

458
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,053
He said...

459
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,598
he promised his son that he'd come back.

460
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,601
So you let him go?

461
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,561
Yes.

462
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,107
You believed him?

463
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,783
I heard he was a retard.
And you're just the same.

464
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,522
What happened, Dad?
Where's Mom?

465
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,073
I'm sorry...

466
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,662
that I'm late.

467
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,165
I was scared by myself.

468
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:13,382
I'm sorry I left you by yourself.

469
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,427
I am...

470
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,850
...so sorry.

471
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,441
I'm sorry.

472
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,032
I'm sorry.

473
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,121
I am...

474
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,291
I'm sorry.

475
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,050
I'm sorry.

476
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,888
I'm sorry.

477
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,229
-Is he the guy?
-Yes.

478
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,106
I'm sorry.

479
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,777
He did come home. Unbelievable.

480
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,571
-I'm sorry.
-He sure is retarded.

481
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,490
What should we do, sir?

482
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,159
-About what?
-Should we take him over?

483
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,453
Hand him over to the police. He's useless.

484
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,541
He can't speak properly.

485
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,337
And he's way too retarded.
What can he possibly do for us?

486
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,714
I wasted my time for nothing.

487
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:41,887
Lee Jaeman!

488
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,018
-It's not him. It's the kid.
-Don't do it, Ganghoon.

489
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,028
Don't do it, Ganghoon.

490
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,156
Dad, I hate these people!

491
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,952
That boy did this?

492
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,454
-Yes.
-Don't do it.

493
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,040
Ganghoon.

494
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:15,421
Don't. Ganghoon, it's all right.

495
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,965
So abilities could be passed on?

496
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,762
Ganghoon...

497
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,765
It's okay, Ganghoon.

498
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,644
-It's okay.
-Take care of the situation.

499
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,482
-Ganghoon, it's okay.
-Don't take Dad!

500
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,151
Stop it, Ganghoon.

501
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,612
-Stay away from Dad!
-It's okay. Don't.

502
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,576
It's okay, Ganghoon.

503
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,500
It's okay.

504
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,674
Don't do it.

505
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,201
DAD'S MEAL

506
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:03,987
That night,

507
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,075
I got rid of every trace
that could lead to me

508
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,246
and everything I ever had

509
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,832
and left with my daughter.

510
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:20,546
No.

511
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,715
I left with my everything.

512
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,862
You know what?

513
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:46,613
Hmm?

514
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,866
I got a friend.

515
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,036
He's really inflexible and boring,

516
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,539
but he's kind.

517
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,042
His words make me think again.

518
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,503
He's a good kid.

519
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,341
I remembered something
while talking with him.

520
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,428
About what?

521
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,557
A memory about Mom.

522
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,441
When the accident happened,

523
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,738
she saw me from the car and smiled at me.

524
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,289
She saw that I couldn't get hurt...

525
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,418
and smiled.

526
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,640
Right.

527
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,434
I see.

528
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,569
Huisoo, go home without me.

529
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,988
I still have lots of work to do.

530
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,783
-Okay.
-Good.

531
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:31,802
Come home soon.

532
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,096
Okay, be careful on the way.
