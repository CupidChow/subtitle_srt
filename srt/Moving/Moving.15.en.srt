THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,967
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,638
INFORMATION IS OUR POWER

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:21,396
MOVING

5
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,690
-Nothing?
-No.

6
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,774
YEAR 2003, NIS

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,401
He must have left some traces behind.

8
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,362
Jang Juwon knows our methods
all too well, sir.

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,323
He destroyed the CCTVs around his place
and the maintenance office.

10
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,826
He completely erased any trace of himself.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,287
What about tracking his account
or phone network?

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,122
He left everything when he fled.

13
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,541
I'm sorry, sir.

14
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,710
I didn't think he'd run away
with his child overnight so--

15
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,462
It's because of his child.

16
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,090
We aren't sure if she inherited it.

17
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,301
We are sure.

18
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,472
I checked again today.

19
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,101
She left the hospital
a week after the accident.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,021
Actually...

21
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,609
it doesn't make sense
that she even survived that accident.

22
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,533
I can assure you
that I take my job very seriously, sir.

23
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,953
Huisoo. Stay there.

24
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,278
Jang Juwon's daughter
did inherit his talent.

25
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,534
What is this?

26
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,788
It's a proposal for a project.

27
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,959
"National Talent Development Project."

28
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,837
We'll train children.

29
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,297
It would be worth a shot.

30
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,677
We already secured
Lee Jaeman's son.

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,762
Lee Jaeman's son?

32
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,140
What will you do
with a four-year-old child?

33
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,267
That's why it's
a National Talent Development Project.

34
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,394
We must look to the future.

35
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,063
You're starting a project
with just one child?

36
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,316
It isn't just one child.
We can track Jang Juwon and his daughter.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,484
That makes only two.

38
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,694
Three.

39
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,532
Kim Doosik's child.

40
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,954
-Sure.
-Thanks.

41
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,104
I'm sure of it.

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,525
My eyes don't miss
even the tiniest detail.

43
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,112
On top of that,
Bongpyeong and Naju also have children.

44
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,573
How will you find those who have fled?

45
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,992
I'm confident
about my ability to investigate.

46
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,243
You know that, don't you, sir?

47
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,747
I'll track them down to the end
and make sure to find them.

48
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,709
The current black agents
will grow old one day.

49
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,294
We must be prepared for that.

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,923
A change of generation is inevitable.

51
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,219
There might even be more out there.

52
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:44,140
We must search through the country
to find more talents.

53
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,392
I'll take charge of it, sir.

54
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,437
It'll take a very long time.

55
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,190
So we need an organized system.

56
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,234
An organized system?

57
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,695
We must first track down
Kim Doosik's son,

58
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,948
and make our base
within his school district.

59
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,910
All children need to go to school
once they grow up.

60
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,579
School?

61
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,997
Mr. Jo.

62
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,999
I know corruption within private education
is the norm these days,

63
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,793
but how much are you planning on making?

64
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,919
Come on.

65
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,128
Give it a rest.

66
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,589
This is an important matter
for our nation.

67
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,719
It's too risky.

68
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,682
Chief Min.

69
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,310
No, Deputy Director Min.

70
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,854
This is a long-term project.

71
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,692
As our future is at stake,

72
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,570
we need to discover, train,
and continuously manage these talents.

73
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,079
All right.

74
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,497
Give it a try.

75
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:58,881
EPISODE 15: N.T.D.P.

76
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,343
PREVIOUSLY ON MOVING

77
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,637
Are you taking good care
of the files?

78
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,888
Yes, of course.

79
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,848
AUGUST 21, 2018
ASSIGNED HOMEROOM AND COUNSELING

80
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,392
I think there will be
some good results this year.

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,145
Hi, I'm Jang Huisoo.

82
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,063
Nice to meet you.

83
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,609
You found one?

84
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,986
You can be friends with her.

85
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,119
If those files are revealed,
things will grow even more problematic.

86
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,834
What the hell are you?

87
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,463
Does your child go
to Jeongwon High School?

88
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,090
The entrance exams are over
and the semester will be ending soon.

89
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,633
We should finish up the tests.

90
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,891
It's a new age now.
There are billions of smartphones around.

91
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,851
If someone sees just one of your kids,

92
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,395
the information will spread
like wildfire across the globe.

93
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,531
Go to South Korea.

94
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,996
JEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL
JEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,415
GYM

96
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,667
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
DO NOT USE

97
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,433
-Did you see that?
-That was sick.

98
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,053
Hey.

99
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,140
Was it you?

100
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,727
You acted big about being a bully
and beat up kids.

101
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,938
And this is what you do?

102
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,273
Fuck you.

103
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,901
You're not so different from me.

104
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,284
You're the one who acted big
relying on your strength.

105
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,061
JANG HUISOO

106
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,400
Thanks for the ramyeon.

107
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,111
Sure.

108
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,113
You're not hurt, are you?

109
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,740
No. Thanks to you.

110
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,825
That's good.

111
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,459
Do you have superpowers or something?

112
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,422
Do you?

113
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,552
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

114
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,014
I'd get a perfect score
on the practical test if I were you.

115
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,560
But I guess it doesn't matter to you
since you got in through early action.

116
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,523
I'm done with my test.

117
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,233
Your test?

118
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,778
-You mean your early action admission?
-Not that.

119
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,781
I'm not going to college.
I want to work for the government.

120
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,244
That's right.
You even had different textbooks.

121
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,871
And you stayed until late
even after your early action application.

122
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,459
That was because I didn't want
to go home early.

123
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,670
I'm going to the library, Mom.

124
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,588
Okay. Take care on your way.

125
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,174
3 YEARS AGO

126
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,652
I'm off, Dad.

127
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,154
HOON'S SUPERMARKET

128
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,574
See you later, Ganghoon.

129
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,785
You know my father?

130
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,412
Yes.

131
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,665
Mr. Lee Jaeman.
He has two previous convictions.

132
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,209
His first crime was violence,

133
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,255
and his second one was injuring
government workers using violence.

134
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,800
He received additional punishment
for committing the same crime.

135
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,636
Even after he finished
his ten-year sentence,

136
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,388
he is still on probation.

137
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,020
Isn't your father always home?

138
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,396
Or more like,

139
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,774
doesn't he have to stay home?

140
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,028
Who are you?

141
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,904
Me?

142
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,657
I'm a principal.

143
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,745
Didn't I say that I was a principal?

144
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,414
You're a principal?

145
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,588
You could say I have two jobs.

146
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,468
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE
SECTION CHIEF JO RAEHYUK

147
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,514
My goodness. What's there to hesitate?

148
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,099
Your family is struggling financially.

149
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,268
And this will solve your future prospects

150
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,187
as well as erase your father's records.

151
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,483
Think hard about this.

152
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,193
You're going to high school next year.

153
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,197
Come to our school.

154
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:01,535
I guess you decided
on your career path from early on.

155
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,995
I decided on mine just this year.

156
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,622
I'm jealous.

157
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,877
Let's eat up. Classes are almost over.

158
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,129
Han Byul.

159
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,007
Don't you know that you can't film things
for YouTube and such at school?

160
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,386
I'll hold on to this
and give it back to you when you graduate.

161
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,681
-Mr. Yoon.
-You may go.

162
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,493
Come in.

163
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,627
Did you ask to see me? What is this about?

164
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,090
What's your thought
on the accident in the auditorium?

165
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,179
Do you think I did it?

166
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,352
The semester is almost over.

167
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,484
Okay.

168
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:16,902
You may go.

CAREER GUIDANCE ROOM

170
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,264
-Hey, isn't that them?
-By the way,

171
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,183
don't tell the others
what I told you earlier.

172
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,642
Keep it to yourself.

173
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,019
Okay.

174
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,524
Thanks for that day.

175
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:57,818
No worries.

176
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,502
Maybe I could do it, too.

177
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,881
Maybe I could fly faster
and higher than I can right now.

178
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,299
I...

179
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,134
I want to fly, Mom!

180
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,637
Do you want to end up like your dad?

181
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,731
I just met with Mr. Yoon.

182
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,982
Why?

183
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,485
He confiscated my camera,
because I filmed at school.

184
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,861
All of a sudden?

185
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,947
I don't get it.

186
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,032
He didn't mind before.
Why is he suddenly doing this?

187
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,909
For real. That's a shame.

188
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,786
I'm sure he'll give it back later.

189
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,247
My YouTube account was deleted, too.

190
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,123
Why? Were you blocked?

191
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,669
I don't know.
I didn't violate any regulations.

192
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,089
Ugh! I had over 200,000 views.

193
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,132
-It's driving me nuts.
-That really is a shame.

194
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,801
Maybe your account was hacked.

195
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,887
Open a new account
and post that video again.

196
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,432
I'm going to at least get
my memory card back.

197
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,684
You don't know where it is.

198
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,311
-She's right.
-Would it be on Mr. Choi's desk?

199
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,980
-Or Mr. Yoon's desk?
-They're here.

200
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,065
Hey, the class president is here.

201
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,485
What's going on between them?

202
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,452
Take your seats.

203
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,581
COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMS ARE OVER!
WE'RE FREE!

204
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,374
All right.

205
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,253
Since there was
the auditorium accident yesterday,

206
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,797
all after-school classes
are canceled today.

207
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,426
Don't stay at school for no reason.

208
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,094
Just go home.

209
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,512
Yes, sir!

210
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,430
That's it.

211
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,309
Attention. Bow.

212
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,227
We love you.

213
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,146
-Jang Huisoo.
-Yes.

214
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,440
-Come to the career guidance room.
-Yes, sir.

215
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,080
Aren't you going home?

216
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,514
PORTABLE CHARGER

217
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,141
You couldn't train yesterday,
could you?

218
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,225
No.

219
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:40,189
The auditorium will be under construction,
so you won't be able to train there.

220
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,108
There's a sports center at Dunchon-dong.

221
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,902
I think you'll have to train there.

222
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,820
They have all the exercise equipment,

223
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,198
and it'll be nice and empty
since it's closed to the public.

224
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,199
All of a sudden?

225
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,286
It seems sudden, but you'll get behind
if you slack for even a day.

226
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,665
You should really be focusing
on your practical test right now.

227
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,708
You need to get into college, don't you?

228
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,920
This is a notice for a field study
outside of school. Take it.

229
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,006
Okay.

230
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,925
Thank you, sir.

231
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,389
Hey.

232
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,140
You scared me.

233
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,058
What?

234
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,395
What did Choi Ilhwan say?

235
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,355
Nothing much.

236
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,114
You better watch out. Don't trust anybody.

237
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,328
What the heck?

238
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,916
Were you waiting for me?

239
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,167
Yes. I mean, no.

240
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,420
Is it a yes or a no?

241
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,755
I was just thinking about something.

242
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,133
Aren't you going home?
We don't have study hall anymore.

243
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,175
I was about to head out.

244
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,887
What's going on with you all day?

245
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,223
Where's your water bag?

246
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,059
I didn't bring it.

247
00:16:59,143 --> 00:16:59,977
Why not?

248
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,770
I'm going to get used to not having it.

249
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,647
Does your mom know about this?

250
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,898
Yeah.

251
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,525
I had a long chat with her.

252
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,652
Are you going to be okay?

253
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,447
I can't live like this forever.

254
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,617
I want to run when I have to run
from now on.

255
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,580
Is this about what happened at...

256
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,634
Never mind.

257
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,056
I don't wear weights at home,
and I do totally fine.

258
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,019
As long as you're not around...

259
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,444
What are you doing?

260
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,755
I'm worried about you.

261
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,382
Let's go.

262
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,300
Where?

263
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,302
The sports center in Dunchon-dong.

264
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,262
-Mr. Choi told me to go there.
-I see.

265
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,680
But what about dinner?

266
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,608
What are you still doing at school?

267
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,903
All the other kids went home.
You should hurry up and...

268
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,201
Why, that bastard...

269
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:56,218
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

270
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,110
Would that be better
for the kids?

271
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,029
I hope so.
My class totally flunked it.

272
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,739
Aren't you cold?

273
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,700
You think?

274
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,618
Are you really not cold?

275
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,912
No, I've never even had a cold.

276
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,541
-Still--
-It's okay. I'm really not cold.

277
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,793
-But still--
-You're being weird.

278
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,504
Then take this at least.

279
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,631
This gets pretty warm.

280
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,681
How warm.

281
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,974
Isn't it?

282
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:44,892
I meant you.

283
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,316
STUDY HALL

284
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,207
I'm really okay.

285
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,168
You don't believe me
when I say I'm okay, either.

286
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,254
I do believe you. I just get worried.

287
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,964
I know.

288
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,467
I'm hungry.

289
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,260
-Let's grab dinner.
-How about tteokbokki?

290
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,179
-Tteokbokki? Okay.
-Let's go.

291
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,227
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

292
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:23,824
There is another student
with powers

293
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,538
at the same school and in the same class.

294
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,417
Is it just a coincidence?

295
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:47,889
No.

296
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,726
There could actually...

297
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,896
be more than one.

298
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,565
DEEP FRYER

299
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,247
Good evening.

300
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,416
Good evening.

301
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,334
Hey.

302
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,127
For two people, please.

303
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,382
I have a cell phone now.

304
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,258
I said I'd pay for yours one day.

305
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,095
Actually, why are you two going this way?

306
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,179
Are you on a date?

307
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,305
I'm on my way to train.

308
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,890
You're preparing for a PE major?

309
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,184
I also used to prepare for that.

310
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,019
I went to your school, too.

311
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,938
Oh, my gosh. That's awesome.

312
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,607
-Then he's our senior.
-Keep moving.

313
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,568
Where should we sit? There?

314
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,778
Sir, wait.

315
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,280
It didn't register. Try it again.

316
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,414
-This charger really is big.
-I know, right?

317
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:37,916
It's so warm.

318
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,420
It's still warm, right?

319
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,504
Is it not working?

320
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,549
Do you have a transit card or some cash?

321
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,802
May I see your phone?

322
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,351
Maybe the transit card isn't set up.

323
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,649
You can't register
a transit card with this.

324
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,163
Give me back my phone.

325
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,457
Sorry?

326
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,167
Oh, right.

327
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,919
I'll let you get on for today.

328
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,384
I want to eat more tteokbokki.

329
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,471
-I also want some gimbap.
-For real?

330
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,028
The driver...
No, our senior up there...

331
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,905
He's Bungaeman.

332
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,656
Bungaeman?

333
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,533
Don't you know Bungaeman?

334
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,162
Bungaeman. Bungaeman.

335
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,039
Lightning. Lightning.

336
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,708
Lightning Power.

337
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,586
-Calm down.
-Okay.

338
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,589
He was the second Bungaeman.

339
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,798
-The second?
-Yes.

340
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,467
But he's not anymore.

341
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,177
Still...

342
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,138
Once a hero, always a hero.

343
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,061
Lightning Power.

344
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,314
The Bungaeman that I had been waiting for
showed up right before my eyes.

345
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,983
I got so nervous
that I couldn't even act like I knew him.

346
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,653
All I could say was good morning.

347
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,570
Is that so?

348
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,740
-He was my superhero.
-All right.

349
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,075
He was my hero.

350
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,660
-I see.
-Yes.

351
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,787
He's so cool.

352
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,224
JEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL

353
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,186
Is everyone out?

354
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,565
-Who's on night duty?
-Mr. Choi Ilhwan.

355
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,275
Then everyone should be out
except for him.

356
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,651
Okay.

357
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,278
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

358
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,487
-Take care.
-Bye.

359
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,749
Outsiders cannot enter after school hours.

360
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,043
I'm not an outsider. I'm a parent.

361
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,379
What brings you here, ma'am?

362
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,008
I'm here to see Mr. Choi Ilhwan
of 12th-grade class 3.

363
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,217
I'd like to speak with him.

364
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,267
Go to the career guidance room
on the fourth floor.

365
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,769
-Thank you.
-No problem.

366
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,043
Yes, Mom?

367
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,461
Where are you?

368
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,087
I'm...

369
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,174
I'm on my way home.

370
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,719
I'm outside. Go straight home.

371
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,848
I might be home late,
so go ahead and eat first.

372
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,565
-Was that your mom?
-Yeah.

373
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,484
So you're on your way home?

374
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,110
That's...

375
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,572
This bus has a circular route,
so I am on my way home.

376
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,865
You lied to your mom.

377
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,370
She isn't home.

378
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,205
I can go home a little late today.

379
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,373
What a bad son.

380
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,292
I can help you with your training.

381
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,545
-What a great guy.
-Yeah.

382
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,928
Yeah, Dad?

383
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,429
Where are you?

384
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,014
I'm headed to the sports center
in Dunchon-dong.

385
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,184
A sports center?

386
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:09,396
Yes, the auditorium is closed,
so Mr. Choi introduced me to this place.

387
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,772
He did?

388
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,485
Huisoo, don't go wandering about today.

389
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,028
Go straight home. Okay?

390
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,656
Okay. I'll go straight home.

391
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,788
Aren't you getting off?

392
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,749
Why? I need to train.

393
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,628
-What a bad daughter.
-What?

394
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,296
Nothing.

395
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,205
ANNEX

396
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,490
It's me.

397
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,743
Lee Mihyun and Guryongpo
are at the school right now.

398
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,590
Come in.

399
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:05,970
Come...

400
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,268
Are you Mr. Choi Ilhwan?

401
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,188
Yes, that's me.

402
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,655
I'm sorry that this is all I can offer.

403
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,125
I heard there was an accident at school.

404
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,419
May I ask what happened?

405
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,630
Oh, that? You see...

406
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:45,927
It was a small accident caused
by some old equipment at the auditorium.

407
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,596
Thankfully, there weren't any injuries.

408
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,973
No one was hurt.

409
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,724
-I'm glad to hear that.
-Yes.

410
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,477
I heard that a student stopped
the accident.

411
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,937
Who was that student?

412
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,522
Our class president.

413
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,190
What is that student's name?

414
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,817
His name is Lee Ganghoon.

415
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,277
Does he have superpowers?

416
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,119
Kids like stories like that, don't they?

417
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,206
Well, that student is pretty athletic.

418
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,584
But calling that a superpower
would be a bit much.

419
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,836
My child saw it, too.

420
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:26,551
Because the situation was quite tense,

421
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:31,556
perhaps the students exaggerated
what they saw.

422
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:36,352
Think about it. A guy saved a girl
from a dangerous situation.

423
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,981
For impressionable children,

424
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:44,527
he may have looked
as if he had superpowers.

425
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,279
Is that...

426
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,532
what my child would have felt as well?

427
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,576
I suppose so.

428
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,371
He probably looked cool to him
as a fellow guy.

429
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,881
The school must've gotten rowdy.

430
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,299
You're right.

431
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:14,432
It has, but our school's atmosphere
is focused on academic pursuits,

432
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,726
so we were able to resolve it quietly.

433
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,227
I see.

434
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:23,399
Anyway, this won't affect
my child's college entrance, would it?

435
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,069
Of course not.
The college entrance exams are over,

436
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,740
and this won't affect
the remaining classes either.

437
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,825
I'm worried since my child
doesn't have good grades.

438
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,789
Bongseok may not have the best grades,

439
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:41,459
but he'll have no trouble going to college
within his grade level.

440
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,839
How did you know I was Bongseok's mom?

441
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,704
Kisoo!

442
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,957
Kisoo! What happened here?

443
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,544
What are you doing? Call an ambulance!

444
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,464
It's really swollen.

445
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:29,966
Hold still.

446
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,843
What are you doing?

447
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,696
JEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL

448
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,411
Excuse me.

449
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,257
And you are?

450
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,927
I'm a parent,
and I need to speak to the teacher.

451
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,347
Is the homeroom teacher
for 12th-grade class 3 here?

452
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,064
Did you make an appointment?

453
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:26,981
No.

454
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,407
There was an accident at school,
so we have orders to inspect it.

455
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,243
Since it was
from the Ministry of Education,

456
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,871
we'll have shortened school hours
until it's finished.

457
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,833
As you can see,
no one's here since classes are over.

458
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,508
Then may I take a look around the school?

459
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,597
-That's--
-Since classes are over,

460
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,183
I don't think I'll be a bother.

461
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,022
-You're an outsider.
-I'm a parent.

462
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,196
All right. Go ahead.

463
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:36,092
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE STUDIES

464
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,772
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

465
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,889
This stop is Dunchon Shopping Center.

466
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,391
-Are we here?
-Yes.

467
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,810
The next stop
is Dunchon Neighborhood Park.

468
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,191
What will you do today?

469
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,528
Long jumps?

470
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,281
-Long jumps?
-Should I do something else?

471
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,787
I never told you that I'm Bongseok's mom.

472
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,544
I saw you on Bongseok's social media.

473
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,590
Pardon me for saying this,
but Bongseok is raised by a single parent,

474
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:25,136
so I've shown a little more care for him.

475
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,972
Is something wrong?

476
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,598
No, there isn't.

477
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,434
I apologize.

478
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:36,022
We will try even harder,

479
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,859
so that there won't be
any accidents like this again.

480
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,115
If that's all you wanted to discuss...

481
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,536
Mr. Choi.

482
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,246
Yes?

483
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,917
When did you start doing this work?

484
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,379
What do you mean?

485
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,298
When did you start teaching?

486
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,032
No way.

487
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,827
It can't be.

488
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,503
Where did he go?

489
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,319
Who are you?

490
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:19,041
WORKING PAINSTAKINGLY HARD
FOR THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING MY OWN HOME

491
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,587
What is on the files?

492
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,259
The biological records
of the gifted, I guess.

493
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,931
What will happen
if we can't obtain the files?

494
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,560
The children themselves
are the files, aren't they?

495
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,396
We can just look for them one by one.

496
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,856
Then...

497
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:48,279
we are authorized to kill anyone involved
in training the gifted, right?

498
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,742
Do you even have to ask?

499
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,329
So we'll kill the adults,

500
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,708
but what will we do with the kids?

501
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,798
What's the current situation?

502
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,800
Come to the back door.

503
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:14,972
Should we go?

504
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,344
END OF SERVICE

505
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,699
Sir, stop the bus!

506
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,077
-What is going on?
-Stop now!

507
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,426
What are you doing,
you bastard?

508
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,554
Stop the bus right now!
