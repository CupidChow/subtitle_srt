-(ominous music)
-(young Huisoo breathing heavily)

4
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:20,311
Mom?

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,356
Mom?

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,108
Huisoo.

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,446
(breathing shakily)

8
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,617
JIHEE: Stay there.

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,871
-Mom.
-JIHEE: Stay there.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,666
MOVING

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,876
JIHEE: Stay there.

12
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,920
(blood splattering)

13
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,088
Mom?

14
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,509
Momma?

15
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,349
(pensive music)

16
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,061

00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,534
(beeps)

20
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,164
(panting)

21
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,295
16.8!

22
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,505
Almost perfect!

23
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,131
(sighs)
Not quite, though.

24
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,550
BONGSEOK: Still, that's really good.
I know you can do it.

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,222
HUISOO: You don't have to do that.

26
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,057
BONGSEOK: If you slip, you'll get hurt.
(grunts)

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,725
HUISOO: I told you, I don't get hurt.

28
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,810
BONGSEOK: But still.

29
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,437
But it's true. I fought 17 kids.

30
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,897
Yeah, still.

31
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,441
(Bongseok grunting)

32
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,403
Aren't you curious at all
why I got expelled?

33
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,371
Sure, yeah.

34
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,748
You haven't asked me.

35
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,376
I was worried it might be a bad memory.

36
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,336
(awkward chuckle)

37
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,130
(soft music)

38
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,172
(soft chuckle)

39
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,649
HUISOO: When I was a kid,
we moved all the time.

40
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,818
GOODBYE
SEOUL METROPOLITAN CITY

41
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:36,197
COME AGAIN SOON, SEOUL METROPOLITAN CITY

42
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,034
My dad carted us around
like we were... running from something.

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,000
(soft music continues)

44
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,143
We'd stay a year, never more than three.

45
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,728
Huisoo!

46
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,648
Get down! What are you doing up there?
It's dangerous!

47
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,610
Come here. Let's go.
(grunts)

48
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,403
Oh, boy.

49
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,947
All right, let's get in.

50
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,035
HUISOO: We never settled down anywhere.

51
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,333
My dad was a day laborer.

52
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:33,421
He'd take any job he could.
Didn't matter what it was.

53
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,260
We always moved around
like we were being chased,

54
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,721
but my dad's top priority...

55
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,182
was always me.

56
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,078
JUWON: Thanks. Take care.

57
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,768
(sighs)

58
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:33,898
HUISOO: One day, my dad finally decided
to settle down, so I could go to college.

59
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,234
HIRING MINERS FOR TAESAN MINE

60
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,696
He managed to find himself
a regular job as a miner.

61
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,533
And not long after that,
I was a high school student,

62
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,201
who wouldn't have to transfer.

63
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,246
Dad, I'm already late.

64
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,706
See you later!

65
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,457
HUISOO: My dad bought a small house.

66
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,960
-Be careful, slow down!
-Okay!

67
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,964
HUISOO: It cost him every penny he saved
for ten years working as a day laborer,

68
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,340
all while raising me.

69
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,972
4,000 days of work.

70
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,934
(speaker chiming)

71
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,730
(distant indistinct chatter)

72
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,273
140 DAYS UNTIL ENTRANCE EXAMS
GET IT TOGETHER!

73
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,233
-(girls laughing)
-(paper rustling)

74
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,901
SEO YURA:
Probably thinks you're fucking ugly.

75
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,069
-(girl 1 laughs)
-GIRL 2: That's fucking ridiculous.

76
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,697
HUISOO: Early in the semester,
a new girl transferred in.

77
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,284
-(girls laughing, chattering)
-She was really sweet and quiet.

78
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,702
-(girls laughing)
-GIRL 3: You're not cute...

79
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,330
HUISOO: Apparently, she was
the only daughter of a wealthy family.

80
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,791
The usual juvies got to her first.

81
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,085
-(girl 1 laughs)
-SEO YURA: This bitch is just ignoring us.

82
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,340
HUISOO: So, of course, she never had
the chance to make any other friends.

83
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,507
These are the new ones, huh?

84
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,927
-Mm-hm.
-Let me borrow them.

85
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,096
It'll be just for the day.

86
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,765
-GIRL 1: Just for a little while.
-SEO YURA: I'll give them right back.

87
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,768
-GIRL 2: Oh, my god.
-Can I, huh?

88
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,437
-(girls laugh)
-GIRL 3: Here we go again, y'all.

89
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,482
-All right. Uh, here.
-(Seo Yura chuckles)

90
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,567
-And the charger?
-GIRL 1: Oh, wow, that's some

91
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,610
-next level stuff...
-GIRL: 2: I seriously

92
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,153
-...for real.
-...did not see that coming, guys.

93
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,113
Didn't you just want to use them
for a little while?

94
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,825
Just forget it.
Look, I don't think our Hyewon trusts you.

95
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,204
-GIRL 1: No way, no way! Come on.
-SEO YURA: Hmm.

96
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,747
(sighs)

97
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,791
Ouch, that one really hurt.

98
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,125
(girls giggling, chattering)

99
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,170
No, you said that...
you'd give them right back,

100
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,088
and I just thought--

101
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,131
Hyewon. That's really hurtful.

102
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,551
GIRL 1: Aren't we friends?
You're being so stingy about it.

103
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,553
Not like she's going anywhere.

104
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,347
(in childish voice)
I'm just going to stay right here.

105
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,557
(annoyed grunt)

106
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,935
(in normal voice)
That really fucking hurts.

107
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,521
-Look at her.
-Hey, I mean...

108
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,314
GIRL 1: What's your deal?

109
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,857
-Look, she's chickening out now.
-GIRL 2: Are you okay?

110
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,943
(girl 3 laughs)

111
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,028
-GIRL 1: Come on, what are you doing?
-GIRL 2: Go on. Give it up.

112
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,780
-I'm sorry.
-GIRL 3: Hey.

113
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,906
(girls laughing)

114
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,324
-That's better, Hyewon.
-(girls laughing)

115
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,784
-GIRL 4: There we go!
-SEO YURA: Thank you!

116
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,495
HUISOO: Obviously,
we all know she's getting bullied.

117
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,789
GIRL 1: Took her long enough.

118
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,707
HUISOO: Why is no one doing anything?

119
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,292
-GIRL 1: OMG, look at this.
-GIRL 2: Look at what?

120
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,335
-GIRL 1: What's up with this hair?
-GIRL 3: What are you doing?

121
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,045
-GIRL 1: Oh, yeah, try this.
-GIRL 2: That's freaking cute.

122
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,173
GIRL 3: 'Kay, thanks! Thank you!

123
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,884
(girls laughing)

124
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,390
-(girls chattering, laughing)
-GIRL 1: Oh, my god, I can't with you!

125
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,059
(squishing)

126
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,896
(ominous music)

127
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,986
TAESAN MINE

128
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,821
SAFETY TODAY! SAFETY TOMORROW!
SAFETY FIRST

129
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,369
What?

130
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,123
Something... in your ear.

131
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,833
Really?

132
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,794
Ah.

133
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,130
Coal dust.

134
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,550
I take a shower,
and it still falls out from somewhere.

135
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,759
My god.

136
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,344
I did shower, I swear.

137
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,679
I know.

138
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,017
I'm a bona fide miner now.
(chuckles)

139
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:57,894
Oh, man.

140
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,691
How's your claustrophobia? Is it okay?

141
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,403
As soon as I started full time,
I got completely cured.

142
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,529
(chuckles)

143
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,281
Why are you in a good mood?

144
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,326
Why wouldn't I be?
Does money grow on trees?

145
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,244
No, it does not. But you can dig it up!

146
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,162
(laughs)

147
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,248
So now, I can afford to get
your favorite fried chicken. Hmm?

148
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,751
And we don't have to move, so I'm great.

149
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,128
-Yeah, but...
-(Juwon slurps, gulps)

150
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,046
(Juwon sighs)

151
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,256
How about a beer, huh?

152
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,342
I'm still a student, you know.

153
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,720
JUWON:
You only have one semester left, though.

154
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,848
I know, Dad.

155
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,060
(Juwon slurps, gulps)

156
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,186
(Juwon sighs)

157
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,812
Just gotta hold on a little longer.

158
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,690
"Hold on"?

159
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:47,860
Mm-hm.

160
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,154
(pensive music)

161
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,535
130 DAYS UNTIL ENTRANCE EXAMS
WE CAN DO IT!

162
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,912
GIRL 1: Ya know,
I aced that exam last week.

163
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,830
GIRL 2: Wait a minute,
are you top of our class?

164
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,541
-GIRL 1: Hell, yeah, I'm the Queen Bee.
-(gasps)

165
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,585
-GIRL 3: You did? How'd you manage that?
-GIRL 2: I don't believe it, no way.

166
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,671
It's freakin' nice.

167
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,215
This is pretty sweet.
I bet it was super pricey.

168
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,132
-GIRL 1: Really? How much is it?
-Hmm...

169
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,759
GIRL 2: Oh, come on, don't lie.

170
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,511
-It's, like, 400 grand.
-(girls gasp)

171
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,681
GIRL 2: For real, I saw it in the mall.
It's stupid expensive.

172
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,890

does that mean it didn't happen?

We'll take care of it. You can go.

194
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,944

the appropriate measures right away.

TEACHER: We've received a report
about some violence.

196
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,329
If anyone had their possessions stolen,
or if you were bullied in any way,

197
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,788
please raise your hand.

198
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,833

Really, no one?

00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,559
HUISOO: She couldn't raise her hand.

00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,731
TEACHER: If something like this
ever happens again,

206
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,901
we'll form a disciplinary committee
and take actions against you.

207
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,277
-Is that clear?
-HUISOO: The teachers called in

208
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,195
all the kids

209
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,864

-Hey, Seo Yura.

HUISOO: They said they'd take
the appropriate measures.

214
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,334
But that was it.

215
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,213
Those weren't appropriate measures.

216
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,631
(indistinct chatter)

217
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,299
They were adequate measures.

218
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:22,098
It was just enough to give the appearance
that they had addressed it.

219
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,520

220

What the hell did we ever do to you guys?

Which one of you ran your stupid mouth
off to the teacher?

223
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,910
Tell us who spilled the beans, huh?
Then we'll go on our way, huh?

You're going to make them all cry.

Stay out of it, babe, okay?

230
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,562
The principal said
he'd take disciplinary action

231
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,856

But I didn't do anything wrong.

234
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,869
Who was it?

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,211
Admit it. Face me, you coward,
you little fucking bitch!

you can't do this in school.

268
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,686
They were okay with it.

269
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,023
It's my fault.

00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,736
Our senior year's almost over,
and I crossed the line.

I should've stayed quiet.

272

-GIRL 2: Look out!

341
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,329
SEO YURA: Holy shit.

342
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,331
-(cutter rattles)
-(laughs)

343
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,250
What are you gonna do about your face?

344
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,880
(blood sloshing)

345
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,173
You bitch.

346
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,759
(panting)

347
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,888
(suspenseful music)

348
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,516
(shouts)
You bitch!

349
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,143
(grunts)

350
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,354
(whimpers)

351
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,358
(girl 3 screams)

352
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,861
(suspenseful music continues)

353
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,865
(grunts)

354
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,783
-(both scream)
-(students gasp)

355
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,703
(blood splattering)

356
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,791
(breathing heavily)

357
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,773
What... What are you?

358
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,986
What the hell are you?

359
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,656
(flesh squelching)

360
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,702

361
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,637

362
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,070
(eerie music)

363
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,754
(muffled thud)

364
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,841
(inaudible scream)

365
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,863
-(grunts)
-(blood splatters)

366
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,124
(sighs)

367
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,418
I don't like that color.

368
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,629
Orange?

369
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,757
Why?

370
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,303
'Cause it's a cross between two colors
that you have to mix together.

371
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,934
Because it's not red,
nor is it yellow, either.

372
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,729
It isn't just one color or the other.

373
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,287
OFFICE OF STUDENT AFFAIRS
JANG GYEONG HIGH SCHOOL

374
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,789
HUISOO: There was an investigation.

375
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,375
And I was expelled.

376
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,544
JUWON: Again, I apologize.

377
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,837
HUISOO: Because I used violence,

378
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,174
and I did it on school grounds,
no school would take me.

379
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,884
-I'm so sorry.
-TEACHER: Fine, all right.

380
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,927
JUWON: I'm so sorry.

381
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,055
TEACHER: Thank you, Mr. Jang,
you may go now.

382
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,431
Yes. I'm very sorry.

383
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,851
HUISOO: Fortunately, one school
accepted me as a transfer student.

384
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,859
It was a transfer in name only.
I was basically expelled.

385
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,364
(breathes deeply)

386
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,744
-That was what the school board decided.
-(sighs)

387
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,165
The fact that they even held
an investigation...

388
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,210
was thanks to my dad.

389
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,963
(speaker chiming)

390
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,715
Dad went to every single one
of those girls' parents,

391
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,718
and paid a ton of settlement money,

392
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,138
and stopped them from pressing charges.

393
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,099
(students murmuring)

394
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,860
Everyone avoided me.

395
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,489
No one would come near me.

396
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:11,908
JUWON: Huisoo.

397
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,743
Let's go.

398
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,544
HUISOO: They all just...
kept their distance.

399
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,842
-BOY 1: Look.
-BOY 2: Wait, she's leaving.

400
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,386
(pensive music)

401
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:44,858
HUISOO: Dad said, "Let's go home,"
but we lost that, too.

402
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,905
He had to sell it to cover
the hospital bills and settlement payouts.

403
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,116
We couldn't prove
that both parties were at fault.

404
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,536
Because of what I did,

405
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,542
self-defense didn't apply,
I wasn't hurt at all.

406
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,505
I messed up my dad's whole life.

407
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,884
Hey, Pop.

408
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,763
Did you know I was like this?

409
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,100
(Juwon sighs)

410
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:21,978
JUWON: No, I didn't.

411
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,272
I guess I had a hunch,

412
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,109
but all this makes it pretty clear.

413
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,118
But why am I like this?

414
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,752
(Juwon sighs)

415
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,754
You take after me.

416
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,842
You can't sit quietly
when something's wrong.

417
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,513
That's from your mother.

418
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,395
If your mom knew you took after me...

419
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,481
she'd be overjoyed.

420
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,947
Knowing she'd be pleased with that...

421
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,369
makes me truly happy.

422
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,205
(sobs)

423
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,046
BONGSEOK: Huisoo.

424
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,592
(chuckles)

425
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,551
Come on. Let's eat.

426
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,388
(chuckles)

427
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,640
Is it lunch already?

428
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,518
Time flies.

429
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:44,978
Oh.

430
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:51,401
Don't you think
that orange can be red and yellow?

431
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,570
Isn't that exactly what makes it orange?

432
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,488
You know, it's not one or the other.

433
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,992
You don't have to choose one.
It could be each color, yeah?

434
00:26:59,075 --> 00:26:59,909
You see?

435
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,377
Okay, then, let's have lunch.

436
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,005
BONGSEOK: Mm. Oh!

437
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,982

440
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,421
Ugh.

441
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,341
Christ, shit.

442
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,470
What the hell's wrong with this guy?

443
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,015
MAN: Ugh, again with this shit,
for fuck's sake.

444
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,935
What do you want?

445
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,523
Oh, uh, my credit card machine's here.
I'm here to collect on the bill.

446
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,440
(man sighs)

447
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,651
Do you even know
what time it is? Seriously.

448
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,529
(sighs)
You're pissing me off, all right?

449
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,365
You think I'm not going to pay you, man?

450
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,159
MAN: What the fuck? Here, take my card.

451
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,165
-You know, I wanted to ask yesterday.
-(tense music)

452
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,542
What accent is that?

453
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,379
-What? Shit. The fuck?
-Bro.

454
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,091
You from Gyeongsang?

455
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,010
I'm from Pohang and Guryongpo, dude.

456
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,346
You from Gyeongsang?

457
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,224
(man clears throat, chuckles awkwardly)

458
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,768
-I'm from Seoul.
-Then why do you have that accent?

459
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,105
Why are you trying to act
like you talk that way?

460
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,482
-(awkward chuckle)
-You really shouldn't do that.

461
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,525
Yes, sir.

462
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,362
If I see you running your mouth again,
with that phony talk,

463
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,031
I'll put your lips in a vice.

464
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,783
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,826
(scoffs)

466
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,954
Oh, that's just how we talk, I mean...
(scoffs)

467
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,748
Seemed like you didn't know.

468
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,665
Of course.

469
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,959
Wanna put the cigarettes
on the card, too? Yeah?

470
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,335
-Oh, yes, of course, yes.
-All right.

471
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,297
-Including a 4,500-won transaction fee.
-Right.

472
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,716
Uh, do you have a calculator?

473
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,259
Uh, no, I don't.

474
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,974
Sir, um, I've been meaning
to ask you since you arrived.

475
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,477
Uh, but right here, these two round scars.

476
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,021
Damn, my man,
this shit looks totally badass, bro.

477
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,522
So, uh, what are those?

478
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,441
Are they burns?

479
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,152
-Gunshot wounds.
-(gasps)

480
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:42,530
Gunshot wounds? Wow!
Oh, man, that's so fucking dope.

481
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,699
(laughs)
How the hell'd you get those?

482
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,367
Uh...

483
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:47,952

What are you thinking?

508
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,065
-What do you think memory is?
-Um...

509
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,734
A while ago, I read this thing, it said,

510
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,403
"Memories are like
electrical transmissions."

511
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,739
See, there's nerve cells
called neurons in the brain,

512
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,783
and they receive electric impulses, right?

513
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,077
So that's... that's how they, uh...

514
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,037

00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,336
BONGSEOK:
I've always been curious about it.

518
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,629
Why do you wanna know?

519
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,093
When I was four years old,
my mom passed away in a car crash.

520
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,261
I was sitting right next to her.

521
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,765
HUISOO: I still have memories
of that exact moment.

522
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,603
My mom looked right at me.

523
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,528
I don't remember
what her face looked like.

524
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,865
And that's my only memory of her.

525
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,125
(microwave beeping)

526
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,251
And I...

527
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,588
I wonder if she was crying.

528
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,976
OLD MAN: I waited a full 30 minutes here!
A half hour!

529
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,437
If you had even an ounce of respect,

530
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,522
you would at least leave
a phone number on your car!

531
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,149
-OFFICER 1: Sir, please. Calm down.
-OLD MAN: For god's sake.

532
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,358
It's a shit parking job, too.

533
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,235
-Come on! Hey, hey, hey!
-OFFICER 1: It's the NIS!

534
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,529
Hey, you think you're all that
'cause you're NIS?

535
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,197
OLD MAN: I was a former Marine,
you slick bastard!

536
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,490
OFFICER 2: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!

537
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,076
OLD MAN: Lucky someone had the good sense
to call me.

538
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,203
Otherwise, all of you
would've chickened out

539
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,289
and run away if I wasn't here!

540
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,458
FRESH CHICKEN

541
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,587
(engine starts)

542
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,854
-(grunts)
-(thumps on board)

543
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,441
(gasps)

544
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,862
(quirky music)

545
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,407
You got 63?

546
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,534
Two centimeters higher is a perfect score!

547
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,707
What?

548
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,085
Are you really gonna just sit there?

549
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,463
I do this just to get ready
for entrance exams. I'll be here late.

550
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,549
I'll be here studying from now
until you're done.

551
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,885
-(rattles)
-It's going to be a while.

552
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,638
-It's okay. I'm staying.
-Why?

553
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,056
Just 'cause.

554
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,353
So you're here all night?

555
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:06,771
Yeah, so?

556
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,940
-Well, then, you're just hanging out.
-No, I'm not.

557
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:09,982
Oh, yeah, come on.

558
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,069
You're here to make sure
I don't get lonely.

559
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,612
-No, I'm not.
-Thank you.

560
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,447
Uh, no... Huh?

561
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,201
(both chuckle softly)

562
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,748
(ominous music)

563
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,795
WOONKYU: We closed the case as a robbery,
with the perp going after her valuables.

564
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,381
Within a half hour, we deleted
all the pictures that were uploaded

565
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,675
to social media,
preventing further exposure.

566
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,927
We got the bodies from the NFS,

567
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,263
and we'll process them immediately
for the funeral.

568
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,349
(breathes deeply)

569
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,184
YONGJUN: Jincheon,

570
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,229
Bongpyeong,

571
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,940
and now, Naju.

572
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,904
It seems like they've sent a cleaner.

573
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,659
Yes, but they're all retired agents,
why bother?

574
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,412
Back in the day,
all our agents' top secret missions

575
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,581
were cleared in advance with the US.

576
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:11,502
To them, our agents are nothing more
than living proof of the past.

577
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,714
So they're bent on getting rid of them.

578
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,967
Then shouldn't we be taking action
in response?

579
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,051
Why?

580
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,929
To protect the retired agents.

581
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,056
Since the retirees know
as much as they do,

582
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,975
that makes this mess a challenge.

583
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,271
However, as for the cleaner,
we should find out...

584
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,732
what they know.

585
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,025
WOONKYU: We'll look into it.

586
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,695
We have businesses that we toss aside,
and businesses we invest in.

587
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,072
Get Chief Jo.

588
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,413
Should I reach out
to the US adviser as well?

589
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,458
Not yet.

590
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,752
First, we need proof.

591
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,588
We need to find out who this cleaner is.

592
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,384
(ominous music)

593
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,388
MAN: Yes.

594
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,849
The hair salon at the shopping center.

595
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,768
-(woman 1 crying)
-MAN: Yeah, the owner.

596
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,394
-WOMAN 2: Come on, let's go outside.
-MAN: That's what I'm saying.

597
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,604
WOMAN 2: Yeah? Here.

598
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,856
-(crying continues)
-WOMAN 2: Let's get some air.

599
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,691
MAN: Yeah, hurry.

600
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,984
I'll wait for you then.

601
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,320
(tense music)

602
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:20,821
Yeah.

603
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,242
THE LATE HONG SUNGHWA

604
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,385
In case you can't have spicy food.

605
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,846
Your name was in the guestbook.
I looked, I don't recognize it.

606
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,516
How'd you know my mother?

607
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,896
Do you speak Korean?

608
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:57,942
A little.

609
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,195
You speak a little bit, then.
You're an immigrant?

610
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,825
No, I'm not.

611
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,369
How do you know Korean?

612
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,415
Adopted.

613
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:17,336
Oh, oh! You were. Oh, of course. Uh...

614
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,964
NAJU'S SON: Do you see them?

615
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,634
All of us were orphans
till our mother took us in.

616
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,137
(pensive music)

617
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,099
Well, our mother did have
a daughter of her own,

618
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,478
but she never treated us
differently at all.

619
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,233
We wore the same clothes,
ate the same food,

620
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,193
went to the same school.

621
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,862
Always together.

622
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,074
Her daughter passed,
she was in high school.

623
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,828
That happened over a decade ago.

624
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,292
(awkward chuckle)

625
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,252
I'm sorry, I'm talking too much.

626
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,378
I'm sorry.

627
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,174
Uh, thanks a lot for coming.

628
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,969
Oh, please help yourself.

629
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,557
FRANK: Wait.

630
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,442
Was she a... good mother?

631
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,322
Yes.

632
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:43,756
(exhales sharply)

633
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,053
(ominous music)

634
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:10,241
RAEHYUK: Ah, yes, mm.
(sniffs, sighs)

635
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,326
-Is the Deputy Chief in?
-Yes.

636
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,454
(sneezes)

637
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,751
(sniffing)

638
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,629
Okay, so?

639
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,508
It's all right.

640
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,802
I'm not trying to fault you for anything.

641
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,471
Just tell me in detail one more time.

642
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,975
She was really like a monster?

643
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,309
SEO YURA: Yes.

644
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,106
She was definitely injured.

645
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,944
Her skin was all torn up, she was cut,

646
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,988
she was in bad shape and...

647
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,991
right away, she healed herself.

648
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,994
(scoffs)

649
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,288
She can't be human.

650
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,875
She's a monster.

651
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,419
(inhales sharply)
Oh.

652
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,587
So you're...

653
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,549
certain that she's really a monster,

654
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,468
huh? Huh?

655
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,511
-(sniffs)
-SECRETARY: Section Chief Jo is here.

656
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,813
-(soft grunt)
-(knocks on door)

657
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,565
-Come in.
-(door opens)

658
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,863
Good afternoon. It's been a while, sir.

659
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,114
So what news do you have?

660
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,032
Yes.

661
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,786
Well, this year, we'll get some results.

662
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,829
(Raehyuk clears throat, sniffs)

663
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,041
It's already been a full ten years
since you entrusted me

664
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,084
with this very sensitive business.

665
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,755
During that time, we've had
numerous graduates from our school,

666
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,717
but none of their potential abilities
came to fruition.

667
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,222
However, we believe this year,
they're going to meet

668
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,140
-your expecta--
-Are you taking good care of the files?

669
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,186
Of course, sir, I am, yes.

670
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,898
You know
that the NTDP has my full devotion.

671
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,358
Ah, yes. Good work.

672
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:09,944
I appreciate that.

673
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,947
Wipe that smile off your face.

674
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,491
YONGJUN: Something's definitely afoot.

675
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,451
DEAD

676
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,369
RAEHYUK: Oh.

677
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,829
Of course.

678
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,249
Keep close tabs on the NTDP files,

679
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,042
you never know what can happen.

680
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,835
If they're leaked to the outside,

681
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,004
things'll get
a lot more complicated for us.

682
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,005
Yes, of course, sir.

683
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,008
We'll have to find...

684
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,512
the right moment to destroy these.

685
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,349
We have to hurry.

686
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,143
NAME: JANG JUWON,
CODE NAME: GURYONGPO

687
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,229
JEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL

688
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,111
-Huisoo.
-Hmm?

689
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,990
You know how there was, like,
Styrofoam on the ceiling of my house?

690
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:56,907
Yeah.

691
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,076
My mom put it there.

692
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,746
She put it up when I was little.

693
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,791
And if any of it would fall,
she'd replace it right away.

694
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,877
It was there to protect me.

695
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,798
She won't take it down,
even though I'm grown.

696
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,053
And it's funny,
I just can't stop wondering why.

697
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,055
Huh?

698
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,182
(chuckles)

699
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,977
Oh, I see, no wonder you were zoned out.

700
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,895
She would've laughed,

701
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,981
your mother.

702
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,361
Because of course she knew
you wouldn't get hurt at all.

703
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:45,873
Huisoo?

704
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:54,423
If your mom knew you took after me...
she'd be overjoyed.

705
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,261
Knowing she'd be pleased with that...

706
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,348
-makes me truly happy.
-(sobs)

707
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,769
JIHEE: Huisoo. Stay there.

708
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:11,315
(breathing shakily)

709
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,112
(pensive music)

710
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,823
(sobbing)

711
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,620
-Mom?
-(flesh squelching)

712
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,080
Mom?

713
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,044
(gas hissing)

714
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,672
(chuckles)

715
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,051
(fire roaring)

716
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,555
(sobs)

717
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:01,824
FRESH CHICKEN

718
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,535
ANCHOR: At 11 o'clock last night,
a robbery occurred at a hair salon

719
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,745
in Gangdong-gu shopping center.

720
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:10,416
Ms. Hong, the owner of the salon,
was stabbed to death with a lethal weapon.

721
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,627
The authorities believe the suspect
was after the victim's valuables

722
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,296
and are calling it a typical robbery.

723
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,090
Police will be reviewing
the security footage

724
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,926
in an effort to identify the suspect.

725
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:24,430
Because the robbery took place
in a concentrated commercial area,

726
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:28,726
police are collecting both CCTV footage
and eyewitness accounts of the crime.

727
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,146
Unfortunately, with the upcoming holidays,
robberies are on the rise,

728
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,897
but patrol units are ready to respond.

729
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,985
The police chief has a comprehensive plan
to combat the holiday crime surge.

730
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,113
You know, I heard
he's been dead for days already.

731
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,948
Why's he in the mortuary so late?

732
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:46,535
I heard the NFS did an investigation
and they only just released the body.

733
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,496
-MAN 1: NFS? What for?
-MAN 2: Suspicious electrical accident.

734
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,706
MAN 1: My god!
(clicks tongue)

735
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,000
But still, even if that's true,
why are there no visitors?

736
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,418
MAN 2 (shushes): Quiet, he might hear you.

737
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,766
(suspenseful music)

738
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,645
(electricity crackling)

739
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,453
ILGANG FUNERAL HALL

740
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,532
(smacks lips)
Come on in.

741
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,452
Now, I've got some good news
to give you all.

742
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:13,872
Another transfer student.
So, please be nice to her, no fighting.

743
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,375
She specifically requested
to be part of this class,

744
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,503
-since obviously, I'm so popular here.
-(students clamoring, laughing)

745
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,547
ILHWAN: All right, all right,
that's enough.

746
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,299
Okay. Say hello.

747
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,561
HYEWON: I'm Shin Hyewon.

748
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,772
(soft music)

749
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,842
(closing theme music)
