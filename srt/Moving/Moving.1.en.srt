19
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,889

33
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,481
Kim Bongseok!

34
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,359
Do you want to be late
for your first day of school?

35
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,361
No! Just getting ready!

36
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,368
Bulgogi.

JUWON: Wow.

40
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,216
We're actually doing this.
How do you feel?

41
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,388
Fine. But, Dad, isn't it better
to franchise one of these?

42
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,806
You're starting at a new school.

43
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,434
You sure you don't need
a new uniform for this school?

44
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,606
Mm. It's only for one semester, you know.

45
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,191
I'll just make a deal with my teacher.

46
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,318
Hey, your teacher deserves
your respect, okay?

47
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,154
Uh, wait, here, just in case.

48
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,280
How much do you need?

49
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,282
Don't worry, look,
I'm already running late. Goodbye!

50
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,370
Good luck, hun!

51
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:26,998
Thanks!

52
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,044
You be careful, all right?

53
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,421
Love you, hun.

54
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,632
Yeah.

55
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,304
(panting)

56
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,893
MIHYUN: I'll increase
the weights later tonight.

57
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,853
(grunts)
I want you to wear two each today.

58
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,355
It's fine, Mom. I'll be careful.

59
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,440
I don't think so. Put them on. Two each.

60
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,775
Strap them tight.

61
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,402
Mom, that's exactly
why I keep losing weight.

62
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,695
They tire me out.

63
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,575
All right, then.
You just be very careful. Okay?

64
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,623
Here.

65
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,252
-Stand. There we go.
-(Bongseok grunts)

66
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,087
Why is it so heavy?

67
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,214
I put more in the backpack, just in case.

68
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,799
Here.

69
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,550
It's okay, I don't have a break today.

70
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,719
Yeah, take it, anyway, just in case. Here.

71
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,181
When you get to the classroom,
hang your bags on either side of the desk,

72
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,934
stay seated as much as possible,
don't let your guard down.

73
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,687
And also, don't fall asleep at all.
Got that?

74
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,564
Why don't you put on two today? Huh?

75
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,983
-Just for today.
-I'm already late!

76
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,734
-Ah, Bongseok... Hey, Bongseok, wait!
-I'm leaving, Mom! Bye!

77
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,862
MIHYUN: Take the weights!
Don't run or you'll trip and fall!

78
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,907
If they bust you for being late,
just say your mom's really sick!

79
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,826
No, no, just say you got hit by a car!

80
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,787
Honey! Good luck!

86
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,011
Thanks a lot.

87
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,096

88

-HUISOO: Please wait!

-(Huisoo sighs)
-MACHINE: The balance is insufficient.

90
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,019
-The balance is insufficient.
-Okay,

91
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,021
go add more money and get on the next bus.

92
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,147
It's in 12 minutes.

93
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,982
Then I'll be late for school.

94
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,650
(scoffs)
You're already late, though.

95
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,278
The other students
all hopped on the last one.

96
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,488
Grab the next one.

97
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,407
-Hello, sir.
-Every single day, you say the same thing.

98
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,743
Uh, I'll pay for her, too.

99
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,581
Ooh, quite the gentleman.

100
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,666
MACHINE (beeps): Transfer valid.

101
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,503
Dude, thanks. I'll pay you back.

102
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,214
I owe you 720, then, right?

103
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,967
Oh, no, I transferred from another bus,
so it's already covered.

104
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,553
All right, then.

105
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,484
Why are you...

106
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,528
speaking so casually?

107
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,447
We just met, you know.

108
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,493
Aren't you in high school?
I'm a senior there.

109
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,454
All the students talk in a casual way.

110
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,249
It's cool. It's okay.

111
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,335
I, uh, but it's not good manners,

112
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,296
to be so familiar
when we don't know each other.

113
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,881
Why are you so old-fashioned?

114
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,050
Set your bag down.

115
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,680
Oh!

116
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,807
What's in this?

00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,063
I really should get her
a new uniform for her school.

(speaker chimes)

147
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,912
Hey, you. Sorry, Bongseok.
You're too late!

148
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,706
(panting)

149
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,126
A late student on the first day of school,
and from my class, no less.

150
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,837
I had to run the whole way.

151
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,172
Oh, and I had to eat breakfast, too.
And, uh...

152
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,259
Our home isn't that close.
It's a ways from the main road.

153
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,094
It's a long walk, to the bus.

154
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,762
-And breakfast was very good--
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, enough.

155
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,473
All right. I didn't know you'd come up
with a good excuse. Huh?

156
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,766
You're gonna clean the toilets.

157
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,436
No, I'm... I'm a second-semester senior!

158
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,937
-And?
-Uh, but...

159
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,192
The school rules should be followed
without exceptions.

160
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,277
Right.

161
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,449

00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,623
-You're here, sir.
-RAEHYUK: Mm.

179
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,583
Hey. We could've greeted you outside.

180
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,876
No need.

181
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,670
-(chuckles)
-Mm.

182
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,841
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

183
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,304
(sniffing)

184
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,602
-RAEHYUK: It's going well, then?
-SUNGWOOK: Yes.

185
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,610
(sniffing)

186
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,028
RAEHYUK: Then why don't we have a look?

187
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,155
Because of security precautions,
we're unable.

188
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,740
(scoffs, sniffles)

189
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,953
-I have jurisdiction over here.
-Yes, I'm aware of that.

190
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,540
Indeed, I suppose security is crucial.

191
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,210
We've only got one semester, anyhow.

192
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,462
(sniffs, clears throat)

193
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,673
I'll see them then, though?

194
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,007
(Raehyuk sniffs, coughs)

195
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,594
RAEHYUK: Ah, don't let me tell you
what to do.

196
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,554
-Hm?
-Yeah.

197
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,056
Your contract is ending soon.

198
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,100
So you should start looking
for something long-term.

199
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,017
-Hm?
-Yes.

200
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,729
-(sniffles)
-Sir. I'll do my best.

201
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,357
Keep taking care of this school. Hm?

202
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,526
Yes.

203
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,195
RAEHYUK: I'm going, then.

204
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,448
All right, goodbye, sir. Take care!

205
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,450
(sighs)

206
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,493
You're not gonna say anything?

207
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:26,996
Goodbye, sir.

208
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,957
So you're a real teacher now?

209
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,543
(sniffles)
Mm.

210
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,795
(door opens)

211
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,133
You're going?

212
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,844
After I clean this.

213
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,644
(ominous music)

214
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,161
Whoa.
(grunts)

215
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,623
What's wrong?

216
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,002
(sighs)
Go on.

217
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,843
3-3 SMARTPHONE BASKET

218
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,638
(background chatter)

219
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,727
I need your cell phones.

220
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,189
He's Lee Ganghoon, our class president.

221
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,942
The cutest guy in the entire school,
hands down.

222
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:42,112
The dude's a genius, and he's athletic
and so good-looking,

223
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,574
tall and a really super smart guy
that can just--

224
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,660
-Hey. I have to take your phone.
-What?

225
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,079
This isn't a phone, it's a camera, Lee.

226
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,581
Do you really have to take it away?

227
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,333
Just don't film during math.

228
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,876
Mm-hm.

229
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,294
GANGHOON: Phone, please.

230
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,757
So you see that?
He's about as kind as it gets.

231
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,967
(chuckles)

232
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,844
No. What? No way.

233
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,764
HAN BYUL: Whoa! Whoa!

234
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,601
(Han Byul exclaims)

235
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,354
No way! Oh, my gosh.
That's so freaking cool.

236
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,064
Whoa!

237
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,567
Whoa.

238
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,448
Wow, that was nuts. This is Kim Bongseok.

239
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,450
What's your channel's name again?

240
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,244
Han Byul's SeniorSeniorBong.

241
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,372
Hey, how are you? Kim Bongseok here.

242
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,457
Um, subscribe to SeniorSeniorBong.

243
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,128
Also, like it, and stay tuned,
because I'm subscribing as well.

244
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,922
-All right, thanks. Mm.
-Yeah.

245
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,090
GANGHOON: Okay, everybody, take a seat.

246
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:46,010
This year's welcome speech
will be a video of the principal.

247
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,262
KISOO: What are you looking at, shithead?

248
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,184
Why are you staring at me, huh?

249
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,229
(sighs)

250
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,355
Sit up straight, okay?

251
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,774
(sighs)

252
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,745
COUNSELING IN SESSION

253
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,791
Come on!
I'll only take scholarships in Seoul.

254
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,086
Yeah. Let me tell you again, huh?

255
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,088
With your current grades,

256
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,758
you might only get a scholarship
at a national college.

257
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,302
Look, if I go any farther,

258
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,055
it'll cost too much,
food, dorms, transportation.

259
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,432
I'll be staying with my dad.

260
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,685
(Ilhwan sighs)

261
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,855
ILHWAN: Let me see here.

262
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,983
Oh! You're good at sports.
What about physical education?

263
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,444
An Art and Phys-Ed College.

264
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,696
Phys-Ed?

265
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,823
Looking at your transcript here,
it's quite good.

266
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,326
And if you get a great score
on the practical exam,

267
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,663
you can get into a four-year
college degree program in Seoul,

268
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,207
and you wouldn't have
to pay an admission fee,

269
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,001
you might even get
a scholarship to that school.

270
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,342
Well, still, a PE degree is tough.

271
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,095
Aren't those elite schools?

272
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,346
They're very expensive.

273
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,765
Not all. You don't need to worry about it.

274
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,934
All you have to do
is basic fitness training.

275
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,894
You know there's a track field outside.

276
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,688
You can train and do athletics here.

277
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,773
There's a lot of equipment sitting there.

278
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,944
I'll make sure that you're the only one
who can use it. I'll support you.

279
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,404
You will?

280
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,993
Why are you so nice to me?

281
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,369
Hey, silly bean.

282
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,455
I'm the teacher, you're the student.
Of course, I'll be nice to you.

283
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,293
Oh, well, thank you, sir.
Can I ask one more question?

284
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,920
Go ahead and ask me anything you want.

285
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,215
Could I wear
another school's uniform instead?

286
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,384
(groans)

287
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,637
I've been teaching for 15 years here.

288
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,265
Uh, you might be the first person

289
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,183
who wants to wear
another school's uniform.

290
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,393
You're a strange one, huh?

291
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,271
JANG HUISOO

292
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,403
Hello. Jang Huisoo here.

293
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,406
Nice to meet you, guys.

294
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,490
ILHWAN: That's it?

295
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,409
Introduce yourself.

296
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,581
Um, I used to live in Taebaek, Gangwon.

297
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,499
But I like eating potatoes and corn,

298
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,253
and there isn't much to do in Gangwon,
it's a small town.

299
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,715
Anyway, one semester left
and we're almost done.

300
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,051
ILHWAN: You can take
that empty seat there.

301
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,218
HUISOO: Okay.

302
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,221
All right, she's a transfer student,
so be nice to her.

303
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,515
-ILHWAN: Don't argue.
-(students greeting)

304
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,059
-Hey.
-ILHWAN: You're all seniors now.

305
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,061
-(students exclaim)
-KISOO: Not for long, though.

306
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,312
ILHWAN: That is true.

307
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,230
All right, quiet down.

308
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,566
Hey, Mr. Lee, come see
the Guidance Counselor.

309
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,650
All right.

310
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,779
TEACHER 2: This statement proves
that aspects of life

311
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,697
are reflected in the language.

312
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,283
Now, based on these facts,

313
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,702
let's take a look
at how the Korean language

314
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,873
has changed over time in different eras
and discuss its future trajectory.

315
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,960
Ancient Korean...

316
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,546
Yian, why don't you read it?

317
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,506
YIAN: Sure.

318
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:15,094
"Historically, the time periods
of the Korean language are divided."

319
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,222
"The earliest period of Korean
is called Ancient Korean,

320
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,307
commonly used
until the early tenth century..."

321
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:25,312
(heartbeats)

322
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:26,939
(gasps)

323
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,068
(panting)

324
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,696
Three-point-one-four-six,
five-nine-three...

325
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,369
Huh?
(breathes nervously)

326
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,290
Three-point-one-four-six,
five-nine-three...

327
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,753
Three-point-one-four-six,
five-nine-three...

328
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,091
Three-point-one-four-six,
five-nine-three...

329
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:11,692
(indistinct PA chatter)

330
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,444
(tense music)

331
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,373
(ominous music)

332
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,633
(sighs)

333
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,396
(exhales deeply)

334
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,493
(suspenseful music)

335
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,046
(beeping)

336
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,039
JEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL

337
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,001
(overlapping chatter)

338
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,047
Jang Huisoo.

339
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,341
Oh, I don't have a phone. Thanks.

340
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,428
No, the teacher,
he told me to show you the auditorium.

341
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,595
HUISOO: He did, really?

342
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,055
GANGHOON: Mm-hm.

343
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,307
Let's go.

344
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,642
-Now?
-GANGHOON: Yep.

345
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,523
Three-point-one-four-six,
five-nine-three...

346
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,317
GYM

347
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,617
(gasps)

348
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,038
This is not the auditorium, is it?

349
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,375
Lots of our PE classes are held in here,
'cause the field is all dirt.

350
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:22,716
The standing long jump, and sit-ups,
long-distance running...

351
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,009
(gasps)

HUISOO: Vertical jump.

353
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,680
Here, this is the key.
Mr. Choi wanted you to take it.

354
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,475
We have two sets of keys,
so you can have the extra one.

355
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,477
Okay, thanks.

356
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,399
I'll do a few laps before I go.

357
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,985
Mm. Lock up before you leave, huh?

358
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:42,903
Yep.

359
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,628

360
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,922

ILHWAN: Oh.

362
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,386
She said she doesn't have a phone.

363
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,596
She's running around
the auditorium right now.

364
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,264
Okay. That's all.

365
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:17,938
Sir, Jang Huisoo has an ability?
Is it just like mine?

366
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,193
Yeah, both of you are alike.

367
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,657
We're gonna keep an eye on her. Relax.

368
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,245
Is that it?

369
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,206
Yes.

370
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,209
You should relax.

375
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,443
Hm...

376
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,573
Ah, it's not as dirty as I thought.
I'll be quick.

377
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,327
Now, shall we start?

378
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,624

382
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,792
-EMPLOYEE 1: Let's work harder!
-Hey, excuse me.

383
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,919
What do you need?

384
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,129
Delivery.

385
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,299
-Just leave it there.
-No, no, no, directly.

386
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,885
Uh, I have to deliver it in person.

387
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,970
Who is it addressed to?

388
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,555
Jincheon.

00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,848
EMPLOYEE 2: Jincheon?

390
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,436
There's no one here by that name.
You sure that's right?

391
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,437
Guys.

392
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,816
Go have some lunch now.

EMPLOYEE 2:
It's not lunchtime yet, though.

394
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,991

396
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,468

397
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,178
Hey.

00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,515
How'd you find that out?

399
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,144
Right there, it's in black and white.

400
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,354
And what is that?

401
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,356
List, retired.

402
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,316
Uh, hm...

403
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,195
You're retired. This is the list.

404
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,532
-A list of retirees?
-Uh-huh.

405
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,034
And so what, there's a list,
what about it, hm?

406
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,331
Why don't you explain exactly

407
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,334
why you've come over here?

408
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,920
In detail, please.

409
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:29,838
Oh, I'm sorry.

410
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,840
I, uh... Where are my manners?

411
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,217
Oh, now you have manners?

412
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,136
Sometimes I do.

413
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,681
Let me ask you, again.

414
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,561
Why on earth are you here now?

415
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,402
To delete you.

416
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,904
Delete, huh?

417
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,616
Come here, Jincheon.

418
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,868
I have to explain?

419
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,828
Come here.

420
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,247
How dare you talk like that?

421
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,124
Wait, no, you have no manners.

422
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,626
(scoffs)
Hey, come on.

423
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:12,589
"Hey, come on"? Look at this punk.
Am I your friend now?

424
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,675
Ooh, don't even try, Jincheon.

425
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,886
I've dealt with college punk-ass guys
like you before,

426
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,846
and I know your type well, huh?

427
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,267
-What you need...
-(metal screeching)

428
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,560
...is a good beating.

429
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,400
Wow, do you want to fight, yeah?

430
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,986
It's on, baby. Eat the club!

431
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,155
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait!

432
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,615
Hold on, wait a sec!

435
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,971

(grunts)

444
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,693
Do you have children?

445
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,153
Hm?

446
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,447
Do you have children?

447
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,741
(spits)

448
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:07,078
No, I don't. No, you stupid fucker.

449
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,955
"Stupid fucker"?

450
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,791
You're a second-string asshole.

451
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,877
What'd you say?

452
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,044
You...

453
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,215

455
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,430

Why are you here?

478
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,354
I just cleaned the toilets,
because I was late.

479
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,940
That's why you were acting
so strange today.

480
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,692
You were drinking so much water, too.

481
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,654
Well? You going?

482
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,281
-Yeah. Yeah.

00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,117
-But your pants, they're soaked.
-Your bag's heavy, right?

484
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,786
-A little bit, yeah.
-I can... I can carry it for you.

485
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,496
Why? You're not my servant.

486
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,207
You helped me out earlier today,
so I got it.

487
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,043

Uh, not today, I gotta take another one.

Thanks for carrying this for me.
See you later.

493

You're early.

509
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,319
Yeah, it was the first day,
and they let us out really early.

510
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,032
Did something happen at school?

511
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,158
We just started.

513
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,371
(sighs)
I'm so tired today.

514
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,416
You should try telling
your face that, huh?

515
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,960
Hey, Mom, will you increase
my bag's weights again?

516
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,172
Mm-hm. I'll put some more in tonight.

517
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,509
Mmm!

00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,868
yes, of course, you'll need some money.

533
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,703
So, how much do you need?

534
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,706
A hundred and fifty thousand
for a uniform.

535
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,458
Oh.

536
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,043
Why?

537
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,504
So you didn't make a deal
with your teacher?

538
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,422
Sure, let's get you a new one.
I suggested that.

539
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,092
I also, uh, need a uniform for PE.

540
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,384
Sixty thousand.

541
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,348
Just get it now, huh?

542
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:04,310
I'll give you cash to buy it, okay?
Why are you worried, huh?

543
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,394
(scoffs)

544
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,064
Buy all of them, okay? You had me scared.

545
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,482
Ah.

546
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,276
(water running)

547
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,956
(dog barking in distance)

548
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,499
ILHWAN: A student will transfer here.

549
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,959
Her name's Jang Huisoo.

550
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,669
-Ganghoon: You found her, then.
-ILHWAN: Mm.

551
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,045
ILHWAN: You've waited a while.

552
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,548
You can get close to her.

553
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,594
Jang Huisoo.

554
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,645
HOON'S SUPERMARKET

555
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,529
-(beeping)
-(chuckles)

556
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,742
Ganghoon... Ganghoon...
Ganghoon, you're here.

557
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,327
GANGHOON: Yes, Father.

558
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,329
I'm home.

559
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,168
Hey, I'm home.

560
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,420
GANGHOON'S MOM: Oh, honey, you're back.
How was your day?

561
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,880
-GANGHOON: Good.
-GANGHOON'S MOM: You must be hungry.

562
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,715
-GANGHOON: Yes.
-GANGHOON'S MOM: Let's sit down and eat.

563
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,719
NAMSAN DONKATSU

564
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,847
(Mihyun humming)

565
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,891
Why does he sweat so much at night?

566
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,354
-(humming)
-(beeping)

567
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,658
#MYSTERIOUS DEATHS

568
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,078
(suspenseful music)

569
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,254
#MYSTERIOUS DEATHS

570
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,261
SOLEMN DEVOTION SOLELY TO THE PROTECTION
AND HONOR OF OUR NATION

571
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,351
AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY PLANNING
5TH DEPUTY DIRECTOR MIN YONGJUN

572
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,355
YONGJUN: Jincheon is dead? How?

573
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,856
Fell out a window.

574
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,485
But there were signs
of an attempted strangulation.

575
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,446
Scars on his neck
from broken bones show he was choked,

576
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,908
and we have evidence
of a violent fight in his hideout.

577
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,746
So then, who was it?

578
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,790
WOONKYU: We're still confirming.

579
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,627
(grunts)

580
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,966
The situation is taking a strange turn.

581
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,802
How did we wrap up the case?

582
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,137
We ruled it as an accidental death.

583
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,932
So it won't garner much attention
from the press.

584
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:48,975
But...

585
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,602
(inhales)
...there is the issue of social media.

586
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,606
We will erase it all,
but it's going to take some time.

587
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,693
(scoffs)
Shit! Fuck, this world has gone to shit.

588
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,945
(breathes deeply)

589
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,406
I had it good in the old days.

590
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,616
Work was exciting, then.

591
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,618
WE WORK IN THE SHADOWS
TO PROTECT THE SUNLIT LAND

592
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,456
And the breeding program?

593
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,960
We finished replanting them, sir.

594
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,841
Let's speed up the cultivation, huh?

595
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,592
WOONKYU: I'll let them know, sir.

596
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,136
POSSIBLE SUMMIT MEETING OF TWO KOREAS
AT THE END OF AUGUST IN PYONGYANG

597
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,520
(sighs)

598
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,605
(tense music)

599
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,042
BONGSEOK: I have a secret.

600
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,714
Mom said I'm just a little different
from other people.

601
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,010
As I got older and gained weight,

602
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,471
I was able to control it a bit on my own.

603
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:14,226
But even the smallest change in weight
or my emotions affected me a lot.

604
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,523
I always had to control my body
on my own, for my mom.

605
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,075
MIHYUN: Everything that was posted
on social media

606
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,744
has been deleted.

607
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,748
Which can only mean...

608
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:52,014
that someone is deleting them.

609
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,312
(closing theme music)
