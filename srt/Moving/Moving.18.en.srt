Kim Doosik.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,108
It's because of him.

7
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,901
Kim Doosik.

8
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,074
So you know.

00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,243

10
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,662
Hand over the files.

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,295
Get inside.

15
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,299
(suspenseful music)

16
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,722

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,044
Ah.

22

JAEHAK: Nice shooting.

23
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,465
You're gifted, aren't you?

24
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,425
You've got skills.

25
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,552
I almost died.

26
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,223
(cocks gun)

27
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,309
You're lucky.

28
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,061
I had a silencer on.

29
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,235
I became an elite warrior
with my shooting skills alone.

30
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,779
JAEHAK: Hey.

31
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,781
Say something.

(plops)

33
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,289
I have a story to tell about myself.

34
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,582
Do you want to hear?

35
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,462

Are you okay, kid?

42
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,087
Yes.

43
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,174
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

44
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,259
It's dangerous here. Hurry and evacuate.

45
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,264
Kisoo, get out of the school immediately.

46
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,640
What about you?

47
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,143
-Just go.
-KISOO: Mr. Choi, it's dangerous.

48
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,311
Hurry and leave.

49
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,775
Go.

50
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,278
Go on.

51
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,870

52
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,715
(Han Byul sobbing)

53
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,189
What the...

54
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,900
Kisoo.
(wailing)

55
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:54,943
I...

56
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,529
-I just came to get the memory card.
-Be quiet.

57
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,490
I'm so scared.

58
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,159
Quiet down.

59
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,661
(muffled crying)

60
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,955
Stop crying.

61
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,040
The situation out there is really strange.

62
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,416
We can't get caught.

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,502
Be quiet, seriously.

64
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,920
(muffled crying)

65
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,588
Stop crying, okay?

66
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,215
(muffled whine)

67
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,426
(tense music)

68
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,901
How did you come up here?

69
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,153
MIHYUN: And how did you come
all the way here?

70
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,614
Where are my soldiers?

71
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,991
I'm the one asking the questions.

72
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,245
What happened to my soldiers?

73
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,297
I killed two.

74
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,016
(grunting)

75
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,394
She's not bad, but what's with you?

76
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,645
(grunts in frustration)

77
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,688
JUNHWA: By the way,

78
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,442
you’re a lot like someone I know.

79
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,445
(Bongseok grunting)

80
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,613
You have a father, don't you?

81
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,698
(grunts)

82
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,784
My father?

83
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,206
Yes, your father.

Kim Doosik.

85
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,756
Kim Doosik?

86
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,474
What happened...

87
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,644
to Kim Doosik?

88
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,197
YONGJUN: Kim Doosik, code name Moonsan.

89
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,616
The most elite black agent of the ANSP.

90
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,744
He will be entrusted
with a top-secret assignment soon.

91
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:37,021
MOVING

92
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,361
(thrilling music)

93
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,530
(yelps)

94
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,298
(grunts)

95
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,385
(thrilling music intensifies)

96
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,568
Where is everyone?

97
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:10,865
(yelps)

98
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,004

(groans)

112
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,974
There!

113
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,021
(officers grunting)

114
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,940
OFFICER 6: He's over there!

115
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,863
(suspenseful music)

116
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,538

(music ends)

120
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,884
(tense music)

121
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,775
(wheezing)

122
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,992
Don't go in there.

123
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,497
You shouldn't be able to speak.

124
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,167
Please.

125
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,756
Don't go in there.

126
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,595
I didn't shoot any of their vital points.

127
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,599
There isn't much time.

128
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,227
Save those who can survive.

129
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:09,937
DEOKYOON: Please...

130
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,078
(breathes shakily)

131
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,804
(Deokyoon groans weakly)

132
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,109

133
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:19,381
EPISODE 18: SOUTH AND NORTH

134
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,969
CHIEF: We shouldn't just be sitting ducks.

135
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,097
If the South has them,
we must have them, too.

136
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,642
Search every corner to find them.

137
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,812
Make sure to complete your mission

138
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,022
and repay the republic that spared you.

139
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,734
Yes, sir.

140
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,449
CHIEF: My security department agents
will assist you.

141
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,832
To watch me?

142
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,875
Hey!

143
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,294
Have you already forgotten
why you have no subordinates?

144
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,714
Harden your mind,
or you'll be dead for nothing.

145
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,632
Understood?

146
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,178
Complete the mission at any cost.

147
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,891
Yes, sir.

148
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,938
CHIEF: Do not forget.

149
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,567
Sacrifices are inevitable.

150
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,780
(door opens)

151
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,157

152
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,704
YEAR 1995, MOUNT SURI

153
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,416
DEOKYOON: You comrades are
soldiers with unrealized potential.

154
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,167
who pulled through the severe training.

155
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,880
Finish your last test to become a gifted.

156
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,969
We have no time to wait
for your abilities to be awakened.

157
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,973
Even at this very moment,

158
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,976
the South Korean bastards
would be plotting their scheme.

159
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,646
It's an honor for warriors
to die in battle.

160
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,940
A life of humiliation...

161
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,820
is worse than death.

162
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,282
Break through the door of death.

163
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,452
Be born again as a gifted.

164
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,704
Once you pass this test,

165
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,458
you'll become elite warriors
for our great republic.

166
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,793
(shudders)

167
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,089
Long last the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.

168
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,010
MEN: Long last DPRK!

169
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,095
Protect the people!

170
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,014
MEN: Protect the people!

171
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,772
Comrades...

172
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:42,983
jump.

173
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,531

174
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,913
Jump!

175
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,665

176
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,086
Mother...

(soldiers sobbing)

178
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,468
Mother.

179
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,597

180
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,695

(sobbing)

187
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,889
Come down.

188
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,727
Why aren't you coming down?

189
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,687
Come down!

190
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,650
My comrades who trained with me...

191
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,694
are all dead.

192
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,826
This was supposed to be a selection
for the Supreme Guard Command.

193
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,039
I only wanted to become a guard

194
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,917
and support my family

195
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,671
to live without hunger.

196
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,506
(sobbing)

197
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,757
Do you want to live?

198
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,095
The only way to survive
is to become an elite warrior.

199
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,557
Look.

200
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,353
I do not want to...

201
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,567
become an elite warrior!

202
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,778
This isn't training.

203
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,406
How many times have you done this?

204
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,742
JUNHWA: How many have died?

205
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,245
At least it wasn't in vain.

206
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,455
JUNHWA: What do you mean?

207
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,125
DEOKYOON:
Soldiers who died during training

208
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,544
are listed on the roll of honor.

209
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,422
The republic pays them respect.

210
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,215
Respect?

211
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,802
I don't need such a thing.

212
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,345
I just...

213
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,933
want to live.

214
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,521
If you run away, you'll become a traitor.

215
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,067
DEOKYOON: A traitor...

216
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,154
gets executed.

217
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,872
If you become a traitor,

218
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,875
what about your family?

219
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,681
(sighs)

220
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,392
Come down.

221
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,991
YEAR 2003, ORCHARD OPERATION

222
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,536
I'll distract them from the front.

223
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,330
Escape with Bongseok through the back.

224
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,414
Come with us.

225
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,583
They're here in the middle of the night.

226
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,211
That means they already know about us.

227
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,797
We can't all escape together.

228
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,091
-Still, come with us.
-(Doosik shushes)

229
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,636
They probably don't know
about Bongseok's ability.

230
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,722
We must not let them know

231
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,225
that he's like me.

232
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,604
I cannot...

233
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,066
let our son live a life like mine.

234
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,904
You can't let anyone know, no matter what.

235
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,407
You have to keep him hidden.

236
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,828
Don't worry.

237
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,414
I'll join you soon.

238
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,873
(sighs)

239
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,628
(Doosik grunting)

240
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,550
Now.

241
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,592
DOOSIK: Go.

242
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,054
(engine starts)

243
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,739
You screwed me over again.

244
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,497
INFORMATION IS OUR POWER

245
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,627
DOOSIK: I decline.

246
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,715
You aren't in a position to decline.

247
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,053
If I decide to do
something else right now,

248
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,556
will you be able to stop me?

249
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,267
Don't joke with me, you bastard.

250
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,730
You think I can't take that gun from you?

251
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,065
Should I kill you for real?

252
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,942
You must have gotten caught for a reason.

253
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,529
Who could have actually stopped you?

254
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,285
You came here because you knew.

255
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:56,958
Putting you aside, your wife and son
can't be on the run forever.

256
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,254
(scoffs)

257
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,591
Did you hide them well?

258
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,638
We found you once.
We sure can do it again.

259
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,812
YONGJUN: If you kill me,

260
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,440
you'll be wanted by Interpol

261
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,859
for murdering a high official
of a national security agency.

262
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,408
How far would that news reach?

263
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,370
We managed to find you here.

264
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,580
Then the North
would just as easily do the same.

265
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,549
They'll be constantly after you.

266
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:49,761
And without me,
who's going to protect your sorry ass?

267
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,226
Make a choice.

268
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,688
Whether to take this mission
or be on the run forever.

269
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,699
Why me?

270
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,203
You're the only one who knows that place.

271
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,965
Just consider it as another round.

272
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,761
YONGJUN: I promise this will be
your last assignment.

273
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,268
(gunshot)

274
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,494
(suspenseful music)

275
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,740
There you are.

276
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,576
-(gunshot)
-(groans)

277
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,745
(grunts)

278
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,466
(grunting)

279
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,687
I heard you shoot people
under their ribs to not kill them.

280
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,439
So it's true.

281
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,578
(tense music)

282
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,332
Kim Doosik. It's been a long time.

283
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,459
DEOKYOON: Do you remember me?

284
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,132
I was spared my life

285
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,551
for resisting until the end.

286
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,019
Did you think you were showing mercy?

287
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,481
I told you not to go in there!

288
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,652
(groaning weakly)

289
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,410
DEOKYOON: I wasn't only trying
to save our supreme leader.

290
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,871
Everyone who was stationed here that day,

291
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,166
my comrades, my superiors,
and my subordinates!

292
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,754
(breathing sharply)

293
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,048
They were all executed.

294
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,857
What's your relationship with Kim Doosik?

295
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,279
Are you his wife?

296
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,951
I see.

297
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,665
Kim Doosik came in 1994.

298
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,630
He did this to me.

299
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,223
He broke into the Presidential Palace
all by himself.

300
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,853
And we were utterly defeated.

301
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,855
Just tell me about Kim Doosik.

302
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,150
DEOKYOON: Sure.

303
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,280
Kim Doosik then went back.

304
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,868
In 2003,

305
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,039
he came again.

306
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,003
We knew he'd come.

307
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,088
(trills)

308
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,469
(gunshots)

309
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,680
(yelps, groans)

310
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,973
(grunts)

311
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,393
-(shrieks)
-Hide.

312
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,814
(Yongdeuk groaning)

313
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,653
(Mihyun breathing heavily)

314
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,908
(approaching footsteps)

315
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,678
(tense music)

316
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,305
Kim Doosik?

317
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,600
Do you know my father?

318
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,310
How old are you?

319
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,978
You haven't seen him
for a long time, have you?

320
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,563
Do you know him or not?

321
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,943
I do. I caught him.

322
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,696
You caught him?

323
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,781
What does that...

324
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,993
What does that mean?

325
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,873
Can't you understand Korean?

326
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,252
Tell me.

327
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,046
Then make me.

328
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,340
Tell me!

329
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,633
(Bongseok yells)

330
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,551
(Bongseok grunting)

331
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,262
(panting)

332
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,099
(yells)

333
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,185
(suspenseful music)

334
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,524
You awakened your ability.

335
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,861
Now you know how to reduce the impact
when you take a blow.

336
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,537
Ah, you take after your father.

337
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,705
I take after my mom.

338
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,376
(Bongseok shouts)

339
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,676
(both grunting)

340
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,304
BONGSEOK: Huisoo!

341
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,056
(gasps)

342
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,935
(Bongseok grunting)

343
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,020
(suspenseful music)

344
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,698
Huisoo!

345
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,455
ILHWAN:
Grip it with the tips of your fingers,

346
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,999
so your grip is as wide as possible.

347
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,918
Swish! Notice my pelvis and shoulders.

348
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,963
Stomp! Step, like so.

349
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,506
Then, throw!

350
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,799
Like this.

351
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,384
-You know boxing, right?
-Yes.

352
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:30,346
Throwing a ball in handball
is similar to throwing a punch.

353
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,015
In boxing, this is your basic stance.

354
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,351
Your shoulder and pelvis turn like this
when you throw a punch.

355
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,270
-Throw!
-Good.

356
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,147
All right. Give it a try.

357
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,325
(suspenseful music)

358
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,336
Swish.

359
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,172
-Stomp!
-Stomp!

360
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,591
(both grunting)

361
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,217
Now!

362
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,598
Throw!

363
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:23,399
(panting)

364
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,828
(groaning, panting)

365
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,415
What the...

366
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,211
Are you not him?

367
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,342
You are him.

368
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,767
Who are you?

369
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,689
(action music)

370
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,158
(groans)

371
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,958
You sure are young and fast.

372
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,044
Where do you think you're going?

373
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,563
Speed isn't everything, you know.

374
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,540
Go.

375
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,460
