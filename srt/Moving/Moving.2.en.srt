DECEMBER 2003

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,021
(wind howling)

5
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,452
(Mihyun breathing heavily)

6
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:57,849
MOVING

7
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,742
(bells jingle)

8
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,890
That's a lot of luggage you've got,
it's gonna block the aisle here.

9
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:39,974
I'm sorry about that.

10
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,643
What would you like?

11
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,437
MENU
BEEF SHANK, DONKATSU, GIMBAP

12
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,314
Donkatsu, for one.

13
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,149
It's gonna take awhile to cook it.

14
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,443
I'll wait. That's okay.

15
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,986
Sure, okay. Mm.

16
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,380
MAN 1: An incident is out of the question.

17
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,466
He's surrounded by security.

18
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,511
MAN 2: Yeah, exactly,
I think it definitely has to be a coup.

19
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,556
(indistinct chatter)

20
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,141
(young Bongseok grunting)

21
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,987
(soft music)

22
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,743
Bongseok.

23
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,829
(sobs softly)

24
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,832
Your mom is tired.

25
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,182
(knife rasping)

26
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,267
(sobbing)

27
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,105
This way.

28
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,823
MAN: That's the entrance. Over there.

29
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,326
Come on in.

30
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,961
Wait, so you're gonna live here all alone,
just with your kid?

31
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,379
(grunts)
Yes.

32
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,882
-Uh--
-And I'll pay 30K.

33
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,469
-(breathing heavily)
-No, 30,000 a month is way too little.

34
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,054
It won't be enough to cover this lease--

35
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,013
MIHYUN: I'll pay upfront.

36
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,016
Three years' worth in advance right now.
Ten million won.

37
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,517
Oh.

38
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,190
-MIHYUN: I have one condition.
-What's that?

39
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,442
From now on, don't come in here.

40
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,693
What?

41
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,946
I own this building, why shouldn't I?

42
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,280
Not for long.

43
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,491
One more violation report,

44
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,660
and then you'll lose
the entire property, won't you?

45
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,746
-Just give it back, then.
-Ah, okay.

46
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,539
All right, three years.

47
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,294
Take good care of it.
You really got a bargain.

48
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,088
MAN: It's a completely fine building,

49
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,590
but some son of a bitch
had to go and report it.

50
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,802
Just a bitch, actually.

51
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,011
(grunts)

52
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,640
Honey, there's a lot of space.

53
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,935
MIHYUN: Our house is really big,
isn't it, huh?

54
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,919
He seems a little big to carry, huh?

55
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,046
(plastic rustles)

56
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,467
Does he have a condition, or...

57
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,853
You believe he doesn't know?

58
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,187
Know what?

59
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,692
About how you look at him.
About what you're saying.

60
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,112
And I looked at him how?
What're you talking about?

61
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,114
He's not disabled or...

62
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,868
or what if he was disabled
and he heard you say that?

63
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,827
(butcher's son grunts)

64
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,621
Hey, Mom.

65
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,919
-Where do you want this?
-Oh, you got that.

66
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,713
Take that to the fridge.

67
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,507
The cow's feet can be stacked up
in the freezer, eh?

68
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,052
BUTCHER'S SON: Pork, freezer.
Cow's feet, fridge.

69
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,304
You got it backwards. Say it again.

70
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,058
Pork, freezer... fridge!
Cow's feet, free... freezer!

71
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,225
(chuckles)

72
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,982
BUTCHER'S SON: Hey, Ma, it's weird.

73
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,444
The candy is almost gone.
Can I have some, Ma?

74
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,198
Two of them, yeah?
You did a great job today, as usual, eh?

75
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,575
BUTCHER: Son, you head home now.

76
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,660
Yeah.

77
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,085
(cheers)

78
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,179
See you later!

79
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,693
(soft music)

80
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,905
(sighs)

81
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,745
(exhales deeply)

82
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,343
I'm sorry for earlier.

83
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,555
Why would you apologize?

84
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,640
You're sorry, what for?

85
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:16,310
You must have misunderstood my stare
for something else.

86
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,771
To me, it just seemed
that your boy looked a bit

87
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,648
too crammed up back there, you know?

88
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,152
Look, even the way you tied him up
is too tight.

89
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,404
Look, look.

90
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,656
BUTCHER: Don't you see?

91
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,534
You don't have time
to look after yourself now, do you?

92
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,829
It's not just the children.

93
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,414
Mom's have it rough, too.

94
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,167
You have to step back for them to grow.

95
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,087
In the end,
mothers can't be selfish, you know?

96
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,924
As they get bigger,
you gotta give them some space.

97
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,801
How else will they learn, huh?

98
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,139
MIHYUN: Bongseok.

99
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,892
Don't ever forget it.

100
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,562
To keep yourself from floating,
you always have to wear this.

101
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,980
Here.

102
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,818
(sighs)

103
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,655
Come on. You try it. Hmm?

104
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,581
There you go.

105
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,083
Here, try again.

106
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,421
You gotta get into the habit.

107
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,016
Left foot, right foot.

108
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,313
BONGSEOK:
It took me forever to learn how to walk.

109
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,356
MIHYUN: Left foot.

110
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,608
BONGSEOK: Every time I tried,
I'd start floating,

111
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,235
and would fall.

112
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,571
That's it. There you go, Bongseok.

113
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,781
(giggles)

114
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,370
(sighs)

115
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,082
BONGSEOK:
When she figured out that my floating

116
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,042
was connected to my emotional state,

117
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,170
that's when my mom smiled at me
less and less.

118
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,301
You did great, Bongseok.

119
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,388
(light music)

120
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,894
(grunts, breathes deeply)

121
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,646
Hey, you did great, sweetie.

122
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,149
You took more than 20 steps today.
There you go.

123
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,735
(young Bongseok giggling)

124
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,612
MIHYUN: Such a great job, honey.

125
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,660
BONGSEOK: When my mother smiled,
it made me happy.

126
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,332
And when she'd hug me,
it also made me happy.

127
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,794
PRESENT, 2018
NAMSAN DONKATSU

128
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,337
-(thumps)
-(Bongseok groans)

129
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,841
(groaning, exhales heavily)

130
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,805
MIHYUN: Kim Bongseok!

131
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,348
Get up, Bongseok!

132
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,561
This won't do.

133
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,815
(playful music)

134
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,325
EPISODE 2
BOOYANG: FAMILY SUPPORT, LEVITATION

135
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,827
What kind of dream makes
your nose bleed...

136
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,496
Oh, god.

137
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,915
Yeah, you're at that age.

138
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,208
That's good, you're healthy!

139
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,710
Time to eat. Here.

140
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,295
BONGSEOK: Uh... Whoa, no, that's not it.

141
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,422
Really, I... I just banged
my nose, you know.

142
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,965
Right, you just banged it.

143
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,761
-I forget, where was your nose again?
-Uh, no, that's not...

144
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,304
I hit my head a bunch and...

145
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,306
and then I also hit my nose
on the ceiling.

146
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,975
Also, it's more...

147
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,604
I mean it... Your head goes all the way
from your neck up, you know?

148
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,481
-So it includes the eyes...
-(sighs)

149
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,691
...uh, the nose, ears, and even the face.

150
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,277
I wish you'd try and apply
all this knowledge and get good grades.

151
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,530
Except, you might be thinking
of the word "hair" when you hear--

152
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,616
MIHYUN: Okay, all right. Time to eat.

153
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,245
Wow. I mean, wow,
this is a lot of food to eat.

154
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,123
You're floating 'cause you lost
too much weight recently.

155
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,041
Eat more.

156
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,668
It's still too much, I think.

157
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,753
So, you want to go to bed tied down?

158
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,297
MIHYUN: Eat it all.

159
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,135
Don't scarf it down, chew all your food!

160
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,554
-Eat slower!
-(slurps)

161
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,223
I'll pack your bag for you, okay?

162
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,812
(rings)

163
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,899
(raindrops pattering)

164
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,528
NAMSAN DONKATSU

165
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,947
Oh, hey! Hey, hey, hey!
It's raining! Oh, god.

166
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,491
MIHYUN: The sheets are still drying
on the roof! Oh, my god!

167
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,576
(grunting, panting)

168
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,579
-Ugh! Oh! Ow! Hey!
-Aw, Ma!

169
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,872
(Bongseok grumbling)

170
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,293
God! Why are you even going up
the stairs, huh? Go eat!

171
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,879
APRIL 2007

172
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,759
Hey, Ma? Is our home a restaurant now?

173
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,677
Yeah.

174
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,179
I have to earn some money now.

175
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,265
I spent it all to get us this house.

176
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,599
And we need to eat.

177
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,728
(chuckles)

178
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,771
Bongseok.

179
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,065
Try reading that from right here.

180
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,608
NAMSAN DONKATSU

181
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,820
YOUNG BONGSEOK: Hmm... "Namsan Donkatsu."

182
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,239
Why is it called Namsan Donkatsu?

183
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,744
Namsan donkatsu is the best donkatsu.

184
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,995
(chuckles softly)

185
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,665
(bright music)

186
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,003
-Have a great day!
-(children laughing)

187
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,089
BONGSEOK: When school was over,
I had to come straight home.

188
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,758
(indistinct chatter)

189
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,052
BONGSEOK: I sat in my room for hours,
just watching TV.

190
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,639
So, for a kid like me,

191
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,518
Bungaeman was a hero to me.

192
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,561
Hero.

193
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,772
-BONGSEOK: Hero.
-Amazing!

194
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,273
BONGSEOK: It taught me what a "hero" was.

195
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,567
-(shouting on TV)
-(crowd cheering on TV)

196
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,610
YANGCHEON CULTURAL CENTER

197
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:03,032
(TV chatter)

198
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,954
(epic music playing on TV)

199
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,001
BONGSEOK:
Someone who can fly as his heart desires.

200
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,004
A hero. That's what a hero is.

201
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,676
Then I thought,
maybe I could fly like that, too.

202
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,515
Power! Lightning!

203
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,601
Lightning Power!

204
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,604
BONGSEOK: I wanted to be a hero, too.

205
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,773
I wanted to become a hero.

206
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:45,407
(kids chattering, laughing)

207
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,539
(chattering continues)

208
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:55,751
Lightning, Lightning, Lightning Power!

209
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,795
-Ha!
-(kids cheering)

210
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:02,424
ALL: Kim Taehyun!
Kim Taehyun! Kim Taehyun!

211
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,968
(kids cheering)

212
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,553
(laughter)

213
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:12,476
(overlapping chatter)

214
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:20,359
(chattering continues)

215
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,152
KID 1: Wait, look at him!

216
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,947
-You'll get hurt!
-KID 2: Don't do it!

217
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,407
-KID 3: Come back down!
-KID 4: He's crazy!

218
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,867
-Be careful!
-KID 2: Get down!

219
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,118
KID 5: Don't do it!

220
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,828
(overlapping chatter)

221
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,581
Lightning! Lightning!

222
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,418
Lightning Power!

223
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,004
(kids cheering)

224
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,089
(suspenseful music)

225
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,304
Ha!

226
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,642
(epic whimsical music)

227
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,239
(kids cheering)

228
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:13,329
(overlapping chatter)

229
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,626
It's not a big deal.

230
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,423
(distant chatter)

231
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,262
(stifled cough)

232
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,223
(car engine starts)

233
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,391
(stifled cough)

234
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,520
(breathing nervously)

235
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,898
TEACHER:
I guess Bongseok was playing around

236
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,733
a bit dangerously at school.

237
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,820
He jumped so far in fact,

238
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,156
the other kids must have thought
he was really flying.

239
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,783
-(screams)
-(metal clangs)

240
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,493
TEACHER:
Kids do have quite the imagination.

241
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,788
-(Mihyun sighs)
-However, the school rules are strict

242
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,998
about preventing accidents like this
from recurring.

243
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,417
I had no choice but to ask you to come in.

244
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,544
I'm so sorry.

245
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,216
The injured child, well, is he okay?

246
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,221
Uh, Bongseok, hey. Will you wait outside?

247
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,473
Your mom and I need to have a talk.

248
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,489
TEACHER: Actually, I'm sorry to say,
the boy that fell

249
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,117
is quite heavily injured, in fact.

250
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,369
MIHYUN: Oh, god, I'm sorry.

251
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,122
(sighs)

252
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,874
(somber music)

253
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,636
CLOSED TEMPORARILY

254
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,139
-(rain pattering)
-(thunder rumbling)

255
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:02,396
NAMSAN DONKATSU

256
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:08,610
(wailing)

257
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,739
YOUNG BONGSEOK: He showed off first.

258
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,742
He can't even fly, but he said he could.

259
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,412
Bongseok. I want you to listen.

260
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,166
Never do that again, understand me?

261
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,377
Why?

262
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,296
Why not? Ma, I could do it.

263
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,007
You said I had this power.

264
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,467
What do you think power is?

265
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,554
Empathy is what real power looks like.

266
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,143
Having the ability to care and understand
the emotions of others.

267
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,897
MIHYUN: What kind of hero breaks
other people's hearts?

268
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,690
Is that what a hero does?

269
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,406
It must have been scary for him,
but you showed off.

270
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,658
MIHYUN:
And you did in front of your friends,

271
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,827
you acted like you were better than him.

272
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,998
Bongseok, what you did
wasn't admirable at all.

273
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,793
Hero?

274
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,837
That's not it.

275
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,258
A hero has compassion towards others.

276
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,428
I figured you knew that.

277
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,225
(sighs)

278
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:28,941

279
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,699
-(whimpering)
-(tense music)

280
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,245
Bongseok!

281
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,421
I'm not letting go!

282
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,633
Mom!
(crying)

283
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,009
It's okay, I'm right here!

284
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,345
-Mom!
- I'm right here! It's okay!

285
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,680
I'm scared!

286
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,890
I'm holding on, honey, I swear!

287
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,019
-MIHYUN: Look at Momma! Hold on tight!
-YOUNG BONGSEOK: Mom!

288
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,897
-MIHYUN: It's okay, just look at me!
-(crying)

289
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,401
It's okay! I'm not letting go!

290
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,530
(Mihyun grunting)

291
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,949
(panting)
It's okay.

292
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,702
Momma's got you. It's okay.

293
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,203
It's all okay.

294
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,833
-I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
-(sobbing)

295
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,714
I'll always protect you, baby.
I'm so sorry.

296
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,925
Oh, it's okay. It's all good.

297
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,012
-(wind whistling)
-(Mihyun sobbing)

298
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,305
(lightning crackles)

299
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,612
BONGSEOK: Booyang,
to take care of and support.

300
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,821
BOOYANG

301
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,282
Floating, rise into the air.

302
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,077
Thanks to my mom's support,

303
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,496
I didn't float away.

304
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,166
(bus honking)

305
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,003
Hello, sir.

306
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,964
You might wanna get out
of the rain, huh? Get on.

307
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,176
I'll go.

308
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,636
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,430
-CARD READER: Transfer valid.
-Oh.

310
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,308
You were waiting for that girl
to show up from yesterday.

311
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,393
I guess your girlfriend's already gone.

312
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,353
Uh?

313
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,980
Huh? Oh, we're just classmates, is all.

314
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,609
Her uniform wasn't like ours, huh.

315
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,903
"Ours"?

316
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,614
Ah, she just started here.

317
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,865
Oh, yeah?

318
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,075
Just friends at school?

319
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,202
Yeah.

320
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,286
(bus door buzzes)

321
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,046
Huh?

322
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,258
-(squeaking)
-(grunting)

323
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,928
(upbeat music)

324
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:04,972
BONGSEOK: Huh?

325
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,344
APARTMENT FOR SALE

-(vehicles honking)
-(exasperated scoff)

332
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,410
How do you just U-turn
in the middle of the...

333
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:13,206
I just... Everyone okay?
I'm sorry about this.

334
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,548
(exhales deeply)

335
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,716
(whistle blows)

336
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,760
Counting down from ten, let's go!

337
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,221
Ten, nine, eight,

338
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,806
seven,

339
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,726
six, five, four,

340

three, two, one!

341
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,525
(Bongseok grunts)

342
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,613
Ding. You two are late. Cleaning duty.

343
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,114
What, I'm a senior.

344
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,616
Yes, I know, you're in my class.

345
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,284
Cut us some slack, would you?

346
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,869
ILHWAN: Nope. The rules are the rules.

347
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:51,870
-(sighs)
-BONGSEOK: Yes.

348
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,873
Yeah, that's... that's right.

349
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,125
The rules are the rules.

350
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,920
Yeah. Um,

351
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,340
the small things have to...
have to be maintained.

352
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,008
BOTH: You be quiet.

353
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,761
Hey. That Hollywood stunt was a bit much.

354
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,431
She's probably half your weight,
and you go flying like that?

355
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,517
No, I'd say I'm more like a quarter.

356
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,144
What am I, a truck or something?
So dramatic, jeez.

357
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,646
Anyway, you're cleaning, so...

358
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,731
What? Aw, Mr. Choi.

359
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,733
I swear I won't be late from now on.

360
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,235
I sprinted all the way here!

361
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,403
-ILHWAN: From home?
-Yeah.

362
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,489
She did. I watched her from the bus.

363
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,951
I was working out. I started training.

364
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,994
Then you should've been faster
to not be late.

365
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,621
Aw, Mr. Choi!

366
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,040
ILHWAN: You'd be cleaning anyway
because of the dress code.

367
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,708
I was gonna go buy it today, after class.

368
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,420
The uniform isn't the issue,
it's what you're wearing over it.

369
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,380
Anyway, cleaning duty.

370
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,090
Go on in, class is starting soon.

371
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,007
Yes, sir.

372
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,511

(paper rasps)

376
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,979
I didn't order any packages.

377
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,945
Your name. Bongpyeong.

378
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,783
This country's code names are amusing.

379
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,454
Are you a foreigner?

380
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,456
Anyway...

381
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,791
I happened to look into it and...

382
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,711
What was it, Chungcheong-do, Jincheon?

383
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,088
Gangwon-do, Bongpyeong.

384
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,632
Jincheon?

385
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,646
So how did you find us?

386
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:27,984
Is that a list?

387
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,112
BONGPYEONG: Why us? We're retired.

388
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,572
FRANK: I don't really know.

389
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,534
I just follow my orders.

390
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,744
You know all about that, don't you?

391
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,169
(electricity crackles)

392
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,215

394
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,435
Aren't I right? Electric man.

395
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,235
(breathes deeply)

396
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,828
BONGPYEONG: You know quite a lot about me.

397
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,330
Is that also on your list?

398
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,833
The list isn't always accurate.

399
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,087
Gotta check for myself.

400
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,005
(music stops)

401
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,882

I smell, huh?

440
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,790
It's bad?

00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:37,979
What?

444
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,899
You're doing PE 'cause of the teacher?

445
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,903
Take a seat. It's still study hall time.

446
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,158
KISOO (scoffs): You're fucking kidding me.

Hey.

451
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,512
Do you have your PE uniform with you?

452
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,390
Mm-hm. Well, yeah. It's in my locker. Why?

453
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,516
Can I borrow it?

454
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,519
Right now, my clothes smell
from all that running I did.

455
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,772
But it'll look big on you, I think.

456
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,482
That doesn't really matter, though.

457
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,236
You're the only one I know here.

-I appreciate it.
-Mm.

460

Oh,

461
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,671
are there showers around here?

462
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,715
Oh, they're... they're near the stage,
the theater.

463
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,800
-Theater, huh?
-Yeah.

464
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,926
It's lunchtime, you know.

465
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,428
But um... Yeah.

466
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,013

What the hell?

470
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,679
What are you doing here?

471
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,599
I don't think
that's your goddamn business.

the teacher's fucking pet.

474
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,400
Listen up you fucker, if you think
that's gonna keep you safe--

475
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,568
Why are you here?

476
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,487
Dang, you're such an irritating asshole.

477
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,907
That's my fucking business, huh? Why?

478
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,535
What are you planning,
you son of a bitch, huh?

479
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:03,833
(scoffs)

480
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,421

Let's go, motherfucker!

(Kisoo grunting)

485
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,252
The hell was that, huh?
(scoffs)

486
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,338
You call that a punch, you son of a bitch?

487
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,049
(both grunting)

488
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:53,966
(groans)

489
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,009
Shit.

490
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,844
You fucking bitch.

491
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,012
Just stop it.

492
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,680
You fucking bastard!

493
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,640
(grunts)

494
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,643

496
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,942

(panting)

499
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,060
Did you eat already?

500
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,941
I'm surprised you're able to drink
that much water.

501
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,695
Thanks for the uniform.
I'll bring it after I wash it.

502
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,612
Mm.

503
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,197
Oh, yeah, what is this?

504
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,826
Oh, that's... Those are my initials.

505
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,744
(scoffs)
Your name is KBS?

506
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,912
(chuckles)

507
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,623
Are you a broadcasting company?
(laughs)

508
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,710
Our school doesn't...
We don't have name tags,

509
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,587
so we put our names on our uniforms.

510
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,214
It's also a pretty good way
to keep from losing it.

511
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,966
Okay, Wikipedia.

512
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,259
-Okay, so?
-Hmm?

513
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,596
Your name, what is it?
I don't know your name yet, you know?

514
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,307
You're being quiet.

515
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,393
You don't want to get close, huh?

516
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,311
No, Huisoo.

517
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,729
It's, um, my name is...

518
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:36,068
Kim Bongseok. That's it.

519
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:39,488
Okay. Kim Bongseok.

520
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,866
Bongseok.

521
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,494

going to after-school classes,

524
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,666
show your pass to Ganghoon.

525
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,835
The rest of you have study hall in here.

526
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,253
STUDENTS: Yes, Mr. Choi.

527
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,130
ILHWAN: Where's Bang Kisoo?

528
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,882
(students murmuring)

529
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,217
-I saw him.
-ILHWAN: Where?

530
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,053
Bang Kisoo said he wasn't feeling well,
so he went home early.

531
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,721
-GANGHOON: I meant to tell you.
-Seriously?

532
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,223
-(students laugh)
-Sorry, sir.

533
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,391
ILHWAN: Fine.
All right, close out the class.

534
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,812
Attention. Bow.

535
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,522
STUDENTS: Thank you very much!

536
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,649
You, too.

537
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,943
(students laugh, murmuring)

538
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,945
-Let's go.
-Where?

539
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:19,862
To clean.

540
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,697
We don't have time. We're seniors.

541
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,200
-BONGSEOK: A promise is a promise.
-HUISOO: How is that a promise?

542
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,785
I mean, it was just an order.

543
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,036
Anyway, I gotta go work out.

544
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,537
You see, this is what I think.

545
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,499
-A promise is--
-(sighs) Fine, I'll do it. Let's go.

546
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,292
(Ganghoon clears throat)

547
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,836
Are you guys doing study hall today?

548
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,838
Ugh, I don't know. We're on cleaning duty.

549
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,423
(sighs)

550
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,884
I was going to ask you to tag along, too.

551
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,386
Where... Where?

552
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,888
Uniform store.

553
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,723
I can go with you.

554
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,393
-Serious?
-Yeah.

555
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,020
-You said a promise--
-It's really close, right up front.

556
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,730
We... We can go and come back.

557
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,148
Yeah?

558
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,359
Okay.

559
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,320
HUISOO: Hey, we're coming back anyway.
Why are you taking your backpack?

560
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,698
BONGSEOK:
It feels weird if I don't have it with me.

561
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,867
-I get anxious.
-(Huisoo laughs)

562
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:07,785
HUISOO: Fair enough.

563
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,830
DEAD

564
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:18,379
YONGJUN: You still haven't found it out...
who's doing this?

565
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:20,965
I apologize, sir.

566
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,093
We'll take care of it
as soon as we identify the culprit.

567
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,011
No.

568
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,681
Just ID who's doing this.

569
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,641
WOONKYU: Excuse me?

570
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,728
I'm going to keep a close eye on it.

571
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,150
REPORTER (on TV): An electrical surge
caused a fire at a second-hand bookstore

572
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,484
in Songpa-gu, Seoul.

573
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,946
After the fire was put out, Mr. Jeon,
the owner of the bookstore,

574
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,366
was found dead by the firefighters
investigating the scene.

575
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,453
It's unknown if Mr. Jeon's cause of death
was directly related to the fire,

576
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,955
and is under review
as part of the investigation.

577
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,124
However, the cameras
in the immediate vicinity

578
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,334
were also destroyed,

579
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,794
and officials are trying
to piece it all together.

580
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,172
The police investigation is ongoing,

581
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,382
and they'll be interviewing
any eyewitnesses.

582
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,927
The store owner's body will be transferred
to the National Forensic Service

583
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,763
to determine the exact cause of death.

584
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,848
(tense music)

585
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,747
Whoa. That's pretty.

586
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,750
What are you doing?

587
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,711
Nothing.

588
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:41,962
Excuse me.

589
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,674
I'm getting three types of uniforms,
so, I can get a discount, right?

590
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,177
No discount, 210,000 won.

591
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,678
Can I at least get the initials?

592
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,306
No, the dry cleaners can do that
for an extra charge.

593
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,225
(sighs)
I think that buying this amount

594
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,142
-should at least--
-No.

595
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,686
The dry cleaner's down there
will do that for you.

596
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,854
STORE OWNER: 5,000 won, I think.

597
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,564
To do them all?

598
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,566
No, of course not. It's per initials.

599
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,445
Two PE and one normal uniform,
that's about...

600
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,155
(gasps)

601
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,615
That'll be 20K.

602
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,743
So, are you super rich or something?

603
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,789
Oh, this is just...
My mom stitched this for me.

604
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,624
Your mom could help out.

605
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,002
My mom's gone. She died when I was young.

606
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,713
I don't think
she could have done that, either.

607
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,507
Yours is really skilled.

608
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,052
Oh, she's always been talented
with the sewing machine.

609
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,304
Uh, you want me to ask my mom?

610
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,265
Forget it. Don't bother.

611
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:35,975
How much is it?

612
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,977
God, I'm starving.

613
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,019
Me, too.

614
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,230
I had to skip out on lunch earlier.

615
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,857
Same here.

616
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,191
Why?

617
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,819
Oh. Just 'cause.

618
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,740
Did you not have lunch
'cause you were waiting on me earlier?

619
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,286
Well, you said
the only person you know is me.

620
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,540
So you thought... I would be eating alone?

621
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,500
Mm.

622
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,378
Let's make a quick stop.

623
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,380
I'll get you
some chicken soup with noodles.

624
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,339
BONGSEOK: What?

625
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,092
And for your information,
this is a big deal,

626
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,344
'cause I don't usually ever treat
anyone else.

627
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,513
Okay. Cool.

628
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,348
HUISOO: I'm being serious.

629
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,058
BONGSEOK: I know. Thanks!

630
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,152
(groans)

631
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:32,156
(breathing heavily)

632
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,660
(laughs)

633
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,289
That shithead.

634
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:55,429
FRANK: "Attended Jeongwon. Graduate."

635
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,099
Jeongwon School.

636
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,727
(phone beeps)

637
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,210
(ominous music)

638
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,381
(closing theme music)
