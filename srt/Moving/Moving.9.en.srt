10
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,862
Lee Mihyun, Information Strategy.

11
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,405
KIM: Mr. Min wants to speak with you.

12
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,115
-Thanks, on my way.
-KIM (whispers): Hey.

13
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,284
He's in a mood.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,289
(phone clanks)

15
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,583
(background chatter)

00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,512
-MALE EMPLOYEE 1: Yeah, look at that one.
-FEMALE EMPLOYEE: Okay, yeah.

17
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,639
-All right, I'm on it.
-MALE EMPLOYEE 1: Okay then.

18
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,481
(employees sigh)

19
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,316
MALE EMPLOYEE 2:
I hate that we're always walking

20
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,235
on eggshells because of that woman.

21
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,694
(sighs)

22
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,699

(knocks on door)

25
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,251
Yeah?

26
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,878
GOVERNMENT PUSHES FOR PEACE REGIME
BASED ON INTER-KOREAN AGREEMENT

27
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,090
(sighs)

28
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,051
-You called for me, sir?
-Yes. Let's have some coffee.

29
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,594
Ms. Kim. Bring some water.

30
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,306
-Oh, coffee, yes, I'll go make it.
-YONGJUN: Just go get some water.

31
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,686
(Kim gasps)

32
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,438
Just leave it alone and do as you're told!

33
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,274
KIM: Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

34
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,152
How is that girl more useless
than a vending machine?

35
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,867
YONGJUN: All the useless dolts
should be fired.

36
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,994
They're merging
too many divisions together,

37
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,996
and I'm having to cut a lot as well.

38
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,582
This fucking government.

39
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,460
They have no idea
how important the ANSP is. God.

40
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,672
How can they change policies this much
with every new leader?

41
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,175
It's ridiculous that they want
to start from scratch,

42
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,426
because of this new guy.

43
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,678
(Yongjun sighs)

44
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,108
You're not having any?

45
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,526
No, I'm fine.

46
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,529
I don't really like coffee.

47
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,828
It's good.

48
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,878
How are things? Is it going well?

49
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,254
(Mihyun coughs)

50
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,264
You know, Min won't tolerate
any more failures.

51
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,893
(breathes deeply)

52
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,397
So this won't end
with a simple disciplinary action.

53
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,987
He's the type to discard you quickly...
(grunts)

54
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,781
...when he deems you useless.

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,951
(Doosik sighs)

56
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,416
What if you didn't fail?

57
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,045
What?

58
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,046
Couldn't you...

59
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,007
continue with this assignment?

60
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:19,968
Why though?

61
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,970
Are you saying I should?

62
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,179
I want you to keep going.

63
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,728
That way, I can...

64
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,357
continue to see you.

65
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,446
Yes.

66
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,032
It's going quite well.

67
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,494
This is a good opportunity
for you to make amends

68
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,539
for your mistake during Operation Seagull.

69
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,667
If this goes well,

70
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,044
I'll give you a promotion.

71
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,630
Thank you.

72
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,258
You must understand the result
if it doesn't.

73
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,808
So, based on what you've seen,

74
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,602
what is Kim Doosik like?

75
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,860
You know, in TV shows, the leads
always sit in the very best seats.

76
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,697
So you watch a lot of TV shows?

77
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,077
(Doosik clears throat)

78
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,667
Apparently, business is so good,

79
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,002
they're now open late.

80
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,003
(clears throat)

81
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:41,758
Mm, it'd be really nice
to get donkatsu delivered.

82
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,301
Delivered?

83
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,472
When I work overtime, the only place
that delivers is a Chinese restaurant.

84
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,060
And they don't even take orders
if it's just one thing.

85
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:58,232
I think that all the foods of the world
will be delivered anywhere.

86
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,234
Even for one thing.

87
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,944
-Yeah?
-Possibly.

88
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,029
No way.

89
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,906
Enjoy your dinner.

90
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,699
Someday. Oh.

91
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,618
My sleeve.

92
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,704
Shit.
(grunts)

93
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,802
I suppose that has one advantage.

94
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,595
What does?

95
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,181
You can't tell that you got anything
on your suit.

96
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,685
At our company, they all wear black,
like they promised not to wear any color.

97
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,647
The building is all gray,
and people all wear black.

98
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,815
And I'm black.

99
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,445
(chuckling)

100
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,162
Mihyun, what color do you like?

101
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,332
Any color as long as it's not dark.

102
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,336
Ah, my car's white, you know.

103
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,088
I wanted that color.

104
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,300
When I'm working,
I'll look out the window at my car,

105
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,385
it looks like...

106
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,932
a piece of white rice that's fallen
on the seaweed before the roll is done.

107
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,477
Ah, so you like white then.

108
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,231
(exhales deeply)

109
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,901
One day, I'd like to show you
what it looks like when you're flying,

110
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,696
looking down on a snowy day.

111
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,282
Oh, no, I like purple.
I really like purple a lot.

112
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,199
Purple, huh?

113
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,243
Maybe it's because I live surrounded
in dark colors,

114
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:36,122
but I grew to like vibrant colors,
and finally, purple became my favorite.

115
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,542
All the curtains are purple in my house.

116
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,085
Hey, did you know?

117
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,629
Purple is said to mean...

118
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,215
the bitch is crazy.

119
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,512
Oh, so you're crazy.

120
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,099
(both laughing)

121
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,689
I feel relaxed when you hang out with me.

122
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,191
I like that a lot.

123
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,279
(sighs)

124
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:12,617
Do you usually say you like something
that casually that often?

125
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,619
Are you always like this?

126
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,121
No, it's not like me.

127
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,414
Then what are you like?

128
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,957
I'm cold and calculated.

129
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,709
I'm quiet.

130
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,085
Why are you like this now?

131
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,882
Mm, because you're right there.

132
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,222
You just keep joking.
(chuckles)

133
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,682
So I can't gauge
whether or not you're being serious.

134
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,436
I'm serious.

135
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,734
I'm seriously enjoying this.

136
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,825
YONGJUN: I asked you
what Kim Doosik is like.

137
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,875
He's a... He's quite a serious person.

138
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,547
So there's nothing more special to report?

139
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,965
I'm not sure what you mean.

140
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:09,966
You're not?

141
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,636
No?

142
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,888
(sighs)

143
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,934
You haven't found out his secret.

144
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,185
His secret?

145
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,730
It means that he still hasn't
opened up his heart to you.

146
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,482
What kind of secret?

147
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,900
Find out what it is.

148
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:29,860
Sir.

149
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,362
(sighs)
Dismissed.

150
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,700
(Yongjun slurping)

151
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,954
I will need you...

152
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,999
-(cup clanks)
-...to get even closer to him.

153
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,504
I will do my best.

154
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,880
It's an authorized operation.

155
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,843
Do not forget that.

156
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,139
Yes, sir. Of course.

157
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,896
(Kim sobbing)

158
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,780
Make his coffee with cream
and three sugars.

159
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,326
-Huh?
-He seems to like it sweet.

160
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,370
So stir it slowly
until the sugar disappears.

161
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,371
It could take a while.

162
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,417
-'Kay.
-Wear clothes that are monotone.

163
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,377
Black would be the safest choice.

164
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,756
Wear some low heels, too.

165
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,675
(sniffles)

166
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,052
I'm sure it's hard to be alone.

167
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,056
(sobs)

168
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,015
Stay strong.

169
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,226
I'm alone here as well.

170
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,064
Thank you very much, Ms. Lee.

171
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,486
Crying becomes a habit.
A habit becomes a weakness.

172
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,740
Only cry...

173
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,787
when you're really truly upset, okay?

174
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:18,969
WOONKYU: Ms. Lee.

175
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,264
Come here.

176
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,106
And where were you?

177
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,650
I was speaking with Mr. Min.

178
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,276
You must report to me when you return.

179
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,945
It was a personal meeting.

180
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,114
Ah, ah, the top-secret assignment?

181
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,449
That's why you slip out
like a little rat--

182
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,409
I'll close the door.

183
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,035
What? Why close the door?

184
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,663
There are many ears here.

185
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,747
So what?

186
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,666
They're all insiders,

187
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,960
so what's this nonsense
about too many ears?

188
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,919
(scoffs)

189
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,839
An ex-agent's habits die hard, huh?

190
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,801
And even if you are a former agent,
shouldn't you report

191
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,804
back to your immediate supevisor
when you leave your desk?

192
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm under orders
to report directly to Mr. Min.

193
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,351
Directly?

194
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,437
Ah, directly.

195
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,691
Our dear Miss Lee is allowed
to speak directly with Mr. Min

196
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,192
from the moment she arrived, huh?

197
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,821
There is not a single employee
in our division

198
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,698
who can speak a word with Mr. Min!

199
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,826
We're just simply working hard,
busy little bees,

200
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,412
trying to raise our salaries step by step

201
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,289
and working through the process
day after day.

202
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,834
So, okay. Ms. Lee. Come out here.

203
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,258
What's the status of your work?

204
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,218
Organizing the first quarter's materials.

205
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,971
Complete it today and report directly
to me first thing tomorrow,

206
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:44,930
for my signature.

207
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,268
What's wrong? You have no response?

208
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,022
I am an Analyst
and a Grade Six Junior Manager.

209
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:57,526
It's Ms. Lee Mihyun, or else,
you can say Junior Manager Lee.

210
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,533
Just go get to work.

211
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:06,911
Ms. Lee.

212
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,580
Yes.

213
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,965
(siren wailing in distance)

214
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,094
(whooshes)

215
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,305
(groans)

216
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,519
(paper rustles)

217
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,520
(Mihyun sniffles)

218
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,136
(gasps)

219
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,475
Doosik?

220
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,894
At the fifth floor?

221
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,813
Hey!

222
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,565
Mr. Kim?

223
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,361
(amused gasp)

224
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,407
What…

225
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,076
What is this?

226
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,459
Ah.

227
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,170
I'm sorry if I frightened you.

228
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,257
I just wanted to try surprising you.

229
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,426
(gasps)

230
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,969
Uh...

231
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,929
So you can...

232
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,640
You can fly then?

233
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,311
Yeah.

234
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,775
Delivery.

235
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,612
Flying Donkatsu.

236
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,575
(chuckling)

237
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,662
You're incredible.

238
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,666
Oh, and, uh, the miso
is in a thermos, so it's really hot.

239
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,627
Careful.

240
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,630
Mr. Kim.

241
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,257
I want to thank you.

242
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:28,886
Yeah.

243
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,096
I, uh...

244
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,768
I meant thanks for trusting me
with your secret.

245
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,773
Enjoy the food.

246
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,365
MIHYUN: Why did he leave through here?

247
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,908
What if someone sees?

248
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,641
DOOSIK: One day, I’d like to show you
what it looks like when you're flying,

249
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,102
looking down on a snowy day.

250
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,770
He really wasn't joking.

251
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,447
(gentle music)

252
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,125
(chuckles)

253
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,725
Thanks for my dinner.

254
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,283
(music fades)

255
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,454
(cocks gun)

256
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,878
(bullets clank)

257
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,591
Whoa.

258
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,842
(clanking)

259
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,096
(clanking)

260
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,723
-(thuds)
-(sighs)

261
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,726
JUWON: Oh.

262
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,940
You always go for that one shot.

263
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,277
That shot disables
without killing the target.

264
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,279
But can't you just shoot their limbs?

265
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,114
We're supposed to work quietly,

266
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,242
so I put pressure between the lungs
and bronchial tubes to silence them.

267
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,788
Yeah, but don't they die
from internal bleeding

268
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,705
when they're shot like that?

269
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,834
Well, they could survive
with emergency treatment, and sheer luck.

270
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,798
Oh, for decreasing any casualties
outside of our targets.

271
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,717
I mean, it's the best I'm able to do.

272
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,344
That's generous.

273
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,934
Then I should change my aim
to be more like yours?

274
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:22,976
(clears throat)

275
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,311
(mimics gunshot)

276
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,480
I mean, uh, your stance is correct.

277
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,941
-Hm?
-I'm just used to this, that's all.

278
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,030
I suppose it suits you better,
uh, shooting from the sky.

279
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,576
And I also practice
my shooting consistently.

280
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,748
I brought a lot, it's been a while
since the last time you were here.

281
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,545
Wait, Doosik. "A while"?

282
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,881
You said you're here all the time
to practice shoot--

283
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,842
(gunshots)

284
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,260
-(Juwon groans)
-(gunshot)

285
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,138
DOOSIK: I'm heading out.

286
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,139
JUWON: Wait for me.

287
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,306
DOOSIK: Practice more.

288
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,432
JUWON: Who are you meeting with?

289
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,560
Let me come!

290
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,187
(scoffs)

291
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,565
Why's he leaving in such a hurry?

292
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,150
Because it's spring.

293
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,484
Come again?

294
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,653
Spring breeze, it's nice.

295
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,863
(cocks gun)

296
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,281
Um, I don't think I get it.

297
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,867
You putting your cans on? Huh?

298
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,661
Oh, oh! Wait a minute. Hold on. Ah!

299
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,334
Yeah.

300
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,300
(pensive music)

301
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,026
(door closes)

302
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:02,993
So was it good?

303
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,286
It was very good.

304
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,122
(muttering)

305
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,081
You're not surprised?

306
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,376
-By what?
-Me coming here again.

307
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,172
I knew that you would.
(mumbles)

308
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,219
You're mean you're not happy to see me.

309
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,262
I saw you yesterday.

310
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,359
When I said I knew you'd come,
I meant that I heard the shots.

311
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,071
You hear shots
in the underground range way up here?

312
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,322
I have good hearing.

313
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,823
This is the fifth floor.

314
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,327
I have very good hearing. Very, very good.

315
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,621
(paper rustles)

316
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,171
(Mihyun sighs)

317
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,891
I was very nervous when I first heard
that you were a black ops agent.

318
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:12,354
But you're not quite
what I thought you'd be, Mr. Kim.

319
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,109
You keep making those silly little jokes,

320
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,238
and you let your emotions show through.

321
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,742
Was it a letdown?

322
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,538
It was...

323
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,376
unexpected.

324
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,004
Honestly,

325
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,884
I've been doing work in the shadows
my entire life,

326
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,928
so I haven't met a lot of people.

327
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,639
I'm not that good...

328
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,641
at socializing.

329
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,103
But I wanted you to think well of me.

330
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,688
And so maybe I, uh...

331
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,985
didn't want to come across
as too stiff and serious of a man.

332
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,031
And if that desire came off as a joke,

333
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,575
I'm sorry.

334
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,579
Honestly, it's from my heart.

335
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,793
I'm sitting here with you now,

336
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,963
because I know it's from your heart.

337
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,967
You... How do you know?

338
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,095
I already told you
that I have good hearing.

339
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,388
It's very good.

340
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,313
My eyesight is also...

341
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:38,857
exceptional.

342
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,280
Mr. Kim.

343
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,448
Yes?

344
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,369
I just revealed my secret to you now.

345
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,212
Tell me if I'm right.

346
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,758
(heartbeats)

347
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:09,262
(heartbeats continue)

348
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,559
I'm right.

349
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,648
(rapid heartbeat)

350
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,327
Hmm, that's not good.

351
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,454
It's beating way too fast.

352
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,165
At this rate, you could die.

353
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,376
No, I...

354
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,631
I don't care if I die.

355
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,530
(uplifting music)

356
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,190
(chuckling)

357
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,865
Well, want to get dinner?

358
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,831
(chuckling)

359
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,171
DOOSIK: Let me ask you something.

360
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,465
What's the opposite of ladyfingers?

361
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,428
MIHYUN: Hmm, the opposite of ladyfingers?

362
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,597
DOOSIK: Think about it.

363
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,392
MIHYUN: The opposite of ladyfingers.

364
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,019
DOOSIK: It's mentos.

365
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,687
-(Mihyun gasps)
-(Doosik chuckles)

366
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,984
(Mihyun chuckles)

367
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,077
YONGJUN: Oh, a summit, hm?
YONGJUN: Oh, a summit, hm?

368
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,870
NORTH LEADER KIM ILSUNG
EXPRESSES DESIRE FOR INTER-KOREAN SUMMIT

369
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,958
Call Lee Mihyun here.

370
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,252
KIM: Um, Mr. Min, all the employees
would have left--

371
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,212
Find her right now and bring her here!

372
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,129
(phone thuds)

373
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,464
Kim Doosik.

374
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,927
Do you meet with him often?

375
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,220
Yes.

376
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,930
Are you two are quite friendly?

377
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,056
Yes.

378
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,724
Lovers?

379
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,436
No, we're not.

380
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,605
So what's his big secret then?

381
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,237
I don't know yet, Mr. Min.

382
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,781
You still don't know?

383
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,449
Not yet.

384
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,162
You did well.

385
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,914
Sir?

386
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,457
Your assignment's concluded.

387
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,005
Did you just say
that my assignment is done?

388
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,548
Mm, you did well.

389
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,674
Dismissed.

390
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,303
Dismissed.

391
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,430
Thank you, sir.

392
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,353
He in?

393
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,525
Why are you here?

394
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,444
-Mr. Min called me in.
-(scoffs)

395
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,613
Secret assignment? You're still not done?

396
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,616
I've just completed it.

397
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,617
Yeah?

398
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,745
(scoffs)
Okay then. I'm all done now, too.

399
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,001
WOONKYU (in sing-songy voice): Mr. Min.

400
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,354
(gloomy music)

401
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,328
WOONKYU: I just heard,
you concluded Lee Mihyun's assignment.

402
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,996
Mm, it all went well.

403
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,291
Seriously, sir, your skill
with people is amazing.

404
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,085
-It's nothing, really.
-(both chuckle)

405
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,671
Honestly, in the beginning,
I really didn't understand

406
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,131
why you would trust such a birdbrain.

407
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,008
I mean, even if she was a former agent,

408
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,428
she made such a dumb mistake
and messed up such an important job.

409
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,138
You think that was a mistake?

410
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,223
Huh?

411
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,934
I was an observer
during the investigation.

412
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,019
The more we looked into it,
the stranger it became.

413
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,814
It was sort of like
someone deliberately let them go.

414
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,023
WOONKYU: Hmm.

415
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:16,444
Lee Mihyun produced the highest scores
in all the training processes

416
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,321
since the ANSP was established.

417
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,742
You really think she confused
a stun grenade for tear gas, huh?

418
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,538
One possibility.

419
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,957
Cheap humanism.

420
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,583
Humanism?

421
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,626
(men grunt)

422
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,589
YONGJUN: There was a recording
of the events, and we replayed it all.

423
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,096
The soft-hearted dumbasses would have been
completely shaken up by it.

424
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,389
(gunshot in distance)

425
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,686
Are you saying Lee Mihyun did that
knowing she could ruin her career?

426
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,479
Oh, not just that,

427
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,773
she could've been accused of spying
if things went south.

428
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,109
-There was another like her there.
-Who?

429
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,737
Kim Doosik.

430
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,164
Seven years ago, Kim Doosik ignored
the commands of his superiors,

431
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,957
and acted on his own.

432
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,545
He risked his life to save other people
by disobeying orders.

433
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,048
Wasn't he just overflowing with humanism?

434
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,970
So then,   investigating the incident,
you found out about Lee Mihyun.

435
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,680
-And Kim Doosik, who's sympathetic--
-No, no.

436
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,725
There's no reason for me
to have any interest in Mihyun.

437
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,980
Kim Doosik's only failed assignment
was Operation Seagull, you see.

438
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,274
That's where I saw her.

439
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:40,779
So it's possible they may have already
had some contact during Operation Seagull?

440
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,908
YONGJUN: Kim Doosik doesn't miss.
So why did he fail? Did he actually fail?

441
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,952
-Or did he side with her?
-SANGGU: Eagle! Eagle, can't you hear me?

442
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,996
Eagle! Hey, you little shit!

443
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,664
Those bastards are all running away!

444
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,958
What are you doing, you stupid idiot?

445
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,756
(chuckles)

446
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,300
Birds of a feather, huh?

447
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,094
That's why I tied them together.

448
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,972
So, did they get close to each other?

449
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,516
He's a black ops agent.

450
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,144
If someone approaches him,
he eliminates them or reports it.

451
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,021
He didn't do either.

452
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,025
Kim Doosik's in love with Lee Mihyun.
(chuckles)

453
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,485
So everything went as planned?

454
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,947
No. If only one side falls for the other,
that's not being tied together.

455
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,615
They both have to fall for each other.

456
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,701
Right, so Lee Mihyun
also has to fall for Kim Doosik?

457
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,537
-That's right.
-(knocks on door)

458
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,874
Ah.

459
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,044
Don't bring these anymore.
I don't need them.

460
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,045
Sir.

461
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,341
Let's see.

462
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,639
Mmm. Decent.

463
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,224
It happened.

464
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:52,851
WOONKYU: How do you know?

465
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,938
I know because she lied about it,
and went against protocol.

466
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,857
WOONKYU: And how did you know that?

467
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,525
Because I saw it.

468
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,694
(Yongjun snickers)

469
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,612
(gasps)

470
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,697
DEPUTY DIRECTOR 5, SECRETARY

471
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,741
KIM: He knows you lied.

472
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,784
(gasps)

473
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,202
(line crackles)

474
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,883
(whirring)

475
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,181
(whirring stops)

476
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,517
(Mihyun gasps)

477
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,777
(tense music)

478
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,672
(whirring)

479
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,685
(whirring stops)

480
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,313
(tense music continues)

481
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,942
RESTRICTED AREA

482
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,834
(panting)

483
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,511
(whirring)

484
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,428
(whirring stops)

485
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,487
Just leave it alone and do as you're told!

486
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,115
(suspenseful music)

487
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,202
What?

488
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,539
Couldn't you continue
with this assignment?

489
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,690
MIHYUN: What's your reason for doing this?

490
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,574
(sighs)

491
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,452
You did your work,

492
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,704
just as I did.

493
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,707
You gave me two assignments to complete.

494
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,793
Spend time with Kim Doosik and get close.

495
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,379
And find out
if he can perform his assignments.

496
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,217
I haven't yet been able to analyze
his capability to perform field work.

497
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,552
You did well there too.

498
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,346
An agent returns when it's complete.

499
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,557
Except Kim Doosik has no ties.

500
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,644
More than likely he'd flee
and go into hiding.

501
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,563
Could I trust him with another job?

502
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,691
That's why I needed a reason
for him to come back here.

503
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,236
Exactly what assignment do you plan
on entrusting him with--

504
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,988
You're forgetting agency protocols!

505
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,575
If you had failed on your assignment,
you wouldn't be here!

506
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,493
Get out!

507
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,539
YONGJUN: Oh.

508
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,211
Lee Haesong. Born in 1941.

509
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,464
Convalescing for eight years
due to a cerebral infarction

510
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,840
after his wife died.

511
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,885
Yangpyeong Convalescent Hospital
supports the families

512
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,303
of government officials.

513
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,599
These health care costs would be
quite a burden for any salaried worker.

514
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,853
Isn't it fortunate that his only daughter
is a government official?

515
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,396
You visit every weekend?

516
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,567
Due to all of your overtime work,
it's been a while.

517
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,195
Don't worry, your country
is taking good care of your father.

518
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,156
I'll be keeping an eye on you from now on.

519
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,463
(door shuts)

520
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,723
(gunshot)

521
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,815
(bullets clank)

522
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,278
(gun thuds)

523
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,115
EMPLOYEE 2: Mr. Min wants to see you.

524
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,963
YONGJUN: Moonsan,
this is a top-secret operation.

525
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,216
(suspenseful music)

526
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,524
(suspenseful music fades)

527
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,707
MIHYUN: I waited for him.

528
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,841
There was nothing else I could do
besides wait for him.

529
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,968
(indistinct chatter)

530
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,263
A party of two? Please head inside
to that table over there.

531
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,557
(background chatter)

532
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,451
MIHYUN: July came around.

533
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,828
But he did not.

534
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,375
I didn't see him for over ten days.

535
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,296
On July 9th,

536
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,300
an unconfirmed Chinese intelligence
swept through the ANSP.

537
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,221
(suspenseful music)

538
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,436
Kim Ilsung...

539
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,524
(panting)

540
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,779
Sir! Sir! Sir!

541
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,493
-EMPLOYEE 3: What's going on?
-EMPLOYEE 4: It's an emergency!

542
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,995
EMPLOYEE 5: Are you serious?

543
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:12,039
(people clamoring)

544
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,124
(phone rings)

545
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,211
MIHYUN: The intelligence
was confirmed to be true.

546
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,463
The official announcement came
from North Korea.

547
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,466
The leader of North Korea had died.

548
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,801
KIM ILSUNG, DEAD

549
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,138
It was only 15 days before
the South-North Korean Summit

550
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,264
was supposed to be held.

551
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,059
KIM ILSUNG, DEAD

552
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,564
(indistinct chatter)

553
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,481
KIM ILSUNG, DEAD

554
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,734
NORTH ANNOUNCES "CARDIAC INFARCTION
AT 2 A.M. ON THE EIGHTH"

555
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,819
YONGJUN: A cardiac infarction?

556
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,489
Ah, what's going on here?

557
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,950
Why not say assassination?

558
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,036
Why is Doosik not back yet?

559
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,412
Get everyone in here!

560
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,081
Yes, sir.

561
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,918
YONGJUN: It looks like…

562
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,130
Moonsan acted alone on this one.

563
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,174
Alone? How is that possible?

564
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,635
Isn't this impossible without orders
from his superiors?

565
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,221
His superiors? Aren't we his superiors?

566
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,267
WOONKYU: Moonsan holds
the key to everything.

567
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,770
We need to figure out his last steps.

568
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,898
On the 7th at 2200,
he crossed the border to North Korea.

569
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,691
That's the last movement we tracked.

570
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,779
Director Yeo, how do you know
that information so precisely?

571
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,864
WOONKYU: Director,
what exactly are you suggesting?

572
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,992
I should open up the lines
of the Information Management Division?

573
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,578
DIRECTOR 1: This is the biggest incident
that's occurred

574
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,914
since the start of this organization.

575
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,958
If you have the information,
shouldn't you share your source?

576
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,752
WOONKYU: Is your team not up to the task?

577
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,672
Or you'd prefer to steal our results
for your own benefit?

578
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,965
Director Yeo, look.

579
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,177
You're young and you're out of line.

580
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,095
(sighs)

581
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,639
DIRECTOR 2: We're not here to fight over
whose team is better.

582
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,557
There's an order to these things.

583
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,060
We should analyze whether
that intelligence is true--

584
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,019
Enough.

585
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,276
YONGJUN: It's confirmed intelligence.
What else do you need to analyze?

586
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,738
We must know what Kim Doosik did
up in the north, but he disappeared.

587
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,075
Then we have to catch that bastard
and bring him right back here!

588
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,327
So what order are you talking about, huh?

589
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,872
DIRECTOR 2: Sir.

590
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,375
You speak like you know that Moonsan

591
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,628
went off to North Korea on his own--

592
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,630
You stupid motherfucker.

593
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,883
You're an executive,
and you can't show an ounce of discretion?

594
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,593
Kim Doosik is part of our organization,

595
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:34,056
and the peril he poses for us
with what he could say is astronomical!

596
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:41,272
If you all don't want to get fired
at the same time,

597
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,149
listen to me carefully.

598
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,236
Get every agent and get out
and find that son of a bitch.

599
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,196
Get him here as soon as possible.

600
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,449
Kim Doosik.

601
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,493
Kim Doosik.

602
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:03,127
MIHYUN: Director Min mobilized
the whole organization to hunt him down.

603
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,840
He became the enemy of the new ANSP.

604
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,771
(machine hissing)

605
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:36,076
(approaching footsteps)

606
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,916
MIHYUN:
I was in the same situation as him.

607
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,171
And that year,

608
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:51,759
in 1994, we were hit
by a record-breaking heat wave.

609
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,931
I got in the habit
of staring up at the sky.

610
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,393
Everyone wished for the heat to break.

611
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,438
Everyone waited for the rain to start.

612
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,233
(car door opens)

613
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,068
(car door closes)

614
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:16,367
ICED COFFEE

615
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,494
MILK COFFEE, BLACK COFFEE

616
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:22,289
(coffee machine clanks, whirs)

617
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,298
MIHYUN: I became his hostage.

618
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,133
(rain pattering)

619
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,260
I wondered,

620
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,514
-would he be thinking of me that fondly?
-(thunder rumbles)

621
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,142
He said he didn't get
to meet a lot of people.

622
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,894
And he wasn't good at socializing.

623
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,230
He always joked with me,

624
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,024
but it was all from his heart.

625
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,738
(Mihyun gasps)

626
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,534
(gasps)

627
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,625
How'd you know I was here?

628
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,631
Purple?

629
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,426
Why?

630
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,054
Why are you here?

631
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,773
I was dying inside.

632
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,069
(thunder rumbles)

633
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,363
(emotional music swells)

634
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,135
MIHYUN: He should not have come back.

635
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,597
He was in grave danger.

636
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,727
He said he didn't get
to meet a lot of people.

637
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,563
And because of that,

638
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,402
he wasn't good at joking or socializing,

639
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,156
but it was all from his heart.

640
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,577
Everything he said was from his heart.

641
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,918
No, that's not exactly right.

642
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,796
It was actually...

643
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,091
because...

644
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,885
he loved me.

645
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,178
(door shuts open)

646
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,526
(music fades)

647
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,449
(closing theme music)
