5
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,934
CROWD: Yes!

6
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:22,272
MC: Great! Okay, let's call him.
Scream for him as loud as we can!

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,314
One, two, three!

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,859
CROWD: Bungaeman!

9
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,402
Bungaeman!

10
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,654
Bungaeman!

11
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,740
-Bungaeman!
-Hello, everyone!

12
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,825
(crowd cheering)

13
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,290
Today, Bungaeman flew all the way down

14
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,418
from the bright Lightning Star
just to see all of you.

15
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,670
Are you ready to have some fun today?

16
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,338
(crowd cheering)

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,633
Okay, let's all shout out
"Lightning Power!"

18
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,386
Like your love is a big thunder bolt!

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,889
-Lightning Power!
-CROWD: Lightning Power!

20
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,808
(crowd cheering)

00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:11,279
MOVING

22
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,280
AUGUST 1995

23
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,909
TEACHER: So, the electric eel generates
electricity from its body, right?

24
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,619
KIDS: Yes!

25
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:21,456
But guess what else can do that too.
Our bodies can also generate electricity.

26
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,791
KIDS: Oh, really?

27
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:23,708
Oh, yes.

28
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,877
Because the thing is, the human body

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,213
is always surrounded
by its electrical current.

30
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,297
We call that...

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,091
KIDS: Static electricity!

32
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,884
Whoa, you're so smart!

33
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,303
That's correct, static electricity.

34
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,181
-Everyone have their sheets ready?
-KIDS: Yes!

35
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,933
Now, everyone, watch me.

36
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,477
So, if you rub it like this,

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,271
our bodies will help
generate static electricity.

38
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,316
Did you know that a shock
of static electricity

39
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,193
emits over 10,000 volts?

40
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,655
Now, because the electricity passes by
incredibly quickly,

41
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,198
we know it's not dangerous.

42
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,116
Now!

43
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,327
(suspenseful music)

44
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,456
Okay. Did it work?

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,457
(kids murmur)

46
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,626
-It doesn't work that well, right?
-KIDS: No.

47
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,379
Because it's summer right now
and it's been raining a lot.

48
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,505
The humidity...

49
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,298
(gasps)

50
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,884
Whoa, look at that.

51
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,886
Looks like Gyedo made it work!

52
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,099
KIDS: Wow!

53
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,895
Wow, Jeon Gyedo,
you're good at generating electricity.

54
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,813
(chuckles)

55
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,356
That looks great!

56
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,693
-Give him a hand! Whoo!
-(thunder rumbles)

57
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,610
Whoa!

58
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,362
Look, did you see that?

59
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,322
TEACHER: The lightning is just like Gyedo!

60
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,993
There are many electric currents
all around us, they're everywhere!

61
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,161
-(thunder crackles)
-(kids exclaim)

62
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,705
Okay, guys, why don't we watch
the lightning strikes, huh?

63
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,665
-KIDS: Okay.
-Okay.

64
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,876
TEACHER: Let's wait for the flash.

65
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,628
-Look out the window.

69
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,599
Keep going!

70
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,267
(Gyedo panting)

71
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,436
Come on, come on. One more lap to go.

72
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,398
Yep, you got it, come on.

73
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,241
(grunting)

74
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:21,868
Time, time, time.

75
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,827

CAREER GUIDANCE ROOM

79
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,133
ILHWAN: You should try, uh,
Broadcasting and Entertainment.

80
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,763
Broadcasting and Entertainment?
As a major?

81
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:51,064
Your test results aren't high enough
for a PE major.

82
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,733
You told me to prepare for PE,

83
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,860
I've been training for those tests.

84
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,947
The school thought you had a talent
for sports and activities.

85
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,324
You don't.

86
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,247
Uh, well, the principal told my mother
that I might have some potential.

87
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,581
Sorry about that.

88
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,377
Uh, it's my first year, so it took a bit
to make a determination.

89
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,671
You should still go to college.

90
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,091
But it's too late to go now.

91
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,926
You like being the center of attention.

92
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,762
Huh? I do?

93
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,680
Mm.

94
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,765
For someone who can be so shy,

95
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,685
you really seem to enjoy it
when you're suddenly in the limelight.

96
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,064
Broadcasting and Entertainment.

97
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,025
Uh, I never thought about acting.

00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,746
please show us the Lightning Power pose,
starting with 277.

102
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,459
I'm 277, Cho Minkyu.

103
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,461
I'm number 278, Lee Minkyo.

104
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,922
I'm 279, Kang Sungjoong.

105

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,974

110
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:08,891
Thanks.

111
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,938

JUDGE: Yeah, thanks very much.

123
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,057
Go ahead and exit that way.

124
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,644
-JUDGE: How many more are there?
-Around 20 or so, I think.

125
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,526
Uh, wait. Just a sec. Just a second.

126
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,028
(chuckles nervously)

127
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,827

Huh?

132
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,095
If I'm not Bungaeman,
who else could it possibly be?

133
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,680
281, I'm Jeon Gyedo!

00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,600

(Gyedo's mom chuckles)

157
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,552
Let me know right away
if you run out of food, okay?

158
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,220
Okay, yeah, will do. Thanks.

-Oh, no!

00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,540
Now listen to me.

184
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,625
I'll never let you take our kids, One-Eye!

185
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,627
You think you can defeat me on your own?

186
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,337
(evil laughter)

187
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,713
No, I'm not alone.

188
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,551
All our love is like a thunder bolt!

189
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,469
Lightning...

190
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,221
-Lightning...
-(electricity crackles)

191
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,847
Lightning...

192
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,850
CROWD: Lightning...

193
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,977

(crowd screaming, crying)

197
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,577
Hey! What the hell was that?

198
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,829
I'm sorry, sir. I'll look into it , sir.

199
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,747
Oh, shit.

200
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,332
(crowd clamoring)

201
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,167
Hey, so, uh, what the hell was that?

202
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,752
Was it Jeon Gyedo again?

203
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,297
Look, I'm telling you,
get a new actor, seriously!

204
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,383
He just... He trashes all my equipment.
I'm gonna go broke.

205
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,178

206
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,182

209
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,663

Practically blind in this thing.

210
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,998
I can't see shit when I'm lying down.

211
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,751
Hey, by the way,
Bungaeman's gonna get canned.

212
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,669
Really?

213
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,755
The PD and lighting director
are throwing a huge fit,

214
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,465
complaining about
how it's happened before.

215
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:37,345
Then should I... Maybe I should apply
to be the next Bungaeman, huh?

216
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,596
(chuckles)
Keep dreaming.

217
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,598
I already had a little chat
with the producer.

218
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,184
-Oh, okay.
-Lightning Power!

219
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,604

220
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,523
BOTH: Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

221
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,071
Oh, Jeon Gyedo. We need your costume.

222
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,489
-(electricity rattles)
-Oh! Aah!

223
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,032

224
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,790
(exhales sharply)

225
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,878
Thank you for your hard work.

GYEDO: Hi, Mom.

229
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,303
GYEDO'S MOM: Everything okay?
Something wrong?

230
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,555
You don't sound so good.

231
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,267
GYEDO: Ah, it's nothing.

232
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,519
GYEDO'S MOM: I'm coming by.

233
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,312
I'm bringing some food
that I made for you.

234
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,606
So get home early.
(coughs)

235
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,692

(whimpers)

242
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,587
No, Mom! Mom!

243
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,881
Mom, what's wrong?

244
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,634
No, Mom!

245
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,720
(whimpering)
No, Mom!

246
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,805
(somber music)

247
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,819
So you quit your job?

248
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,739
Yeah.

249
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,824
I'm gonna start looking soon.

250
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,535
(sharp exhale)

251
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,911
That's good.

252
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,665
I don't think that job was right for you.

253
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,295
No, I...

254
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,174
I have no right to say stuff like that.

255
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,011
I haven't seen you in years.

256
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,639
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,230
Don't worry about it.

258
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,442
I know you sent money...

259
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,070
for my college tuition
and living expenses.

260
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,241
Then you sent me money to get my own place

261
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,495
when I said I'd move out and get a job.

262
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,663
Believe me.

263
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,375
You went above and beyond.

264
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,297
Thank you for that.

265
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,050
Now...

266
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,427
I'll take care of myself.

267
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,059
All right, Dad?

268
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,488
Okay.

269
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,952
You know, I'm retired.

270
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,912
I run a bookstore.

-Hello.

The guy's a whiz with batteries,
generators, and all things electrical.

00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,858
DONGYONG: He's an amazing guy!
Now, everyone say hi.

00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,761
-First day behind the wheel?
-That's right.

406
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,680
-Don't be nervous. Just drive safe, okay?
-Thanks! I'll see ya later!

407
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,390

Hm...

someone who's nice and thoughtful,

Your food's getting cold,
and you seem out of it.

I don't have friends to eat with.

-Yeah, sit down.

483
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,467
Thank you.

484
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,804
I was looking for you, actually.

485
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,181
Where'd you go right after the bell rang?

486
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,393
Uh, I went to say hi
to the security guard.

487
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,523
Can I sit here? I'm an outcast, too.

488
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,524
And why's that?

489
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,443
Oh, nobody likes me,
cause I'm always recording stuff

490
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,861

HAN BYUL: If I was a famous YouTuber,
they wouldn't mind.

493
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,075
You got some new subscribers?

494
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,743
One, I just got one.

495
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,914
Wait.

496
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:29,999
Was it you?

497
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,765
Is that our class president right there?

498
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,942
Should we go eat over there?

499
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,236
Why?

500
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,363
He's by himself, right?

501
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,532
Maybe he wants to be alone.

502
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,617
HUISOO: Who knows what he's thinking.

503
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,704

00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,733
What? You angry?

511
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,864
Go on.

512
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,824
Hit me.

513
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,326
You're an expert at it.

514
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,828
Hit me like last time,
you fucking shithead.

515
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,707
(Kisoo scoffs)
What?

516
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,668
Are there too many people watching?

517
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,837

518
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:00,840
Hey.

519
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,175
Think you're cool, huh?

520
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,470
You're just an asshole, got it?

521
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,932
You're the asshole who's been chosen,

522
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,019
and I'm the other asshole.

523
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:21,444
Listen, dude. I'm gonna expose you guys
and everything you're up to,

524
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,780

529
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,592

530
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,509
You knock?

531
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,637
You didn't hear the news?

532
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,805
What?

533
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,516
I heard the dropout picked a fight
with the class president just now.

534
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,727
From what I heard, he embarrassed the kid.

535
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,771
I think something smells fishy.

536
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,940
Who's class president
and who's the dropout?

537
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,942
I think you know.

538
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,736
Bang Kisoo and Lee Ganghoon.

539
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,404
Those aren't their names.

540
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,825
Bang Kisoo is acting kinda strange.

541
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,620
He's really been messing
with Lee Ganghoon a lot recently.

542
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,247
Luckily, Lee Ganghoon is keeping his cool.

543
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,125
All right. Goodbye.

00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,464
You should do something.

546
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,342
Do what, huh?

547
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,802
He's acting out.

548
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,971
He got hurt
'cause he didn't know his place.

549
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,683
He's been acting weird lately.
Shouldn't you take action or--

550
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,393
I'll take care of it alone, okay?

551
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,394
You can go.

552
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,856
It's my job, too, you know.

553
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,441
You're a temp for God's sake.

554
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,526
Get out of here.

555
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,657
(sighs)

556
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,951
The way you came in here
was way too casual.

557
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,702
You come in here a lot when I'm out?

558
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,413
(chuckles)

559
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,374
Oh, come on.

560
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,542
Ugh.

561
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,421

562
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,715

Get back to class!

569
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:23,751
Oh.

570
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,006
The class president
can just ditch class, huh?

571
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,425
GANGHOON: You too?

572
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,176
I'm preparing for PE exams.

573
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,261
I'm allowed.

574
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,429
Oh.

575
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,973
Right. Good luck.

576
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,307
Where you going?

577
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,809
I should head to class.

578
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,145
What? Come on. Don't go.

579
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,147
Aren't you here 'cause you're embarrassed?

580
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,356
No, I'm not.

581
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,816
Okay, fine.

582
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,151
Just cool it.

583
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,487
Sit down. Wait a sec.

584
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,283
(bag rustles)

585
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,870
Yours, right?

586
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,333
You could've saved them.
I cleaned them up, they're useable.

587
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,044
Thank you.

588
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:09,964
You did good.

589
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,674
What?

590
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,176
The cafeteria, at lunch.

591
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,470
You think I held myself back?

592
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,387
Mm-hm.

593
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,307
You got humiliated by him,
but you held back.

594
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,934
-I've been through that before.
-(sighs)

595
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,186
You take the beating,

596
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,104
so holding back is winning.

597
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,939
He would lose.

598
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,526
Isn't he a bully?
I heard he's really tough.

599
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,070
He'd lose, I swear.

600
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,072
Okay, okay. Sure.

601
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,283
No, for real,
I think you came out on top. Seriously.

602
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,121
Violence is the easiest
and dumbest method.

603
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,207
There are so many different ways to fight,

604
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,875
took me a while to see that.

605
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,928
(bag rustles)

606
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,096
(shoes thud)

607
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,598
Okay.

608
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,641
Good luck, then.

609
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,017
You're going?

610
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,519
Mm. I should go to class.

611
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,354
Okay.

612
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,403
Oh, Ganghoon.

613
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,073
Do you know how to turn the AC on?

614
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,119
The air was on before, but it's off today.

615
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,161
Oh.

616
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,502
I didn't know the switch was there.

617
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,882
(sniffles)

618
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,761
Appreciate it.

619
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,684
Oh, sure. Thank you.

620
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,229
I can see perfectly, they're so clean.

621
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,106
Oh, Bongseok cleaned them off.

622
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,941
(exhales sharply)

623
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,070
(quirky music)

624
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,829
Uh, you know, my dad owns a shop too.

625
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,291
(door closes)

626
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,251
What?

627
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,132
(grunts)

628
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:20,052
(panting)

629
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,230
(exhales deeply)

630
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,317
DONGYONG: Hey there.
You're back at work already?

631
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,152
Wasn't the funeral yesterday?

632
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,613
I already took off a few days.

633
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,365
The funeral's over now. It's okay.

634
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,825
You call that time off?

635
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,703
You were chasing after the NFS.
It's hardly been two days.

636
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,165
It's fine if you take some time to rest.

637
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,170
It's easier if I have something to do.

638
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,757
I wanna stay active.

639
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,427
I just feel like I have to keep going.

640
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,056
And this is the only thing I can do.

641
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,309
I'll see you around.

642
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,980
(engine starts)

643
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,943

644
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,716
(exhales heavily)

645
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,263
(mellow music continues)

646
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,825
Looks like Iowa.

647
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,709
JEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL
EDUCATED AT JEONGWON TO SERVE THE COUNTRY

648
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,210
CSATs are coming shortly.

649
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,504
Okay? Try to stay on your toes.

650
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,840
Pace yourselves, guys.

651
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,634
ILHWAN: And stay out of trouble.

652
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,262
Bang Kisoo.

653
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,017
I'd like to see you after class.
We should talk.

654
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,810
Son of a bitch.

655
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,186
(scoffs)

656
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:39,942
Bang Kisoo!

657
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,654
HAN BYUL: Move, move! Out of the way.

658
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,364
-MALE STUDENT 1: Is he actually leaving?
-HAN BYUL: Hey, move, move.

659
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,615
MALE STUDENT 2: Yeah, here he goes.

660
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,616
(Han Byul grunts)

661
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,203
YONGJUN: Wait a sec, isn't this a Korean?

662
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:55,708
Well, yes. He grew up in the US
and was forced into adoption.

663
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:59,587
Of course, they would send
a native Korean to do a job over here.

664
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,635
We were only able
to find his code name, Frank.

665
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,137
Frank, huh?

666
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,222
It means he's the sixth child.

667
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,016
A, B, C, D, E, F for Frank.

668
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,477
Holy shit, they've got it good.

669
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,188
They can cherry pick recruits
from anywhere.

670
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,482
His mom's Korean.

671
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,609
His dad's an American soldier based here.

672
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,528
An agent from the CIA
brought him to the US.

673
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,114
After that, all his records were deleted.

674
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,826
So it was the CIA.

675
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,456
Get the US Counselor to come in.

676
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,550

What's that song?

680
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,611
Come on, what is it?

681
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,240
You made this playlist?

682
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,325
Uh-huh. That okay?

683
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,828
It has songs to cheer you up.

684
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,748

685

(overlapping chatter)

728
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,226
Swish. Pow. Toss.

729
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,941
Study hall's done?

730
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:31,859
BONGSEOK: Yeah.

731
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,403
HUISOO: Oh, Bongseok.

732
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,447
I left your phone on and the battery died.

733
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:37,740
Huh?

734
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,582
HUISOO: I'm almost done.
Let's walk home together.

735
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:47,541
Just a sec.

736
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,502
-I, uh, I have to go.
-Huh?

737
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,421
I better go, my mom might call.

738
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,674
Okay. See ya.

739
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,811
(fans whirring)

740
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,398
(engine rumbling)

741
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:30,834
Hello, sir.

742
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,547
(beeps)

743
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,966
You always say that to me.

744
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,095
You've been gone, I was worried.

745
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,392
(soft music)

746
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,409
(bus door hisses)

747
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:20,884

748
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,035

749
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,539
(clatters)

750
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,416
(clanking)

751
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,417
Hey, I'm home.

752
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,046
Hey, Gang... Ganghoon.

753
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,093
You... You're home early.

754
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:04,928
Yeah.

755
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,766
Hey, Ganghoon, he... head inside
and grab a bi... bite.

756
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,272
(can clanks)

757
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,984

00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,990
(can clanks)

759
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,659
You know, my dad owns a shop too.

760
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,624
Hey, Pop.

761
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,635
I'm sorry.

762
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,391
GANGHOON'S MOM:
Ganghoon. You must be tired.

763
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,643
GANGHOON: Oh, hey, Mom.

764
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,277
(emotional music)

765
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,249
(clanks)

766
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,166
How much is it?

767
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,169
Um, that's the newest model.
A million. Yeah.

768
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,504
Oh!

769
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,089
So, how you wanna pay?

770
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,091
Ten orders of chicken.

771
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,635
Uh, you're paying in chicken?

772
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,220
Uh-huh. Here.

773
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,847
This is worth a hundred orders.

774
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,014
-Go.
-Yep.

775
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,307
-See ya.
-Thanks.

776
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,684
-Uh-huh.
-Thanks for this.

777
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,561
Sure. Share it, please.

778
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,979
Yeah, I will.

779
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,940
Jesus, that was worth a ton, and that...

780
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,276
that psycho just took it, for fuck's sake!

781
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,652
(breathes heavily)

782
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,780
Ugh, damn it, what a bunch of bullshit!
Fuck that guy.

783
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,657
Ugh! Son of a bitch!

784
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,499
-HUISOO: Hey, Dad, I'm home.
-Mm!

785
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,837
Ta-da!

786
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,463
Your brand-new phone!

787
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,799
Wait, what?

788
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,259
I just got it.

789
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,303
Go get it set up.

790
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,805
You're in high school,
you gotta have a cellphone.

791
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,932
I got rid of mine, why'd you get it?

792
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,601
Forget about your old school.

793
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,520
You said you made a new friend.
New phone, new contacts.

794
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:20,939
Wasn't it expensive?

795
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,065
Oh, no.

796
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,483
It's used, but like new.

797
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,193
I got it from a colleague.

798
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,696
(scoffs)
How do you know anyone around here?

799
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,325
Thanks a lot, Dad.

800
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:33,785
(exhales sharply)

801
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,747
God, I really didn't need this.

802
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,126
It makes me a little nervous
when I can't get ahold of you.

803
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,419
I'm not a child.

804
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,545
You're my child.

805
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,173
I want you to be careful.

806
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,425
Why do you say that?

807
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,801
Uh, because I'm your dad?

808
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,596
-All right.
-Mm.

809
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:53,847
I'll use it wisely.

810
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:57,225
I won't use data, only Wi-Fi.
No texting, only WhatsApp.

811
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,477
I won't use a ton of minutes.

812
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,354
-No, don't do that.
-Huh?

813
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,230
I want you to always have it with you.

814
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,274
Always answer it, no matter what.

815
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,735
If something happens, call me right away.

816
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:07,694
You got it?

817
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,071
If what?

818
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,072
For anything.

819
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,950
Pop, is something wrong?

820
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,493
It's just in case.

821
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,038
Mm-hm.

822
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:24,461

-Hello, sir.

824
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,757
-Mark here to see Yongjun.
-Oh, hold on, please.

825
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,138
The counselor from the US Embassy
has arrived, sir.

826
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,723
-(knocks on door)
-(door opens)

827
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,686
MARK: Ah, Deputy Chief Min.

828
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,938
It's been quite a while.

829
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,398
Yes, indeed it has.

830
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:50,779
(Yongjun sighs)

831
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,283
MARK: Wow.

832
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,079
(Mark scoffs)

833
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,584
Well, now,
isn't this some kind of discourtesy?

834
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,670
(scoffs)
Discourtesy?

835
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,964
Discourtesy indeed.

836
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:10,716
MARK: Right.

837
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,551
You just gonna sit there?

838
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,094
(scoffs)

839
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,350
Isn't this a little discourteous
for an ally?

840
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,895
Especially one who represents
the United States of America.

841
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,816
I represent the entirety
of Korean Intelligence.

842
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,193
(snickers)

843
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,653
What's the matter, Section Chief?

844
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,447
Section Chief.

845
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,366
Do you think this is just
any normal office?

846
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,118
No, of course not.

847
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:43,248
It's a secret department,
assembled back during the ANSP,

848
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,960
disguised as a regular office,
you know, for confidentiality.

849
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,087
Okay, so?

850
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,799
Nonetheless, I'm a counselor
of the US Embassy here.

851
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,843
Right, you're a counselor.

852
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:55,927
(chuckles)

853
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,347
You're a CIA agent
undercover as a counselor.

854
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,433
(ominous music)

855
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:09,858
(chopping rapidly)

856
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,526
(engine revving)

857
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,872
(tap water running)

858
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,293
(tap closes)

859
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,266
Oh, hi, welcome.

860
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,355
Have a seat wherever you want.

861
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,162
Is it just you tonight?

862
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,876
(tense music)

863
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,754
What can I get you?

864
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,181
"Donkatsu."

865
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,225
What's that?

866
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,728
Are you a foreigner?

867
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,605
(Frank scoffs)

868
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,440
Maybe.

869
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,610
Oh, donkatsu is a kind of fried meat.

870
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,195
It's fried pork.

871
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,573
Mm-hm.

872
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,952
King Donkatsu.

873
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,329
There're two sizes,

874
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,583
medium size and a large size as well.

875
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,210
The King Donkatsu is the large one.

876
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,171
Mm-hm.

877
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:00,010
Then, one King Donkatsu, please.

878
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,846
(chuckles)
Sure, it'll be ready soon.

879
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:22,616
BONGSEOK
DON'T COME HOME

880
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,455
A certain "bird" just flew in
from your country.

881
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,374
Now that's a discourtesy.

882
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:36,296
No, more than that,
it's actually quite a serious problem.

883
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,800
Do you want it to become
a diplomatic issue?

884
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,513
If you don't fucking crush
his little wings,

885
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,765
I'll make sure

886
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,310
this becomes a diplomatic issue.

887
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,521
That could be bad for both sides.

888
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,523
Then terminate it.

889
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,983
I don't have the authority.

890
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:04,783
All right, we'll do a deal.
You need some kind of results.

891
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:10,080
And we aren't interested
in the past generation.

892
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:13,166
SUBWAY LINE 9 ROUTE EXTENSION CONSTRUCTION

00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,283
Please enjoy your food.

896
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,536
I understand.

897
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,082
I'll suspend the operation.

898
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,333
I don't think you understand.

899
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,836
Terminate. "Suspend" is different.

900
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,422
It'll be suspended,

901
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,757
reported, and then terminated.

902
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,094
I guess you don't get it, then.

903
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,431

-SECRETARY: Yes, sir.

904
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,724
Connect me to China.
