ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,179

00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,433

CONTROL STATUS

6
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,948
Sir, Lee Jaeman in Gangdong-gu
has breached the probation perimeter.

7
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,702
-DIRECTOR: You're sure of that?
-Yes.

8
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,705
His ankle monitor is intact,
but he definitely breached his perimeter.

9
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:39,998
That makes no sense.

10
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,375
DIRECTOR: How could he get
to that place in a minute?

11
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,170
-Maybe it's a GPS error.
-(director sighs)

12
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,505
He couldn't have gotten there
by car, either.

13
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,760
Ms. Kim, get me some info on Lee Jaeman.

14
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,471
MS. KIM: He's 52 years old,
and he's not a sex offender.

15
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,432
He has two records of assault,
and he's to be on probation for...

16
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,600
20 years.

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,478
He is on the special watch list
of the NIS.

18
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:03,938
The NIS?

19
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,857
(monitor beeping)

20
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,068
DIRECTOR: Let's follow the procedure.

21
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,944
Check the local probation office,

22
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,988
and contact the police as well as the NIS.

23
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,239
SUPERVISORS: Yes, sir.

24
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,243

28
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,258
What the hell are you?

29
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,053
(grunting)

30
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,517

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,434
Ooh.

32
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,061
You're strong.

(breathing heavily)

37
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,380
Do you want to try again?

38
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,090

43
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,902
What is it? Do you want to go again?

44
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,488
-(crunches)
-(yells in pain)

45
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,699
That's why you should have stayed hidden.

46
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,162
(whimpering)

47
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,626

(muffled sobbing)

51
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,119

(Han Byul gasps)

53
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,754
Who are you?

54
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,673
We're sorry.

55
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,009
We didn't see anything. We're sorry.

56
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,179
Please don't kill us.

57
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,389
I asked who you are.

58
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,391
HAN BYUL: Okay.

59
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,061
We're just students.
We don't know anything.

60

62
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,742

CHANIL: So you are gifted.

64
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,633
It's confirmed now.

65
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,053
This will all be over
when you answer this.

66
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,598
Who else is there besides you?

67
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,851

Where are the files?

78
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,192
What files?

79
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,904
CHANIL: You're going to die at this rate.

80
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,156
I don't have them.

81
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,784
(groaning)

82
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,747
You'll die for real.

I don't have them, you bastard.

84
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,753
Really?

85
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,670

Get it together, Ganghoon.

95
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,626
You're going to make me cry.

96
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,922
So, what if we do this?

97
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,012

I'm sorry...

151

Okay.

167
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,738
That must've hurt.

I have a plan,

179
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,048
so you should leave, sir.

180
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,596
I don't think we're done yet.

181
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,014
Pardon?

182
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,517

(suspenseful music)

184
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,487

(groans)

186
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,335

00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,826
How did a kid end up in this hellhole?

192
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,538
-His dad was a traitor.
-(chains clink)

193
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,417
GUARD 2: His whole family was caught
while they were heading to South Korea.

194
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,172
The parents were shot dead,

195
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,383
and the kid will spend
the rest of his life here.

196
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,384
GUARD 1: Really?

197
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,844
Oh, well. He's the family of a traitor.

198
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,156
I have to catch them.

199
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,701
I have to catch them like this.

200
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,203
That way, it won't be itchy.

201
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,248
JAESEOK: Don't die.
There will be more bugs.

202
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,084
When there are more bugs, it gets itchy.

203
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,461
It's so itchy.

204
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,130
-(bugs buzzing)
-(thumps)

205
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,591
I have to catch them.

206
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,177
I have to catch them like this.

207
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,763
That way, it won't be itchy.

208
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,183
GUARD 3: Another one dead.

209
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,394
(guard 3 grunts)

210
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:01,937
It stinks.

211
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,150
(whimpering)

212
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,401
(door slams)

213
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,159
I have to catch the bugs.

214
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,577
I have to catch them.

215
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,668
(distant clang)

216
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,422
(ominous music)

217
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,971
Is someone there?

218
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,975
What year is it now?

219
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,145
JAESEOK: Is it day or night?

220
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,066
Please answer me.

221
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,280
Don't die.

222
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,700
I won't die, either, so don't die.

223
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,702
There will be more bugs.

224
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,509
Come on, answer me.

225
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,387
Did you die as well?

226
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,062
I guess you died.

227
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,065
(bug buzzing)

228
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,233
(thumps)

229
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,243
I should...

230
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,122
die as well.

231
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,006
MAN: Let's live.

232
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,304
Let's try to live.

233
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,642
Let's not give up.

234
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,537
(tense music)

235
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,504
(echoing shrill)

236
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,505
(grunts)

237
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,306
(coughs)

238
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,892
ILHWAN: Ganghoon!

239
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:51,982
Ganghoon!

240
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,239
(yells)

241
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,160
(blasts)

242
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,753
(gunshots)

243
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,717
(rumbling)

244
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,266
Run!

245
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,104
(rumbling)

246
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,329
(Juwon shouts)

247
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,414
(suspenseful music)

248
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,004
(echoing shrill)

249
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,047
(groans)

250
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:15,190
(Jaeman grunting)

251
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,693
JAEMAN: Ganghoon.

252
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,487
Ganghoon.

253
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,825
Aah!

254
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,869
(grunts)

255
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,205
JAEMAN: Ganghoon.

256
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,043
(debris thump)

257
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,169
(grunts)

258
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,541
(line rings)

259
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,461
Are you okay?

260
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,338
I'm okay.

261
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,215
You're a bigger mess.

262
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,967
You got beat up a lot.

263
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,427
I'm really okay.

264
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,221
See? I don't get hurt.

265
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,726
HUISOO: My dad said he was fine
even after being shot.

266
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,353
Do you believe me now?

267
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,313
I believe you. But that's not the issue.

268
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,107
You're still human in the end.

269
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,109
On top of that, you're someone I like.

270
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,527
-When someone gets hit--
-What?

271
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,615
What?

272
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,743
You said something weird just now.

273
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,703
What?

274
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,789
You said you liked me.

275
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,793
-What?
-HUISOO: You said I'm someone you like.

276
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,421
What kind of a confession is that?

277
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,137
I feel the same.

278
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,557
(chuckles)

279
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,061
(phone buzzes)

280
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,785
DEOKYOON: Is it confirmed?

281
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,870
Yes, it's confirmed.

282
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,998
They're both gifted.

283
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,543
Things here aren't going
the way we planned.

284
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,710
You must come at once.

285
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,631
JUNHWA: Right now, sir?

286
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,133
The parents are here.

287
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,343
DEOKYOON: Kim Doosik's wife
killed two of us.

288
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,430
-Mom?
-JUNHWA: I'll be right there.

289
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:01,940
You two.

290
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:03,900
Don't follow me.

291
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,485
What's going on?

292
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:07,988
(gunshot)

293
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,707
(panting)

294
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,792
(tense music)

295
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,132
(yelling)

296
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,407
-(grunting)
-(debris thumping)

297
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,787
JAEMAN: Ganghoon, don't do that.

298
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,498
Stop it.

299
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,876
That's going to hurt your hand.

300
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,300
(stomping)

301
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,892
(both grunting)

302
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,027
(Ganghoon shouting)

303
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,280
That's hurting you. Don't do it!

304
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,669
JAEMAN: Go on, Ganghoon.

305
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,925
(suspenseful music)

306
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,311
Huh?

307
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,025
I think the battery short-circuited.
It exploded due to overvoltage.

308
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,445
I replaced it,
so you won't have any trouble driving.

309
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,697
I see.

310
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,116
-Thank you.
-Sure.

311
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,587
Huisoo.

312
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,338
Huisoo.

313
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,506
Huisoo!

314
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,301
Wake up, Huisoo!

315
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,261
(crying)

316
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,101
(groaning)

317
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,940
That really hurt.

318
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,817
Are you okay, Huisoo?

319
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,695
Are you okay?

320
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,405
The blood...

321
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,617
-BONGSEOK: Are you okay, Huisoo?
-HUISOO: I'm fine.

322
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,243
-You need to go.
-Oh, no.

323
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,078
-You have to go to your mom.
-You're bleeding.

324
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,038
Bongseok.

325
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,206
Kim Bongseok!

326
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,501
I'm really fine.

327
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,295
Go to your mom.

328
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,964
I'll catch up with you.

329
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,322
(epic music)

330
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,869
(grunting)

331
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,918
Whoa!
(grunts)

332
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,256
(breathes heavily)

333
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,353
(epic music)

334
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,402
(wind gusting)

335
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,591
(electricity buzzing)

336
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,221
Bongseok...

337
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,515
and Huisoo?

338
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,897
Father.

339
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,777
I'm going to protect you...

340
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,740
until...

341
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,785
the end.

342
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,080
Father.

343
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,124
-GANGHOON: Father!
-Ganghoon.

344
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,086
ILHWAN: Your father will be okay.

345
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,255
Let's take you out of the building.

346
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,340
No.

347
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,221
(suspenseful music)

348
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,562
(grunts)

349
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,069
You're fucked now.

350
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,157
(grunts)

351
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,999
(groaning)

352
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,421
That bastard lost his juice.

353
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:01,966
Thank you.

354
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:10,725
Your son saved my daughter.
I'm thanking you for that.

355
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,103
Your son grew up well.

356
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,566
My Ganghoon.

357
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,488
(foreboding music)

358
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,787
(yelling)

359
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,171
(whimpering)

360
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,761
(both grunting)

361
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,939
(whimpering)

362
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,319
(shouting in pain)

363
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,122
-(Jaeman grunting)
-(Jaeseok groaning)

364
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,709
(approaching footsteps)

365
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,793
(sighs)

366
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,961
JUWON: I'm so sick of this.

367
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,965
(yelling)

368
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,090
How many more are there?

369
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,178
What are you going to do?

370
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,805
I'm going to...

371
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,767
kill all of you.

372
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,896
You monster.

373
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,817
Let me ask you one thing.

374
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,654
Why are you...

375
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,282
trying to kill all of us?

376
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,703
I'll become a monster anytime...

377
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,875
if it's to protect my child.

378
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,258
(groaning)

379
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:50,802
Finally.

380
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,973
It'll all be over.

381
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,809
But...

382
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,147
before that...

383
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,233
(gunshot)

384
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:17,620
END OF SERVICE

385
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,252
(whimpers)

386
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,045
-(Huisoo gasps)
-(tires screech)

387
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,427
-Hey!
-I'm sorry.

388
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,012
What happened to you?

389
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,391
I have to go to school. Sorry!

390
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,601
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

391
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,103
Huisoo!

JEONGWON HIGH SCHOOL

393
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,403
(suspenseful music)

394
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,594
(groans)

395
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,438
-(grunting)
-(choking)

396
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,073
(panting)

397
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,037
(suspenseful music)

398
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,417
(yells)

399
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,952
(Jaeman grunting)

400
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,890
(yells)

401
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,616
GUARD 1: Lim Jaeseok,
you're released. Come out.

402
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,579
Stop fiddling around. Come out already.

403
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,746
JAESEOK: I don't want to go.

404
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,456
I told you.

405
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,168
I'm not gifted.
I don't know anything about that.

406
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,211
I don't want to leave this place.

407
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,547
What's wrong with him?

408
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,341
He was in the basement cell
since he was a child.

409
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,136
And he's been living in the dark
by himself for over 20 years.

410
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,847
GUARD 1: His eyesight deteriorated,
so he can't stand the light.

411
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,182
And he's afraid of the outside.

412
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,933
JAESEOK: He's right.

413
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,935
I like it here.

414
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,274
Please don't kick me out of here.

415
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,193
I like it here.

416
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,238
Whenever you finish your assignment,
I'll let you return here.

417
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,450
No, thank you. I like it here.

418
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:48,331
The outside is so bright. It's terrifying.

419
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,708
-I can't open my eyes.
-Lim Jaeseok.

420
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,044
You'll be shot
if you refuse the party's command.

421
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,128
GUARD 1: Come out already!

422
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,974
(Jaeseok breathing shakily)

423
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,148
YONGDEUK: My name is Kwon Yongdeuk.

424
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,567
Let's...

425
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,779
live on.

426
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,153
We have an assignment. Come on out.

427
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,998
YONGDEUK: You'll be okay now.

428
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,105
-(Jaeman grunts)
-Yongdeuk!

429
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,156
Live.

435
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,074
What's going on?

436
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,956
COP: Isn't that near Jeongwon High?

437
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,792
Hey, it is Jeongwon High.

438
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:20,918
Report it.

439
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,503
Hang on.

440
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,921
This is M1.

441
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,464
Requesting checkup on Jeongwon High.

442
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,926
-KISOO: Oh!
-(Han Byul whimpering)

443
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,845

00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:37,935
It's all right.

449
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,081
Aah!

450
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,251
Hey!

451
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,129
Wake up!

464
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,300
I'm fine.

465

Let's get out of school grounds.

466

(Juwon groaning)

467
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,067
Hurry!

473
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,090
-Father.
-Let's go home.

474
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,679
Let's go home.
