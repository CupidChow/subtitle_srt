00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:05,005
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,967
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,680
DOOSIK: Let me ask you something.

4
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,767
Do you know
what the opposite of ladyfingers is?

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,978
(soft music)

6
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,772
MIHYUN: The opposite of ladyfingers?

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:23,773
DOOSIK: Think about it.

8
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,279
-Mentos.
-(Mihyun gasps)

9
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:35,577
MOVING

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,914
(Mihyun chuckles softly)

11
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,882
MIHYUN: Can I ask you something too?

12
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,134
I've been wondering about it.

13
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,219
DOOSIK: Sure. What is it?

14
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,307
MIHYUN: How can you fly?

15
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,519
That's...

16
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,813
just how I was born.

17
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,232
My body floated ever since I was born.

18
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,903
But floating and flying are different.

19
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,239
Is there a way you can fly well?

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,534
How do you walk well?

21
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,537
There's no such thing as walking well.
You just walk.

22
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,499
Left foot, right foot.
Then left foot again.

23
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:26,127
Exactly, if the right foot doesn't follow
the left foot, you'll fall.

24
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,047
I'm the same.

25
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,510
I couldn't fly well at first.

26
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,471
I was afraid of falling.

27
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,724
I bet it was scary.

28
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,851
That's why I couldn't fly well.

29
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:46,147
I got scared of falling
before I could even fly.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,569
No matter how high or far you fly,

31
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,905
you're bound to fall at some point.

32
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:55,907
But...

33
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,744
gliding as you come down
would still count as flying.

34
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,456
It's not flying itself that matters,

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,959
but how well you fall.

36
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,923
That's why flying well...

37
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,801
means falling well.

38
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,565
(soft music continues)

39
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,082
We're going through this trouble
because of Bungaeman.

40
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,334
It's good exercise.

41
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,343
-(ominous music)
-(wind whistling)

42
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,894
HUISOO: Hello, Mr. Choi Ilhwan
of Jeongwon High told me to--

43
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,855
Yes, I was notified. You can go inside.

44
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,772
BONGSEOK: Thank you.

45
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,695
This place is really nice.
Is it okay to use it all by yourself?

46
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,114
HUISOO: Yeah, our teacher got permission.

47
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,533
BONGSEOK (exclaims):
It's much nicer than our school.

48
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,243
Our school is nice too.

49
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,037
(Huisoo scoffs)

50
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,997
What is it?

51
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,625
I keep saying "our."

52
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,084
What's wrong with that?

53
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,045
I guess I'm starting to like our school.

54
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,130
Our school is so run-down though.

55
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,965
I mean that I like our teacher.

56
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,551
He doesn't act like it,
but he's very considerate.

57
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,844
BONGSEOK: That's true.

58
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,639
-I'm glad I transferred here.
-What?

59
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,265
I like our teacher...

60
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,101
and you too.

61
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,144
(Bongseok clears throat)

62
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,439
(splutters)
Is there anything I can help you with?

63
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,275
No. I'm going to run to warm up.

64
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,944
(bag zips)

65
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,198
What are you doing?

66
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,033
Cheering you on.

67
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,369
Standing like that?

68
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,332
I'm sending you my well-wishes.
Did you receive it?

69
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,416
Do you need more?

70
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,043
(soft chuckle)

71
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,798
You got this.

72
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,927
You got this!

73
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,723
(soft chuckle)

74
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,809
Gosh.

75
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,940
(panting)

76
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:56,671
DUNCHON SPORTS CENTER

77
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,729
(ominous music)

78
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,670
(soft chuckle)

79
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,506
Hello.

80
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:57,940
(panting)

81
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,490
Hey kid.

82
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,867
You run well.

83
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,913
How much did you run?

84
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,415
Who are you?

85
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,960
If an adult asks you a question,
you should answer.

86
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,003
How much did you run?

87
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,049
I ran about ten laps.

88
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,884
(puffs)

89
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,930
Each lap looks to be around 200 m.

90
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,349
You do run very well.

91
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,978
Who are you? I have permission to be here.

92
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,316
Let me check something.

93
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,568
-(gasps, whimpers)
-(grunts)

94
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,238
-(Huisoo screaming)
-(tense music)

95
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,452
(groaning)

96
00:06:59,001 --> 00:06:59,836
Hmm?

97
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,842
(door rattling)

98
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,262
BONGSEOK: Huisoo!

99
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,555
The door's locked!

100
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,933
(Huisoo panting)

101
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,644
I guess you can't fly.

102
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,729
(mutters)

103
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,730
(shouts)
What the hell?

104
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,065
(trills)

105
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,692
(Huisoo yelling)

106
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,821
(suspenseful music)

107
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,870
You're not strong either.

108
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,038
(grunts)

109
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,459
(Huisoo grunts, groans)

110
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,544
-(Huisoo groaning)
-(banging on door)

111
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,213
Huisoo! Huisoo!

112
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,719
(panting)

113
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,934
(breathing heavily)

114
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,695
So... you have the ability to heal.

115
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,157
(panting)

116
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,710
All right.

117
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,339
-Let go of me!
-Let's check again!

118
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,507
(Huisoo screams)

119
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,218
(grunting)

120
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,474
(gasps)

121
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,643
HUISOO (whimpers): Let go of me!

122
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,270
(suspenseful music continues)

123
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,985
(breathing heavily)

124
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,074
Your dad once told me that flying well...

125
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,661
just means falling well.

126
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,665
So Bongseok,

127
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,085
when you really must fly,

128
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,213
don't be afraid of falling.

129
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,054
(breathing deeply)

130
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:19,976
All right.

131
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,686
Let's check one last time.

132
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,814
(Huisoo screams)

133
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,701
(grunts)

134
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,414
(Bongseok shouting)

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,670
(shouts)
Huisoo!

136
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,132
(epic music)

137
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,051
(both grunt)

138
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,309
(Bongseok panting)

139
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,605
(grunting)

140
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,214
(fireworks crackling)

141
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:38,012
EPISODE 17: AWAKENING

142
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:47,229
(both panting)

143
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,524
Bongseok.

144
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,276
I didn't...

145
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,695
just float.

146
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,864
You flew.

147
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,493
I flew.

148
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,589
That one has the ability to fly.

149
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,782
Pardon me,

150
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,326
but where are you from?

151
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,582
Yanbian.

152
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,130
Your accent isn't that of the Northeast.

153
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,424
(tense music)

154
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,010
MIHYUN: Where are you from?

155
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,139
(sighs)

156
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,354
Pyongyang.

157
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,274
(tense music continues)

158
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,903
(both grunting)

159
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,536
Ah.

160
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,705
You're good.

161
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,334
You aren't a North Korean defector,
are you?

162
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,755
Why are you here?

163
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,216
(both grunting)

164
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,011
-Then why are you here?
-(grunts)

165
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,388
What are you snooping around for?

166
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,188
-(cleaner groans)
-(pants)

167
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,939
(trills)

168
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,030
(suspenseful music)

169
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,325
You aren't alone.

170
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,913
(cleaner groans)

171
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,794
(groaning)

172
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,927
(pants)

173
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,615
(trills)

174
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,077
-(door opens)
-(footsteps approaching)

175
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,787
JAEHAK: Hey.

176
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,376
Which unit?

177
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,170
South Korean dispatch
under the security department.

178
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,463
You?

179
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,341
Special abilities division
under Supreme Guard Command.

180
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,634
(grumbles)

181
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,011
That fucking bitch.

182
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,807
It's a mess in here.

183
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,936
She ran away.
(panting)

184
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,020
Who did?

185
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,188
The parent of a gifted kid.

186
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,274
A parent?

187
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,359
We must catch her.

188
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,944
She seemed to be looking for the files.

189
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,781
She must still be in the school.

190
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,253
Did you kill him?

191
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,798
He was getting in my way.

192
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,093
Isn't your mission to find the files?

193
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,097
CLEANER: Killing everyone who's involved
is also my mission.

194
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,852
Did you not know...

195
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,188
that someone was watching you?

196
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,358
No.

197
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,281
Who are you?

198
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,577
(suspenseful music)

199
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,304
Go to South Korea.

200
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,851
The security department already got intel

201
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,481
that South Korea is training
the next generation of gifted ones.

202
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,781
It took a long time
to find out their base.

203
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,993
In order to collect intel,

204
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,621
I've planted a top agent
from our security department.

205
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,376
I told her to simply find some proof,

206
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,296
but she stumbled across the schemes
of those South Korean bastards.

207
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,760
Go to the South and join her.

208
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,845
What is the proof?

209
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,975
They're files with the information
on training the young gifted ones.

210
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,268
What's my mission?

211
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,397
Destroy their plan to train the gifted.

212
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,774
Clean up everybody that's involved

213
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,110
and bring that file to me.

214
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,156
(tense music)

215
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,663
Who are you?

216
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,416
Where are the files on the students?

217
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,547
The files on the potentially gifted.

218
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,466
You call them ones with powers.

219
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,099
Hand it over.

220
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,565
(tense music continues)

221
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,156
What are you looking for?

222
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,576
I don't see that bitch.

223
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,091
I'll look for her.

224
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:32,760
No.

225
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,636
That bitch is mine.

226
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,890
You should take care of that.

227
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,980
Is he involved in this?

228
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,151
Anyone who is here right now
is involved in this.

229
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,362
All we have to do is kill them all.

230
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,076
(frustrated groan)
Where did this bitch go?

231
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,660
No.

232
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,164
We must see
what and how much they've trained.

233
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,596
(suspenseful music)

234
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,850
(gasps)

235
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,936
(cleaner gasps)

236
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,731
(cleaner grumbles)

237
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,112
(grunts)

238
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,169
POWER CONTROL ROOM

239
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,339
(trills)

240
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,227
(gasps)

241
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,564
(suspenseful music)

242
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,489
Why that fucking bitch.

243
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,830
What the hell is going on?

244
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,081
That scared me.

245
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:22,262
SEOUL GANGDEOK POLICE STATION

246
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:29,019
BUS DRIVER: How could the battery
break down when you were the one driving?

247
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,646
(bus driver sighs)

248
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,983
You aren't hurt, are you?

249
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,403
I'm glad no one was hurt.

250
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,907
I'll go to the office

251
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,160
and take care of the property damage
and passenger insurance claims.

252
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,286
Don't worry.

253
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,665
Make sure to drive safe
when you return the bus after it's fixed.

254
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,419
I'm sorry.

255
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,921
It's all right.

256
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,590
-Thank you.
-Okay.

257
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,220
-(phone buzzing)
-BUS DRIVER: Yes. I'm sorry, sir.

258
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,972
It's all sorted out here.

259
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,808
Gyedo will return the bus
once the repair work is done.

260
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,476
Yes. I'm so sorry.

261
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,852
Sorry for all the trouble.

262
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,235
Hand over the files.

263
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,823
You've been managing
kids with potential abilities.

264
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,209
The South Korean dogs really are helpless.

265
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,712
Who the hell are you?

266
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,423
Think carefully.

267
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,300
This will all be over
if you give me the files.

268
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,944
That's where you hid them?

269
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,121
KISOO: Is this it?

270
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,627
This doesn't seem like the file.

271
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:07,803
CHANIL: Hey.

272
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,680
Where is the study hall?

273
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:14,976
Here.

274
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,690
Did you just come from there?

275
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:22,901
Yes.

276
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,365
Stay right there.

277
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,585
MS. SHIN: Goodness.

278
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,089
It's snowing. You should come inside.

279
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,843
(splutters)
I'm fine.

280
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,678
(Ms. Shin sighs)

281
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,681
He said he'd be home early
now that the entrance exams are over.

282
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,060
I hope he's all right.

283
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,064
MS. SHIN (chuckles softly):
He's preparing for the civil servant exam.

284
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,649
He must be studying some more.

285
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,155
I'll give him a call so come inside.
(soft chuckle)

286
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,259
(phone buzzing)

287
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,887
MOM

288
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:33,930
Yes, Mom?

289
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,724
MS. SHIN (over phone):
Ganghoon, where are you?

290
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,892
GANGHOON: I'm still at--

291
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,018
Oh.

292
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,103
It is you.

293
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:42,981
Pardon?

294
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,001
You asked me who I was.

295
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,345
I'm not a South Korean dog. I'm a teacher.

296
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,806
Only teachers can see the student files.

297
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,477
Get out of our school!

298
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,813
(suspenseful music)

299
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,901
How dare you come in.

300
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,487
Didn't you hear the teacher?

301
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,741
If you take one more step,
I'll pull your ankle out.

302
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,038
Just try me.

303
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,792
KISOO: Where is it?

304
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,628
(sighs)

305
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,308
(papers rustling)

306
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,071
(sighs)

307
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,656
My goodness!

308
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,574
JAEHAK: Hey.

309
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,576
Do you go to this school?

310
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,704
Who are you?

311
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,248
If an adult asks you a question,
you should answer.

312
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,584
So who the hell are you?

313
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,711
(sighs, scoffs)

314
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,838
You're a very rude student.

315
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,423
What the hell is he saying?

316
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:33,967
What...

317
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,553
were you looking for in there?

318
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,348
What's it to you?

319
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,225
Were you looking for the files?

320
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,979
Your homeroom teacher teaches PE,
doesn't he?

321
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,108
So he does.

322
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,737
(exclaims, grunting)

323
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,198
What is your ability?

324
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,369
Fuck this!

325
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,459
(groaning)

326
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,587
(tense music)

327
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,174
(Ganghoon groans)

328
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,342
(Ganghoon groans over phone)

329
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,220
-Ganghoon.
-(Ganghoon groaning over phone)

330
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,014
MS. SHIN (gasps): Ganghoon!

331
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,559
Honey, Ganghoon is...
(sobbing)

332
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,645
What is it?

333
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,688
I think something happened to him.

334
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,981
Where is he?

335
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:30,899
He's at school.

336
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,027
I just heard him scream from...

337
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,323
-Honey!
-(panting)

338
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,244
(distant groaning)

339
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,162
We're testing.

340
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,374
We have no choice
since you're not handing over the files.

341
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,459
We just have to check them one by one.

342
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,254
The test might be a little rough
on the students.

343
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,050
Move!

344
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,179
(tense music)

345
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,188
(both grunting)

346
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,525
I told you I'll pull your ankle out.

347
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,904
(groaning)

348
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,096
I'll take care of things here,
so go to the students.

349
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,848
I'll catch up with you.

350
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,099
Okay.

351
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,396
You wait right there.

352
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,983
You're after this bastard.

353
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,528
(scoffs)
All right.

354
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,286
CLEANER:
Did you have fun playing hide-and-seek?

355
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,913
Did you find the files?

356
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,457
How much did you hear?

357
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,836
That you're going to kill
everyone that's involved.

358
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:16,963
Oh.

359
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,340
So you heard everything.

360
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,010
My son is one of them.

361
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,262
INDUSTRIAL OIL FILTER

362
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,726
(groans)

363
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,811
(body thuds)

364
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,153
Do something.

365
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,780
Aren't you gifted?

366
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,490
(panting)

367
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,659
You fucking bastard!

368
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,661
KISOO: Fuck!

369
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,747
(Kisoo yelling)

370
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,916
-Bang Kisoo.
-(Kisoo groans)

371
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,669
(groans)

372
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,754
JAEHAK: Get up.

373
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,423
(whimpering)

374
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,508
ILHWAN: Kisoo!

375
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:02,926
(Kisoo groans)

376
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,263
(grunting)

377
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,057
(yells)

378
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,770
Using a weapon is cheating.

379
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,648
(yelling)

380
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,576
(suspenseful music)

381
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,212
ILHWAN: Kisoo, don't come out here.
Stay in there.

382
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,713
(panting)

383
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,132
Mr. Choi.

384
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,721
-(Ilhwan groans)
-Mr. Choi.

385
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,685
Mr. Choi!

386
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,646
We need to call the police.

387
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,652
You can't call the police.

388
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,697
(Kisoo and Ilhwan yelp)

389
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,240
(phone pieces clattering)

390
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,244
Please spare him!

391
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,745
This student doesn't know anything.

392
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,123
I'm the one who knows everything!

393
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,875
He doesn't know anything!

394
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,547
Hand over the files.

395
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,508
-(Juwon and Yongdeuk grunting)
-(thudding)

396
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,857
(Juwon grunts)

397
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,404
(panting)

398
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,490
(phone ringing)

399
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,206
I found them. What should I do?

400
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,334
See how good they are
and report back to me.

401
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,386
(grunting)

402
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,972
DEOKYOON: I'll be waiting.

403
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,390
Yes, sir.

404
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,645
(Juwon grunting)

405
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,287
Did you think
we were simply doing nothing?

406
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,834
South Korea isn't the only place
that has people with powers.

407
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,004
(groans)

408
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,593
In our republic, we have
the People's Special Abilities Corps.

409
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,852
(pants)

410
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,064
(groans)

411
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,029
Are you okay?

412
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,782
Yes, I'm totally fine.

413
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,411
Who is that?

414
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:17,954
I don't know.

415
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,248
But I'm going to kill him.

416
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,793
(shouts)
Hey! Get down here!

417
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,922
All right. I'll come down.

418
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,386
(tense music)

419
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:46,858
BONGSEOK (whispers): What do we do now?

420
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,945
-HUISOO (whispers): I don't know.
-What?

421
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,781
What will you do now?

422
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,661
I've fought 17 to 1.

423
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,830
This time it's two to one.

424
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,332
BOTH: We got this.

425
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,500
(both yell)

426
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,713
HUISOO: Bongseok, be careful!

427
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,840
(suspenseful music)

428
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,550
(screams, groans)

429
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,593
(gasps)

430
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,100
You bastard!

431
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,395
(Huisoo grunting)

432
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,481
(Bongseok coughing)

433
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,400
(Huisoo shouting)

434
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,322
(panting)

435
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,284
What are you going to do?

436
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,202
Get down.

437
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,538
(shouts)
Get down here, you bastard!

438
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,501
(grunting)

439
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,377
(Bongseok yells)

440
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,050
(gasps)

441
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,056
(groans)

442
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,517
Bongseok.

443
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,773
Hey, you!
(grumbles)

444
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,238
-(Huisoo grunts)
-BONGSEOK: Huisoo!

445
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,828
(whimpering)

446
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,497
(groans)

447
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:36,968
(grunting)

448
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,891
Do you know why we ended up like this?

449
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,480
It's all
because of you South Korean bastards.

450
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,733
Kim Doosik.

451
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,279
It's because of him.

452
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,031
-DEOKYOON: Kim Doosik.
-(gasps)

453
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,366
It's because of him.

454
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,710
(tense breathing)

455
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,175
MY SON

456
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,469
(line ringing)

457
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,640
(phone buzzing)

458
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,804
(suspenseful music)

459
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,523
