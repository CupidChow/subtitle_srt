6
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,077
We've got to figure out the password
for Dr. Kang's briefcase by today.

7
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,121
JUWON: Can we get it done?

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,873
Hey, Juwon.

9
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:40,790
Yes?

10
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,667
Isn't the night view amazing?

11
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,045
It's wonderful.

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:51,092
Good for you.
You get to enjoy this view all the time.

13
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,180
But what's the operation about
that you're gearing up?

14
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,390
It's not for an operation.

15
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,560
I just felt sorry for seeing
this wonderful night view alone.

16
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,062
What?

17
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:02,979
Oh?

18
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,734
Mr. Kim, what are you...

22
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,385
RUSSIAN AGENT (in Russian):
That suitcase alone is useless.

23
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,304
We need the password.

24
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:40,600
Tell him to give us the password
if you want to earn some money.

25
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,816
(in Korean)
Dr. Kang, give me the password right now.

26
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,071
If I tell you that right now,
you're just going to kill me.

27
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,156
I'll tell you
once I'm back in North Korea.

28
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,122
I'll give you three seconds.

29
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,751
Did you have enough of the night view?

30
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,128
What?

31
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,213
Yeah! Please, let's go back now!

32
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,216
Go back where? It's time to work.

33
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,136
What?

34
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,262
Three.

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,264
DOOSIK: Just like what we always do.

36
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,891
I'll shoot from above,
and you do your thing on the ground.

37
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,476
What?

38
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,603
Just do what we always do.

39
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,565
Oh, what we always do? Okay.

40
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,650
Two.

41
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,571
Let's begin.

42
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,531
Whoa!
(screams)

43
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,616
Kim Doosik!

44
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,034
(screaming continues)

45
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,620
Look how he's addressing me
when he's distressed.

46
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,248
He needs more training.

47
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,833

00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,895

(groaning)

74
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,622
Comrade.

75
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,416
Get up.

76
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,878
Are you okay?

77
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,758
He's okay.

78
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,803
No, it hurts. I'm not okay.

79
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,846
I'm fine.

80
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,974
And only I get to say that I'm okay.

81
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,642
You have no right.

82
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,810
(groans)

83
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,398
Dr. Kang.

84
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,444
We escorted your family
safely to South Korea.

85
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,280
Did you really?

86
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,950
Will you come to South Korea with me?

87
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,538
How can I trust you?

88
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,920
This is not about trust.

89
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,464
It's a choice.

90
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,015
Mr. Kim.

91
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,558
Here, take this helmet.

92
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,103
It'll be tough to carry
the two of us at once,

93
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,062
but you can do it!

94
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,522
Two?

95
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,566
It's too heavy to carry...

96
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,985
two people at a time.

97
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,028
Hm?

98
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,197
Huh?

99
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,995
-I'll see you in Seoul.
-What?

100
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,539
(Dr. Kang exclaims)

101
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,416
Hey!

102
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,583
Don't do this!

103
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,793
Mr. Kim, come on.

104
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,254
JUWON: You're just playing around

105
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,339
because I called you
by your full name, right?

106
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,007
Come back down!

107
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,011
How do you expect me
to go to Seoul from Russia?

108
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,514
I can't even find my way to my house!

109
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,557
Oh!

110
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,143
Hey, Kim Doosik!

111
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,436
That darn...

112
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,855
(yelling)

113
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,649
Give me my helmet back!

VENDOR (in Cantonese):
Here are your dumplings.

117
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,606
Please enjoy.

118
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,737
(groans softly)

119
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,958
Won't it leave a scar
if you don't remove it soon?

120
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:21,876
Here.

121
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,180
You always carry this with you
when you don't even use knives.

122
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,224
It's from my late father.

123
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,394
But can I use it for this?

124
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,940
I don't let just anyone use it.

125
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,284
(Juwon groaning)

126
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,121

127
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:11,842

I'm going to assign you an important task.

133
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,172
The most elite black agent of the ANSP.

134
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,175
You have to get close to him
without him noticing.

135
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,638
MIHYUN: I'm Lee Mihyun,
Information Management Division.

136
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,764
I'm Kim Doosik.

137
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,099
It's Deputy Director Min, isn't it?

138
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,980
Let's just say you didn't fail.
That way, I can continue to see you.

139
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:09,942
Mr. Kim?

140
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,111
(gasps)

141
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,613
MIHYUN: Thank you.

142
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,990
Thank you for telling me your secret.

143
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,201
I'm telling you my secret right now.

144
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,078

146
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,048
YONGJUN: Moonsan,
this is a top-secret assignment.

147
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,430
Why did you come?

148
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,682
I thought I might die.

149
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,982
Listen carefully.

150
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,485
This is a new mission.

When Kim Doosik returns,

153
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,825
we need to capture him alive.

154
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,830
Think of your father...

155
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,334
and cooperate.

157
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,549
I'm his partner.

158
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,301
Mr. Min will see him alone.

159
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,805
Juwon, just have a cup of coffee.

160
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,351

00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,524
Why did you go off the grid
without reporting to me?

189
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,652
Report right now.

190
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,238
What happened up North?

191
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,202
Did you succeed or fail?

192
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,664
The result is the same.

193
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,292
What matters is whether
the operation succeeded.

194
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,213
-What matters is that it was ordered.
-Tell me what happened right now.

195
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,215
If you want a report,

196
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,470
may I report the order you gave me
to the Blue House?

197
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,306
-What? You little...
-I'm guessing they're in the dark.

198
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,891
YONGJUN: Hey, Kim Doosik!

199
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,435
You're an ANSP agent!

200
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,520
Are you saying you'll betray us?

201
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,939
You know how we deal with--

202
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:04,857
Min Yongjun.

203
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,775
(tense music)

204
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,446
I'm the one who was betrayed.

205
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,620
So, how does it feel to be betrayed?

206
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,878
I'll take care of Lee Mihyun myself.

207
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,717
I will exist on my own terms.

208
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,136
What?

209
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,637
I'm going to live

210
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,849
and let both the North and South
chase me down.

211
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,227
(suspenseful music)

212
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,353
-(gunshots)
-(yells)

213
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,314
(grunts)

214
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,815
(gunshots)

215
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,446
(groaning)

216
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,491
(whimpers)

217
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,786
(groans)

218
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,539
What... What are you doing?

219
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,836
Don't shoot.

220
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,754
Hold your fire.

221
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,382
-STAFF 1: What's going on?
-STAFF 2: Where did that sound come from?

222
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,342
STAFF 3: What is it?

223
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,052
(staff clamoring)

224
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,595
AGENT 4: Move in!

225
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,350
-Let's talk it out.
-(gunshots)

226
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,185
Get him!

227
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,146
-(Yongjun screams)
-Oh!

228
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,066
Mr. Min...

229
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,818
Mr. Min!

230
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,614
YONGJUN: Drop your guns!

231
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,242
Put your guns down, you idiots!

232
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,201
MIHYUN: It's him.

233
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,413
YONGJUN: Don't shoot!

234
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,873
-Don't shoot!
-WOONKYU: Don't shoot!

235
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,334
-YONGJUN: You might shoot me!
-WOONKYU: Mr. Min might be shot!

236
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,961
You might shoot me!

237
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,172
-Don't shoot!
-MIHYUN: He could've just disappeared.

238
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,093
But he returned because of me.

239
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,469
(crowd screams)

240
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,263
Because if he had just disappeared,

241
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,015
everyone was going to be after me.

242
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,978
He risked the danger of coming back...

243
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,938
-(whimpers)
-...for me.

244
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:14,236
To deny our relationship
in front of all these people.

245
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,487
Lee Mihyun!

246
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,243
STAFF 4: Lee Mihyun?
Why is he calling her?

247
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,621
MIHYUN: Mr. Kim Doosik.

248
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,958
It was so unfortunate of you...

249
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,420
to meet me.

250
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,800
(soft music)

251
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,740
(Yongjun whimpering)

252
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,451
-(gunshots)
-(crowd screaming)

253
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,085
WOONKYU: Mr. Min!

254
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,837
-(Woonkyu screaming)
-(breathes nervously)

255
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,936
(breathes shakily)

256
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,357
(dramatic music)

257
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:43,992
WOONKYU: Mr. Min!

258
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,955
What are you waiting for? Move!

259
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,414
Go after him!

260
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,085
I know everything.

261
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,546
Threaten me with this gun
and slip through.

262
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,966
(Mihyun sobs)

263
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,348
And give my knife to Guryongpo.

264
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,476
DOOSIK: He will help you.

265
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,192
(somber music)

266
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,613
(sobs)

267
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,682
Contact the strike force again.

268
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,599
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

269
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,352
-AGENT 5: We're heading to headquarters.
-AGENT 6: Yes, sir.

270
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,692
Juwon, just have a cup of coffee.

271
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,486
Like what we always do.

272
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,574
(gunshot)

273
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,376
(gun thuds)

274
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,715
STAFF 5: Mr. Min is asking for you.

275
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,638
I have a favor to ask.

276
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,016
Like what we always do.

277
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,983
(tense music)

278
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,604
(tense music continues)

279
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,389
JUWON: "Like what we always do."

280
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,559
That was our last assignment.

281
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,729
Just like that, he left.

282
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,317
We were both called monsters.

283
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,694
He was my colleague...

284
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,655
and partner.

285
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:11,908
AGENT 7: Mr. Min.

286
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,827
-We found him.
-AGENT 8: Sir, are you all right?

287
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,829
-We're with the Blue House...
-MIHYUN: The next day,

288
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,415
the military police
rescued Deputy Director Min.

289
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,625
-(dog barks)
-AGENT 8: Mr. Min, are you all right?

290
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,796
-MIHYUN: He was found near the Blue House.
-YONGJUN: Get me down!

291
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,549
Get me down right now!

292
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,761
MIHYUN: Since the incident couldn't be
fully explained to the Blue House,

293
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,555
Deputy Director Min was demoted.

294
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,765
As for Kim Doosik...

295
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,895
he had disappeared.

296
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,900
The ANSP with its absolute power

297
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,443
eventually diminished.

298
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,948
And like that, the barbaric era passed.

299
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,492
DECEASED: LEE HAESONG
CHIEF MOURNER: LEE MIHYUN

300
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,769
MIHYUN: I became completely alone.

301
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,272
My father had passed away,

302
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:29,653
and I was finally freed from the agency.

303
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,367
He did not return.

304
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,393
I missed him.

305
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,778
Since the ANSP was downsized,

306
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,239
I was able to transfer
to another organization.

307
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,783
CHIEF: Let's call it a day.

308
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,702
-EMPLOYEE 1: Good work everyone.
-EMPLOYEE 2: Yes, sir.

309
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,287
-LEADER: Good work today.
-Good work.

310
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,332
I have a request, sir.

311
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,250
What is it?

312
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,627
Could I move to another desk?

313
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,545
CHIEF: To which one?

314
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,631
To the empty desk by the window.

315
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,593
CHIEF: We left it empty,
because it's too visible from the outside.

316
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,011
Will that be okay with you?

317
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,972
(chief chuckles)

318
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,098
CHIEF: All right, then.

319
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,975
-Thank you.
-CHIEF: No problem.

320
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:46,062
MIHYUN: I had the life I wanted.

321
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,900
I returned to my everyday life

322
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,155
but he did not return.

323
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,829
EMPLOYEE 3: Jjamppong for the team leader
and donkatsu for Mihyun.

324
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,957
What? Chinese restaurants
now deliver donkatsu, too?

325
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,752
They even deliver kimchi fried rice
these days.

326
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,797
EMPLOYEE 4: I see.
They deliver all kinds of food now.

327
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,550
LEADER: All right,
please enjoy your meals.

328
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,593
EMPLOYEE 3: Enjoy your meal.

329
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,011
-EMPLOYEE 4: Enjoy.
-LEADER: Thanks.

330
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,096
(soft music)

331
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,852
Are you looking at the flowers?

332
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,936
Yes.

333
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,814
We're going to a café.
Why don't you join us for coffee?

334
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,024
I already have one.

335
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,025
(exclaims)

336
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,402
Not the ones from the vending machine,
a brewed one.

337
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,613
Everyone drinks Americanos these days.

338
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,033
I prefer the ones from vending machines.

339
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,077
See you later, then.

340
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,842
MIHYUN: I developed a habit
of looking out the window.

341
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,553
CHIEF: All right. It's six o'clock.

342
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,306
Let's clock out on time
as government workers should.

343
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,600
-EMPLOYEE 5: Good work, everyone!
-EMPLOYEE 6: Good work today!

344
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,560
-EMPLOYEE 7: See you tomorrow.
-EMPLOYEE 8: Goodbye.

345
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,562
-EMPLOYEE 9: Let's go.
-EMPLOYEE 10: Okay.

346
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,147
Ms. Lee, aren't you clocking out?

347
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,149
MIHYUN: I'll stay a bit longer.

348
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,610
Don't overwork yourself, and go home soon.

349
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,737
-MIHYUN: Thank you.
-Good work.

350
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,781
EMPLOYEE 11: Let's go.

351
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,576
(door closes)

352
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,079
(Mihyun sighs)

353
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:42,846
MIHYUN: I developed a habit
of looking up at the sky.

354
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:50,311
JINMYUNG REAL ESTATE AGENCY

355
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,731
-MAN 1: This is it.
-ANCHOR: This is the nine o'clock news.

356
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,899
The Agency for National Security Planning

357
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,110
is being renamed
as the National Intelligence Service.

358
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,320
Its motto, "We work in the shadows

359
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,780
-to protect the sunlit land..."
-Hey.

360
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:04,117
-...has become "Information is our power."
-I used to work at the ANSP.

361
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,370
As a means to improve the public image
of the new government...

362
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,248
This is top secret.

363
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:15,044
One of the ANSP agents I saw at the time

364
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:19,507
had the ability to fly
and shoot guns from the air, and...

365
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,843
How can a person fly?

366
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,011
Gosh.

367
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,597
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Come on.

368
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,391
-But I saw it with my own two eyes.
-Goodness.

369
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,436
No one's going to believe
the words of a security guard.

370
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,395
-Right?
-Exactly.

371
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,940
Oh, come on. I almost believed you.

372
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,445
-MAN 2: What's with you?
-MAN 3: Luck is on my side today.

373
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,280
MAN 4: I'm completely cleaned out.

374
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:46,242
-MAN 3: Today's dinner...
-But he really did fly in the sky.

375
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,454
-MAN 4: Hurry up. I need to win.
-...in short, they will be called NIS.

376
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,807
(sighs)

377
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,406
(approaching footsteps)

378
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,249
(calm music)

379
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,565
I looked for you in the sky.

380
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,651
But you came on foot.

381
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,156
Do you remember?

382
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,870
I said I wanted to show you

383
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,248
the white world from the sky
when it snowed.

384
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,129
Show me.

385
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,809
(whimsical music)

386
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,916
(amused gasps)

387
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,254
(chuckles)

388
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,971
(cooing)

389
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,349
-You're in a new diaper now.
-Does it feel good?

390
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,142
What's wrong? Did he go again?

391
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,233
MIHYUN: Were you hungry, sweetheart?

392
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,736
-DOOSIK: What upset you?
-(baby Bongseok crying)

393
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,196
-What made you upset?
-What is it?

394
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,615
Bongseok.

395
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,202
(both chuckle)

396
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,287
(light music)

397
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,235
DOOSIK: You didn't have to come out.

398
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,778
What about Bongseok?

399
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,405
He's doing just fine on his own.

400
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,033
Here's a cold shake for you.

401
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,579
-(groaning)
-(chuckles)

402
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,709
I guess farming is hard
even for a legendary elite black agent.

403
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,169
(groans)

404
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,631
If anyone claims
that farming is good for killing time,

405
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,050
I'm going to shoot them.

406
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,677
(both laughing)

407
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,303
Hold me steady.

408
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,598
Ahh.

409
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,269
This is perfectly ripe. Here you go.

410
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,564
(whimpering)

411
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,694
Goodness, you're awake again.

412
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,279
You need to sleep some more.

413
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,323
Gosh. There, there.

414
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,742
DOOSIK: All right.

415
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,536
There's this thing called
the miracle of 100 days.

416
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,413
They're supposed to stop crying
after 100 days.

417
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:04,167
Ms. Lee, your son
is more than 200 days old.

418
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,045
(Mihyun sighs)
Then they're all lies.

419
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,131
Mihyun, it's hard to raise a child,
isn't it?

420
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,008
(yawns)

421
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,345
I finished the agent training course
with top scores.

422
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,639
Sure, 54th year.

423
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,724
(sighs)

424
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,560
This is harder than the fourth week
of winter ranger training.

425
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,688
(both laugh)

426
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,483
DOOSIK: Say "Mommy."

427
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,902
-"Mommy."
-MIHYUN: Peekaboo.

428
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,196
-Bongseok, say "Mommy."
-Peekaboo.

429
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,530
-"Mommy."
-Peekaboo.

430
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,615
(cooing)

431
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,533
-DOOSIK: Say "Mommy."
-(Mihyun chuckles)

432
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,203
(gibbering)

433
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,206
Say "Daddy, Mom..."

434
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,916
(baby Bongseok crying)

435
00:34:56,177 --> 00:35:00,014
(crying intensifies)

436
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,175
(sighs)

437
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,308
-REPORTER: On June 14th, at 11:10 p.m...
-DOOSIK: Don't eat the spoon.

438
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,310
...the leaders of the two Koreas

439
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,354
signed the North-South Joint Declaration,

440
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,857
which marks a milestone
in the history of the Korean Peninsula.

441
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,067
President Kim Daejung
of the Republic of Korea

442
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,819
and the National
Defense Chairman Kim Jongil

443
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,029
of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.

444
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:02,034
The two leaders joined hands
and raised them with big smiles.

445
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:56,839
OFFICE OF PLANNING AND DECISIONS

446
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,199
Hello, Deputy Director Min.

447
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,455
I'm still just a section chief.

448
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,541
You told us not to let anyone in.

449
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,669
So it hasn't been cleaned yet.

450
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,045
Forget it.

451
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,047
Call everyone in.

452
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,299
Everyone, sir?

453
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,135
Except for Guryongpo.

454
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,938
AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY PLANNING
5TH DEPUTY DIRECTOR MIN YONGJUN

455
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,114
We'll begin again.

456
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,324
(trilling)

457
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,242
What is it?

458
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,621
-(rat squeaking)
-(cans clank)

459
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,417
Nothing. I think it's a wild rat.

460
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,628
(sighs)

461
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,631
Should we move to another place?

462
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,425
Why?

463
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,594
This place is too remote from everything,

464
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,180
and he might feel suffocated,
stuck in this house.

465
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,141
We should live in a bigger house.

466
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,644
He's small, so it's all right for now.

467
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,982
Won't others think it's strange
that he never goes outside?

468
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,485
There are hardly any neighbors
in the area.

469
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,279
So it's fine.

470
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,075
And we shouldn't let our guard down yet.

471
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,954
Let's move after some time has passed.

472
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:54,957
Okay.

473
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,044
(exhales deeply)

474
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,297
When that time comes,
let's go to the outskirts of Seoul

475
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,174
and run a restaurant.

476
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,471
You can cook.
And I can clean and wash the dishes.

477
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,222
I can also do deliveries.

478
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,350
What kind of restaurant?

479
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,644
Donkatsu.

480
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,687
(chuckles)

481
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:17,938
It's your favorite.

482
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,274
You must be tired. Let's sleep.

483
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:24,820
(Mihyun sniffles)

484
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,198
Oh, right. Mihyun.

485
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:28,866
Hm?

486
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,245
I love you.

487
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:35,873
I know.

488
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:59,146
(giggling)

489
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,819
How about some spicy noodles?

490
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,736
Ah.

491
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,655
Sounds perfect.

492
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,408
I'll start cooking, so come in later.

493
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,369
Let me finish this up quickly.

494
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,495
Okay.

495
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,876
(chuckling)

496
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,382
Butterfly.

497
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,813
MIHYUN (in distance): Bongseok!

498
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:42,940
Bongseok!

499
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,859
Bongseok, where are you?

500
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,779
(panting)

501
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,865
Doosik!

502
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,242
MIHYUN (in distance): Bongseok!

503
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,202
Bongseok, where are you?

504
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,248
(gasps)

505
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,209
Bongseok is gone.

506
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,129
I don't think anyone broke into the house.

507
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,256
But the gate is open.

508
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,800
Where did he...

509
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,095
Okay, Mihyun. Calm down.

510
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,555
Calm down.

511
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,231
(epic music)

512
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,621
DOOSIK: Bongseok!

513
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,248
(thrilling music)

514
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,753
Bongseok!

515
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,094
DOOSIK: Bongseok!

516
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,100
Bongseok!

517
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,270
Bongseok!

518
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,772
-Bong--
-(young Bongseok crying)

519
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,778
(sighs)

520
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,407
YOUNG BONSEOK: Dad!

521
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,159
-Dad!
-Bongseok.

522
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,537
My boy. What are you doing here?

523
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,331
DOOSIK: Were you scared?

524
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,125
You were scared, weren't you?

525
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,169
You're all right.

526
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,172
(beeps)

527
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,051
(sighs)

528
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,511
Fortunately, he has no fever.

529
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,766
I guess he got scared of the height.

530
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,686
He's okay now.

531
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,147
Are you okay?

532
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,442
I'm fine.

533
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,612
You were always so calm.

534
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,991
DOOSIK: I've never seen you like that.

535
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,368
I guess you've been anxious all along.

536
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,581
MIHYUN: I tell myself
that everything is over.

537
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,376
But I guess I still feel uneasy.

538
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:16,051
(birds chirping)

539
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:22,975
CHEONGGYE OVERPASS DISAPPEARS INTO HISTORY

540
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:27,021
(young Bongseok gibbering)

541
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,939
(paper rustling)

542
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,201
DOOSIK: How may I help you?

543
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,579
RAEHYUK: I'd like to buy some apples.

544
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,873
DOOSIK: We only sell them wholesale.

545
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,338
RAEHYUK: I'm stopping by on my way
to my wife's family.

546
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,176
Just let me buy about 30,000 won worth.

547
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,385
DOOSIK: Well...

548
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,556
-Sure.
-RAEHYUK: Thanks.

549
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:05,893
Thank you.

550
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,854
Gosh, that's a lot.

551
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,695
Oh.

552
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,824
(grunts)

553
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,910
(tense music)

554
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,246
(rat squeaking)

555
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,749
(approaching footsteps)

556
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,344
(trilling)

557
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,016
Did something pass by?

558
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:46,975
(Mihyun shushes)

559
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,736
(trilling)

560
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,447
(approaching footsteps)

561
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,700
(whispers)
There are people approaching.

562
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:06,995
How many?

563
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,628
MIHYUN: Around 30.

564
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,671
(cocks gun)

565
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,095
MIHYUN: Three close by.

566
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,057
(approaching footsteps)

567
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,477
We're surrounded.

568
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,612
(tense music)

569
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,116
(cocks gun)

570
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,201
Doosik.

571
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,912
I'll distract them from the front.

572
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,706
Escape with Bongseok through the back.

573
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:51,832
Come with us.

574
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,042
They're here in the middle of the night.

575
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,503
That means they already know about us.

576
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,672
We can't all escape together.

577
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,965
Still, come with us.

578
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:00,924
(Doosik shushes)

579
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,428
They probably don't know
about Bongseok's ability.

580
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:10,058
We must not let them know
that he's like me.

581
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:13,479
Mihyun.

582
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,109
Do you know how my life has been?

583
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,905
I can't...

584
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,450
let our son live a life like mine.

585
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:31,413
You can't let anyone know, no matter what.

586
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,832
You have to keep him hidden.

587
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,170
Don't worry.

588
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:40,672
I'll join you soon.

589
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:47,346
When I give you the signal,
run and don't look back.

590
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,557
I'll find you no matter what.

591
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,490
(sniffles)

592
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,161
(suspenseful music)

593
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:27,803
(sighs)

594
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,099
Did Deputy Director Min send you?

595
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,896
Moonsan. I've heard a lot about you.

596
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,314
Let us escort you.

597
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,781
(grunting)

598
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,450
(gunshots)

599
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,455
(explosion)

600
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,876
SANGGU: Let's move!

601
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,878
(suspenseful music)

602
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,965
(gunshots)

603
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,407
(gunshots)

604
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,711
(Doosik groaning)

605
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,510
(yelling)

606
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,859
(electricity crackles)

607
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,829
(both grunting)

608
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,714
(foreboding music)

609
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,427
AGENT 9: Stay still!

610
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,223
(whimpers)

611
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,391
(screams)

612
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:44,231
(both grunting)

613
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,071
SANGGU: Search Team,
get back to the main force.

614
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,531
Get back right now!

615
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,328
(tense music)

616
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,344
Now.

617
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,515
(engine starts)

618
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,322
SANGGU: Stop.

619
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,783
The rats escaped.

620
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:40,996
(groans)

621
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,165
(sighs)

622
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,132
Let's stop now.

623
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,145
You screwed me over again.

624
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,231
You fucker.

625
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,348
What time does the next bus come?

626
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,016
It comes every 30 minutes.

627
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,519
-Thank you for the food.
-All right.

628
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,451
I need my receipt.

629
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,703
RESTAURANT OWNER: Sure.

630
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,789
(closing theme music)
