00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,262
(line ringing)

10
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,764
MOTEL OWNER (over phone): Hello?

11
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,265
This is room 408.

12
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,768
I want to get a coffee delivery
from Umji Coffee Shop.

13
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,895
MOTEL OWNER:
What has gotten into you, Room 408?

14
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,314
I thought you were
some kind of a robot without--

15
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,108
(nervous breathing)

16
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,781
(tap water running)

00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:10,964
EPISODE 11: ROMANTICIST

18
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,758
(door opens, closes)

19
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,227
How many spoons of sugar?

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,650
-One.
-Goodness. You don't drink it sweet.

21
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,443
You must like the bitterness.

22
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,823
Gosh, why is this room so cold anyway?

23
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,867
I keep the window open.

24
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,912
Ah.

25
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,832
I'm going to make a cup for myself too.

26
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,667
Yes, ma'am.

27
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,960
"Yes, ma'am"?

28
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,336
(laughs)

29
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,131
Gosh, you're a gentleman.

30
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,091
You're really funny.

31
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,013
Should I go wash up?

32
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,515
Sorry?

33
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,436
Come on. You called so late at night.
You're not getting a ticket?

34
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,190
You can go after you finish drinking.

35
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,819
I can only go if you finish your coffee.
You haven't even touched yours.

36
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,489
(coffee shop staff 1 gasps)

37
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,534
That's still hot. Is your mouth okay?

38
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,788
(playful music)

39
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,789
(cup and spoon clank)

40
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,799
(gulps, exhales sharply)

41
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,468
(gasps)

42
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,262
(cup and spoon clank)

43
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,099
-(cigarettes sizzling)
-(coffee shop staff 2 blowing air)

44
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,855
Again?

45
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,651
Gosh, Room 408.

46
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,611
You must have a lot of--

47
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,695
(line beeps)

48
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,613
Hello?

49
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,699
What a monster.

50
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,787
(motorbike engine revving)

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,874
MOTEL OWNER: Hey.

52
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,002
Sign in.

53
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,887

55
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,687
408, UMJI, HWANG 1

56
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,483
(knocks on door)

57
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,612
You ordered coffee?

58
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:40,989
Yes.

59
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,868
MS. HWANG: It's been a while.

60
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,204
JUWON: Thank you for taking me
to the motel that day.

61
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,122
It was nothing.

62
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,001
A grown man was crying on the street.
How could I just walk by?

63
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,378
How many spoons of sugar?

64
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,255
Three spoons, please.

65
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,218
You should have a cup too.

66
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,515
You've done this a lot.

67
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,893
(cup and spoon clanking)

68
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,771
JUWON: Thank you.

69
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,065
MS. HWANG:
You've been living here a while, right?

70
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,777
Yes, well...

71
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,613
I only asked because it looks clean
for a room used by a single guy.

72
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,906
I wasn't asking for a story.

73
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,827
I've been here for four months.

74
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,249
I guess you like martial arts novels.
They're about fighting, right?

75
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,878
These aren't just martial arts novels.

76
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,004
Then what are they?

77
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,797
They're romance novels.

78
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,050
I see. Romance.

79
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,843
It's true.

80
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,346
In the end,
all martial arts novels are about romance.

81
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,306
The good guy wins

82
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,267
and ends up with the person they love.

83
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,186
Sure. Okay.

84
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,271
(quirky music)

85
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,443
-The water got cold.
-(coughs)

86
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,492
You don't have the TV on today.

87
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,996
-MS. HWANG: I didn't...
-Should I turn it on?

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,374
MS. HWANG (chuckles): It was usually on.

89
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,045
I just don't like it when it's quiet,

90
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,547
because I'm claustrophobic.

91
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,548
(clears throat)

92
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,557
(TV chatter)

93
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,975
MS. HWANG: That's about fighting as well.

94
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,061
What do you like
about people beating each other up?

95
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,400
I guess he's finished.

96
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,235
No.

97
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,612
Hulk Hogan will win.

98
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,781
Hulk? You mean that green monster?

99
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,701
No, not the Hulk. I mean, Hulk Hogan.

100
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,287
Ah...

101
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,457
I didn't know they were different.
I like the Hulk though.

102
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,959
Why?

103
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,670
He looks like a monster,
but he's a good guy.

104
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,762
The Hulk would always win, right?

105
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,975
Hulk Hogan always ends up winning too.

106
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,644
He's a good guy.

107
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,480
Good guys don't always win.

108
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,692
If you watch until the end,
they always win.

109
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,947
He can't get back up
after getting beaten like that.

110
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,615
-MS. HWANG: He's finished.
-Actually...

111
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,201
(cup and spoon clanking, clattering)

112
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,419
JUWON: I'd like to get a ticket.

113
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,508
Okay. You should wash up first.

114
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,428
(splutters)
That's not what I mean.

115
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:54,348
No, I'd like to just talk with you.

116
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,435
(quirky music)

117
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,607
(sighs)

118
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,026
Forget it.

119
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,363
"Just talk with me." What nonsense.

120
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,157
If you want to do it, just do it.

121
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,534
Why do you want to pay me
to talk with you?

122
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,745
I really just want to talk with you

123
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,371
-while we drink coffee.
-Forget about it.

124
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,042
Just give me 10,000 won for the delivery.

125
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,004
If you want coffee again,
just come to the shop.

126
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,423
I don't know how to get there.

127
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,759
I'm bad with directions.

128
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,219
What an excuse.

129
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,847
I've been ordering coffee,
because I wanted to see you.

130
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,731
(door opens)

131
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,530
(sighs)

132
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,283
(door bell jingling)

133
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,660
SHOP OWNER: Gosh, it's cold.

134
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,663
Why are you out here?

135
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,165
I needed to get some air.

136
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,127
UMJI COFFEE SHOP

137
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,424
You were there for a while.

138
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,676
Did he get a ticket?

139
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,593
No.

140
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,347
He asked for the ticket just to talk,
so I left.

141
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,765
(shop owner chuckles)

142
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,934
He's the sappy kind
that you hate the most.

143
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,524
I'm sick and tired of men
who want to play the romanticist

144
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,692
with coffee delivery girls.

145
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,443
They all try to get you into bed anyway.

146
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,695
-(shop owner chuckles)
-(soft chuckle)

147
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,782
Then what did you do
while you two drank coffee?

148
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,912
We talked for a bit.

149
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,874
I thought you didn't like the sappy kind.

150
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,919
He wasn't being sappy.

151
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:51,674
We talked about martial arts novels
and pro wrestling.

152
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,050
What?

153
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,802
Martial arts novels and wrestling?

154
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,387
MS. HWANG: Yeah.

155
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,099
(laughing)

156
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,560
SHOP OWNER: I guess he likes those things.

157
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,855
He says he likes it
because the good guys win.

158
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,067
Apparently, martial arts novels
are about romance.

159
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,986
Goodness.

160
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,448
(inhales deeply, exhales deeply)

161
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,490
Gosh, it's cold.

162
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,578
He might've been that way
because it was you,

163
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,538
not because you were
any coffee delivery girl.

164
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,415
What?

165
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,752
All the girls who delivered coffee
to room 408 returned immediately.

166
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,879
My goodness.

167
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,257
Romance is correct.

168
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
(shop owner scoffs)

169
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,011
-(door opens)
-(door bell jingling)

170
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,017
(boat honking in distance)

171
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,934
(sighs)

172
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:52,109
BUSINESS SUSPENSION
MAYOR OF ULSAN

173
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,570
(suspenseful music)

174
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,532
What about the Monster?

175
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:01,952
GANGSTER 1: That's...

176
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,121
We haven't found him yet.

177
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,707
Do you have a death wish?

178
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,169
GANGSTER 2:
We're searching all over the country,

179
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,005
but there's just no sign of him anywhere.

180
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,882
What should we do?

181
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,676
All right.

182
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,054
Then, you can die.

183
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,472
-(glass shatters)
-(groans)

184
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,890
-You idiots.
-Come on.

185
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,059
That bastard can't hide for long.

186
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,062
-We planted our guys all over the country.
-(Minki panting)

187
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,068
-(Minki sighs)
-GANGSTER 1: Get off!

188
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,488
A wolf can't live long among the sheep.

189
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,908
You'll see. It'll show its teeth soon.

190
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:45,788
Very soon, you'll hear from somewhere,
"There's a wolf!"

191
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,165
I told you
not to underestimate Jang Juwon.

192
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,793
Even if he's a wolf, he's a lone wolf.

193
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,795
He'll get eaten up by the wild dogs.

194
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,130
(shouts)
He isn't a wolf!

195
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,509
He's a monster.

196
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,847
(upbeat music)

197
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,520
Would you go to Wolmi-do with me?

198
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,565
What?

199
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,193
I hear they have Disco Pang Pangs, and...

200
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,362
(Ms. Hwang chuckles softly)

201
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,489
Their pirate ship ride is fun too.

202
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,326
UMJI COFFEE SHOP

203
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,911
(grunts)

204
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,457
Come on, man.

205
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,709
Try them. They're fun.

206
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,128
I don't feel like reading them.
I'd rather prefer TV shows.

207
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,588
You should still try.

208
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,424
If you read these,
you won't want to watch TV shows.

209
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,467
I'm not so sure.

210
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,886
There are so many.
When will I finish reading them?

211
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,471
Just read them one by one.

212
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,309
UMJI COFFEE SHOP

213
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,312
One coffee delivery for Motel Plus.

214
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,938
What's the room number?

215
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,818
Okay. It'll take a while.

216
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,365
Coffee delivery for Motel Plus? I'll go.

217
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,452
No, you don't have to go.
I'll send Jihee when she returns.

218
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,205
-Did he ask for her?
-No.

219
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,706
Then why?

220
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,957
It's room 408.

221
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,585
(upbeat music continues)

222
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,170
You're cold, aren't you?

223
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,557
Aren't you going to watch TV?

224
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,393
You didn't seem to like it.

225
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,942
Why don't you ask me?

226
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,319
Sorry?

227
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,113
"How did you end up doing this?"

228
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,324
"Why do you live your life
doing this for a living?"

229
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,371
You must have had a reason.

230
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,269

231
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,985

00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,987
GAMBLER 1:
I get a bad hand whenever he deals.

233
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,364
-GAMBLER 2: I know.
-GAMBLER 1: Always like that. I'm broke.

234
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,241
-All right. Here I go.
-GAMBLER 2: Do it.

235
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,326
-Call?
-Call. Okay.

236
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,537
What the fuck are you looking at?

237
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,248
Hey, you scared him.

238
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,542
Who the hell was that anyway?

239
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,919
He's the loser from room 408.

240
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,380
He's always reading comics
or something in his...

241
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,423
Damn it.

242
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,384
You gave me such a bad hand.
I'm fucking folding.

243
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,261
GAMBLER 2: Fuck it. Me too.

244
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,972
Hey, order some coffee. I'll pay.

245
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,015
How much is it?

246
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,726
-Just order one.
-GAMBLER 2: Why?

247
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,853
(sighs)
There's a bitch I want.

248
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,313
-Is she pretty?
-(sighs)

249
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,815
She's pretty but very fucking stuck up.

250
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,358
GAMBLER 3: Did something happen?

251
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,571
She owes me some extra.

UMJI COFFEE SHOP

253
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,423
Room 408.

00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,051
(sighs)

255
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,720
You're behind on paying rent.

256
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,889
I know.

257
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,766
Okay, so you do know.

258
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,143
I guess you have money
to borrow martial arts novels though.

259
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,104
It's 60,000 won for 5 days.
How many times did I tell you

260
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,898
that long-term guests
have to pay in advance?

261
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,316
ROOM
403

262
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,613
None of the other long-term guests
act like you.

263
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,657
I'll evict you if you do this again.

264
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,034
Tell me. When will you pay up?

265
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,578
I'll pay you soon.

266
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,497
And when is that?

267
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,265
(Ms. Hwang screaming)

268
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,435
MS. HWANG: Get off me!

269
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,895
GAMBLER 1: You have a death wish?

270
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,898
-MS. HWANG: I'll kill you!
-GAMBLER 2: Hey!

-GAMBLER 1: Grab her!
-I'll kill you if you come near.

274
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,822
You fucking scumbags!

275
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,739
(shattering)

276
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,117
-You fucking bastards!
-(gamblers shouting)

277
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,327
-That bitch!
-You fucking bitch!

278

-Hey!
-MS. HWANG: Don't come near me!

280
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,165
You crazy? Know your fucking place!

281
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,542
You fucking losers.

282
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,669
-What the fuck do you think you're doing?
-GAMBLER 1: Stop!

283
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,255
GAMBLER 2: All right.
We'll pay you per person, okay?

284
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,881
Fuck you!

285
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,342
GAMBLER 3: What more do you want?
We're paying you!

286
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,927
I'm going to fucking kill all of you!

287
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,013
-GAMBLER 4: Fuck you! Try it then!
-(shrieks)

288
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,598
(panting)

289
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,683
GAMBLER 1: Kill us.

290
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,893
-Go ahead and...

292
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,313
What the hell?

293
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,524
JUWON: She says she'll kill you!

-What is that?

296
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,072
-What the hell is that?
-What?

297
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,198
What the fuck is that?

298
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,284
JUWON (shouts): She says she'll kill you!

299
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,201
What?

300
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,619
(splutters)
Who is that?

301
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,288
-GAMBLER 1: Go check it out.
-GAMBLER 2: What the hell is this?

302
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,083
(gamblers exclaim)

303
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,335
GAMBLER 1: What the fuck?

304
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,463
(breathing heavily)

305
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,091
It's the Hulk.

00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,594

315
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,287
What did the lady say?

316
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,372
(splutters)
Who the fuck are you?

317
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,001
Hey, I'm the brother
of Incheon's boss Nolgae!

318
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,836
GAMBLER 1: Don't you know the Nolgae Gang?

319
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,213
I don't know about that,

320
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,381
but what did the lady say?

321
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,844
(breathing heavily, grunts)

322
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,391
What did she say?

323
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,353
That...

324
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,772
she's going to kill us.

325
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,066
That's right.

326
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:29,983
GAMBLER 1: What?

327
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,486
(crunches)

328
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,366
Hang on.

332
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,470
JUWON: I'll quietly clean things up
and leave soon.

333
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,847
(sobs)

334
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,558
Don't do anything stupid until I leave.

335
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,892
(sobbing)

336
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,810
Got it?

337
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,022
I'll pay you soon.

338
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,150
(in shaky voice)
It's all right.

339

Is this Umji Coffee Shop?

345

Could you...

346
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,595
SHOP OWNER (over phone): What?

347
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,432
Is Ms. Hwang doing okay?

348
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,184
"Ms. Hwang"?

349
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,395
This is room 408 of Motel Plus.

Oh.

352
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,524
Yes.

353
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,735
She said you'd call.

354
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,695
She's at the hospital right now.

355
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,989
Ah...

356
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,616
Is she hurt badly?

357
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,535
She'll get an IV after she's treated.

358
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,787
Shall I tell her to call you
when she returns?

359
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,788
Ah...

360
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,999
Well...
(sighs)

361
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:09,917
Yes?

362
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,422
What is Ms. Hwang's name?

363
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,383
It's Hwang Jihee.

364
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,885
Hwang Jihee.

365
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,265
I'll be waiting for her call then.

366
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,439
Hwang Jihee.

367
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,576
(panting)

368
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,709
(grunts)

369
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,472
(ominous music)

370
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,574
(footsteps approaching)

371
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,785
(thuds)

372
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,378
(suspenseful music)

373
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,328

374

375
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,460
(gangster groans)

376
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,798
Get out of my way.
Who the fuck is acting up in my territory?

377
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,592
Is it you?

378
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,969
You beat my brother up to a pulp.

379
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,346
Do you know who I am?

380
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,639
(shouts)
I'm the boss of Incheon's Nolgae Gang!

381
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,017
What?

382
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,438
(shouts)
I'm Nolgae of Incheon!

383
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,648
Never heard of you.

384
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,108
You bastard...
(groans)

385
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,028

387
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,573
Are you all right, boss?

388
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,784
NOLGAE: My teeth...

389
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,827
You bastard.

390
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,912

395
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,523
(clamoring continues)

396
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,324
GANGSTER 1: We got him!

397
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:15,620

398
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,876

402
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,573
Hey!

403
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,575
He's getting up!

404
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,202
-Go get him!
-(Juwon grunts)

405
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,498
GANGSTER 3: Go and get him, all of you!

406
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,458
(gangster 4 groans)

407
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,131
Fucking die already!

408
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,305
NOLGAE:
What are you waiting for, you idiots?

409
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,308
Get in there, you bastards!

410
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,602
(Juwon groaning)

411
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:25,524
You fucking bastard,
how dare you mess with me?

412
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,030
(screaming in pain)

413
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,968

414
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,822

415
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,368
(chuckles)

416
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,453
Listen carefully.

417
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,039
He's a monster
who can pull out a knife he's stabbed with

418
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,541
and use it as a weapon.

419
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,459
Don't let him take your weapon, got it?

420
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,752
GANGSTERS: Yes, boss!

421
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,590
Hey, Monster.

422
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,342
This scares you shitless, doesn't it?

423
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,720
(laughs)

424
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:40,015
BATTA: Should I tell everyone your secret?

425
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,349
(deep inhale)

426
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,602
It's not that you don't feel pain.

427
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,478
You just endure it.

428
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,942
I'll make you want to die.

429
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,154

430
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,576

(sharp breath)

432
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,051
Oh, my gosh.

433
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,596
Boss, just how many of you are here?

434
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,306
About 100?

435
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,979
But if there are so many of us,
wouldn't the police come?

436
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,439
Because of the war on crime--

437
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,276
Want me to tear your mouth too?

438
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,320
It's all right.

439
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,865
There's a high-up nearby, so it's fine.

440
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,123
-(glass shatters)
-(gangsters screaming)

441

(gambler exclaims)

443
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,837
MINKI: What the fuck is going on?

444
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,547
-What was that?
-(all murmuring)

445
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,715
(terrified breathing)

446
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,595
-(body thuds)
-(gambler gasps)

447
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,180
Was that...

448
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,265
Batta?

449
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,684
(gambler whimpers)

450
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,229
What are you doing, you idiots?
Get in there!

451
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,146
GANGSTERS: Yes, sir!

452
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,857
-Let's go!
-(all clamoring)

453

454
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,405
-(clamoring continues)
-(breathing heavily)

455
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:32,919
Huh?

456
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,510
(gambler exclaims)

457
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,769
(tense music)

458
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,316

459
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,324
(breathes angrily, grunts)

460
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,492
(Minki and gambler yelp)

461
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,788
(Minki breathing nervously)

462
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,544
(gambler breathing heavily, whimpers)

463
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,423
MINKI: That fucking monster...

464
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,512
(gambler whimpering)

465
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,139
(car horn honking)

466
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,604
GANGSTER: He's here! Get him!

467
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,022
(gangsters shouting)

468
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,357

(gangsters clamoring)

470
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,912
Is he the Monster?

471
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,623
Yes, sir.

472
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,501
Let's see how he does.

473
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,088
So, how much more...

474
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,591
Push him to the brink.

475
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,805
And if he dies...

476
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,015
It doesn't matter.
I'll take responsibility.

477
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,685
Think of it like this.
If you don't kill him, he'll kill you.

478
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,565
Yes, sir. We're thoroughly prepared.

479
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:23,863
Fuck.

480
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,866
(bat clangs, rattling)

481
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,536

They blocked off that whole neighborhood.

506
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,901
Isn't it because of that war on crime?

507

00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,421
(car horn honking)

543
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,401
(blasts)

544
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,366
(groaning)

545
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,331
What was that noise?

546
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,541
Shouldn't we check it out?

547
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,504
Hey, the high-ups gave us orders.

548
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,756
Let's just take it easy, okay?

549
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,133
Sorry, sir.

550
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,385
BOTH: Oh!

551
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,806
Ma'am!

552
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,182
Ma'am!

553
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,059
(whistle blowing)

554
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,520
OFFICER: Ma'am!

555
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,842
(gangsters clamoring)

556
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,808
Go and check with your own eyes.

557
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,269
YONGJUN: Then you can decide.

558
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,437
PASSENGER: What would be the standard?

559
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,399
It's simple.
All that matters is his ability.

560
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,861
We don't need good character.
All we need is a monster.

561
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,239
PASSENGER: What do I do
in the worst-case scenario?

562
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,744
You are only to watch until the end.

563
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,125
If he isn't a monster, he should die...

564
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,752
since he's useless.

565
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,173
(ominous music)

566
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,342
(car door opens)

567
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,805
(car door closes)

568
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,099
(snickers)

569
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,896
(panting)

570
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,414
-GANGSTER 1: Get that monster!
-GANGSTER 2: Here!

571
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,832
GANGSTERS: Yes, sir!

572
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,418
(all clamoring)

573
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,130
(worried exhale)

574
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,265
(panting)

575
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,226
(surprised grunt)

576
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,353
JIHEE:
Why are you always out on the streets?

577
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,271
This is because of me, isn't it?

578
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,981
No, it isn't.

579
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,108
Hurry up and go!

580
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,318
GANGSTER 1: Get that monster!

581
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,071
-Go!
-What are you saying? Get on!

582
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,239
Just go!

583
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,823
I'm not leaving until you get on.

584
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,992
-(panting)
-(gangsters shouting)

585
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,289
(shouts)
I'm his girlfriend!

586
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,666
GANGSTER 2: Get that bitch too!

587
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:36,963
JIHEE: Hold on to me.

588
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,133
Get him!

589
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:49,558
(all clamoring)

590
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,568
(calm music)

591
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,035
(bird squawking)

592
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,747
(water lapping)

593
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,959
You said they always win.

594
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,377
What?

595
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,131
You said that good guys always win
in the end!

596
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:23,843
I'm not...

597
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,470
a good guy.

598
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,640
All of this...

599
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,977
is because of what I have done
in the past.

600
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,356
Whatever you did, you were in hiding
but got caught because of me.

601
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,527
I've even...

602
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,364
killed people.

603
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,372
(Jihee exhales sharply)

604
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,292
You must have had a reason.

605
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,184
(calm music continues)

606
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,286
-(tires screech)
-(Juwon gasps, yelps)

607
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,330
-(loud crash)
-(Juwon grunting)

608
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,684
Jihee.

609
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,436
Jihee!

610
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,063
Jihee!

611
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,653
(tires screeching)

612
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,495
(panting)

613
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,043
(Juwon shouting)

614
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,184
(all grunting)

615
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,646
(tires screeching)

616
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,734
(all screaming)

617
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,955
(groaning)

618
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,718
Boss!

619
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,012
Die already, you bastard!

620
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,805
(Minki laughs)

621
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,474
(Minki sighs)

622
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:19,810
(Minki grunts)

623
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,354
MINKI: Boss.

624
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,066
You kept craving sunfish.

625
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,319
Do you know how much
I had to run around looking for one?

626
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,907
Why the hell would you look for something
from Pohang at Ulsan?

627
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,034
I didn't understand at all.

628
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,161
Listen.

629
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,707
I found out
what's actually famous in Ulsan.

630
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,169
It's whale meat.

631
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,589
Apparently, they catch
a lot of whales in Ulsan.

632
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,176
-(car clangs)
-(groans)

633
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,221
Damn it. You fucking scared me!

634
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,641
I can't even get close,
because you're so scary.

635
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,185
(weak breathing)

636
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,359
I borrowed this from the whalers.

637
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,945
MINKI: Look.

638
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,740
I was really curious about this
from a long time ago.

639
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,825
I was so curious.

640
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:22,414
Would a monster like you die
if you had a hole in your head?

641
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,459
What should I do?

642
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,213
What should I do?

643
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,216
(in weak voice)
I can't find my way.

644
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,803
What the hell are you saying?

645
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,388
-I'm a monster, too, you--
-(gunshot)

646
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,643
(tense music)

647
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,572
(light music)

648
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:00,327
(breathing weakly)

649
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,873
(Juwon breathing weakly)

650
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,726
PATIENT 1: Excuse me.

651
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,646
What do you think about all day long?

652
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,024
Tell me what your story is.

653
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,403
My story?

654
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,571
PATIENT 1: Yes.

655
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,365
I get bored just lying here.

656
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,369
We already shared all of our stories.

657
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,413
There's nothing more to share.

658
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,059
I have a story now too.

659
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,817
Uh...

660
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,071
It's a story about fighting.

661
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,656
But...

662
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,076
it's about romance too.

663
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,079
Romance? She says it's about romance.
(chuckling)

664
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,456
PATIENT 2: What kind of story is it?

665
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,874
PATIENT 1: Let's hear her out.

666
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,502
JIHEE: Hmm...

667
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,630
I met this man.

668
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,840
(soft music)

669
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,550
I first met him on the street.

670
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:46,392
He was crying like a fool.
(soft chuckle)

671
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,812
He couldn't find his way.

672
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,943
I definitely gave him directions
before that.

673
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,823
But he stayed there for hours.

674
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,200
I was so surprised.

675
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:08,038
He must have been circling the area
for hours.

676
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:12,167
6 MONTHS LATER
AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY PLANNING

677
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,755
You'll be on active duty.

678
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,592
Serve your country

679
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,595
and erase your past mistakes.

680
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:25,806
Yes, sir.

681
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,101
Haven't you corrected your dialect yet?

682
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,354
You need to completely change
your identity.

683
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,315
You are no longer a gangster.

684
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:36,942
Yes, sir.

685
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,574
You will be forbidden
from acting by yourself from now on.

686
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,703
(deep exhale)

687
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:48,871
Remember.

688
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,831
I can cancel erasing your record of murder

689
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,834
at any time.

690
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,711
-(knocks on door)
-Understood, sir.

691
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,093
YONGJUN: Why are you so late?

692
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,312
He finished his training
and will be in Office Six starting today.

693
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,439
He'll be working with you from now.

694
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,402
Have you guys met before?

695
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,320
(Doosik sighs)

696
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,159
This guy's code name is Moonsan.

697
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,787
Where did you say you're from?

698
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,208
I'm from Guryongpo, Pohang, sir.

699
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,418
YONGJUN: Guryongpo.

700
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,962
Your code name will be Guryongpo.

701
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,382
You two are not to know
each other's real names

702
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,926
and must never use them.

703
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,512
You must only use ranks within the agency.

704
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,931
Moonsan's rank is--

705
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,558
We're the same kind anyway.

706
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,685
Just call me Mr. Kim.

707
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,065
Anyway...

708
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,569
Moonsan will be guiding you
as your superior.

709
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:03,987
YONGJUN: Greet him.

710
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,704
We have a clear hierarchy,
so you'd better salute him.

711
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,751
My name is Kim Doosik.

712
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,631
Let's try to get along.

713
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,468
I'm Jang Juwon.

714
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,471
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Kim.

715
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:42,651
UMJI COFFEE SHOP

716
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,945
-JIHEE: Then Ms. Kwak was...
-COFFEE SHOP STAFF1: Ms. Park?

717
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,530
-COFFEE SHOP STAFF 2: Ms. Choi?
-Ms. Kim?

718
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:50,033
No, it's "Ms. Kwak."

719
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,495
Why do you like
novels about fighting so much?

720
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,874
JIHEE: This isn't an action novel,
it's a romance novel.

721
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:57,791
-(door opens)
-(door bell jingling)

722
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,001
Welcome.

723
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,586
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

724
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,255
JUWON: I'm here for coffee.

725
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,049
SHOP OWNER: Yes, please have a seat.

726
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,011
With Jihee.

727
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,476
(soft chuckle)

728
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,022
(deep inhale)

729
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,900
(soft music playing)

730
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,946
(whispers)
It's him, right?

731
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,197
-SHOP OWNER: Back away, girls.
-Goodness.

732
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,365
SHOP OWNER: There's nothing to see here.

733
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,284
My goodness.

734
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,329
Long time no see.

735
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:37,998
Yes.

736
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,251
It has been a very long time.

737
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,840
Well, I had something I had to do.

738
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,761
I thought you got lost again.

739
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,306
You're so bad at directions,
but you found your way here fine.

740
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,852
I'm still bad at finding my way.

741
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,816
I just tried to find you.
(exhales softly)

742
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,366
How romantic.

743
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,826
(nervous chuckle)

744
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,038
(soft chuckle)

745
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:22,960
(chuckles)

746
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,087
(closing theme music)
