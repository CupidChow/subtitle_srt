TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,053
(tense music)

00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:18,143
MOVING

5
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,649
WOMAN 1: Have a good night.

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,234
MAN 1: Thank you, have a nice evening.

7
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,318
Hello.

8
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,862
MAN 2: Can I get two
point-one milligram packs?

9
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,572
-MAN 1: Sure. These, right?
-MAN 2: Yes, yes.

10
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,741
-MAN 1: Nine thousand, please.
-MAN 2: Here's my card.

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,284
-MAN 1: Insert your card, please.
-MAN 2: Okay.

12
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,454
-MAN 1: Okay, you're good.
-MAN 2: Yes, thank you.

13
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,622
-MAN 1: Have a nice evening.
-MAN 2: Thanks, you too.

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,208
Wait!

15
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,294
(tense music)

16
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,977
BONGSEOK: We'll take these instead.

17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,771
EPISODE 3: 1+1

18
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,190
Oh, these, too.

19
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,776
Why?

20
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,445
These are buy-one-get-one-free.

21
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:14,532
-(machine beeping)
-Ooh, that's good.

22
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,743
You can get two for the price of one.

23
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,037
Good thinking.

24
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,830
(chuckles)

25
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,543
(machine beeping)

26
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,549
And these Band-aids. All together.

27
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,428
You must eat donkatsu all the time,
'cause of your shop.

28
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,263
Sure do.
(chuckles)

29
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,306
(Huisoo sighs)

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,642
I guess that's how I'll turn out, too.

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,354
-A piggy and a chicken, hm?
-(slurping)

32
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,272
Hm?

33
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,734
I wasn't saying it like that.

34
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,735
Hm?

35
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,030
My dad opened a chicken shop.

36
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,907
Oh!

37
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,243
-You'll be eating a ton of chicken.
-(chuckles)

38
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,577
Yeah.

39
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,038
(Bongseok slurping)

40
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,207
I'm kinda worried, though.

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,043
My dad's never run a shop before,
and by himself.

42
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,797
My mom started the restaurant herself.

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,049
She's still running it alone,
but she does great.

44
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:13,967
So don't worry.

45
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,051
What about your dad?

46
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,555
I've never seen him.

47
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,599
Well, pretty sure I have,
I just can't recall.

48
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,351
No memories?

49
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,271
More or less.

50
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,734
I remember things in my dreams,

51
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,154
and in...

52
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,825
Bang Kisoo?

53
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,870
HUISOO: We know that guy. What the...

54
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,954
He was fighting.

55
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,832
Looks to me like he got beat up.
I wouldn't call that a fight.

56
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:46,749
Hey.

57
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,501
Are you guys friends, or...

58
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,589
-No.
-Then why?

59
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,550
I saw him, so I should ask.

60
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,767
That's weird.

61
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,812
He's not the type to get beat up.

62
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,940
Usually, he'd be doing the beating.

63
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,483
Is he a thug?

64
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,610
Is he?

65
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,279
He was always fighting.
I mean, even from the get-go.

66
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,573
Since he transferred,
he became the alpha juvie.

67
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,700
He wanted to go into PE, too.

68
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,453
-For exam stuff?
-Yeah.

69
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,747
Yeah, it was Choi
that told him he should try.

70
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,123
He hurt his leg, though, and--

71
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,082
He hurt his leg?

72
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,502
After that, he became the Kisoo we know.

73
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,046
Even teachers avoid him now.

74
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,516
Pres said he saw him,
said that he left to go home.

75
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,312
(slurps)

76
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,565
(exhales)

77
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,693
-Was that enough?
-Yeah.

78
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,654
So good. And you?

79
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,072
Yeah, I'm done.

80
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,574
Thanks for all this.

81
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,202
What do you mean?
I should be thanking you.

82
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,537
Weren't you waiting for me
'cause I was alone?

83
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,333
Actually, I don't have friends, either.

84
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,669
Are you a loner?

85
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,545
Me too.

86
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,882
That's only
because you transferred just now.

87
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,386
I still didn't have friends
at my old school.

88
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,097
But you look like the type
to have a lot of friends.

89
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,556
Why?

90
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,018
Well, you're kind, and you're nice.

91
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,520
Aren't those the same thing?

92
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,524
And you're pretty.

93
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,820
You're not embarrassed?
You're the one who said it.

94
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,489
Let's get ice cream.

95
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,574
(whimsical music)

96
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,286
(Mihyun humming)

97
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,878
(groans)

98
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,134
NAMSAN DONKATSU

99
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,844
OPEN LATE NIGHT

100
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,809
MAN 3: Man, come on!
Hurry, hurry up. Hurry up, hurry!

101
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,769
This place only has donkatsu?

102
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,396
Who cares about food?

103
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,773
Hey, pretty lady, some beers here.

104
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,941
We don't sell beer here.

105
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,485
What are you talking about?

106
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,571
You don't sell alcohol at this restaurant.
Why not?

107
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,448
Oh, just give it a rest.

108
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,117
We have some left over, so we're all good.

109
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,119
-(man 3 grunts)
-Just drink the one's we got.

110
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,163
Hey, pretty lady, wanna drink with us?

111
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,581
You can't have alcohol here.

112
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,250
For goodness' sake, man!
Hey, little miss, little miss.

113
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,669
You got a pretty face,
but your attitude's messed up, huh?

114
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,047
Your customers
won't put up with this, you know?

115
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,257
MAN 3: If you're gonna
continue business like this, I...

116
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,385
I'll go around telling anyone who listens
not to come here and instead...

117
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,928
-Oh! Oh, my god.
-You're here.

118
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,307
Auntie, where's this one go?

119
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,516
Put it in the kitchen, okay?

120
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,519
No beers or alcohol.

121
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,313
BOTH: Yes.

122
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,488
(thuds)

123
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,782
(thuds)

124
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,076
Here. Is your mother doing well?

125
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,454
Donkatsu smells really good.

126
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,206
Thanks.

127
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,376
OPENING SOON

128
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,668
(sighs)

129
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,131
NOW OPEN

130
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,552
FRESH CHICKEN

131
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,638
(quirky music)

132
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,142
(Juwon sighs)

133
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,187
-(meat thuds)
-(soft grunt)

134
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,327
(alarm trilling)

135
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,578
(Juwon sighs)

136
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,040
Okay, that part's good.

137
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,503
Now, orders should come in.

138
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,433
-(phone rings)
-Oh!

139
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,437
(mumbling) This is Fresh chicken,
still fresh when it's dead.

140
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,983
Hello, this is Fresh chicken,
still fresh when it's dead.

141
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,609
Yes.

142
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,695
Yes.

143
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,324
No, we've already got some loans, yes.

144
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,952
Oh, yes. Yes. Goodbye. Thanks.

145
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,206
(sighs)

146
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,254
(chuckles)

147
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,758
I haven't told my dad
about school plans yet.

148
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,677
Why not?

149
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,305
I just think he'll worry about it.

150
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,808
That's 'cause he doesn't know,
I mean, he wouldn't if he knew.

151
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,351
Hm?

152
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,728
Worry is fleeting,

153
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,939
and every parent ends up
having to support their children.

154
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,150
That's what my mom told me once.

155
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,277
Really?

156
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,613
Well, I wish I'd heard that before.

157
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,407
My dad's always trying to be tough.

158
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,660
Well, maybe you should tell him, then.

159
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,079
Parents get kinda sad about that stuff.

160
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,542
He wants to try and support you,
but he's unable because he doesn't know.

161
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,836
Then you should bite the bullet
and just tell him.

162
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,130
(P.A system chimes)

163
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,673
You were just worried about your dad.

164
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,468
I mean, you wanna support each other,
isn't that right?

165
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,431
(students chattering)

166
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,682
Eat this, too, okay?

167
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,309
I'm totally full.

168
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,479
Hey, pres.

169
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,106
Didn't you say Bang Kisoo went home early?

170
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,650
Yeah, why?

171
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,860
Well, I just saw him walking outside.

172
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,322
I guess he came back. Why?

173
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,740
-Oh, the thing is--
-It's nothing.

174
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,283
We have to clean.

175
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,912
Where did you go during study hall?

176
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,873
-We got some food.
-You ditched class.

177
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,376
What? It's voluntary study hall, though.

178
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,670
-Voluntary.
-Voluntary.

179
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,553
You two have gotten pretty chummy.
You seem to get along.

180
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,555
Mm-hm, yeah, we're pretty close now.

181
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,849
Both of our homes are shops,
and we're loners, so...

182
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,019
-Let's go.
-Mm.

183
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,985
(sighs)

184
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,944
STUDENT 1: Karaoke!

185
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,779
-Let's go sing karaoke.
-STUDENT 2: Yeah!

186
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,283
(student laughs)

187
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,004
BONGSEOK: Listen carefully, okay?

188
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,756
Take the broom and brush,
and with your wrist, you snap.

189
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:55,011
Then splash water and you go again.
Yeah. Then repeat.

190
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,763
But really, the most important thing
is this mop.

191
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,764
(Bongseok grunts)

192
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,475
So you take this and you scrub hard.

193
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,396
Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.

194
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,940
-Even in the corners.
-(door closes)

195
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,400
(grunts)
Huh?

196
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,155
Okay.

197
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,086
("Together!" by JANNABI playing)

198
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,478
("Together!" by JANNABI continues playing)

199
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,576
-What the...
-(Huisoo gasps)

200
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,662
("Together!" playing on earphones)

201
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,624
-This is the men's, you can't be in--
-Hey, calm down for minute.

202
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,544
The reason you got hurt
was my fault, so...

203
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,758
-I wonder if it's enough.
-Three-point-one-four...

204
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,635
-I've never done this before.
-Ah, stop.

205
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,220
Come on, stay still.

206
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,681
Three-point-one-four-six...

207
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,434
Stop it.

208
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,520
(lively music playing on earphones)

209
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,816
Three-point-one-four-six-five...

210
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,858
Hey!

211
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,404
-Does it hurt that much?
-This is bad.

212
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,406
Three-point-one-four-six,
five-nine-three...

213
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,408
-Three-point-one-four-six-five--
-All done.

214
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,451
(groans)

215
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,120
Three-point-one-four-six-five--

216
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,038
You might need more. Take it.

217
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,585
I finished cleaning. You nearly done?

218
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,463
Huh? Three-point-one-four-six,
five-nine-three...

219
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,424
-Three-point-one-four-six-five...
-What was that?

220
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,260
You leave first.

221
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,180
Okay, then.

222
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,059
Three-point-one-four-six-five...

223
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,185
I'll head out.

224
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,981
That should do it, I suppose.

225
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,611
Three-point-one-four-six-five...
Three-point-one-four-six-five...

226
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,114
Three-point-one-four-six-five...

227
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,824
Three-point-one-four-six-five...

228
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,034
("Together!" by JANNABI playing)

229
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,123
Three-point-one-four-six-five...

230
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,667
(whimpers)

231
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,923
(water trickling)

232
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,107
(song fades)

233
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,792
(dog barking in distance)

234
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,303
HUISOO: Mm-hm.
Yeah, we're pretty close now.

235
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,389
Both of our homes are shops,
and we're loners, so...

236
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,476
(beeps)

237
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,560
(chuckles)

238
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,104
Ganghoon. You're here.

239
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,106
I'm home now. Hello, Father.

240
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,302
Oh!

241
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,388
Welcome... Oh, hey, hon.

242
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,015
Ta-da! What do you think?

243
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,518
Oh, wow, it's pretty. What about you?

244
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,979
Mm-hm. I mean, of course I like it.

245
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,355
-(chuckles)
-You bought it for me.

246
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,401
BONGSEOK: Worry is fleeting,

247
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,195
and every parent ends up
having to support their children.

248
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,447
That's what my mom told me once.

249
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,993
BONGSEOK: He wants to try and support you,
but he's unable because he doesn't know.

250
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,286
Um, Dad.

251
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,662
Hm?

252
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,001
I need your support, Dad.

253
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,880
You got this!

254
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,883
You didn't even ask me about it!

255
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,343
What... What about what I think, huh?

256
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,304
That's why I'm telling you now.

257
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,180
Do you think
I'm just gonna okay this, huh?

258
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,684
You were gonna go into humanities!
Why PE all of a sudden?

259
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,227
This is a huge decision.

260
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,770
Explain it to me.

261
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,149
Your opening! Dad, congrats!

262
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,942
Stop playing around and answer.

263
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,403
Why a PE major, huh? Tell me.

264
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,363
-A lot of business today?
-Two orders today.

265
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,615
Are you joking around?

266
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,409
Stop changing the subject and tell me.
Why switch?

267
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,370
I'm good at sports, just like you are.

268
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,207
You... Does that really sound
like a good enough reason, huh?

269
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,752
You didn't even discuss
a single thing with me.

270
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,753
Yeah, but...

271
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,212
What?

272
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,798
That's why I'm discussing it now.

273
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,092
I don't need to pay for private lessons.

274
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,639
My homeroom teacher also teaches PE.

275
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,391
He said he'll teach me
everything at school.

276
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,770
I don't have to pay for PE school.

277
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,734
I mean it, you don't have to worry.

278
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,235
I'll take care of it, Dad.

279
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,946
Mm.

280
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,743
MAN 4: Can I get a half-plain,
half-yangnyeom to go?

281
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,662
Just a moment, sir!

282
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,749
I appreciate your support.

283
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,842
There's a customer. What are you doing?

284
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,390
You've got this!

285
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,727
HUISOO: Just a minute!

286
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,814
(sighs)

287
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,153
MAN 4: Are you guys still open?

288
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,991
Oh. Oh, we are.

289
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,742
JUWON: Yes.

290
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,160
MAN 4: I'd like a half-and-half
to go, please.

291
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,162
-JUWON: Right. A half-and-half?
-MAN 4: Yes.

292
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,331
-JUWON: Thank you.
-MAN 4: Here's my card.

293
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,582
Oh, that looks so good.

294
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,418
JUWON: I'll fry it up nice
and crispy for you.

295
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,089
-Half-plain, half-yangnyeom. Mm-hm.
-(oil sizzling)

296
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,677
(brake squeals)

297
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,054
(door hisses)

298
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,890
Hello, sir...

299
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,809
Uh...

300
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,894
MAN 5: Hey. Are you getting on?

301
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,398
(beeps)
MACHINE: Transfer valid.

302
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,281
(upbeat music)

303
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,742
(chuckling)

304
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,590
Oh, excuse me.

305
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,354
(panting)

306
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,903
ILHWAN: Do any of you
have Bang Kisoo's number? No one?

307
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,696
(whispers)
Hey, don't say it.

308
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,823
Really? Not a single one of you
is close to Bang Kisoo.

309
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,908
-Sir...
-I mean it.

310
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,702
ILHWAN: Well, tell him to see me
if you see him.

311
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,954
-STUDENTS: Yes, Mr. Choi.
-Jang Huisoo.

312
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:01,997
Yeah.

313
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,750
Bring your uniform to train
at the auditorium during study hall.

314
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,667
We'll start today.

315
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,585
HUISOO: Yes, sir.

316
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,669
It's time for class.

317
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,129
STUDENTS: Yes, Mr. Choi.

318
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,716
-Don't stick your nose in it. Stop it.
-Why not?

319
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,094
What were you guys saying?

320
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,013
What?

321
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,351
Just come here.

322
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,105
You know something, don't you?

323
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,774
What?

324
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,151
I saw Bang Kisoo behind school.

325
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,403
He wasn't looking so hot.

326
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,696
You know something.

327
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,368
It's probably nothing, though.

328
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,246
Heard he was in PE, and a juvie.

329
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,248
Where'd you hear all that?

330
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,332
Bongseok.

331
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,837
You guys have gotten to be friends.

332
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,756
-What... We were mid conversation...
-(sighs)

333
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,720
STUDENT 1: Come on,
let's go to the PC cafe!

334
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,014
STUDENT 2: What?
You're not coming with us?

335
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,016
STUDENT 3: Aw, what?

336
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,072
(bag rustles)

337
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,661
(sniffles)

338
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,796
(light upbeat music)

339
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,010
HUISOO: Damn it.

340
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,095
I can barely see anything right now.

341
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,607
(panting)

342
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,682
BONGSEOK: Huisoo.

343
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,437
Hey, you're still here?

344
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,482
You can do it.

345
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,776
What?

346
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,364
You. You got this!
(chuckles)

347
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,409
(panting)

348
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,712
(chuckles)

349
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,839
(uplifting music)

350
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,871
(bell chimes softly)

351
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:54,062
Kim Bongseok! What did I say
about staying out late?

352
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,898
I was tardy today, so I had cleaning duty.

353
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,775
Cleaning duty runs this late?

354
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,279
Well, also, I helped my friend.

355
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,697
A friend?

356
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:04,990
Yeah.

357
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,450
You have a friend now?

358
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,410
Yeah.

359
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,164
Well, make sure to call.

360
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,957
I get worried, you know.

361
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,712
Get on the scale!

00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:21,923

JISUNG: Yes or no?

368
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,559
Excuse me. You can't park here
in front of the school gates.

369
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,560
You need to leave.

370
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,020

384
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,852
That's all right.
For the first time, that's pretty good.

-ILHWAN: Okay, that was okay.

388
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,404
You're gonna have to give me more, though.

389
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,118
Grip it with the tips of your fingers,
so your grip is as wide as possible.

390
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,330
Swish! Your leg's like this.
Waist and shoulder.

391
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,667
Pow! And then you step. And then you toss!

392
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,753
You do it like this. You know boxing?

393
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,921
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

394
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,466
Throwing a handball pretty far,
it's really the same as throwing a punch.

395
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,134
You'll get into a stance like this.

396
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,471
And your shoulder goes this way
with your pelvis, and then... Pow!

397
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,805
-Pow.
-Good.

398
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,015
-Swish.
-Swish.

399
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,433
-ILHWAN: Pow.
-HUISOO: Pow.

400
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,518

403
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,241
Why are you so late?

404
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,327
I was sweaty, so I changed.

405
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,873
Chew, make sure to chew.

406
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,000
I really thought
I might starve to death there.

407
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,962
This is all they had, 'cause I came late.

408
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:47,963
Here.

409
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:49,839
That's yours.

410
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,676
I ate a bunch already. I got seconds.

411
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,179
This is still too much, I think.
But maybe I have a little...

412
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,057
Just take some of the side dishes.

413
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,518
I always eat two plates.

You're here. That was quick.

00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:28,003
Can you go to the auditorium
and get the fans turn on?

419
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,462
-You want the fans on?
-ILHWAN: Yeah.

420
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,756
Uh, during the break,
a lot of dust got in there,

421
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,383
and during Jang Huisoo training,

422
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,927
it was just insane in there.

423
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,095
Yes, I'm on it.

00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,138

-When did you get here?
-Are you okay?

450
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,029
-Why?
-Just now, you were...

451
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,656
-What?
-You're really okay?

452
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,616
-Yeah.
-You landed really weirdly.

453
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,118
Are you sure your ankle's not hurt?

454
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,328
Yeah, it's okay, I didn't... It's fine.

Huh?

459
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,602
Whenever I come here, I start thinking.

Hmm...

461
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,480
Did you know...

462
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,274
I grew up in a place like this?

463
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,111
BONGSEOK: It was really spacious,
with a high ceiling.

464
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,489
Whoa, it sounds like you lived
somewhere really cool.

465

00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,496
Huh?

479
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,499
-Uh...
-Hey, this is crucial, okay?

480
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,086
-This time, count it right.
-Okay.

481
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,381

482
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,554
Okay. I'm ready again.

483

You gotta hold them tight.

-Okay. Mm-hm.
-Don't lose count.

485
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,102
-Seriously.
-Okay.

486
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:55,937
Ready.

487
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,899

Yeah, it's nothing.

00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,511

I gotta continue with my training.

506

-Wanna go to the store afterwards?
-I have cleaning duty.

507
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,359
Tardy again? Where'd they send you?

508
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,487
I think that Mr. Choi's
just given up on it.

509
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,365
He said I can clean wherever I want,
so I'm cleaning the hallways today.

HAN BYUL: Oh, my god, that's amazing!

533
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,925
-What does it do exactly?
-Well, it's the moisture.

534
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,052
-Moisture. Moisture.
-Really, I mean...

535
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,304
It makes your skin feel really alive,
and I'm--

536
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,513
Can you do it one more time?

537
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,057
Attention. Bow.

538
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,809
-STUDENTS: Thank you very much.
-Okay.

539
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,146
I'll take your slips
if you're going to after-school classes.

540
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,273
(students chattering)

541
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,867
(thunder rumbling)

542
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:42,872
(grunts)

543
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,836
(sighs)

544
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,172
(thunder rumbling)

545
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,510
(thunder rumbling)

546
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,720
(whimsical music)

547
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,275
(thunder rumbling)

548
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,702
(thunder rumbling)

549
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,622
(music stops)

550
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,301
KIM BONGSEOK

551
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,184
Hey. Hey.

552
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,689
Wanna grab some food? I'll treat you.

553
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,037
What's that? A game?

554
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,165
Texting that I'm eating
with a friend right now.

555
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,833
Whoa, really?

556
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,918
It's the only way I can stay out.

557
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,713
My mom loves it
when I eat late-night snacks.

558
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,384
I just remembered!
I left my shoes in class.

559
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,969
-Huh?
-(Huisoo gasps)

560
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,346
My dad just got me these shoes,
I can't believe it.

561
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,890
Oh, man, I'm such an idiot.

562
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,892
Uh, I'll get your shoes, I'm done.

563
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,437
No, you still have this.

564
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,149
That one's yours. Buy-one-get-one.
I'll see you soon.

565
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,318
(retreating footsteps)

566
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,239
(bell chiming)

567
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,801
(thunder rumbling)

568
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,892
(lightning crackles)

569
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,604
(panting)

570
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,613
(lightning crackles)

571
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,408
(tense music)

572
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,333
(gasps)

573
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,426
(breathes shakily)

574
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,773
(grunts)

575
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,401
(dramatic music)

576
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,244
Kim Bongseok!

577
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,621
(thunder rumbling)

578
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,290
HUISOO: Bongseok!

579
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,335
Kim Bongseok!

580
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,171
Kim Bongseok!

581
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,425
Huh?

582
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,511
What are you doing here?

583
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,181
Why are you holding up
your shoes like that?

584
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,645
Oh. I was tracking dirt in,
so I took them off. Why?

585
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,231
(sighs)

586
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,233
(Bongseok laughs)

587
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,526
BONGSEOK: How is that possible?

588
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,194
(Bongseok laughs)

589
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,779
Something was different, I swear.

590
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,659
Earlier tonight, when you were helping me
with sit-ups,

591
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,578
you kept reciting these numbers.

592
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,122
-What was that?
-It's a formula. I recite.

593
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,832
Why would you recite that, though?

594
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,542
I use it focus. Pi.

595
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,419
Pi?

596
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,340
I thought it was a spell or something.

597
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,966
(nervous laugh)

598
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,634
What am I? A wizard?

599
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:06,761
Having a blast?

600
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,724
Ah, right. I bought this
when I got the noodles.

601
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,227
Apparently, this is really good
for people who work out a lot.

602
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,688
It's tasty
and it was buy-one-get-one free.

603
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,776
-So I...
-HUISOO: Come on, stay still for a second.

604
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,110
It was falling off.

605
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,036
Hey, come on, don't stand up.

606
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,121
(upbeat music)

607
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,025
(music stops)

608
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,612
(closing theme music)
