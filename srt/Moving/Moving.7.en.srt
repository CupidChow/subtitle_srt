MIHYUN: Oh, Bongseok!
Don't run or you'll trip and fall!

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,419
If they bust you for being late,
just say your mom's really sick!

16
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,337
Honey! Good luck!

17
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,505
Hello. Jang Huisoo here.

HUISOO: Nice to meet you guys.

19
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,097
I was working out. I started training.

20
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,307
ILHWAN: A student will transfer here.

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,558

the cultivation, huh?

26
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,404
MIHYUN: Someone is deleting them.

27
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,617
(thunder rumbles)

28
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,619
Why's that weird?

29
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,079
HUISOO: You're just different.

30
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,538
You're not weird at all,

31
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,541
just a bit special, Bongseok.

32
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,461
BONGSEOK: You can do it. You got this.

33
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,921
(whimpering)

34
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,214

MIHYUN: Something that's not
as good as another thing,

39
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,947
or sorta like that, you know.
(chuckles)

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,410
-BONGSEOK: I'm--
-Oh, hello, sir.

42
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,375
Sit over there.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,627
Inside, right there.

44
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,426
MIHYUN: You're going to get
the donkatsu, right, kid?

45
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,971
-Yeah.
-MIHYUN: It'll be just a minute.

46
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,563
Hey, kid.

47
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,189
Yeah?

48
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,651
Do you go to Jeongwon High School?

49
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,736
Yeah.

50
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,657
Mm.

51
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:41,995
Hey, kid.

52
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,288
BONGSEOK: Uh-huh?

53
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,916
Get the king donkatsu, man.

54
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,710
Wow.

55
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,129
FRANK: This is very, very tasty.

56
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,674
Uh, wait, are you American?

57
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,759
Mm, Iowa.

58
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,845
BONGSEOK: Iowa?

59
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,138
FRANK: Yeah.

60
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,598
Corn belt.

61
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,018
Oh, corn! Yeah, right?

62
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,354
There was nothing around,
but cornfields for days.

63
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,025
This area was all countryside
when I was young.

64
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:12,984
Mm.

65
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,153
Do you live here?

66
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,070
Yeah.

67
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,156
(suspenseful music)

68
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,287
Mm-hm.

69
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,948
(breathes deeply)

70
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,250
SECRETARY: You are now connected to MSS.

71
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,334
MSS: CHINA'S MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY

72
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,378
His name was Frank, is that right?

73
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,463
(suspenseful music)

74
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,819

(phone beeps)

76
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,059
It was nice talking with you.

77
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,979
Good night.

78
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,528
(truck engine starts)

79
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,711
Put them on hold.

80
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,046
SECRETARY: Yes, sir. Right away.

81
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,047
(beeps)

82
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,634
Right.

83
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,428
Let me ask you one question,
off the record.

84
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,139
Are you developing the next generation?

85
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,515
(laughs)

86
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,851
You're also doing it.

87
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,646
Frank is the sixth one, am I right?
Alphabetical order, I'd guess.

88
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,857
I know you're eager to sell them off,

89
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,943
make deals with all the countries
in the world.

90
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,653
Don't be a prick.

91
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,824
It's a new world, you see.
Smartphones are all over the place.

92
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,659
If your kids are spotted anywhere,

93
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,287
that will quickly spread around the globe.

94
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,538
That won't happen.

95
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,332
You don't get it.

96
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,044
Frank has been compromised.
We have eyes on your guy, too.

97
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:23,007
You're in luck,
we're covering this up for you.

98
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,301
Relax, Mark.

99
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,596
Our alliance is forged in blood, isn't it?

100
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,519
Why didn't you see my text?

101
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,187
My phone died. I'm so sorry.

102
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,980
I told you to be careful, son.

103
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,359
-Well, the thing is, today, Huisoo--
-It's mind-blowing that you'd let it die.

104
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,904
I'm sure I was clear
about you responding quickly when I text.

105
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,532
-I just--
-Just? You just?

106
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,243
I'm not telling you this stuff
for no reason, Bongseok!

107
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,871
I told you to always be on your toes!
Why won't you listen?

108
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,268
(exhales deeply)

109
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,773
Mom.

110
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,984
Who was that person?

111
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,819
Did something happen?

112
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,574
Shouldn't I at least know what that was?

113
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,826
Mom.

114
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,870
BONGSEOK: Mom.

115
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,711
Eat before you go.

116
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,047
I'll make you a new dish.

117
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,885
I'm okay.

118
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,776

123
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,480
Mom! Mom!

124
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,649
Mom!

125
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,776
Momma!

127
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,868
Mom!

Sorry, folks. I don't think
that I'm able to keep going.

149
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,344
You better get off the bus.

151
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,017

Bongpyeong?

200
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,683
Why...

201
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:27,856
Why did you murder my dad? You asshole!

202
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,984

00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,533
Get out.

222
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,872
JUWON: Get ten of these, next one's free.

223
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,916
It is you, you bastard.

224

This was you?

234
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,396
You did this?

235
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,981
I'm not finished yet.

236
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,358
What are you saying, man?

237
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,027
You are next.

238
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,613
Yeah.

Who sent you?

248
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,563
You were planning
on killing me just like...

249
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,857
all of the others?

250
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,276
Why are you doing this, bastard?

251
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,574
Do you have children?

252
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,327
What did you say?

253
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,996
Do you have kids?

254
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,457
Tell me what you are.

255
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,170
Does your child...

256
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,466
go to Jeongwon High School?

257
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,693

260
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,270
My name is...

DAD'S MEAL

265
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,550
You make sure that you charge
your phone, all right?

266
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,802
When I call, pick up immediately.

267
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,096
When school ends, come back.

268
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,223
No more late-night self-study halls.

269
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:10,118
Okay, 80 days.
We've only got 80 more days.

270
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,706
No one's in charge of your lives here,
except all of you guys.

271
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,958
"No one's in charge of your lives here"?

272
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,420
Sure, man.
(snickering)

273
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,507
I'd like to see you all succeed.

274
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,886
Attention. Bow.

275
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,804
STUDENTS: Thank you.

276
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,807
PUT YOUR PHONE IN HERE

277
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,060
(overlapping chatter)

278
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,358
Why wasn't your phone in the basket?

279
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,445
-I stopped doing that.
-Who said you could?

280
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,362
HUISOO: Hey.

281
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,573
It's not mandatory to turn it in.

282
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,533
-Huisoo, you don't bring a phone so--
-HUISOO: I do have one.

283
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,243
Right here.

284
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,165
Then you're supposed to turn it in.

285
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,166
HUISOO: Don't you know?

286
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,543
This goes against the constitution.

287
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:08,051
It goes against our freedom,
our right to talk.

288
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,641
Is that all?

289
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,311
Mm.

290
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,437
You're absolutely right.

291
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:20,980
I know.

292
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,941
You've taken his side.

293
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,033
I'll exercise for two hours
before study hall.

294
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,326
Come to the store?

295
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,410
I...

296
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,496
I'm going back home.

297
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,331
HUISOO: Why? Your mom tell you to?

298
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,249
BONGSEOK: It's not like that.

299
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,168
I'm going to study at home.

300
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,422
(scoffs)

301
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:47,840
Do you like her?

302
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,468
Hey.

303
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,346
Why are you trying to hide
that gift of yours?

304
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,597
Take it easy.

305
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,890
(Kisoo scoffs)

306
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,308
So that's what Choi wants?

307
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:03,439
It's you that fucked up my leg, huh? Huh?

308
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,734
You think I'll just let you live in peace?

309
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,571
I'll tear your shitty face
off your fucking head.

310
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,535
(tense music)

311
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,371
(breathes deeply)

312
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,402

(lively music)

314
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,464
A perfect score.

315
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,882
Kim Bongseok!

316
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,805
(indistinct chatter)

317
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,727
-Hui--
-(phone vibrates)

318
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,401
MOM: COME STRAIGHT HOME AFTER SCHOOL

319
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,221
Here's your food.

320
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,182
Yes, well, thank you. Thank you.

321
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,351
Thanks very much. I'll be right with you.

322
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,977
Hey, Dad.

323
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,063
-Dad. Nailing it!
-JUWON: Oh! Yeah, thanks!

324
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:11,442
(alarm trilling)

325
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,866
Ganghoon.

326
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:24,997
I'm home.

327
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,348
(indistinct shouting)

328
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,983
HOSTILE ACTION CEASED IN 70 YEARS

329
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,192
WHAT WAS THE "HOSTILE ACTION"
THAT NORTH AND SOUTH CEASED ON THE 1ST?

330
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,676
(sighs)

331
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:25,725
NAMSAN DONKATSU

332
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,145
Ptolemy is...

333
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,397
Ptolemy...

334
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,277
-(phone buzzes)
-Hm?

335
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,696
HUISOO: WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

336
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,614
BONGSEOK: Huisoo?

337
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,865
(chuckles)

338
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,619
Uh, sleeping early.

339
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,788
(chuckles)

340
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,082
-OKAY, GOOD LUCK TOMORROW!
-YOU, TOO

341
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,626
Five exclamation points.

342
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,632
GOOD NIGHT

343
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,717
Good night to you, too.

344
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,891
(gasps)
Oh!

345
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,768
Ah!

346
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,312
(grunts)

347
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,272
Shit!

348
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,612
MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF YOUR LIGHTS

349
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,613
Hm?

350
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,542
(chuckles)

351
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,264
YOU GOT THIS!

352
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,731
Oh!

353
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,528
WAIT

354
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,955
That's not why I said good luck.

355
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,796
(Bongseok screaming)

356
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,764
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

357
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,685
(both laughing)

358
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,563
I came to wish you good luck.

359
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:37,690
Huh?

360
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,569
You cheered me on when I most needed it.

361
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,783
So I wanted to say it
before you took your CSATs.

362
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,122
I was hesitating, but I had to say it.

363
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,416
Hm?

364
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,210
Huh?

365
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,923
Why... Why would you hesitate?

366
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,969
Aren't you trying to avoid me
until your CSATs are over?

367
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,681
That's why I didn't want to bother you.

368
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,184
I thought you decided that, because...

369
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,604
you watched me train and couldn't study.

370
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,439
Oh, that's not true.

371
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,985
Not at all.

372
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,404
You ran to school every day,
while I took the bus.

373
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,115
You went to the gym
every day after school and...

374
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,327
I was coming home,
because of my mom, but...

375
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,039
you'd never even speak to me.

376
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,420
I guess so.

377
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,556
Huh?

378
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,266
It's okay. Don't get up.

379
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,185
(grunts)

380
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,860
(sighs)

381
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,285
I did want to come wish you good luck,

382
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,665
but what I really wanted to say is...

383
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,761
Well, I miss you.

384
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,356
(chuckles)

385
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,569
I, uh...

386
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,405
-missed you, too.
-Oh, it's snowing.

387
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,952
(gasps)

388
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,664
(chuckles)

389
00:40:58,747 --> 00:40:59,999
Bongseok, it's snowing.

390
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,545
HUISOO: First of the year.

391
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,630
(tranquil music)

392
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:14,638
HUISOO (chuckles): Whoo! Ahh! Ahh!

393
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,028
Good job.

394
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,339
The CSATs are done.
The semester will be over soon.

395
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,924
Graduation is next.

396
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,091
So what?

397
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,469
We should finish the tests.

398
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,512
Yeah, we should.

399
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,932
Hey, where are the files? Are they secure?

400
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,392
It's none of your concern.

401
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,270
Hey, I'm not trustworthy?

402
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,688
Security is key.

403
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,857
I was also transferred here
to do this job.

404
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,443
I'm the one in charge here, okay?

405
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,986
The school year isn't over.

406
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,030
(sighs)

407
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:22,414
GYM

408
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,162
ILHWAN: Okay, the CSATs are done.

409
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,081
(applauding, cheering)

410
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,085
Now, with the CSATs over,
your fitness tests

411
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,878
are totally over with, right?

412
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,005
(students laugh)

413
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,424
That's why you need to exercise
even harder, okay?

414
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,592
STUDENTS: Yeah.

415
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,970
Huisoo hasn't done her test yet,
so you can go practice over there.

416
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:22,391
The rest of you, don't bother her,
and stay on this side, all right?

417
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,392
STUDENTS: Okay.

418
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,810
-Let's go.
-STUDENTS: Okay!

419
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,062
-BOY 1: Mr. Choi, play dodgeball with us!
-ILHWAN: Sure, let's play.

420
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,441
(overlapping chatter)

421
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,526
(comical music)

422
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,620
Kim Bongseok.

423
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,542
-Let's play a badminton game.
-Hm?

424
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,047
Well?

425
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,677
Now, let me present to you,

426
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,764
Jeongwon High's group three
of senior students in PE.

427
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,558
So here are people playing badminton.

428
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,562
Next, we have our cutie Mr. Choi
playing dodgeball with the other students.

429
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,356
Next to them is Jang Huisoo,

430
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,734
whose college entrance tests
aren't done yet in PE.

431
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,403
Ah, our auditorium's second floor.
You want to see?

432
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,489
Secret second floor.

433
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,573
(gasps)

434
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,201
HAN BYUL: Hey, Bang Kisoo
is on the second floor!

435
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,800
(grunts)

436
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,344
Ahh...

437
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,600
-(grunts)
-(metal clanking)

438
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,564
-Yes!
-Whoa!

439
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,149
Again.

440
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,568
(chuckles)

441
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:14,795
(gasps)

442
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,056
You playing or what?

443
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,355
Ooh...

444
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,650
HYEWON: Sixty-five.

445
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,454
-Huh?
-Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.

446
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,833
Huisoo, no!

447
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,840
(tense music)

448
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,865
Aah!

449
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,786
(gasps)

450
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,042
(students murmuring)

451
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,418
BOY 2: He... He flew.

452
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,671
Are you okay?

453
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:11,578
Oh, my god.

454
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,166
HAN BYUL: Whoa, freaking amazing.

455
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,754
Shit, man. I totally knew it, huh.

456
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,423
Huisoo!

457
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,721
UPLOAD THIS VIDEO?

458
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:30,639
UPLOADING

459
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:31,682
HAN BYUL: Okay.

460
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:32,766
UPLOADED

461
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,892
(chuckles)

462
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,979
(upbeat music)

463
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,443
(people murmuring)

464
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:51,034
We deleted all the videos
and stopped the news from reporting it.

465
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,787
We're presently putting out
celebrity rumors to blow this over--

466
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,539
Are you fucking for real right now?

467
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,959
The problem is that our work
has been exposed!

468
00:47:59,042 --> 00:47:59,960
Call in Chief Jo!

469
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,046
Oh, shit.

470
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,260
MAN 1: Oh, my god, guys, did you see this?

471
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,345
Yeah, I did. This looks like a trick.

472
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,306
(sighs)
He seems like a high schooler.

473
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,225
I mean, what is he? Superman? The Flash?
He flew. You saw it.

474
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,977
-I know.
-Here's your fried chicken.

475
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,145
-Oh! Thank you, sir.
-Thanks so much.

476
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,313
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

477
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,190
You said he was in high school?
Which high school?

478
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,359
WOMAN 1: It's close, Jeongwon High.
That's where.

479
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,277
MAN 2: Oh, Jeongwon High.

480
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,738
-MAN 1: How do you know it's there?
-WOMAN 1: Look, it's there.

481
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,365
-It's fake, I think.
-Hey, I think... I don't think this is...

482
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,188
(sighs)

483
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,764
(grunting)

484
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,767
(groans)

485
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,113
(whimpers)

486
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,140
(exhales deeply)

487
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,771
(grunts, screams)

488
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:28,692
(whimpering)

489
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,981
(uplifting music)

490
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:13,070
(whimpering)

491
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,831
(water trickling)

492
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,422
(clanks)

493
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,929
(screaming)

494
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,521
And what are you doing?

495
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,109
I said, what are you doing out here?

496
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,489
Exercise.

497
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,160
(breathes deeply)

498
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,246
You're not wearing your weights?

499
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,625
I won't wear them anymore.

500
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,211
Why?

501
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,217
Why not?

502
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,097
I'm asking you, why would you do that?

503
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,475
-I'm talking to you--
-Mom!

504
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,312
Just no!

505
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,522
I just had enough!

506
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,739
Do you know why I act like this?

507
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,784
Why I'm passive and always so...

508
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,497
inflexible, frustrating, insecure,

509
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,458
scared of what people think and...

510
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,420
It's all because of you.

511
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,548
Mom,

512
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,300
I hate...

513
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,553
who I am.

514
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:47,933
I don't like...

515
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,020
how I feel about myself.

516
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,563
Hm?

517
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,192
Do you know what you told me the most
when I was young?

518
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,153
You said, "Please don't."

519
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:04,658
"Oh, please don't."

520
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,619
BONGSEOK: "Don't run."

521
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,412
"Don't go flying."

522
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,207
And, "Be still, my son. Please."

523
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,584
"Please, don't do anymore, son."

524
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:20,173
You'd tie me up all the time,
and always held me down!

525
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:25,679
I could...

526
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,308
I could have done it, too.

527
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:33,687
I would...

528
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,856
I would have flown, too, Mom.

529
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,442
And I... I...
(sobs)

530
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,653
I could have saved Huisoo.

531
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,238
If you weren't...

532
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,616
keeping me down the whole time.

533
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,287
You want to know why I'm exercising?

534
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,290
And why I'm not wearing the weights?

535
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:57,377
The truth...
The truth is I could do it if I try.

536
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,254
I'd fly faster,

537
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,923
and much higher than I'm able to.

538
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,258
And I...

539
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,260
I want to be flying, Mom!

540
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,429
Do you want to become
like your father, huh?

541
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,349
(sobbing)

542
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:20,358
(sobbing continues)

543
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:31,828
BONGSEOK: Mom never talked to me
about Dad, not even once.

544
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:38,418
I also never told her
about the dream that I had.

545
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,713
The dream I've always had.

546
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:42,630
(young Bongseok crying)

547
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,800
-DOOSIK: Bongseok.
-BONGSEOK: That dream was a memory.

548
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,218
DOOSIK: Bongseok.

549
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,387
Oh, you're up here.

550
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,766
-Oh, Bongseok.
-Dad.

551
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,977
Aw, son. Why are you here, huh?

552
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,645
