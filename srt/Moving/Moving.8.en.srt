00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,525
COPILOT: Looks like we're about to fly
through some choppy weather,

5
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,236
so I've turned the seatbelt sign back on.

6
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,739
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are experiencing some turbulence,

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,908
please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts. Thank you.

00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,618

ABOVE THE INDIAN OCEAN

11
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,892
A RECORD NUMBER OF COUNTRIES
PARTICIPATING IN THE 1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS

12
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,478
(people chattering)

13
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,817
Nothing but clouds
and he's glued to the window.

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,944
The whole flight.
(chuckles softly)

15
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,572
He said he'll brag about flying
when we get home.

16
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,034
WONWOO: Mom, Dad.

17
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,412
There's something in the clouds.

18
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,664
-Hmm?
-(thunder rumbling)

19
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,333
(scoffs)

20
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,465
There's a guy over there!

21
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,218
(suspenseful music)

22
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,533

00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,202
(Doosik grunts)

24
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,589
-Oh! Oh, my god!
-Oh! Oh, shit!

25
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,300
-CAPTAIN: What is going on?
-COPILOT: That... That's a person, right?

26
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,970
Uh... Captain. Wait,
what's he trying to say out there?

27
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,096
Who knows.

28
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,099
(mouthing)

29
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,934
What'd he say?

30
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,980
He's saying we need to slow down.
Captain, should we slow down?

31
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,774
Land it! Land it!

32
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,609
(Doosik whimpers)

33
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,362
(grunts)

34
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,951
(muffled)
Bomb, guys! Bomb, guys!

35
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,786
What?

36
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,456
DOOSIK (muffled): There's a bomb!

37
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,791
A bomb!

38
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,752
Oh, shit. Is he a terrorist?

39
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,005
(muffled)
There's a bomb onboard!

40
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,733
-Get on the radio with air control.
-COPILOT: Right.

41
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,610
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

42
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,695
-This is Korea Line 707.
-CAPTAIN: Oh, my god.

43
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,906
-Land the plane! Right now!
-We have a bomb on board this flight.

44
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:18,865
(both yelp)

45
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,949
(grunts)

46
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,705
(passengers yelping)

47
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,582
-WONWOO'S MOM: Honey, Wonwoo's seat belt.
-Are you all right?

48
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,709
WONWOO'S MOM: Fasten his belt.
Wonwoo, you okay?

49
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,586
-Hold onto Daddy's hand, all right?
-WONWOO'S DAD: It's okay, it's okay.

50
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,379
Wonwoo, your seat belt's on, right?

51
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,883
(grunting)

52
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,889
(panting)

53
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,067
ATTENDANT: Everyone, please stay calm!

00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,041

57
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,758
(tragic music)

58
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,181
DOOSIK: No!

59
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,227

00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:51,124

64
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,906
NAME: LEE MIHYUN

65
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,287
Lee Mihyun, age 24.

66
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,165
YONGJUN: "Youngest agent
since the founding of ANSP."

67
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:36,502
"Flawless scores in shooting
and every practical evaluation item."

68
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,507
"Adapts very well to one's circumstances,

69
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,595
super reflexes, all senses are augmented."

70
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,680
All of them?

71
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,145
You were injured on your first assignment
and lost some eyesight, I see.

72
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,608
You're in a desk job
at the Information Management Division.

73
00:05:59,108 --> 00:05:59,984
Correct?

74
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,235
Correct, Mr. Min.

75
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,531
That's too bad.

76
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,536
You'd be working for me here
without that injury.

77
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,548
(sighs)
Why is this coffee so... Ugh!

78
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,178
Follow me.

79
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:40,400
WE WORK IN THE SHADOWS
TO PROTECT THE SUNLIT LAND

80
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,909
I'm going to assign you
a very critical task.

81
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:57,750
YONGJUN: Kim Doosik, codename Moonsan.
ANSP's most elite black ops agent.

82
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,878
He will be given a top secret assignment.

83
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,340
But before that,
we need to verify his philosophical views.

84
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,427
There can be no mistakes.

85
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,972
That's why I want you on this.

86
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,476
And what is it that I need to know
about Kim Doosik?

87
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,479
Mm, mostly what he thinks about
day to day.

88
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,316
His capability to carry out assignments.

89
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,944
Analyze and judge his psychological state.

90
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,156
I'd like you to get
as close to him as you can.

91
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,199
Why me?

92
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,118
You're an information analyst.

93
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,956
I don't think
this job is for an information analyst.

94
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,043
(laughs)

95
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,631
You truly are
the most beautiful girl here.

96
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,717
Beauty is also a weapon.

97
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,803
Didn't you dream of being
a black ops agent in the field?

98
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,805
Office workers use their brains,

99
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,726
field agents use their bodies instead.

100
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,355
This is your chance
to be a black ops agent again.

101
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,567
Do your best.

102
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,032
YONGJUN: This is an official assignment.

103
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,743
It's not a suggestion, but an order.

104
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,329
If you fail, you will be held responsible.

105
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:23,377
NAME: KIM DOOSIK, CODE NAME: MOONSAN

106
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,632
He's good-looking.

107
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,549
(elevator dings)

108
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,385
EMPLOYEE 1: Excuse me.

109
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,351
-Hey, girl. Which floor?
-The fifth floor.

110
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,852
-(button clicks)
-Thanks very much.

111
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,419
(sighs)

112
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,879
This won't be easy.

113
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,021
YONGJUN: Kim Doosik comes
into headquarters once a month.

114
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,524
He reports in and practices his shooting.

115
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,026
I'll increase that to once a week,

116
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,238
and I'll let you know in advance
what time he'll arrive.

117
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,032
MAIN GATE SECURITY

118
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,325
(phone rings)

119
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,244
Lee Mihyun, Information Strategy.

120
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,834
(breathes deeply)

121
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,088
It will take you a while.

122
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,341
YONGJUN: You'll have to get close
without him noticing.

123
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,770
Make up situations where you interact.

124
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,939
Make sure it feels natural.

125
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,902
(phone rings)

126
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,281
Lee Mihyun, Information Strategy.

127
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,036
YONGJUN: How you approach him,
I'll leave entirely up to you.

128
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,004
(phone rings)

129
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,510
Lee Mihyun, Information Strategy.

130
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,571
(phone rings)

131
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,490
Lee Mihyun, Information Strategy.

132
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:02,036
YONGJUN: Utilize every possible means.
Be careful and good luck.

133
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,614
(sighs)
There are no spots here.

134
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,575
Oh.

135
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,831
Man, who parked this tiny car here?

136
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:47,873
(Juwon clicks tongue)

137
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,418
JUWON: Why can't they expand the lot?
There aren't enough spots.

138
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,379
Why do I have to waste
every day looking for parking?

139
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,673
-Man, it's so annoying.
-(scoffs)

140
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,052
(Juwon humming)

141
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,275
(footsteps approaching)

142
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,758
(footsteps receding)

143
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,717
What is it?

144
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,970
Oh, I just wanted a coffee.

145
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,597
Coffee?

146
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,725
But I don't have change.

147
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,603
We're working now.
There's no time for that.

148
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,856
Coffee is totally fine. Isn't it?

149
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,569
You don't have to include
everything in the report.

150
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,867
You will now be reporting here
twice a week.

151
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,412
We were already coming in every month,
you changed it to once a week.

152
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,955
Now twice a week?

153
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,333
It's not like we have that much
to report on.

154
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,753
We're increasing shooting training
and reinforcing our reporting, that's all.

155
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,879
So enough.

156
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,048
I have something for Guryongpo now.

157
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,132
Moonsan, you may go.

158
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,596
JUWON: Sir, Doosik and I are a great team.
We don't have any secrets.

159
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,600
Hey, Jang Juwon.

160
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,478
YONGJUN: Did you forget the concept
of respect running around outside?

161
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,898
The command structure isn't optional,
you motherfucker.

162
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,608
(sighs)
I'll be outside.

163
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,193
Same goes for you, Doosik.

164
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,655
If you're reporting here,
take your hands out of your pockets!

165
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,908
You don't even salute
as you walk in and out,

166
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,284
you fucking assholes.

167
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,499
YONGJUN: God.

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,669
JUWON: Uh, what did you want
to say to me, sir?

169
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,756
Ah, there's too many
property damage claims for your missions.

170
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,468
Those are the invoices I've organized,
so go write the reports.

171
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,932
Reports? I mean... from when, sir?

172
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,143
I've organized them by quarter,
start from the beginning.

173
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,859
(sighs, clicks tongue)

174
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,987
(sucks teeth, clicks tongue)

175
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,030
(gunshots)

176
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,829

00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,101
(sighs)

180
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,323
(footsteps approaching)

181
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,417
PRESS HERE

182
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,021
-MIHYUN: Hello.
-Hi, how are you?

183
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,151
Have we... met, sir?

184
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,950
Oh, no. I see you when I come around.

185
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,037
This isn't really a place
to just come around.

186
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,167
I work here as well. Uh...

187
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,627
I'm in the field,

188
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,921
so I'm not here very much at all.

189
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,589
Oh.

190
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,967
I'm IST. Lee Mihyun, sir.

191
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,511
Kim Doosik.

192
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,269
Uh, Ms. Lee.

193
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,149
Do you have any change?

194
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,739
You want me to get you one?

195
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,073
Yeah.

196
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,660
(coin clinking)

197
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,497
(machine beeps)

198
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,666
JUWON: Why am I still working here?
Damn it.

199
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,711
(sighs)

200
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,801
MINESWEEPER

201
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,432
I'm so tired.
Hey, what do you want for dinner?

202
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,225
EMPLOYEE 1: What do you want?

203
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,062
-EMPLOYEE 2: Right now, coffee.
-EMPLOYEE 3: Yes, one with milk, please.

204
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,271
(employee 2 sighs)

205
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,276
What about some spicy octopus?

206
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,778
-EOMPLOYEE 1: I love octopus.
-EMPLOYEE 2: They're cheap now.

207
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,071
EMPLOYEE 3: That's right.
(chuckles)

208
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,114
-Don't tell the boss.
-EMPLOYEE 1: I won't.

209
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,409
-Black coffee, okay?
-EMPLOYEE 2: Oh, uh, yes.

210
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,036
EMPLOYEE 3: Yeah.

211
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,872
EMPLOYEE 2: I'm gonna need sugar, though.

212
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,291

216
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,845
(blows air)

217
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,389
Whoa. Whoa, hey.

218
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,059
Hey, did you get invited here, too?

219
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,437
Wow, a banquet this nice at a classy hotel

220
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,022
isn't for just anyone, you know.

221
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,566
(scoffs)
So then, what are you doing here?

222
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,403
This is a special event, though,
to entertain high profile VIPs.

223
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,823
How could they let
someone like you in, huh?

224
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,865
(scoffs)

225
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,867
Can you be any more ignorant?

226
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,370
It's for people
who have been around a while, you know.

227
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,957
They invited guys who are separated
from their families in North Korea.

228
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,544
It's a really important night,
I'm telling you. Got it?

229
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,921
Separated in North Korea?

230
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,049
If you go through Yanji market
and cross the bridge,

231
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,676
you're in North Korea.

232
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,886
-It's really not that hard, dude.
-(sucks teeth)

233
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,596
Watch your mouth.

234
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,598
Or what?

235
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,016
You're an asshole.

236
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,309
Hey.

237
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,604
Don't eat anything
they give you here tonight.

238
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,233
-What does that mean?
-MAN 1: Hey!

239
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,527
-Look what the cat dragged in!
-Hey.

240
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,903
(laughter)

241
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,698
MAN 2: Wow, long time no see, man!
(laughs)

242
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,826
MAN 3: Man, you're still kicking around!

243
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,786
The bait is set.

244
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,250
All Seagulls be ready to go.

245
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,210
Eagle, standby, please.

246
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,464
Serve black tea only to the HUMINTs
that I'm marking.

247
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,218
As for the rest, serve them yellow tea.

248
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,514
(traditional music playing)

249
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,727
(singing in Korean)

250
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,438
Table two, nine o'clock, black tea.

251
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,232
SANGGU: Table four, three o'clock,

252
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,444
table seven, twelve o'clock,

253
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,487
both black tea.

254
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,115
Table number six, two o'clock.

255
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,660
Table eight, one o'clock.
Table thirteen, one and eight o'clock.

256
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,623
Table ten, six o'clock. All black tea.

257
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,835
(Mihyun singing in Korean)

258
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,300
She's a really good singer.

259
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,887
So that's why they chose her
for this operation.

260
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,264
PARK: Well, she's still a trainee.

261
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,352
But she's the top of her class.
She skipped ahead, far.

262
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,937
Top of her class?

263
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,189
How so? Like, for singing?

264
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,651
I heard if she does well
on this assignment,

265
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,903
she'll get to be
an official black ops agent.

266
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,821
A female black ops agent?

267
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,325
Is really knowing
how to make good black coffee enough?

268
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,161
SANGGU: She looks good in that hanbok
and sings well,

269
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,789
so why don't we keep her singing?

270
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,125
(traditional music continues playing)

271
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,558
(whispers)
All right, so...

272
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,019
can I ask you about the operation now?

273
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,980
SANGGU: If you want to.

274
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,190
The operation has begun.

275
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,986
-(clattering)
-(people clamoring)

276
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,753
So the ones having black tea
are all double informants?

277
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,464
We can't be sure yet.

278
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,842
Although we will know soon.

279
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,306
The yellow tea... has been drugged.

280
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,808
(men groaning)

281
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,440
(splutters)
Then you're, um,

282
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:01,695
saying everyone here is a double informant
working with North Korea?

283
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,031
SANGGU: Mm.

284
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,575
I didn't say they work for North Korea.

285
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,410
Huh?

286
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,205
SANGGU: Oh, fuck me.
(clicks tongue)

287
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,460
They're always on the inside, aren't they?

288
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,629
You didn't know
whether it was the black or yellow,

289
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,258
so you told them to act naturally
and not drink any of the teas.

290
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,761
-(tense music)
-(gasps)

291
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,975
Those who knew not to drink either
are the double informants.

292
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:36,063
And the man who talked
is the spying prick on the inside.

293
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,523
I don't understand. I don't know...

294
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,568
Park, look, you know,
you went through a lot.

295
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,986
They'll die but I'll let you live!

296
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,989
Hey, Park! You bastard!

297
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,575
That's not what you said would happen.

298
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,870
Wait, you? Really?

299
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,622
Wait, sir. No, please, wait.

300
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,915

00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,625

How dare a traitor like you sing
our sacred national anthem?

310
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,787
You fucking asshole.

311
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,581
You're a murderer.

312
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,501
You deliberately used
this terrible operation

313
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,421
to round up all the informants
and kill them!

314
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,882
-Do you know how many innocent--
-(gun cocks)

It's okay, huh? I'll take care of it.

SANGGU: If you move, you die, all right?

319
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:05,735
You see, I'm really good
at playing hide and seek, huh?

320
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:11,825
-(cracks)
-(groans)

SANGGU: I'll brief you on the mission.

326
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:53,325
Now then, our assignment is to find
and kill all the informants.

327
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,829
You thought this was a rehearsal?

328
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,040
This is the real deal.

329
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,085
Yanbian is closer to North Korea
than it is to the South.

330
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,255
These assholes can turn
and be puppets for the North.

331
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:13,178
Our assignment is to eliminate anyone
who is even remotely suspicious.

332
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,930
-Understood?
-AGENTS: Yes, sir!

333
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,057
I said, "even remotely."

334
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,558
Understand?

335
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,893
AGENTS: Yes!

336
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,188
SANGGU: You.

337
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,981
Are you just going to sing and go home?

338
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,149
Get to work.

339
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,653

00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,038
This is the real deal.

WOONKYU: He said
the coffee you make isn't good.

350
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,636
Boil the water for us.

WOONKYU: Sir?

00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,354
YONGJUN: What the hell are they doing?
"Exchange of special envoys"?

353
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,649
How can we do anything
if they won't work with us?

354
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,359
It'll be okay.

355
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,528
Why should we try talking to them?

356
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,530
We should just crush them
with our strength.

357
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,531
I'm with you.

358
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,911
There is this expectation in our society
that we might unify with them soon.

359
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,830
-(both chuckle)
-Yes, that's right.

360
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,500
Having them fall so far
by bursting their bubble

361
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,545
when their hopes are high
isn't a bad thing.

362
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,215
Go.

363
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,681
How's Lee Mihyun been working out for you?

364
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,350
I'm sure she's doing well.

365
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,852
Why did it have to be Lee Mihyun for this?

366
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,437
She was an agent already.

367
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,856
Oh, but you know, in our team,

368
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,608
there are others who've been
just as good as Lee Mihyun--

369
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,109
She's pretty and I needed that.

370
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,779
(chuckles)

371
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,077
Honestly, I'm worried
she might mess up the assignment.

372
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,913
She messed up her chance
at being a black ops agent.

373
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,665
(sighs)
The Seagull Operation.

374
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,875
You... You knew about that?

375
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,418
My god, yes.

376
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,130
It's like lambs to the slaughter.

377
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,465
Ahh.

378
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,884
Make them keep running into each other.

379
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,220
Yes, sir. I keep her late every day.

380
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,894
-(sighs)
-Well, any instructions for me?

381
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,479
Add some sugar to that.

382
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:12,857
Yep.

383
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,819
YONGJUN: Is that two days' worth?

384
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,405
WOONKYU: Three days' worth.
I collected them all for you.

385
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,656
(Yongjun sighs)

386
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,825
It'll take a while to go through these.

387
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,042
KIM: Do I need to put more sugar in?

388
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,176
(sighs)
Or creamer?

389
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,937
Miss Lee, where's your work?

390
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,356
I'll be able to get it done tomorrow.

391
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,442
Finish it today and report to me
tomorrow morning.

392
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,069
WOONKYU: Leave whenever you're done
with your work!

393
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,156
-EMPLOYEE 1: Let's leave.
-EMPLOYEE 2: Okay, let's go.

394
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,159
(overlapping chatter)

395
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,954
EMPLOYEE 3: See you tomorrow. Bye.

396
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:08,872
EMPLOYEE 4: Later.

397
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:25,889
(grunts)

398
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,308
(sighs)

399
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,646
MAIN GATE SECURITY

400
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,943
(phone ringing)

401
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,237
Lee Mihyun, Information Strategy.

402
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,155
Yes.

403
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,538
(Juwon humming)

404
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,461
(clears throat)

405
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,384
What's wrong, boss?

406
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,679
Hey, there's a smudge right here.

407
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,890
-On the car.
-What?

408
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,934
DOOSIK: Wash it once in a while.

409
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:13,853
(elevator dings)

410
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,253
-JUWON: What is it? What?
-(footsteps approaching)

411
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,463
Oh, Doosik, I almost pulled my gun.

412
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,589
MIHYUN: Thank you.

413
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,800
We keep seeing you, girl. Where to?

414
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:45,802
Fifth floor, boy.

415
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:47,887
Hmm?

416
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,597
Fifth floor.

417
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,352
(sighs)

418
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,148
(elevator dings)

419
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,987
Um, do you need some help?

420
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,990
-MIHYUN: Oh.
-They look pretty awkward.

421
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,784
-What...
-Yes, they are.

422
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,994
(scoffs)

423
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,788
DOOSIK: Hey, head on up.
I'll be right there.

424
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,082
The weekly report...

425
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,792
Wait, Doosik...

426
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,716
-(coins clinking)
-(soft chuckle)

427
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,601
Uh, I have coins for you.

428
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,856
The machine's downstairs.

429
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:42,984
After you.

430
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,755
(soft music)

431
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,439
-(gunshot)
-(man groans)

432
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,069
SANGGU: Little spies,
hide as well as you can.

433
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,072
Hmm? If I catch you, you'll die.

434
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,699
(stifled cough)

435
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:41,042
(man coughing)

436
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,470
I heard you're the youngest
and top of your class, and I see why.

437
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,263
SANGGU: You're not even coughing.

438
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,892
Okay. Hey, uh,
go set off another gas bomb.

439
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,352
-(man coughs)
-(gunshot)

440
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,353
Huh?

441
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,106
SANGGU: Keep your eyes peeled!

442
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,235
Anyone who moves is a spy, got it?

443
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,277
AGENTS: Yes, sir!

444
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,707
Set off another tear gas, you shithead!

445
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,792
-(alarm ringing)
-(gasps)

446
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,255
(sighs)

447
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,218
-(clicks)
-(ringing stops)

448
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,825
MIHYUN: What am I doing?

449
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,713
WE WORK IN THE SHADOWS
TO PROTECT THE SUNLIT LAND

450
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,846
(Juwon clears throat)

451
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,433
Go on ahead.

452
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,979
Why is she, um,
handing you those so easily?

453
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,397
Hey, girl.

454
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,151
-Are those heavy?
-Boy, very.

455
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,822
-(Doosik inhales deeply)
-(Juwon splutters)

456
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,159
(chuckles)

457
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,161
Just a second.

458
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,915
I don't really like
to point out things like this, huh,

459
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,834
but calling me that the first time
was a mistake,

460
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,046
and you just called me "boy" again,
that wasn't a mistake, huh?

461
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,341
See, even just by looking,
you can tell I'm much older than you--

462
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,467
Mm, you're right.

463
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,095
You're eight years my senior, hun.

464
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,679
Hun?

465
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,642
(scoffs)

466
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,103
Now, you listen here.

467
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,772
Just because we're casual,
that's not very cool.

468
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,398
He's the boss, my senior.

469
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,902
As such, in this area, huh?

470
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,989
Look. See, there's a system around here,
where we have clear ranks--

471
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,325
MIHYUN: Oh? You're the 57th?

472
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,748
In this area, what was it you said?

473
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,210
System what? A clear rank?

474
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,462
You're, uh...

475
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,172
54th.

476
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,551
(sighs)
Oh, god.

477
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,510
(awkward chuckle)

478
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,929
(sighs)
No way.

479
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,809
Oh, are... are you serious?

480
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,063
Hold on, how old are you, then?

481
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,149
I was the youngest to graduate here.

482
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,191
(elevator dings)

483
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,488
So how did you know what year I...

484
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,074
(elevator doors closing)

485
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,299
(Juwon grunts angrily)

486
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,516
YONGJUN: Oh. You're alone again?

487
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:30,229
JUWON: Oh, Doosik is helping
an employee again. He'll be here soon.

488
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,900
YONGJUN: Mm, really?

489
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,862
You go ahead and get that wrapped up.

490
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,906
Wait, what about the weekly report?

491
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,575
Forget it, it's the same anyway.
We'll cut it.

492
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,827
Okay, good work.

493
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:47,955
(scoffs)

494
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,666
(sighs)
Seriously?

495
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,671
DOOSIK:
How did you know the year he graduated?

496
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,342
I'm an information analyst.

497
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,136
I'm able to access all information
unless it's top secret.

498
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,852
I didn't know
your partner's codename was Guryongpo.

499
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,647
It sounded interesting.

500
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,524
Like something out of martial arts.

501
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,027
Guryongpo.

502
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,114
Does it mean, like, nine dragons or what?

503
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,992
Uh...
(sucks teeth)

504
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,410
We normally...

505
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,539
uh, use our birthplaces for our codenames.

506
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,001
He was born in Pohang, Guryongpo.

507
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,963
Oh, Gwamegi.

508
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,758
(chuckles)

509
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,098
It's Min, right?

510
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,610
I thought you'd already know.

511
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:04,156
And you were already aware
that I was aware.

512
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,036
So you've known all about this.
Since when?

513
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,167
The stack that you carry,
it's always the same.

514
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,753
QUARTER 1 INFORMATION ANALYSIS
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT DIVISION

515
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,133
QUARTER 1 INFORMATION ANALYSIS

516
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,467
(soft chuckle)

517
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,013
-EMPLOYEE: Sir.
-YONGJUN: Mm-hm?

518
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,432
We'll step back
from the Namyang High incident.

519
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,146
Mm.

520
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,948
MIHYUN: The op has failed then.

521
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,201
DOOSIK: You look relieved about that.

522
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,581
Well, I'm sorry.

523
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,918
I had no choice,
it came directly from Mr. Min.

524
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,296
Yeah, I believe you.

525
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,507
(sighs)

526
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,634
Min's a very scary person.

527
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:10,514
He won't hesitate
to use whatever means necessary.

528
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,726
He'll use people as a tool
to reach his end goal.

529
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,811
I bet it was hard for you.

530
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,190
Well...

531
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,401
All the overtime was hard.

532
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,113
You did great.

533
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,742
I'm grateful, sir.

534
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,458
Um...

535
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,460
by the way,

536
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,339
could I ask you
about what the hardest part was?

537
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:50,554
Hmm... Honestly,
coffee isn't something I like.

538
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,641
Yeah, it's so bad.

539
00:39:56,185 --> 00:40:00,606
Hmm... It was hard missing dinner
when I worked overtime.

540
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,442
I need to be eating
all three meals every day.

541
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,029
Wait, I'm like that too.

542
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:17,039
NAMSAN DONKATSU

543
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,967
WOMAN: Here you are.

544
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,388
And for you.

545
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,433
Please enjoy your meal.

546
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,392
Thank you.

547
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,272
Wow. That's really a lot.

548
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,857
King Donkatsu.

549
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,570
We only get to sit down
'cause the rush is over.

550
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,780
You know, you give it 20 years

551
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:53,200
and this place will make Namsan
renown for donkatsu.

552
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,952
Still, it's too big.

553
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,248
It's really big.

554
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,084
Still, you should really try it.

555
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,920
Once you start eating, it's hard to stop.

556
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,672
So is donkatsu your favorite?

557
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:15,639
Ah! I mean,
this sauce has some secret magic to it.

558
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,642
It's very good.

559
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,646
Butter, ketchup, sugar, soy sauce,

560
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,275
onions, pepper, vinegar.

561
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,027
Mm.

562
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,613
And apples, I think.

563
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,365
Hang on, you're able to taste that?

564
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,746
My taste buds are very good, you know.
Very good.

565
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,375
I'm serious.

566
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,710
(exhales sharply)

567
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:46,795
I know.

568
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,602
What'll you do? You failed your operation.

569
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,357
It's all right.
It's not the first operation I messed up.

570
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,779
You've failed operations
before, too, right?

571
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:16,825
Just one time.

572
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,793
So you like Adlay tea, after all.

573
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,128
What?

574
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:33,717
When having tea or coffee with others,
usually the idea is

575
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:38,097
to talk while sipping it
rather than just...

576
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,391
drinking it?

577
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,524
(Mihyun chuckles)

578
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,027
(soft music)

579
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,634
So for that operation,

580
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,762
what exactly was your plan?

581
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:24,393
Well, on TV, the woman carries something
and runs into the man,

582
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,562
hmm, and gets close like that.

583
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,896
But that's a TV show.

584
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,232
It could happen in real life.

585
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,402
Oh, sure. And that person could be
an heir to an empire.

586
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,613
-(chuckles)
-You watch TV shows?

587
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,996
-You do.
-You know, sometimes.

588
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,666
Mihyun, I, uh...

589
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,209
(car horn honks)

590
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:56,050
Hey, boss. So what's taking you so long?

591
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,010
Oh...

592
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,559
(soft chuckle)

593
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,270
I was startled for a second.

594
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,730
(chuckles)

595
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,485
Hey, Mihyun.

596
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,529
Don't worry about...

597
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,741
Um, if you've been holding onto...

598
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,910
Just forget the assignment.

599
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,164
An agent can't forget.

600
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,750
Yeah, we can.

601
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,505
An intentional failure...

602
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,341
can't be a failure.

603
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,429
(sighs)

604
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,264
Great work.

605
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,017
You as well.

606
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,286
The cherry blossoms are falling quick.

607
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,414
Are you sad?

608
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,253
I think it'll be really hot this year.

609
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,429
(engine starts)

610
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,033
Hey, Jang,
can you pull over here for a sec?

611
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,535
Oh, sure. Hang on.

612
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,621
SUDEOK MART

613
00:45:55,961 --> 00:46:00,007
Hey, boss, why are you carrying
so many hundred-won coins?

614
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,050
Hey, don't touch them. They're mine.

615
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,552
JUWON: Did I say I'd take them?

616
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,139
Oh, good for you.

617
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,992
TEAR GAS

618
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,913
(suspenseful music)

619
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,555
FLASH BANG GRENADE

620
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,278
Hey. You idiot, that's not...

621
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,575
(explosion)

622
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,039
(Sanggu groans)

623
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,510
(sighs)

624
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,928
MIHYUN: I'm late.

625
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,976
(sighs)

626
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,187
MIHYUN: I was late today.

627
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,107
Seriously?

628
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,692
MIHYUN: I overslept.

629
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,528
I didn't set an alarm at all
and just slept.

630
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,867
I can't remember
the last time I woke up with the sun.

631
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,245
Mr. Kim, you were right.

632
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,542
An intentional failure can't be a failure.

633
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,503
I'm glad my words helped you.

634
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,009
So I'm gonna let it go.

635
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,641
-(high-pitched ringing)
-(soft tense music)

636
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,191
That bitch.

637
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,125
MAN 1: Go, run, get out.

638
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,170
-SANGGU: What? What the hell happened?
-MAN 2: Everybody, run!

639
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,379
(gunshots)

640
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,633
SANGGU: Pull yourselves together!
The spies are getting away!

641
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,010
(Sanggu groans)

642
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,013
(coughing)

643
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,438
SANGGU: Fuck!

644
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,900
What the fuck are you doing?
Eagle, can't you hear me?

645
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,818
Eagle! Hey, you little shit!

646
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,156
Those bastards are all running away!
What are you doing, you stupid idiot?

647
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,042
Coffee isn't really
a drink you like, right?

648
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,379
That's true.

649
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,630
But then...

650
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,302
I've grown to like it now.

651
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,813
If you knew that I was...

652
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,526
intentionally approaching you,
then why would you let me continue?

653
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,325
Why? 'Cause I'm pretty?
You liked my looks?

654
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,289
Yes.

655
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,710
I saw you and...

656
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,130
fell for you.

657
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,508
(quirky music)

658
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,350
It's hot.

659
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,978
(Mihyun coughs)

660
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,148
You okay?

661
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,913
Why are you watching Kim Doosik
this closely?

662
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:48,462
He hasn't failed an assignment
since the airplane crash in '87.

663
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,757
That wasn't an assignment.
He acted alone on that.

664
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,716
What?

665
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:58,138
An agent needs to do what he's told,
so why try to be the savior?

666
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:04,019
Wait, so then, which assignment was it
that Kim Doosik failed?

667
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,944
YONGJUN: The operation fell apart,

668
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,363
and the targets all slipped away.

669
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,243
In the chaos, the eagle who had been
the backup for the seagulls...

670
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,828
(inhales deeply)
...also failed

671
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,246
to finalize things that night.

672
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,917
So he was... The eagle's name was...

673
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,962
It was Kim Doosik.

674
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,684
(dramatic music)

675
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,313
(breathing shakily)

676
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,818
SANGGU: Eagle! Eagle!
What the fuck are you doing?

677
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,903
Eagle, can't you hear me? Eagle!

678
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,446
Hey, you little shit!

679
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,573
Those bastards are all running away!

680
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,992
What are you doing, you stupid idiot?

681
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,725
(closing theme music)
