1
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,791
<i>I'm not an ordinary man.</i>

2
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,541
<i>I have a strong ability
to work under pressure.</i>

3
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,541
<i>My parents are dead,
and I have no friends.</i>

4
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,708
<i>But all of these are
God's challenges for me.</i>

5
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,333
<i>I'm brilliant, talented,
diligent, and motivated.</i>

6
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,083
<i>Success is just around the corner.</i>

7
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,500
<i>But now, something is wrong.</i>

8
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:24,708
<i>I…</i>

9
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,666
<i>I haven't been able to sleep
in over half a year.</i>

10
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,708
It's here!

11
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,333
-Run!
-Everybody, run!

12
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,416
-Save yourself!
-Everybody, run!

13
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,916
Run! Hurry!

14
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,375
MISSED CALL

15
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,166
Open the door!

16
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,958
I know you're in there!

17
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,875
I'll break in if you don't open up!

18
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,166
You shameless bastard!

19
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,916
I tried talking to you
but you just won't listen, right?

20
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,666
You artists,

21
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,916
you're all freaks!

22
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,666
Come out now!

23
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,708
I have some leftovers. Eat them and leave!

24
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,250
Don't die at my house!

25
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,041
Open the door!

26
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,208
Open the damn door!

27
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,625
Open up!

28
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,750
Watch it!

29
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,083
<i>What are dreams?</i>

30
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,458
<i>Some people believe</i>

31
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,208
<i>that dreams are the reality
the soul encounters</i>

32
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,583
<i>after leaving the body.</i>

33
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,125
And the reality

34
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,958
is often another dream.

35
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,166
<i>When you always dream
of being chased by debts,</i>

36
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,666
the final payment is your life.

37
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,333
In fact,

38
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,333
<i>Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung</i>

39
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,833
<i>should both be called the Duke of Zhou.</i>

40
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,541
This world is a cage.

41
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,208
Humans are nothing but exiles
of a more advanced species.

42
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,000
Humans are too intelligent.

43
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,750
We all have great wisdom and strength.

44
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,041
<i>Once realized,</i>

45
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,208
<i>humans can understand the past</i>

46
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,375
<i>and change the future.</i>

47
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,625
<i>Then, become omnipotent.</i>

48
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,083
That's why those beings
only allow us to develop

49
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,041
10 to 15 percent of our brain capacity.

50
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,958
<i>The rest is off-limits.</i>

51
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,541
<i>So in every human brain,</i>

52
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,041
there's a horrific guardian

53
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,000
disguised as a nightmare,

54
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,500
punishing intruders with no mercy.

55
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,708
This is used to ward off nightmares.

56
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,708
WUDOU SUTRA

57
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,875
It was left by our ancestors.

58
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,916
Believe it, even if you don't want to.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,791
Whether it works for you
depends on your fate.

60
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,541
<i>According to Jung,</i>

61
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,791
<i>dreams are the path to the subconscious.</i>

62
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,583
Only in dreams can people go into
the darkest corners of their minds

63
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,500
<i>and see their true selves.</i>

64
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,958
Sometimes, they even scare themselves.

65
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,125
<i>Most schizophrenics</i>

66
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,333
become that way by seeing something
they weren't supposed to.

67
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,541
Sir.

68
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,625
Give me one.

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,833
ASSORTED PANCAKES

70
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,041
No eggs.

71
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:03,791
<i>The drizzling rain with soft wind
Leaning onto the street at dusk</i>

72
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:09,583
<i>With the wind still slapping my face
With rain no longer blurring my eyes</i>

73
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,416
<i>I looked up to the lonely street light</i>

74
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,541
<i>Where a sad love story came to my mind</i>

75
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,583
<i>I like you</i>

76
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,500
<i>I like your breathtaking eyes</i>

77
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,375
<i>I like your delightful laughter</i>

78
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,500
<i>Just like yesterday</i>

79
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,916
<i>You and me</i>

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,625
No eggs.

81
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,375
It's on me.

82
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,000
Here you are.

83
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,041
Thank you.

84
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,250
Why aren't you answering my calls?

85
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,541
-Why are you pushing me?
-I didn't.

86
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,041
-You did.
-I'll explain it later.

87
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,416
-No way.
-I'll explain it later!

88
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,250
Why are you running? Stop!

89
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,791
Don't run!

90
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,333
I'm really disappointed in you.

91
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,250
You're in breach of contract.

92
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,583
I can sue you,

93
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,708
do you understand?

94
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,750
San, I need to talk to you
about something serious.

95
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,166
This is

96
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,250
like a human mind.

97
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,541
All you see is a fish,

98
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,166
representing consciousness.

99
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,541
The rest of the water, which is empty,

100
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,083
represents the subconscious.

101
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,708
When consciousness leaves
the subconscious,

102
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,666
it's like a fish out of water.

103
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,458
Now, I'm just like that fish.

104
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,583
I can't live anymore.

105
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,750
Here are your noodles.

106
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,375
Watch your hands!

107
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,500
Is this still about your insomnia?

108
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,583
Nightmares come
as soon as I close my eyes.

109
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,208
At first, I thought I was schizophrenic.

110
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,416
Or even cursed.

111
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,083
-But I'm not.
-If you can't sleep, write the script!

112
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,208
I can't concentrate.

113
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,291
Then give me my deposit back.

114
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,125
I spent it all on doctors.

115
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,791
For what?

116
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,750
You're useless!

117
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,041
You don't write
and you're here making excuses.

118
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,500
I'll give you ten more days.

119
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,625
You think you have a unique talent?

120
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,208
Do you know how much pressure I'm under
for hiring you?

121
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,833
This is easy money for you!

122
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,125
And now you're pretending to be poor?

123
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,000
Liar!

124
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,583
You've gone too far.

125
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,625
I'm done.

126
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,708
-You're full?
-Yes.

127
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,708
Goodbye.

128
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,958
<i>San,</i>

129
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,500
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

130
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,166
<i>I can't write the script.</i>

131
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,291
<i>My debt to you
will have to be repaid in the next life.</i>

132
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,000
<i>I'm completely hopeless.</i>

133
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,458
<i>I can't fight the nightmare,</i>

134
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,250
<i>and I don't have the strength
to face reality.</i>

135
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,666
<i>What's more frightening is</i>

136
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,125
<i>I can't tell the difference
between reality</i>

137
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,666
<i>and nightmare.</i>

138
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,250
<i>This feeling</i>

139
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,916
<i>is too painful.</i>

140
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,333
<i>Everything I want</i>

141
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,541
<i>is getting further
and further away from me.</i>

142
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,958
<i>This life</i>

143
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,125
<i>is no longer meaningful.</i>

144
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,083
<i>I'm going to be with my parents.</i>

145
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,375
<i>Goodbye, my friend.</i>

146
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,666
<i>Hey! Want a pancake?</i>

147
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,291
The egg and sausage are on me!

148
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,875
So delicious!

149
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,500
I owe you for this,

150
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,541
but I can't pay you back.

151
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,541
Everyone has difficult moments in life.

152
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,791
There's nothing you can't get through.

153
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,250
Maybe I did horrible things
in my past life,

154
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,000
and I'm paying for them in this one.

155
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,541
Day and night.

156
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,541
Endlessly.

157
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,291
You're still young.

158
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,541
What's the worst that can happen to you?

159
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,000
Lose your love?

160
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,541
Lose your job?

161
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,750
Lose your virginity?

162
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,583
None of that
is more important than your life.

163
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:36,041
I haven't slept in a long time.

164
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,458
I die once every night.

165
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,333
Who the hell can bear that?

166
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,541
How about every night before you die,

167
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,125
you wake up first?

168
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,416
How?

169
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,875
I never got the chance to.

170
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,500
People

171
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,583
often talk about death.

172
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,291
"I don't want to live anymore."

173
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,250
"I'd be better off dead."

174
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,333
But they keep living
just the same, don't they?

175
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,666
So,

176
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,791
talking about death

177
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,625
reminds us that we're still alive.

178
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,000
By the same logic,

179
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,333
if you want to wake up,

180
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,750
just tell yourself,

181
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,583
"I'm dreaming."

182
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,833
You might just wake up.

183
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,458
It's badly damaged.

184
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,708
Twenty.

185
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,166
Sang Yu?

186
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,000
Is it really you?

187
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,250
What happened to you?

188
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,708
Do you need help?

189
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,041
You don't remember me, do you?

190
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,000
Let's go.

191
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,708
I'll take you to eat.

192
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,208
Come on.

193
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,416
Hello?

194
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,750
Someone here needs an ambulance.

195
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,625
<i>If you want to wake up,
just tell yourself,</i>

196
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,041
"I'm dreaming."

197
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,166
I'm dreaming.

198
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,208
I'm dreaming!

199
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,583
I'm dreaming!

200
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,333
I'm dreaming!

201
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,750
He's practicing.

202
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,291
Let's go over there.

203
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,000
You've got something? Let's have a look.

204
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,583
Hey, don't go.

205
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:19,541
It's really heavy.

206
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,958
You made it yourself?

207
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,791
This

208
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,833
can only be traded for this one.

209
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,791
It belonged to the Hegemon-King
of Western Chu.

210
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,500
His concubine died from this sword.

211
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,375
Hey, man.

212
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,250
He's right. These all have value.

213
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,375
It looks like a nice sword.

214
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,291
I'll take it for one thousand!

215
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,708
Go bother someone else!

216
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,000
Come on.

217
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,041
How about this?

218
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,833
Give me this sword
for two thousand in cash.

219
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,833
Hey, where are you going?

220
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,250
Don't go. I'll give you more!

221
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,041
TAIXIANG PAWNSHOP

222
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,875
No more than five thousand.

223
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,625
Thirty thousand, or I leave.

224
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,375
Or…

225
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,083
Or at least twenty thousand.

226
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,750
Hey, why are you standing like that?

227
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,708
Can't you stand properly?

228
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,208
Hello.

229
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,250
Hi.

230
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,375
I'd like a room.

231
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:52,125
Excuse me!

232
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,041
I'm dreaming.

233
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:21,041
I'm in a dream!

234
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,958
I'm dreaming!

235
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,416
I'm dreaming!

236
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:59,500
I'm having so much fun!

237
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,500
This is my place.

238
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:13,833
Fuck.

239
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:17,791
Get a car.

240
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:20,125
Have some dinner.

241
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,083
Good night.

242
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:23,458
You jerk!

243
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,375
I'm dreaming!

244
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,083
I'm dreaming!

245
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,541
How is it?

246
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,166
Very good.

247
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,708
TWO MILLION YUAN

248
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,125
That's right.

249
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:58,166
Mr. Sang, where is your fortune from?

250
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,666
Is that any of your business?

251
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:04,541
Don't get me wrong.

252
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,208
In this business,

253
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,416
everyone has their way.

254
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,416
Tomb raiding, smuggling…

255
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,166
Who knows where they come from?

256
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,833
And if anything happens, it is on us.

257
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:18,791
Are you done yet?

258
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:23,000
No offense.

259
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:30,208
You'll find that we,

260
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:31,916
by far, are your best option.

261
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,000
Mr. Sang,

262
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,416
we hope to see you often.

263
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,041
Sang Yu?

264
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:50,583
Sang Yu!

265
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,416
Hey!

266
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:09,958
What?

267
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,833
We weren't meeting until the next life.

268
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:15,708
Go to hell!

269
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:16,791
-Wait, hold on.
-What?

270
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,708
Let me buy you dinner.

271
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,250
Who are you kidding?

272
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,500
San,

273
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,166
let's talk over dinner.

274
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:31,833
If you don't foot the bill, I'll kill you.

275
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,958
Who were you trying to scare
with your last message?

276
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:36,791
Sang Yu.

277
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,875
How did you become like this?

278
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:41,000
You weren't like this before.

279
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,958
You didn't care about anything
but writing.

280
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,500
The old you were worth my respect.

281
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,375
Hey, I'm talking to you!

282
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:06,750
This is twenty thousand.

283
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,000
It's to pay you back.

284
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,083
I'm sorry, San.

285
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:18,833
I…

286
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:20,666
no longer write scripts.

287
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,000
Dude,

288
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,500
if you've found success,

289
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:36,041
show me the way.

290
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:21,541
Hello.

291
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:24,708
What would you like?

292
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:30,333
A latte, please.

293
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:36,583
Just a moment.

294
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,166
ASSORTED PANCAKES

295
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,708
Can I get you anything else?

296
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,000
Do you recognize me?

297
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:12,041
I'll recognize you the next time you come.

298
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,333
Why are you selling your café?

299
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:23,458
Not enough customers. I'm losing money.

300
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:26,208
-How much are you selling it for?
-Why?

301
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:27,416
You want it?

302
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,750
How much do you want?

303
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:32,083
Rent, renovation, and equipment…

304
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,666
At least 1.5 million.

305
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,750
<i>Lately, I want to confess.</i>

306
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:44,458
It's easy for you!

307
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:46,333
Look, here's how I see it.

308
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:47,708
You're a scriptwriter.

309
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,208
You are good with words,
and you express yourself beautifully.

310
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,000
Most importantly, you are rich!

311
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,833
She'll definitely accept you.

312
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:58,041
Money has long been a catalyst for love.

313
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,708
You'll surely win her over.

314
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:21,500
All right.

315
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,041
I'm leaving.

316
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:27,416
If you need anything, call me.

317
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,375
I'm leaving!

318
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:18,791
I'm dreaming!

319
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:29,666
What?

320
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,250
Dude, do you have superpowers?

321
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,333
It must be God's will.

322
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:41,125
You're being paid back
for all your suffering.

323
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,333
There's a light behind you.

324
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:45,833
All right, San.

325
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:46,750
Cut it out.

326
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,625
If there's ever anything,

327
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,208
I will help you.

328
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,875
From now on,

329
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,666
you're my brother.

330
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,833
-Get up.
-No, I won't.

331
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,708
What is the meaning of this?

332
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,500
I want to take over this shop.

333
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:16,375
But I hope you can stay and run it.

334
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,583
I'll cover the losses.

335
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:20,166
We'll share

336
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:22,416
the profit.

337
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:29,958
Hey.

338
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:33,916
Do you have time later?

339
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,125
<i>This restaurant is really good.</i>

340
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,000
<i>They have a table reserved only for me.</i>

341
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:39,916
<i>See what you want to eat.</i>

342
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,583
Sang Yu…

343
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:51,875
I feel like I've heard that name before.

344
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:58,291
It's in the proverb,
"Lose something to gain something."

345
00:39:58,375 --> 00:39:59,958
It's a common name.

346
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:01,166
And a tacky one.

347
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,541
Why do you want to take over the shop?

348
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,375
I…

349
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,791
I'm quite a fan of coffee.

350
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,541
I happened to walk past your shop.

351
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,750
But I don't know how to run it

352
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,666
and I think you're doing a good job.

353
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,583
Really.

354
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:26,458
What's good about it?

355
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:27,750
I'm losing money.

356
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,125
A shop like yours

357
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:32,375
needs nurturing.

358
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:35,000
Give it time and it'll be fine.

359
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:38,625
Fondness is fondness,

360
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,041
and business is business.

361
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,416
I'll send you a contract tomorrow.

362
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,708
We'll bear the profits and losses equally.

363
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:50,125
It's your call.

364
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,416
Business is business.

365
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,250
I trust you.

366
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:06,041
You're not just interested in
the café, are you?

367
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,083
If you're married

368
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,833
or taken,

369
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,291
then don't waste your breath.

370
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:16,541
I'm dreaming.

371
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:24,583
I fell asleep.

372
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:26,583
-Thank you. Careful, it's hot.
-Okay.

373
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,250
Sorry, our tables are all full.

374
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,916
-It's okay, I'll get it to go.
-Me too.

375
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,208
I want an Americano.

376
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,250
Here you are.

377
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:41,500
Please wait a minute.

378
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,375
Sorry, we're very busy.

379
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:46,333
Thank you.

380
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:06,166
ASSORTED PANCAKES

381
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:11,166
You're in my way.
Don't you see I'm handing out money?

382
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,708
I've been standing for so long!

383
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:14,125
Let me get some of that.

384
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:15,958
Get in there. I'm watching you guys.

385
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:19,833
ASSORTED PANCAKES

386
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:23,208
Thank you.

387
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:47,708
<i>In my shop…</i>

388
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,958
<i>No, wait. It's our shop.</i>

389
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,916
I've never seen so many customers before.

390
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,791
You must have brought good luck.

391
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,166
No.

392
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:01,000
I've also never drunk
so much coffee before.

393
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:02,125
Five cups.

394
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:03,708
It was six.

395
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,375
Six?

396
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,916
You didn't go to work today.
You're not busy?

397
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:15,041
I usually work at night.

398
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:17,708
A security guard?

399
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:24,458
How about you give me three keywords

400
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:27,250
and I'll guess what your job is.

401
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:29,416
-You won't be able to guess.
-Let me try!

402
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,125
Guessing doesn't cost anything.

403
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,625
Dream.

404
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:37,708
Seek.

405
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,083
Gain.

406
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:43,666
I've got it.

407
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,958
You're a scriptwriter.

408
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:47,916
I got it right?

409
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,875
How did you guess I was a scriptwriter?

410
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,750
Well, writing a story

411
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,250
is like weaving a dream.

412
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,250
After that, you seek.

413
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,833
The main characters either seek love

414
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,333
or seek to find themselves.

415
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:01,291
And then, you gain.

416
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:03,666
You always gain something
at the end of a story.

417
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,333
Either success

418
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:07,291
or experience.

419
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:58,625
I'm dreaming!

420
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:03,625
Who's there? What?

421
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:05,041
What are you doing?

422
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:12,500
Thank you.

423
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,500
Are you really planning

424
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,250
to walk me home every day?

425
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:25,166
Maybe.

426
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:29,083
It's the least I can do for my partner.

427
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:30,041
Wrong.

428
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:32,166
You also drink six coffees every day.

429
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,500
Your car?

430
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:42,625
Want to give it a spin?

431
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,333
I haven't driven in ages.

432
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:45,791
No problem.

433
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:47,291
Don't worry about crashing.

434
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:49,833
Don't worry? I can't afford to fix it!

435
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,833
-Is it really fine?
-No problem.

436
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:13,583
Actually,

437
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,333
this car is for you.

438
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:23,583
You're really rich, aren't you?

439
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:30,916
You must be a very famous scriptwriter.

440
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,916
Let's talk like scriptwriters then.

441
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:37,250
Which do you choose? Gentle or direct?

442
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,208
Gentle.

443
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:46,375
Being single for so many years

444
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:51,458
isn't because I want a car, a mansion,
or anything else.

445
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:56,125
Hey, how much money do you have?

446
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,458
Tell me.

447
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,250
Usually, I combine work and rest.

448
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:11,458
Go out, see the world, and learn things.

449
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:13,833
You wore your school uniform here?

450
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:15,708
Listen.

451
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:18,916
<i>I looked up to the lonely street light</i>

452
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,291
<i>Where a sad love story came to my mind</i>

453
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,708
<i>I like you</i>

454
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:29,416
<i>I like your breathtaking eyes</i>

455
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,666
<i>I like your delightful laughter</i>

456
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,333
<i>I wish</i>

457
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:38,458
<i>To gently caress</i>

458
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:41,375
<i>Your lovely face again</i>

459
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:44,041
<i>To hold hands and talk in our dreams</i>

460
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:47,416
<i>Just like yesterday</i>

461
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,291
<i>You and me</i>

462
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:50,416
Who are you?

463
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:52,250
Sang Yu.

464
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:56,041
<i>Every night, I walk with my shadow</i>

465
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:58,666
<i>Wandering around</i>

466
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,583
<i>Feeling so cold</i>

467
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,125
What are you looking at, little punk?
Go home!

468
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:07,875
<i>I used to live in my own world</i>

469
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:10,625
<i>Without ever knowing</i>

470
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:13,750
<i>His pain</i>

471
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:22,250
<i>I like you</i>

472
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:25,000
<i>I like your breathtaking eyes</i>

473
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:28,041
<i>I like your delightful laughter</i>

474
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:31,166
<i>I wish</i>

475
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:34,041
<i>To gently caress</i>

476
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,875
<i>Your lovely face again</i>

477
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:39,708
<i>To hold hands and talk in our dreams</i>

478
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:43,083
<i>Just like yesterday</i>

479
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:47,000
<i>You and me</i>

480
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:01,333
When can we see a movie you've written?

481
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,458
I'm really curious

482
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:08,958
about what kind of stories you write.

483
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:33,916
A mocha, please.

484
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,375
Man, what is this?

485
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,333
I don't need you to write these anymore.

486
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,375
Goodness.

487
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:03,166
<i>Let's talk like scriptwriters then.</i>

488
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,791
<i>Which do you choose? Gentle or direct?</i>

489
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:07,541
<i>What about direct?</i>

490
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,000
<i>I can dump</i>

491
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,000
<i>three guys like you in a year.</i>

492
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,333
I'm dreaming.

493
00:52:56,958 --> 00:52:58,083
What are you doing?

494
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:03,000
What's in your hand?

495
00:53:04,416 --> 00:53:05,500
What are you doing?

496
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,375
Did you get this from your dream too?

497
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:11,791
It's amazing!

498
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,083
So touching!

499
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:15,375
<i>Who wrote this? This script is awesome!</i>

500
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,750
<i>I'll take it for 200,000!</i>

501
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:19,416
Only 200,000? Are you kidding!

502
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,708
The scriptwriter doesn't want money.

503
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,875
But he has a condition.

504
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:25,583
He wants the biggest stars
for the male and female leads.

505
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:28,333
-San.
-This time, I want double.

506
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:31,291
Are you kidding?
I'm only investing five million.

507
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,583
I can't afford them.

508
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:34,500
I'll invest.

509
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:37,041
I'll give you 100 million.

510
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:39,791
<i>Sang Yu,</i>

511
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:43,041
<i>once a humble young talent,</i>

512
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:46,500
<i>has begun his rise to fame</i>

513
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:49,583
<i>by becoming China's
most promising scriptwriter.</i>

514
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,166
<i>Molding his craft for ten years,</i>

515
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,000
<i>he is now a major player in the industry.</i>

516
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:56,541
<i>If you're not interested,
I can find someone else.</i>

517
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,041
<i>Many are interested in it.</i>

518
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:01,041
<i>I can sell it to someone else,
buy it back, and sell it to you</i>

519
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,208
<i>at ten times the price.</i>

520
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:06,250
<i>He started reading at the age of three,
writing poems at five,</i>

521
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:07,875
<i>producing at seven.</i>

522
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:11,375
<i>He is nicknamed
the Asian Shakespeare of Cinema.</i>

523
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:14,791
<i>He caught the industry's attention
during his college years.</i>

524
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,333
<i>He kept a low profile</i>

525
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:19,583
<i>whilst working with famous directors.</i>

526
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:22,583
All right, we'll do it.

527
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:24,458
<i>We'll get the contract ready</i>

528
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:26,916
and transfer the first payment tomorrow.

529
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:33,458
<i>He had the chance to become
an overnight star,</i>

530
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:35,583
<i>but he chose to reject fame.</i>

531
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:38,708
<i>He wanted a fulfilling life.</i>

532
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:42,083
<i>So he gave up ownership of all his work</i>

533
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:44,833
<i>and refused any media coverage.</i>

534
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:47,416
<i>During this time, he traveled the world,</i>

535
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,541
<i>collecting vast amounts
of writing material.</i>

536
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:53,458
<i>Today, he has 20 top film projects</i>

537
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:54,791
<i>in development.</i>

538
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,958
<i>Undoubtedly, this is huge
for the Chinese movie industry.</i>

539
00:54:58,041 --> 00:54:59,458
Isn't this a little overboard?

540
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:01,208
This is how everybody gets started.

541
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:08,291
Actually, I'm not as good as it says.

542
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:09,916
For a long time,

543
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,500
I couldn't write a good script

544
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:14,000
because I didn't know why I was writing.

545
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:16,583
But now,

546
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:18,208
I have a new direction.

547
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:19,958
And because of this direction,

548
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:21,458
I will be a better person.

549
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:22,666
Thank you all.

550
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,083
Incredible.

551
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,958
Not even Tyson has one of these.

552
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,916
What's on your mind, Mr. Sang?

553
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:18,083
Lately, I've come to realize something.

554
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,041
All the success stories in the world

555
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:22,500
come from two kinds of people.

556
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:24,166
The first kind

557
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:26,208
is cheaters.

558
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,708
They sacrifice time for things
others aren't willing to sacrifice,

559
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:34,458
such as love, family,
friendship, and entertainment.

560
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:37,625
In exchange for even more time

561
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:40,208
to achieve what they believe is a success.

562
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:43,125
The other kind is thieves.

563
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:45,333
Or what they call geniuses.

564
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:49,291
They invent things that change the world.

565
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,250
But did they really invent them?

566
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,583
All inventions
are actually just discoveries.

567
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:02,041
Another world exists around everyone.

568
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:04,708
You can't see it or feel it,

569
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,500
but the moment you find power
in that world

570
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:10,708
and draw from it to use in this one,

571
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,208
it becomes a kind of invention.

572
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,875
That's the door I went through.

573
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,375
But something is missing.

574
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:27,041
-I can't just keep thinking about myself.
-Look.

575
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:29,250
What is happening here

576
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,583
is God's will.

577
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:36,083
God chose you, so he chose the right man.

578
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:40,125
Tell me if you think
we can make this work.

579
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:42,291
Throughout history,

580
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:46,541
only two things have caused death
on a mass scale.

581
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,666
The first is natural disasters,

582
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,416
and the second is wars.

583
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:53,958
So, what is the root cause of war?

584
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:56,500
It's poverty.

585
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,416
Therefore, only by eliminating poverty

586
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,208
can we eliminate war.

587
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,708
And only you can do that.

588
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,291
We should build Sang Yu Tower.

589
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:09,000
It should be at least
twice as tall as Burj Khalifa.

590
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,750
<i>We'll invite all the starving
and homeless people</i>

591
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:13,041
<i>in the world.</i>

592
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:14,791
<i>Like refugees and pirates.</i>

593
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:17,083
<i>Food, shelter, entertainment,
and education</i>

594
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:18,083
will all be free!

595
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:19,958
We could build one in each country!

596
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:21,666
Starting next year,

597
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,750
every single Nobel Peace Prize

598
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,125
<i>will be yours!</i>

599
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:28,166
<i>If you think this works,
I'll get started right now!</i>

600
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,875
You're awesome, Mr. Sang!

601
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:42,416
I've never seen my shop
from this perspective before.

602
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,000
Look over there.

603
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:51,458
I once thought this city's beauty

604
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:52,791
had nothing to do with me.

605
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,375
But now,

606
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:57,708
because of you,

607
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:01,333
I think I can make this city

608
01:00:01,416 --> 01:00:02,750
shine even more.

609
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:17,125
<i>Now…</i>

610
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:20,541
I feel truly alive.

611
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:24,750
I never hoped to win you over.

612
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:27,708
Spending every day with you like this

613
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:30,916
is enough for me.

614
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:41,583
How long can you keep it up?

615
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:47,333
From the day you suddenly appeared,

616
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:50,625
how long until you suddenly leave?

617
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:07,500
I'll never leave you.

618
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,375
<i>You probably don't remember me.</i>

619
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:20,000
<i>I skipped many classes</i>

620
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:23,416
to watch movies with you.

621
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,791
If I was that boy today,

622
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,291
would you still be with me?

623
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,166
You…

624
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:15,583
Sang Yu?

625
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:29,666
Sang Yu?

626
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,958
Are you okay?

627
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:33,916
Sang Yu?

628
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:49,333
<i>Making you love me</i>

629
01:02:49,416 --> 01:02:51,250
<i>Is simple</i>

630
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:53,666
<i>But meeting you</i>

631
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,958
<i>Is so hard</i>

632
01:02:57,375 --> 01:03:02,125
<i>You ride a boat with sails raised</i>

633
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:06,333
<i>To the opposite shore</i>

634
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:14,583
<i>It's so simple for men
And women to fall in love</i>

635
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:18,750
<i>When trapped in their obsession with you</i>

636
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:25,083
<i>The boat overturns</i>

637
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:30,000
<i>And your wounds start to rot</i>

638
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:45,041
Mr. Sang?

639
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:51,000
Mr. Sang!

640
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:56,333
Why are you here drinking alone?

641
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:00,208
We're having a blast out there.

642
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:02,875
Come out and have some fun with me.

643
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:03,916
I'm tired.

644
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:10,416
Did you get into a fight with Hua'er?

645
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:22,083
Well, women…

646
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,500
First, they zero in on getting your body.

647
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:27,500
Then, they ask for all your attention.

648
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:29,125
Once you're obsessed,

649
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:30,541
you think it's true love.

650
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:32,500
You think she's the one.

651
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:35,750
And you think she's different
from other women on earth.

652
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:38,125
You feel like she doesn't want
anything from you.

653
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,833
-And you think--
-San.

654
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:42,750
After everything we've taken,

655
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:44,791
will there be retribution?

656
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,708
You're the one who took it all.

657
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:53,083
And you took what was yours.

658
01:04:53,166 --> 01:04:54,916
You didn't take anything from others.

659
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,333
Why would there be one?

660
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:58,375
You really didn't fight with Hua'er?

661
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:00,708
Do you remember the door I told you about?

662
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:03,541
One day,

663
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,791
I might go through it and not come back.

664
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:09,916
What are you saying?

665
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,208
Go to sleep and not come back?

666
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:15,375
You've just been too tired lately.

667
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:17,291
Get some rest.

668
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:19,333
Go to sleep early tonight.

669
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:33,791
What are you doing?

670
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:46,041
I want to sleep alone tonight.

671
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,250
Right.

672
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:52,291
You're tired, take a day off.

673
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:53,750
Sleep it off,

674
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:55,625
and it'll all be in the past.

675
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:54,291
<i>If you want to wake up,</i>

676
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:55,375
<i>just tell yourself,</i>

677
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:56,833
"I'm dreaming."

678
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:59,125
I'm dreaming!

679
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:27,416
What are you doing?

680
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,666
What are you doing?

681
01:08:58,458 --> 01:08:59,916
Stop messing around, man.

682
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:02,125
I have important things to do.

683
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:04,125
You've done pretty well for yourself.

684
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:06,000
You're famous.

685
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:07,916
No more pawnshops.

686
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:11,333
Heroes fear old friends.

687
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:14,375
How much do you want? Tell me.

688
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:15,750
Five million.

689
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,000
I'll make a call.

690
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:19,083
Who gave you the right to bargain?

691
01:09:19,166 --> 01:09:20,166
Qiang.

692
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,291
Qiang.

693
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:24,416
What are you doing?

694
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,208
How much do you think you're worth?

695
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:29,750
Give me a price.

696
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,625
I'll give you ten million

697
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:34,750
to never bother me again.

698
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,416
US dollars.

699
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,083
Okay. You can make the call.

700
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,208
-Where is he?
-The money?

701
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,916
Cut the crap! Where is he?

702
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:16,166
Where is he?

703
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,166
Actually,

704
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:23,916
this has nothing to do with me.

705
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,791
I'm just doing someone a favor

706
01:10:25,875 --> 01:10:27,791
and delivering money.

707
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:31,333
He repeatedly urged me

708
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:33,791
to see the hostage
before handing over the cash.

709
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:37,458
I can't have the cash taken
without seeing the hostage.

710
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:40,041
That's not proper etiquette,
don't you think?

711
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:46,500
Who is Hua'er?

712
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:48,416
Your new girl?

713
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:50,791
Give it back.

714
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:52,833
BANK BALANCE

715
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:56,791
I underestimated you.

716
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:59,500
No wonder you're so confident.

717
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,583
A million, ten million, a hundred million…

718
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:05,833
Just in the bank,
you have three hundred million.

719
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:07,250
What exactly do you do?

720
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:10,458
I asked for too little.

721
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:12,208
I definitely asked for too little.

722
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:13,291
Qiang.

723
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:16,375
Something bad is happening to me.

724
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:19,250
I won't live much longer.

725
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:22,000
You can have all my money,
but please let us go.

726
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:23,625
Let me take care of one last thing

727
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:24,875
as a thank you.

728
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,666
What's going on?

729
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:35,500
Sang Yu.

730
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,083
Are you okay?

731
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:38,750
What did they do to you?

732
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:41,708
Do you, sons of bitches,
have any idea who he is?

733
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:43,291
Can you handle the consequences?

734
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:44,791
Hey! You on the couch--

735
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:49,875
San?

736
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:52,000
-Put everything else aside for now.
-San.

737
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:53,875
Let's take care of our business first.

738
01:11:58,750 --> 01:11:59,916
Mr. Sang,

739
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,958
you're back.

740
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:09,500
Mr. San?

741
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:12,833
What happened to him?

742
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:16,208
-He's drunk.
-Oh, he's drunk.

743
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,416
Delivery.

744
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,916
You have a nice place.

745
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:39,125
This can't be right.

746
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,458
No, Qiang.

747
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:43,750
There should be more
in the house than this.

748
01:12:49,416 --> 01:12:51,041
Just leave when you're finished.

749
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:52,541
No problem.

750
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:54,458
Just call the owner to get it.

751
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:45,166
How did you get all this stuff?

752
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:50,000
I traded my life for it.

753
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:52,333
Everyone's money comes
at the cost of their life.

754
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:54,666
Why is your life worth so much money?

755
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:01,750
Put that down.

756
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:03,666
We don't need to move that.

757
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:04,958
Come on, Qiang.

758
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:07,291
You can take everything.
I'll agree with it.

759
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:08,791
I won't call the cops.

760
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,625
But if you kill me,

761
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:13,416
it's a crime.

762
01:14:14,958 --> 01:14:18,083
A one-time thief doesn't want
to steal for a lifetime.

763
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,125
But he

764
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:20,833
is still a thief.

765
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:22,916
A person who betrays himself

766
01:14:23,791 --> 01:14:25,083
can never control

767
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,416
his own destiny.

768
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:31,208
<i>Mr. Sang.</i>

769
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,166
Mr. Sang, are you there?

770
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:38,000
<i>Mr. Sang, are you okay?</i>

771
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:44,166
-What is it?
<i>-Mr. Sang, you have a guest.</i>

772
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,291
<i>It's a woman called Hua'er.</i>

773
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:48,333
<i>-Should I let her up?</i>
-Mr. Sang isn't here.

774
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:50,625
-Tell her to come another day.
-Sang Yu?

775
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:52,416
<i>What are you hiding from?</i>

776
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,458
I'm hiding from you! Leave!

777
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:57,041
<i>Leave now!</i>

778
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:00,166
Did something happen to you?

779
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,833
<i>Mr. Sang, let her come up.</i>

780
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:05,000
-You can talk in person.
-Shut up!

781
01:15:05,916 --> 01:15:07,916
<i>Do you remember what you said?</i>

782
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,458
<i>You can dump three guys like me in a year.</i>

783
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:12,083
You can add me to that today.

784
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:15,958
This whole thing

785
01:15:17,541 --> 01:15:19,625
is making up for past regrets, isn't it?

786
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:28,416
Ma'am,

787
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,958
the door is open.

788
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,375
Don't move! I'll strangle you if you do!

789
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,333
Sang Yu.

790
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:58,583
Are you here, Sang Yu?

791
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:01,041
Are you okay?

792
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:02,958
Sang Yu…

793
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:04,458
Don't take it off!

794
01:16:05,416 --> 01:16:07,291
If you take it off, you won't live.

795
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:10,125
An old lover.

796
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:13,000
You've got the money
and are starting to enjoy it.

797
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:14,166
Who are you?

798
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,416
What do you want?

799
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:17,125
You want money, right?

800
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:18,916
I have a café, it's worth some money.

801
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,375
You can have it all.

802
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,666
-Hua'er…
-Sang Yu…

803
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:28,833
Don't touch her! Don't you dare touch her!

804
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:30,416
-Don't touch her!
-Sang Yu…

805
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:36,041
Qiang.

806
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,125
Qiang, I was wrong.

807
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:39,708
I'm begging you, let her go.

808
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:41,166
You can have everything.

809
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,625
I still have more.

810
01:16:42,708 --> 01:16:44,458
I have more. They're all yours.

811
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:46,333
I'm begging you.

812
01:16:58,708 --> 01:17:00,041
Sang Yu.

813
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:07,000
It's your first time here too, isn't it?

814
01:17:10,666 --> 01:17:12,416
Do you know what he does?

815
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:15,958
A famous scriptwriter?

816
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,791
Do you think all of these

817
01:17:19,875 --> 01:17:21,333
were written by hand?

818
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:22,541
Qiang.

819
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:25,000
Qiang, you don't have to do this.

820
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:26,750
We agreed to come for money.

821
01:17:27,541 --> 01:17:28,583
Huabi…

822
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:29,666
Qiang!

823
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,458
Qiang.

824
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:34,833
Take the money, not lives!

825
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:39,333
Qiang,

826
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:40,458
take money…

827
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:41,916
Qiang--

828
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,416
Why couldn't you just shut up?

829
01:17:57,583 --> 01:18:00,583
There are people
who suddenly appear in our lives

830
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,041
that seem like bad guys.

831
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:04,458
And we

832
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:07,416
complain about our bad luck,

833
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,125
instead of considering

834
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:11,583
how we might have called them
into our lives.

835
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:13,833
Actually, these bad guys are good people.

836
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:15,583
They come into our lives

837
01:18:15,666 --> 01:18:17,708
to remind us.

838
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:19,666
It's just too late for him.

839
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,250
But you're a smart person.

840
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,833
Kill them. All of them.

841
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:52,458
You sons of bitches!

842
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:57,833
Sang Yu!

843
01:18:57,916 --> 01:18:59,166
Are you crazy?

844
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:03,500
Don't move!

845
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:10,541
Don't move!

846
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:11,750
What are you doing?

847
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:14,375
Go!

848
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:29,583
Sang Yu!

849
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:35,416
Just hang on until we get out, okay?

850
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,458
Hurry!

851
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:33,083
Hurry!

852
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:35,166
Go!

853
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:29,625
<i>Id, ego, and super-ego</i>

854
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:32,083
<i>form the human psyche.</i>

855
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:33,458
<i>In the real world,</i>

856
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:36,375
<i>the ego is restrained by social norms.</i>

857
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:37,875
<i>In dreams,</i>

858
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:41,333
<i>it's the id that releases
primitive human desires.</i>

859
01:24:41,416 --> 01:24:45,416
<i>And the super-ego acts against the id</i>

860
01:24:46,083 --> 01:24:48,291
<i>while manipulating the ego.</i>

861
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:07,541
<i>Don't let money be your label.</i>

862
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,750
I'm…

863
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:24,250
dreaming.

864
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:27,000
I'm dreaming.

865
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:30,250
I'm dreaming.

866
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:33,166
I'm dreaming.

867
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:36,166
I'm dreaming.

868
01:26:37,083 --> 01:26:38,500
I'm dreaming.

869
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:44,166
<i>Come out now!</i>

870
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,166
I have some leftovers. Eat them and leave!

871
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,375
Don't die at my house!

872
01:27:57,625 --> 01:27:59,750
You think you have a unique talent?

873
01:28:01,375 --> 01:28:03,416
This is easy money for you!

874
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,000
You've gone too far.

875
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:43,375
I'm…

876
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:48,875
I'm dreaming.

877
01:30:08,833 --> 01:30:09,791
<i>Sang Yu.</i>

878
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:13,208
Sang Yu?

879
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:18,875
Sang Yu?

880
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:31,541
Is it really you?

881
01:30:34,416 --> 01:30:36,000
What happened to you?

882
01:30:41,916 --> 01:30:43,000
Don't eat this.

883
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:46,916
Let's go.

884
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:49,250
I'll take you to eat.

885
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:53,500
Eat up.

886
01:30:53,583 --> 01:30:54,916
You must be starving.

887
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:26,583
Little punk.

888
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:29,833
In a magazine,

889
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:33,458
I saw a story written by someone
named Sang Yu.

890
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:36,916
I thought it was you.

891
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:39,625
You were right to keep writing.

892
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:41,041
You're very good.

893
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:44,541
All you need is a little luck.

894
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,375
I can't help you with much.

895
01:31:54,791 --> 01:31:56,208
But if you want,

896
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,083
you can work at my café.

897
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:01,541
Sang Yu.

898
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:04,083
This is for you.

899
01:33:11,958 --> 01:33:13,083
I can't take it.

900
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:15,083
It's too much.

901
01:33:16,166 --> 01:33:18,916
Then consider it
my investment in your script.

902
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,416
If you make money, it's yours.

903
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,125
If you lose money, it's on me.

904
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,166
I don't want to write scripts.

905
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:28,375
I can't write what others
want me to write.

906
01:33:28,458 --> 01:33:31,125
Write about what you want to write then.

907
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:41,708
You look good.

908
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:50,583
I've heard many excuses
for extending deadlines.

909
01:33:50,666 --> 01:33:52,458
Some say they lost their files.

910
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:55,375
Some say they got water on their computer.

911
01:33:56,458 --> 01:33:58,125
Some got water in their brains.

912
01:33:59,208 --> 01:34:00,708
But you're something else,

913
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:02,750
talking about the next life.

914
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:05,375
Thank you, San.

915
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:08,541
But I really…

916
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:11,833
can't write that script.

917
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,541
I borrowed ten thousand from someone.

918
01:34:15,375 --> 01:34:16,708
It's to pay you back.

919
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:19,041
Sorry for the trouble.

920
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,833
That script you wrote before…

921
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:33,875
I sold it.

922
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:35,875
They said your writing was pretty good.

923
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:37,791
From now on,

924
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:41,208
you should write thrillers.

925
01:34:42,291 --> 01:34:43,250
Here.

926
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:50,583
What are you looking at?

927
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:54,000
You won't even buy me a bowl of noodles?

928
01:35:03,166 --> 01:35:04,375
<i>In this world,</i>

929
01:35:04,916 --> 01:35:08,333
<i>people think of time
as an unchangeable dimension.</i>

930
01:35:08,416 --> 01:35:09,791
<i>But in dreams,</i>

931
01:35:09,875 --> 01:35:12,208
we each have this ability.

932
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:15,333
We can put time in any order we like.

933
01:35:15,416 --> 01:35:17,958
Life then has limitless possibilities.

934
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:20,583
As your time here ends,

935
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:22,375
on another timeline,

936
01:35:22,458 --> 01:35:24,708
<i>you might be living
a completely different life.</i>

937
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:50,583
Sir.

938
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:54,375
With egg and sausage. Thank you.

939
01:36:08,333 --> 01:36:09,583
This belongs to you.

940
01:36:15,375 --> 01:36:17,083
I appreciate the sentiment.

941
01:36:17,166 --> 01:36:19,500
But it's money you traded your life for.

942
01:36:19,583 --> 01:36:21,041
I can't accept that.

943
01:36:25,041 --> 01:36:26,041
Look.

944
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:35,666
I traded mine too, once.

945
01:36:41,041 --> 01:36:42,666
I'm happier where I am now.

946
01:37:55,916 --> 01:37:57,125
<i>Sang Yu.</i>

947
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:00,458
<i>Sang Yu?</i>

948
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,583
Sang Yu?

949
01:38:07,541 --> 01:38:08,583
Don't eat this.

950
01:38:11,041 --> 01:38:11,916
Let's go.

951
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,375
I'll take you to eat.

952
01:43:09,625 --> 01:43:14,625
