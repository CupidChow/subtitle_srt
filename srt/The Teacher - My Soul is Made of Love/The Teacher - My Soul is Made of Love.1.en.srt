1
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,000
I signed already.

2
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,332
There's one more.

3
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,749
There are two.

4
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,790
One for Marriage Equality.

5
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,500
One for Gender Equality Education.

6
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,958
Please sign the Marriage Equality petition.

7
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,666
Please support marriage equality.

8
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,791
Please support marriage equality.

9
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,583
I just want to cuddle, that's all.

10
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,041
Behave yourselves.

11
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,750
No funny business.

12
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,416
Hold on.

13
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,916
You're choking me.

14
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,250
Go brush your teeth.

15
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,583
Two egg pancakes.

16
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,166
So, what do you do?

17
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,750
Me?

18
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,625
I'm a teacher.

19
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,250
A teacher? -Yes.

20
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,458
Can't you tell?

21
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,875
What do you teach?

22
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,125
Civics.

23
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,583
What do you do?

24
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,875
My family has a factory.

25
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,333
How'd you get that?

26
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,083
When I was little,

27
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,041
It's OK to discuss? -Sure.

28
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,500
I was burned by boiling oil.

29
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,999
It also gave me

30
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,291
a bit of a speech impediment.

31
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:33,791
Oh?

32
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,625
You burned your tongue as well?

33
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,500
I was totally covered.

34
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,625
Seriously? -Yes.

35
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,166
But your head looks fine.

36
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,041
It's covered in scars.

37
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,958
And if you weren't a teacher?

38
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,125
Hum...

39
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,916
Let me think...

40
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,958
How about 'being your lover'?

41
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,541
Just kidding.

42
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,583
Just kidding.

43
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,250
I'm just messing around.

44
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,500
I'd do something for my ideals.

45
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,458
Like what?

46
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,541
I'd have chosen to be

47
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,208
a politician.

48
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,000
Would I be good?

49
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,208
Please vote for No. 151.

50
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,458
Kevin Chang.

51
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,625
You can call me Kevin.

52
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,125
Easy to remember.

53
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,750
Yes?

54
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,540
Can you turn off the light?

55
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,541
Thanks.

56
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:56,875
What's wrong with this?

57
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,125
Is that right?

58
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,083
What's so funny?

59
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,415
Is that right?

60
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,540
Like this? -Lower.

61
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,666
Lower?

62
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,625
Fantastic!

63
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,583
A projection screen with

64
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,041
free will.

65
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:23,916
Done.

66
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,124
Let's talk about self-development.

67
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,958
When growing up, you might...

68
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,083
What is it?

69
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,166
What's so funny?

70
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,749
Have you ever thought about

71
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,333
your self-identity?

72
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,583
For example,

73
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,415
you think you're ugly.

74
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,415
But you think you look hot in a selfie.

75
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,708
Anyone?

76
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,790
Or, you're actually really handsome

77
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,583
but can't stand

78
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:48,707
being in photos.

79
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,874
How about "pretty no matter what"?

80
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,624
Permission to slap her, please. -Anyone?

81
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,625
You?

82
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,583
Yourself!

83
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,624
Give us a twirl.

84
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,249
Let's have a look at you.

85
00:13:59,250 --> 00:13:59,958
I'd rather not.

86
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:01,291
Don't be shy.

87
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,041
You can show us that

88
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,207
you are pretty in person

89
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,333
and in pictures.

90
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,415
I'm shy. -No worries. Fine.

91
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,375
Remember,

92
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:13,832
don't be late

93
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,875
and no phones in class.

94
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,750
Mr. Chang.

95
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,750
Director Lin.

96
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,165
Mr. Chang, I see you taking a lot of care

97
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,499
with your hair.

98
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,540
Clean and tidy.

99
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,541
But don't overdo it.

100
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,666
Director Lin,

101
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,790
I... We have the same

102
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,041
hair style...

103
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,749
Not really. You're all shiny and coiffed.

104
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,666
OK. I see.

105
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,374
Did you press the button?

106
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,500
I forgot.

107
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,458
Mr. Chang.

108
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,540
I heard you've been going to the rallies.

109
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,957
Yes. Only at weekends.

110
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,916
You work at my school now.

111
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,041
You represent us.

112
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,415
These extra-curricular activities

113
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,041
you should notify me first.

114
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,000
Alright?

115
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,499
Don't put me in a difficult situation.

116
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,458
Got it.

117
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:08,999
I want to keep my job.

118
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,416
Sure. I understand.

119
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,125
Director Lin, I'm off this way.

120
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,541
Director Lin, Mr. Chang.

121
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,666
An acquaintance of mine

122
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,124
who is gay,

123
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,375
is getting married.

124
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,082
Gays are getting married?

125
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,540
Can you imagine?

126
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,374
I'm not sure I agree.

127
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,374
What's wrong with

128
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,458
old family values.

129
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,333
Really?

130
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,291
As long as they're happy,

131
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,040
that's the most important.

132
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,374
Is this OK?

133
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,958
Is this too hard? -No.

134
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,583
Let me know if it hurts. -Sure.

135
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,540
Anything I can do?

136
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,833
Hey, Auntie. -Kevin.

137
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,125
Nice to see you.

138
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,375
What a good-looking kid.

139
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,708
Thanks.

140
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,499
Instant noodle? -Yeah.

141
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,915
That's not healthy.

142
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,166
I'm hungry.

143
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,708
So cute.

144
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,083
So carefree.

145
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,416
Do you have kids?

146
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,207
I met a couple online.

147
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,708
Been together for 24 years.

148
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
24 years!

149
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,125
How about that?

150
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,958
I want to find someone

151
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,666
who I can love and who loves me.

152
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,041
Get married,

153
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,166
and grow old together.

154
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,333
It's a hermit crab.

155
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,333
It's hiding. You scared it.

156
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:24,791
A sunny day.

157
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:31,541
Warms my heart.

158
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:39,040
I'd give you my all,

159
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:46,166
Still you'd not let me in.

160
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,166
Love.

161
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,291
Is like the waves.

162
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,583
Pulling us up,

163
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:57,333
Dragging us down.

164
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,874
That summer,

165
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,125
We made promises.

166
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,458
That we couldn't keep.

167
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:10,000
I don't know why.

168
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,666
I close my eyes,

169
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,125
Thrash around with all my might.

170
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,541
Love is an ocean.

171
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,791
That envelops us.

172
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,166
They said their alarm went off again.

173
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,583
Shouldn't you go check it?

174
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,458
I'll go over after lunch.

175
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,875
Also the AC in the office, it's been forever.

176
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,708
Can you make a decision?

177
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,375
Let's get a new one.

178
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,583
You know it has to go past the Chairman.

179
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,833
Then can you ask your father?

180
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,916
Alright!

181
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,125
How have you been feeling?

182
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,041
Are you still getting

183
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,874
the side effects?

184
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:03,875
I'm alright.

185
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,166
I could come with you

186
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,250
ask to switch to a different drug.

187
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,791
I'm fine.

188
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,541
Could you stop being so stubborn?

189
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,875
Gao!

190
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,915
What?

191
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,207
I'll go with you.

192
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,666
I'm just fine.

193
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,041
You worry about yourself, OK?

194
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,916
I still want to have a baby.

195
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:54,916
3 dozen for 100NT.

196
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:55,916
100NT?

197
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,625
20NT discount.

198
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,666
Put them in the fridge.

199
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,165
The fridge?

200
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,374
Let him try one.

201
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,624
OK. OK.

202
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,166
Are you her husband?

203
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,333
He's my son!

204
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,833
He looks old, that's why.

205
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,083
Mom looks really young.

206
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,291
I'm so hurt.

207
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,625
I'll take that as a compliment.

208
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,790
Mom, do you remember

209
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,791
the guy I told you about?

210
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,874
Yes, of course.

211
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,625
Do you want to see a picture?

212
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,458
See how he looks?

213
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,958
Weigh him up.

214
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,083
If you want,

215
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,540
of course I'll have a look.

216
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,541
Really?

217
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,125
I've been waiting for this moment.

218
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,041
Look.

219
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,708
Good-looking, isn't he?

220
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,124
Yeah, he really is.

221
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,166
But,

222
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:47,750
But what?

223
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,665
I still think.

224
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,249
Personality is the most important.

225
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,625
He's really good to me.

226
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:01,208
Only that, recently he's been incommunicado.

227
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,166
I don't know what's wrong.

228
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,791
If I were you,

229
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,625
I'd let him find me.

230
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,958
Not me finding him.

231
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,583
Don't overthink it.

232
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,125
What if he just disappeared?

233
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,166
What? Don't be ridiculous.

234
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,416
Just saying.

235
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,916
Hold on.

236
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,666
I know you like seafood.

237
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,833
Hey there, please.

238
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,291
How much is this?

239
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,583
200NT.

240
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,125
Excuse me,

241
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,416
Mr. Gao, please.

242
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,541
Apartment number?

243
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:45,416
Apartment 5, I think...

244
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,582
May I ask, you are...?

245
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:52,416
A friend.

246
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,416
A friend？ -Yes.

247
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,958
I'm sorry. There's no answer.

248
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,291
He might not be home.

249
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,540
I haven't been able to reach him,

250
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,375
so I was wondering if he's around?

251
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,290
I'm not here full time, so...

252
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,791
I can't be sure.

253
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,915
I see.

254
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:14,916
I understand.

255
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,916
I'm happy to see you.

256
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,125
I know.

257
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,416
I had my tonsils out.

258
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,250
I'll be out of here in two days.

259
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,333
Tell me a joke.

260
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,083
I can't.

261
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,833
I'm no good at telling jokes.

262
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,040
A guy goes to the hospital for a checkup.

263
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,040
They do a lot of tests.

264
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,415
The doctor says,

265
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:51,165
"There's good news and bad news.

266
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,040
After reading your report,

267
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:56,082
I diagnose chronic homosexual tendency.

268
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,832
So the guy says,

269
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:01,207
"My god! What's the good news?"

270
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,707
The doctor says timidly,

271
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:07,166
"I think you're cute."

272
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,125
That sucked.

273
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,000
Oh! A visitor.

274
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,708
Do you want some more water?

275
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,041
Are you still in pain?

276
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:33,208
How did you

277
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,458
meet each other?

278
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,708
We met through work.

279
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:41,707
Is that so?

280
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,083
I've never seen you before.

281
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,250
Yeah, neither have I.

282
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:48,791
Is this enough?

283
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:50,750
Do you want some eggs, too?

284
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,250
Are you sure?

285
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,666
I'm leaving.

286
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:01,958
Text me if you need anything.

287
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Hey, Jo.

288
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:12,666
Do you think I'm a home wrecker?

289
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:15,958
What's so funny?

290
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,790
A home wrecker?

291
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:19,791
Yeah.

292
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:22,000
Don't be silly.

293
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,499
Why?

294
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,375
Are you sure he is serious about you?

295
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:26,915
A home wrecker? -But I'm serious.

296
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,208
I'm serious.

297
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,500
Good.

298
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:30,999
Don't laugh.

299
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,666
Tell me what you really think.

300
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,875
He sounds shady.

301
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,290
I saw him at the hospital.

302
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,083
His ex was there.

303
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:44,250
I didn't dare ask what's their deal.

304
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,040
Maybe they are just "friends".

305
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,332
But you need to hear that from him.

306
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,124
I dunno. What if

307
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,707
they are more than "friends"?

308
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,041
I'd be devastated.

309
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,875
I'd rather not know.

310
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,750
Don't pretend it's nothing.

311
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,208
Ask him.

312
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,791
It's obviously bothering you.

313
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:03,791
Yeah.

314
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,500
Then say something.

315
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:07,333
Like what?

316
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,625
What have I just said?

317
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:10,750
Get smart!

318
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,083
What have I just said?

319
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,333
Get smart!

320
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,750
The Gay Parade is officially on!

321
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,041
Guys, time for class.

322
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,541
Back to your seats.

323
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,791
Who's on duty today?

324
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,333
Who is it?

325
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:48,875
Him.

326
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Clean it up.

327
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,125
Lesson 5.

328
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,166
Civil Society Participation.

329
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:15,875
What is Democratic Literacy?

330
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,541
You are all adults.

331
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,666
You should respect each other.

332
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:22,125
Lin Guan-An.

333
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,708
What is Democratic Literacy?

334
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,333
Do you know what is respect?

335
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:35,916
Let's carry on...

336
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,541
What are you doing?

337
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,250
Moving out.

338
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:09,458
Where to?

339
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,750
Huh?

340
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,041
What'd you say?

341
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,166
Where to?

342
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,583
To...

343
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,291
my boyfriend's.

344
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,541
What's the rush?

345
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,625
It's been decided.

346
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,500
Do you have something to say?

347
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:44,083
I haven't met this guy.

348
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:47,375
I don't even know what he's like.

349
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,250
I showed you his picture.

350
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:50,916
A picture?

351
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yeah.

352
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:55,208
What can I tell from a picture?

353
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,000
How can I tell

354
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:00,333
if he's gonna make you happy?

355
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,750
Of course he will.

356
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,541
Stop worrying.

357
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,166
What else?

358
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,541
What can I say?

359
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,375
Looks like you have a lot to say.

360
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,791
What?

361
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:48,625
You can stay here and still date him.

362
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:52,541
I'm right behind you.

363
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:55,250
Now you're all packed and ready to go.

364
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,625
I don't even know

365
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,583
when you'll be back.

366
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,083
I'll call you.

367
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,250
I worry about you

368
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:12,166
'cus I love you.

369
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,500
Raising you,

370
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,708
I've always been tough.

371
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,166
No need to worry about me.

372
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,333
Take good care of yourself.

373
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:35,415
Then why are you crying?

374
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,000
How can I not worry?

375
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:51,416
What is it?

376
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,000
Come home often.

377
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,375
Bring back your laundry.

378
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,166
I'd love to do it for you.

379
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,083
Take care of yourself.

380
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,291
Fine.

381
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,208
When you moved out

382
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,458
you promised me a child.

383
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,291
It's working.

384
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,166
It's been two years.

385
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,208
Good night.

386
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:47,625
Director Lin.

387
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:51,791
Mr. Chang.

388
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,165
I've received complaints about you

389
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:57,333
discussing gay marriage in class.

390
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,250
Yes, it's part of the course.

391
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,625
Listen. We don't want angry parents.

392
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,416
Keep that stuff

393
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:04,875
out of the classroom.

394
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:05,791
Do you hear me?

395
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:06,875
Loud and clear.

396
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:10,541
I'd get an earful.

397
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,375
Mr. Lin, are these yours?

398
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,916
Lottery tickets. -They're mine.

399
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:20,083
That's a lot.

400
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,208
What are you doing?

401
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,833
Stop messing around.

402
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:25,833
We did a group buy.

403
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:26,708
Are these really yours?

404
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,208
Of course. Hand them over.

405
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,291
There's no name.

406
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,208
Wrapped with a rubber band.

407
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,250
Fine.

408
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:33,875
Thanks.

409
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,625
That's a lot of tickets.

410
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,916
I'm gonna crush you.

411
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:15,875
What is it?

412
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,208
A condom.

413
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:20,416
All gone.

414
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,999
I'll go get some. -Just this once.

415
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'll go get some. -Just this once.

416
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,457
I'll be right back.

417
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,499
I'll be here.

418
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,833
Wait for me.

419
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,333
Wait with me.

420
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:34,083
Don't tickle me.

421
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,958
I'll be back in no time. -No.

422
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:40,458
I'll be downstairs, you'll be upstairs.

423
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,625
Be right back. -No.

424
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:43,915
Real quick.

425
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,166
I'm getting pissed.

426
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,708
Be good. -I'm getting pissed.

427
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,375
What do you want?

428
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:39,041
I want to tell you something.

429
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,375
Go on.

430
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,166
I am Positive.

431
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,291
That's not funny.

432
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:01,583
So, the referendum

433
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,541
is coming up soon.

434
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:05,375
But do you think

435
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:07,083
this referendum is fair?

436
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:10,125
Jason, what do you think?

437
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,666
I think... -Hum.

438
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,250
Yes.

439
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:15,500
You think it's fair?

440
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,916
So we can vote to decide if

441
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,750
he has human rights or not?

442
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,250
Is that fair?

443
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,166
We can decide if he...

444
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:26,125
It depends?

445
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:28,041
Depends on what?

446
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,750
Go on.

447
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,666
The government.

448
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,333
So the government represents the majority?

449
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,291
Is that so?

450
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:44,750
Hey, stop it.

451
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:46,375
No cellphones.

452
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,625
Rules are rules.

453
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,166
Pick up your textbook.

454
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,041
Once again. No cellphones.

455
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,791
Caught once, you get a C.

456
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,666
Caught twice, you're flunked.

457
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,583
Don't challenge me.

458
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,666
So, civil disobedience is

459
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:19,000
the professed refusal of a citizen to

460
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,916
obey certain laws

461
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,833
of a government,

462
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,291
equated with...

463
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,375
Jo, how do I get an anonymous test?

464
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:36,875
Put your finger on it.

465
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:42,041
AIDS is actually named HIV.

466
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,750
HIV is the virus.

467
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,500
AIDS is when it develops

468
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,457
into a condition.

469
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,957
One virus, one condition.

470
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:55,000
They're not the same thing.

471
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:00,207
Here's the result.

472
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:03,833
It's Negative.

473
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:05,291
No need to worry.

474
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:06,500
You are good.

475
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:08,916
However, there's a window period,

476
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:10,583
so come back for another test

477
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:12,375
in 3 months.

478
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:20,708
How's your back? I'll do that.

479
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,875
Can you put it there? -To the end?

480
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,125
On the edge.

481
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,250
They're coming. -OK.

482
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:28,291
Thanks. -No problem.

483
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,958
Did you see a doctor?

484
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,833
Yes, I have.

485
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:34,083
Get better soon.

486
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:37,041
Where are you from?

487
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:38,916
I'm from Chong-Li.

488
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:40,666
Yeah? -Right.

489
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:43,250
Do you live alone？

490
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:44,833
I live with my mom.

491
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:46,958
I take care of her.

492
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:49,000
Be careful. -Yeah.

493
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:50,541
Over there?

494
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:52,165
Behind that thing there.

495
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,166
OK.

496
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:57,208
What are you doing after school?

497
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:59,500
Meeting a friend for dinner.

498
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,708
Let's get dinner sometime.

499
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:25,790
Pa, this is my friend.

500
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,790
He wishes you happy birthday. -Thank you.

501
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,125
Happy birthday, Mr. Gao.

502
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:33,333
What does your friend do?

503
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,625
He's a high school teacher.

504
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:45,332
Happy birthday to you, Pa.

505
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:47,415
Here's to health and happiness.

506
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:48,958
Health and happiness.

507
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,916
Forever 18.

508
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,208
Happy birthday.

509
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:02,416
Pa.

510
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,041
I wish you.

511
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,000
Happy birthday. And good health.

512
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:17,125
Come on.

513
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:18,458
Come over.

514
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,083
Come here.

515
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,833
Say 'Happy birthday' to grandpa.

516
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:26,000
Good, good.

517
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,291
Happy birthday.

518
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,333
Happy, happy.

519
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,291
No. Serve her first.

520
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:39,416
I'll help myself.

521
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:46,541
Pa, how's the wine? -Very nice.

522
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:49,000
We brought it from France. -It's good.

523
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:51,416
We'll bring you some more next time.

524
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:56,250
I prefered that Italian stuff.

525
00:46:56,708 --> 00:46:58,375
I like this one.

526
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,375
Papa doesn't drink much now.

527
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,500
That's good.

528
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,375
Should've quit totally. -Agreed.

529
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,208
Hardly anything these days.

530
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,791
But they keep sending him wine.

531
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:21,583
It's a nice gesture.

532
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:23,291
Today's a special day.

533
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,666
Who's screaming?

534
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:36,750
Not hungry anymore.

535
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,625
Maybe he misses grandpa.

536
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,875
Give grandpa a kiss, will you?

537
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:46,625
So cute.

538
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:49,291
Give him a kiss.

539
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,416
And a hug.

540
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:04,166
So, still no baby?

541
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,416
Ma, we're working on it.

542
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,291
Work harder.

543
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:11,291
OK.

544
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,875
It would give me some sway

545
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:16,375
with your dad.

546
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:18,875
I understand.

547
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:23,416
Get your family business straight, for God's sake.

548
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:56,166
Earthquake.

549
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:17,458
Good day, how may I help?

550
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,583
I need a hammer.

551
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,166
Here, I'll show you.

552
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,416
Thanks.

553
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:32,500
I have three kinds.

554
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:14,333
What the hell?

555
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,458
I don't need help wrecking my home.

556
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,125
I can do it myself.

557
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:22,665
Hey, Jo.

558
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,208
Hey.

559
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,375
What's up?

560
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:27,958
Checking up on you.

561
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,708
Checking up on me?

562
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,416
What do you want?

563
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,500
I'll help you close up.

564
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,958
What are you looking at?

565
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:39,541
Have you eaten? -Hum?

566
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,583
Have you eaten?

567
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:42,458
Not yet. Let's go get food.

568
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:46,375
Come on. Hurry up.

569
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:52,500
Let's go. What is it?

570
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:54,083
Help me.

571
00:53:57,041 --> 00:53:57,833
Thank you.

572
00:53:57,875 --> 00:53:58,875
You got it.

573
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:00,458
Where are you going?

574
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:01,875
To the back.

575
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:03,666
Another smoke?

576
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:12,833
It's raining.

577
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:15,583
This your first one today?

578
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:17,083
Yeah. -No shit.

579
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:19,041
Guess how many orders today.

580
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:20,375
How many? -Come in.

581
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,208
It's dripping.

582
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:25,041
How many?

583
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:26,375
Next door,

584
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,583
the realtor ordered...

585
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:32,875
60... NT?

586
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,790
60 thousand? -60NT?

587
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:36,625
That's something to brag about?

588
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:37,708
Get a grip.

589
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:38,833
60 orders!

590
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,250
How do I know?

591
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:41,291
Tell me.

592
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,166
60 buns! -Yeah?

593
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,208
35 combos!

594
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,958
Business is booming. Good for you.

595
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
My ass. I'm just a grunt.

596
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:49,541
Oh, well.

597
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,500
What's wrong?

598
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,583
I really don't get it.

599
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,083
Don't get what?

600
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:01,166
Why some people just

601
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:04,166
can't let go of their ex?

602
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:06,416
Just cut them off.

603
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:08,083
Why's it so hard?

604
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:11,416
So they're not really over?

605
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:13,416
I don't wanna talk about it.

606
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,457
I came back here

607
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:17,166
to listen to you.

608
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:20,541
I know. I'm fine.

609
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:23,250
What happened?

610
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:24,916
Nothing.

611
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,333
When do you get off? Let's go.

612
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,958
Is it ever gonna let up?

613
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:36,833
So you...

614
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,333
What?

615
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:43,583
Something must've gone wrong.

616
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,625
Stop it.

617
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:51,166
Even the garbage bags are bullying me.

618
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:53,625
That sucks.

619
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,666
Where the hell?

620
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:56,958
It's a sign.

621
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:58,125
Thank you.

622
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,500
I'm buying lottos.

623
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,041
Thanks, but I'm leaving.

624
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,416
Are you chickening out?

625
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:24,333
Wei.

626
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:26,416
Please.

627
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,541
The reason

628
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,125
I wanted to see you...

629
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:36,541
I have a question.

630
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:39,541
What do you want to know?

631
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,875
How do I put it?

632
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:46,000
Are you still in a marriage?

633
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:48,583
We are.

634
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,541
I thought you were divorced.

635
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:59,958
Did he say that?

636
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:06,833
What does it matter anyway?

637
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,708
You live together now.

638
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:09,958
Of course it matters.

639
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,916
If you're still in the marriage,

640
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:13,750
that makes me a homewrecker.

641
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:15,583
I won't do that.

642
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,416
I feel that actually

643
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,416
you're a kind person inside.

644
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:31,083
What are you saying?

645
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,041
What is this?

646
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:33,500
Stop playing games. -I'm not.

647
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,166
I'm not playing games.

648
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:39,916
So you're the good guy

649
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:41,375
and I'm the bad guy?

650
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,916
Of course not.

651
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:46,750
I just want everything to be simple.

652
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,041
Who doesn't?

653
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:52,541
The real world is complicated.

654
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:54,083
That's just how it is.

655
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,083
I'm not like you.

656
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:58,291
You're young. The world is yours.

657
00:57:58,333 --> 00:57:59,875
You can go anywhere you want.

658
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:01,625
Do anything you want.

659
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,791
I don't have that luxury anymore.

660
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:08,458
I think he still loves you.

661
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,208
We're doing IVF.

662
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:20,500
I'm not expecting anything from him.

663
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:23,750
I respect what you have between you.

664
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,333
Why a test-tube baby?

665
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,833
Because I need

666
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,166
an ally.

667
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:42,833
You can find someone else.

668
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:44,250
Like who?

669
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:47,500
You think I'm enjoying this?

670
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:52,458
You think this is fun?

671
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:57,083
But I don't understand why he...

672
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,333
That's your problem.

673
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:01,375
Why is it my business?

674
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:02,791
I hope you can help me.

675
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:04,208
Help you?

676
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:11,250
I can't believe this.

677
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:13,333
I just want a clean slate.

678
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:16,166
I can't do that if you're still married.

679
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:06,416
Go see a doctor today.

680
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:25,625
Culture Rights guarantee

681
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:27,999
that communities

682
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,208
have access to culture

683
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:33,875
and right of participation.

684
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,250
Culture rights are

685
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,666
human rights

686
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,165
assuring

687
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,708
the enjoyment of

688
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:43,208
culture...

689
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:47,000
and its components...

690
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:48,458
in conditions of

691
01:00:48,459 --> 01:00:49,665
equality

692
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:51,000
and human diginity.

693
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:52,791
They're...

694
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,541
Er, I need to take a break.

695
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,250
Hang on.

696
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:58,375
I'll be right back.

697
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:02,875
It stinks.

698
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:57,625
HIV symptoms.

699
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:27,750
Can't sleep?

700
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:30,250
Why are you up?

701
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:32,000
Did I wake you?

702
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,291
I can't sleep.

703
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:38,291
You can't sleep?

704
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:40,333
You were just snoring.

705
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:41,875
Was I?

706
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:42,875
Yeah.

707
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:26,791
Hello?

708
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:29,166
This is the health center.

709
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,708
Yes. Speaking.

710
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,333
What's the urgency?

711
01:03:43,541 --> 01:03:45,250
Do I have...

712
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:16,207
Your change.

713
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:17,083
Thanks.

714
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:18,166
Here.

715
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:21,333
Next time call me first.

716
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,125
OK. -There'd be no waiting.

717
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:24,250
Sure. I'll do that.

718
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:24,916
Good.

719
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,125
Goodbye. - Thanks again.

720
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:26,875
Bye.

721
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:27,833
See you.

722
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:28,875
See you.

723
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:43,833
What are you up to?

724
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:47,166
Need some help?

725
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:15,999
You know how?

726
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,625
Sure.

727
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:20,125
It's not difficult.

728
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:36,291
How's business?

729
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:38,208
Not bad.

730
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:50,583
Space them out.

731
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Sure.

732
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:08,791
Wait.

733
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:47,541
Hey

734
01:07:01,291 --> 01:07:03,541
I'll put them in the fridge.

735
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,041
The test center called me.

736
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:13,666
And?

737
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,541
I might have AIDS.

738
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:52,750
Go there tomorrow and find out for sure.

739
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:54,875
It might be nothing.

740
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:58,041
That's not possible.

741
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:12,583
I'll go with you. OK?

742
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:16,708
Don't worry. I'll go with you.

743
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,041
It'll be fine.

744
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:19,583
Don't lie to me.

745
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:21,333
It's cool. Don't worry.

746
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,083
I'm here.

747
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,583
It's cool.

748
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:29,750
It's not cool. You got me into this.

749
01:08:58,291 --> 01:09:00,541
Nitrous oxide.

750
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:19,125
Are you alright, Mr. Chang?

751
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:20,625
I'm fine.

752
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:22,833
Everything's gonna be OK.

753
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,916
I'm fine.

754
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,333
Director Lin.

755
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,916
Come in, Mr. Chang.

756
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:35,916
Shut the door, please.

757
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:42,916
Can you help put this printer

758
01:09:43,083 --> 01:09:46,416
and the trophies on top of the cabinet?

759
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:50,166
I asked you to come in here today,

760
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:52,583
because I need to ask you something.

761
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:55,333
What is it?

762
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:59,166
There's a post online,

763
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:01,125
on Facebook,

764
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:04,833
about a teacher who has AIDS

765
01:10:05,458 --> 01:10:07,541
and is a homosexual.

766
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,625
I saw the post this morning.

767
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:11,708
The teacher in the picture was you.

768
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,666
I wanted to hear

769
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:16,625
your side of the story.

770
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:18,458
Must be a bad joke.

771
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,458
A bad joke?

772
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,083
What else could it be?

773
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:22,833
There's another thing.

774
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:28,000
I received an anonymous letter.

775
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:33,416
Mentioning that post

776
01:10:33,958 --> 01:10:36,208
and about AIDS.

777
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:38,458
Urging me to take action.

778
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:40,916
Our reputation is on the line.

779
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,791
I want to ask you.

780
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:48,791
Is there any truth in this?

781
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,541
Of course it's not true.

782
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:52,875
Maybe someone who looks like me.

783
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,708
Any enemies?

784
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,666
Are you in trouble with someone?

785
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,500
Something you're not telling me.

786
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:00,333
Nothing.

787
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:02,583
Mr. Chang,

788
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:05,958
as a friend,

789
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,708
to be honest, I have no qualms

790
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:13,291
about your sexuality.

791
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:15,916
But the real problem here

792
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:18,541
is AIDS.

793
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:21,541
If you do have AIDS, that's OK.

794
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:22,833
I don't have it.

795
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:25,291
We'll sort it out together.

796
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:27,875
If it's true, you need to tell me now.

797
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,750
It's not true, Mr. Lin.

798
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:31,291
How could you believe that...

799
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:36,458
It seems this person

800
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:40,208
has information on you.

801
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:44,208
Now listen.

802
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:46,375
I'll ask you one last time.

803
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:48,208
Are you a homosexual?

804
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,541
Do you have AIDS?

805
01:11:49,583 --> 01:11:51,375
I'll find out who did this.

806
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:54,083
Calm down.

807
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,041
The first thing

808
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,000
you must do...

809
01:11:58,041 --> 01:12:00,000
My sexuality is not the issue.

810
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:01,333
Let me tell you something,

811
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:02,958
you are a teacher.

812
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:05,625
And to be a homosexual

813
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:08,083
holding this job in Taiwan,

814
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:09,208
Please be reasonable.

815
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:10,791
Is still controversial.

816
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:12,291
Can you please be reasonable.

817
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:13,875
Watch your tone.

818
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:15,250
If I were not reasonable,

819
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:17,000
why ask you here?

820
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:18,916
I want this resolved

821
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,250
before it gets worse.

822
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:23,416
Understood?

823
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,125
My sexuality is not the issue.

824
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:27,125
But I don't have AIDS.

825
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:29,291
I hope you can prove it.

826
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:31,458
There's no need to argue.

827
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,083
Do you understand?

828
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,208
Yes, I'll prove it.

829
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,958
You know what happened today?

830
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:55,250
Of course not.

831
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:56,500
What happened?

832
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,750
They are saying I have AIDS.

833
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:12,291
I'm scared.

834
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:49,583
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

835
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:52,916
What does it matter?

836
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,291
There's another pressing issue.

837
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:04,375
Another?

838
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:06,375
There's only one pressing issue.

839
01:14:06,416 --> 01:14:07,208
Please...

840
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:08,416
Rumors get around.

841
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:09,833
Students need to be

842
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:12,083
careful what they post.

843
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:13,833
This must be understood.

844
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:15,041
What does that have to do

845
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:17,333
with this problem?

846
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:19,375
You can't trust everything on the internet.

847
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,375
You're a PTA president yourself.

848
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,541
How can you...?

849
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:23,916
Mr. President.

850
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,750
We've had cases of

851
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:34,541
students taking issue with

852
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:36,125
unpopular teachers.

853
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:38,541
Even if it's just hearsay,

854
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:39,833
there must be something to it.

855
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:41,500
Or we wouldn't be sitting here.

856
01:14:41,541 --> 01:14:42,583
Or it could be...

857
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:43,976
I'm not interested in 'could be'.

858
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,625
We can't take a chance.

859
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:48,500
You need to sort this out.

860
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:50,125
In the meantime,

861
01:14:50,166 --> 01:14:51,583
this has gone too far.

862
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:53,250
I think Mr. Chang should go.

863
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:54,375
Immediately.

864
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:56,416
Since we are all here today,

865
01:14:56,875 --> 01:14:59,041
I feel that we shouldn't

866
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:00,833
rush to conclusions.

867
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:02,583
Let alone get emotional.

868
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:03,583
I'm telling you.

869
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,166
We can't mess around.

870
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:06,500
All you do is investigate.

871
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:07,916
Investigate this,

872
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:08,958
investigate that.

873
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:11,125
Write your reports, hold your meetings.

874
01:15:11,166 --> 01:15:12,875
Draw your conclusions.

875
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:14,208
How long will that take?

876
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,791
Meanwhile, people are gonna die.

877
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,291
Right, Mr. President.

878
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,291
We'll get it sorted out

879
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:20,458
as soon as...

880
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:22,541
So what's next?

881
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:24,625
What's gonna happen?

882
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:25,416
Mr. President.

883
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:27,375
What will you do exactly?

884
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:30,958
If he really has got

885
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,250
the... disease.

886
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,500
Mr. Chang.

887
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:38,166
Would you be willing

888
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,208
to take a test?

889
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:41,375
I would.

890
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,750
Mr. Chang will do it.

891
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:45,625
Get it done.

892
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,500
There's a privacy issue.

893
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,583
Why should he...

894
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:50,083
What's wrong with you?

895
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:51,750
Would you take a fertility test

896
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:52,875
if there was a rumor...

897
01:15:52,916 --> 01:15:54,041
What are you talking about?

898
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:55,083
Nonsense.

899
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,041
If we don't put a stop to this,

900
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:58,541
we'll all get sick soon.

901
01:15:58,666 --> 01:15:59,500
Now, everyone.

902
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:01,541
Here's what we're gonna do.

903
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:02,833
As Principal,

904
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,583
I answer to the Ministry.

905
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:07,375
And I'm responsible for my staff.

906
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:08,750
We go step by step.

907
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:10,875
First, we deal with the rumor.

908
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,875
Hi, I'm the infamous gay Chi Chia-Wei.

909
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,625
True, the result of the referendum is frustrating.

910
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:16,166
But just look at the numbers.

911
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:18,666
Three million people came out in support.

912
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:22,291
It's "short term pain for long term gain".

913
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:25,833
Obviously, we're not there yet.

914
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:29,208
But look how far we've come.

915
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:34,041
So don't give up.

916
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:36,291
I heard some of you got suicidal.

917
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:38,125
You'd be handing it to them.

918
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:40,666
So, live long and prosper!

919
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:53,375
Here you are.

920
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,708
Ma.

921
01:17:54,916 --> 01:17:56,208
I just got off.

922
01:17:57,083 --> 01:17:59,375
I have a question for you.

923
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:02,375
I got some phone calls.

924
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:04,750
From the school.

925
01:18:04,916 --> 01:18:06,750
You didn't show?

926
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:09,583
The kids spreading rumors about me.

927
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:11,750
I've been asked to get an AIDS test.

928
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:17,875
Get an AIDS test?

929
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:20,166
Do you have it?

930
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:22,458
It's just a rumor.

931
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,791
Then you'll have to do it.

932
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:29,708
So you can prove it.

933
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:30,958
I know.

934
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:33,291
If you are innocent,

935
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,208
you need to prove it to them.

936
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:37,375
Prove it to me.

937
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:39,458
Yes, yes, yes.

938
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:48,708
Kevin.

939
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:52,708
Hey, come on.

940
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:54,375
My head is throbbing.

941
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,875
Talk to me.

942
01:18:56,166 --> 01:18:58,000
We need to talk.

943
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,916
People are saying you have AIDS.

944
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:04,750
If it's not true,

945
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:06,875
we have to clear it up.

946
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:09,166
We need to put an end to it.

947
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:11,041
What if I do have it?

948
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:12,875
I mean, what if.

949
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,166
What are you talking about?

950
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,791
What did I tell you

951
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:18,875
before you started dating?

952
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,250
Didn't you promise me?

953
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:26,416
You need to use protection.

954
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,500
How could you

955
01:19:27,541 --> 01:19:29,583
be so stupid?

956
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:31,916
I...

957
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:35,458
I need you to listen to me.

958
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:37,750
No matter what happens,

959
01:19:37,916 --> 01:19:40,208
AIDS or not,

960
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:43,541
we have to face it. OK?

961
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:47,833
Give me your word.

962
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:51,208
I'm on your side.

963
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:54,500
We've been through worse.

964
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:56,500
Don't be afraid.

965
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:59,000
I'll love you just the same.

966
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:02,500
I'm here with you.

967
01:20:03,541 --> 01:20:05,250
What if I die?

968
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,500
No. Impossible.

969
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:11,458
Mr. Chang!

970
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,000
Mr. Gao...

971
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,083
had an accident

972
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,291
in the parking garage.

973
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:19,583
Are you sure?

974
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:20,333
Yes.

975
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,750
Really? -Yes.

976
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:23,333
He has been taken to ER.

977
01:20:23,416 --> 01:20:24,416
Where?

978
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:25,541
The closest hospital.

979
01:20:25,583 --> 01:20:26,416
Hurry.

980
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:27,500
The closest?

981
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,083
I can't find his name.

982
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,625
Do they have a sign in sheet?

983
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:37,125
Or something?

984
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,500
If he's not yet registered,

985
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:41,125
he won't be in the system.

986
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:43,791
There's nothing at all?

987
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:44,875
Sorry, No.

988
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:45,666
But...

989
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:48,083
Maybe he hasn't been admitted.

990
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,541
It might take some time

991
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:51,083
before his name shows up.

992
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:51,833
I see.

993
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:52,875
Yes.

994
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:56,666
I'll make sure again.

995
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:57,708
OK.

996
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:12,000
I can't find his name.

997
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,500
How is that possible?

998
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:14,875
I'm sorry.

999
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:16,250
How come?

1000
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:18,291
Are you sure he's in this hospital?

1001
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:21,166
I saw him come in.

1002
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:23,625
I am sure it's here.

1003
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:25,875
Sir,

1004
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:27,875
I've looked right through.

1005
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:28,791
He's not here.

1006
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,125
Please look again.

1007
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:32,875
Do it!

1008
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:35,291
Please, I beg you.

1009
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:36,958
He's really important to me.

1010
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:43,041
Nothing. For sure.

1011
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:44,083
I'm sorry.

1012
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,750
Miss, can you help me?

1013
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:47,375
Sir,

1014
01:21:48,041 --> 01:21:49,708
he might've been discharged.

1015
01:21:49,791 --> 01:21:51,166
Or he didn't come here.

1016
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:53,166
Why can't you just tell me?

1017
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,208
It's hospital policy...

1018
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,125
I'm sure he's here.

1019
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:58,458
Just tell me where the fuck he is.

1020
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,708
Sir, do you need help?

1021
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,291
I'm fed up with your bullshit.

1022
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:10,625
Do you have any empathy?

1023
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,166
Can't you check again?

1024
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:15,208
Don't raise your voice.

1025
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,083
There are other...

1026
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:17,625
I didn't raise my voice.

1027
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:22,833
Please. Or I'll call security.

1028
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,125
Mr. Wang.

1029
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,666
Stop it.

1030
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:29,458
Check it again.

1031
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:30,791
Check it again. -Sir...

1032
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:34,041
He means everything. Will you please...

1033
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,666
Sir, please come with me.

1034
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:37,833
This way.

1035
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:40,625
This way, this way.

1036
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:41,833
Let go of me.

1037
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:42,583
Come.

1038
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:43,500
Fuck off.

1039
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:44,958
Cool it.

1040
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:45,875
I'm going.

1041
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:47,125
Sure. This way please.

1042
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,500
Director Lin? -Doctor Liu.

1043
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:58,208
We spoke on the phone.

1044
01:22:58,291 --> 01:22:59,416
This is?

1045
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,833
Mr. Chang.

1046
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,375
Hello.

1047
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,541
Sorry, I need to get this.

1048
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:09,625
Gao?

1049
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,000
Hello?

1050
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:15,000
Hello?

1051
01:23:20,666 --> 01:23:23,208
I just need to send a text.

1052
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:55,958
Mr. Chang.

1053
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:57,208
Mr. Chang.

1054
01:23:57,791 --> 01:23:58,791
Mr. Chang.

1055
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:02,625
I'm sorry.

1056
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:04,750
Mr. Chang.

1057
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,125
I'm sorry. It got out of control.

1058
01:24:11,791 --> 01:24:12,791
Mr. Chang.

1059
01:24:20,208 --> 01:24:22,166
Hello, Mr. Chang.

1060
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:25,250
Gao can't talk now.

1061
01:24:26,541 --> 01:24:28,250
He would like you

1062
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:32,666
to stop looking for him.

1063
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:37,666
He was glad to have met you.

1064
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:41,500
I thank you for all you've done for him.

1065
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:51,291
Remember our meeting at the cafe?

1066
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:55,583
You're blunt. But brave, too.

1067
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:59,416
Life is not always pretty.

1068
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:02,625
We live and we learn.

1069
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:08,457
You are still young.

1070
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:11,625
The possibilities are endless...

1071
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,791
Hello.

1072
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:50,000
I'm your Civics teacher.

1073
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:52,333
My name is Kevin Chang.

1074
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:54,708
Same-sex marriage will be legalized this year.

1075
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:58,166
We'll discuss it in the class.

1076
01:26:58,541 --> 01:27:01,333
Now, regarding this semester's syllabus...
