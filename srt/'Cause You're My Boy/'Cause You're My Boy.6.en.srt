1
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,380
What should we do?

2
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,580
Can I see you after class?

3
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,160
I have to go. See you tonight.

4
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,800
Wait, Mork.

5
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,660
Don’t leave yet.

6
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,960
Who were you talking to?

7
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,180
I have the military training in the afternoon

8
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,000
Are you free tomorrow?

9
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,900
Aren’t you hanging out with me today?

10
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,160
Well…

11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,060
I have to see Bam today

12
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,360
I have to go.

13
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,300
Are you okay?

14
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,760
Mork, wait for me.

15
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,000
Leave me alone.

16
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,640
It’s not too late to go back to her.

17
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
You and I haven’t been intimate

18
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,360
No need for you to think too much into it.

19
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,880
Mork, Wait!

20
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,680
Don’t get drunk just yet.

21
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,160
Make yourself at home

22
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,320
Hey, what’s the story?

23
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,340
How come you’re not with your boyfriend?

24
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,540
Boyfriend my ass.

25
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,560
I don’t have a boyfriend.

26
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,760
He and I are nothing

27
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,980
What’s the point of having a boyfriend

28
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,100
when you’re going to get dumped?

29
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
He tricked me about aliens.

30
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,200
He tricked me to eating noodles.

31
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,480
I, who had never eaten noodles,

32
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,460
now like noodles.

33
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,400
But noodles are not for me

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,940
They’re not for me.

35
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,680
Not for me

36
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,450
Mork.

37
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,700
I think he passed out.

38
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,920
Thanks for bringing him here.

39
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,540
I’ve been looking for him all day.

40
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,960
Take care of my friend.

41
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,160
Don’t hurt him.

42
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,760
Au,

43
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,340
come on.

44
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,320
When you said you’d never leave me,

45
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,760
did you mean it?

46
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,080
Forget about it.

47
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,440
Of course, I meant it.

48
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,180
You were talking to her

49
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,940
I needed to talk to Bambie about something

50
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,020
I don’t want to know.

51
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,060
My mom deactivated my credit card

52
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
because of something I said

53
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,160
Do you have enough money to eat?

54
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,180
If your mom is mad, make up with her,

55
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
not with Bambie

56
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,660
Bam is a friend.

57
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,880
You’re my boyfriend.

58
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,520
I’m not leaving you.

59
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
Liar.

60
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,080
I’m not a liar.

61
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,720
I’m cold.

62
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,520
I’ll be back.

63
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,120
Sleepy?

64
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,860
Go to bed

65
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,420
Please don’t be mad anymore.

66
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,400
Mork, wake up

67
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,760
Eat your breakfast.

68
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,160
You’re all dressed up. Where are you going?

69
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,000
I have a date.

70
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,600
With whom?

71
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,180
With my boyfriend.

72
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,920
Have a shower first. Get up.

73
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,360
You can eat later.

74
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,420
Go.

75
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,160
I got you a green toothbrush

76
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,780
So you can take photos.

77
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,780
But not of someone more handsome than me.

78
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,520
I guess there’s none.

79
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,260
One condition for this trip.

80
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,900
What is this? Is this a Mr. Gay contest?

81
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,740
Can you still see?

82
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,700
No way. You tied it so tightly.

83
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,340
Why?

84
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,960
I won’t see where we’re going.

85
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,060
Is it okay?

86
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,640
Oh, you have to wear this as well.

87
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,620
How can I hear when you give me directions?

88
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,640
Does it hurt?

89
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,120
Here’s how we’re going to do this.

90
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,640
When we walk normally, hold my hand.

91
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,420
When we turn left or right,

92
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,060
put your hand on my shoulder and lead me.

93
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,640
When we stop,

94
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,760
kiss me on the cheek.

95
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,580
That’s perfect.

96
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,640
Okay

97
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,620
I love you.

98
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,840
Mork, come on.

99
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,300
If I want to show someone that I love him

100
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,760
what should I do?

101
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,800
Tee.

102
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,340
I’m right here.

103
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,840
What is by the wayside?

104
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,740
I won’t tell you. It’ll spoil the excitement

105
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,240
Hold on for a little longer

106
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,960
Don’t pity me.

107
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,720
It is exciting

108
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,460
But I need some clues.

109
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,840
Put your ear closer.

110
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,500
You’re such an opportunist.

111
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,100
What is this place? The aircon is way too cold.

112
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,880
Are you ready?

113
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,340
Snow! Snow!

114
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,120
Look, Tee. It’s real snow

115
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,760
Do you like it?

116
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,780
Yes, I do very much

117
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,300
I’ve having a fight with my family.

118
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,880
So, I don’t have much money.

119
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,460
When I do, I’ll take you to see real snow.

120
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,160
Thank you.

121
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,940
It’s so cold

122
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,760
So beautiful.

123
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,020
You see droplets when you breathe.

124
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,980
Let’s get excited

125
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,520
No.

126
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,040
I mean, go to the slide and be excited by the thrilling sensation.

127
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,000
No, I’m afraid of height.

128
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,140
Why would you? Kids are doing it. Come on.

129
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,400
You’re here. You have to try it.

130
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,100
I said I’m afraid. Why aren’t you listening?

131
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,780
Why are you trying to change me?

132
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,140
I mean well. I just want you to have fun

133
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,400
You mean well. What about me?

134
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,760
I’ve never wanted you to change.

135
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,580
If you don’t change, can we still love each other?

136
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,880
If you’re afraid, it’s okay. I’ll go on the slide.

137
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,740
I’ll be back.

138
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,020
Mork, wait!

139
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,720
Let me join you.

140
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,520
Mhm.

141
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,300
What if I pee my pants?

142
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,120
Your pee will become ice

143
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,400
But if something else comes out, you’ll have to see for yourself.

144
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,780
Why are you making a fuss? Need some TLC?

145
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,900
Don’t let fear stop you. You’ve never tried it.

146
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,720
You may enjoy it once you do

147
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,040
Don’t stop being afraid of height for my sake.

148
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,200
When you are afraid, I’ll hold you tight like this.

149
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,720
You’ll be safe.

150
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,760
Mork, let’s do this already.

151
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,020
I’m embarrassed by the kid.

152
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,180
Don’t be.

153
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,680
What are you looking at?

154
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,440
You’ve come this far. Soon, you’ll stop being afraid

155
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,400
Don’t be afraid. It’ll take just a second.

156
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,520
So fun.

157
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,540
Good for you. What’s your name?

158
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,660
I won’t tell you

159
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,480
Let’s go.

160
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,140
The ice is pretty stiff.

161
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,940
Tee, sorry.

162
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,600
It’s safe now.

163
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,900
Guys, let’s go that way.

164
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,820
Let’s hide here, so Mom won’t see us.

165
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,520
You’re a naughty boy.

166
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,160
I’ll tell your mom to catch you.

167
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,120
No.

168
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,820
Mooham, where are you?

169
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,380
Oh, there she is.

170
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,240
If she isn’t taking me home yet, I’ll come back

171
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Don’t do anything naughty

172
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,080
Mooham may come back

173
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,100
I’m not naughty.

174
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,580
Really?

175
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,360
I’m innocent as a lamb.

176
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,040
Are you cold?

177
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,100
Mhm.

178
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,820
Are you warm now?

179
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
No.

180
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,220
How about now?

181
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,420
Sleepy all of the sudden?

182
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
Tee.

183
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,600
Tee.

184
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,180
This is not funny.

185
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,620
Tee,

186
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,040
what’s wrong?

187
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,320
Shit!

188
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,420
Tee, what’s wrong?

189
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,660
A customer is unconscious. Get an ambulance.

190
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Tee

191
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,220
Mork.

192
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,280
Tee, are you okay?

193
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,760
Get up slowly.

194
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,500
It’s good that you woke up.

195
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,380
This is a gift.

196
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,000
A seal ring symbolizes eternal love.

197
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,220
Mooham, let’s go home.

198
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,920
Bye.

199
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,240
Get well soon. Good luck

200
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,580
Thanks.

201
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,580
I’ll check on the ambulance.

202
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,000
That’s fine. I’m okay now

203
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,580
Okay.

204
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,940
Thanks.

205
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,260
Are you really okay?

206
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,200
It’s cute.

207
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,820
There are two of them.

208
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,060
Can I have one?

209
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,940
Put it on for me.

210
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,840
A ring finger on my left hand.

211
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,240
Any meaning behind this?

212
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
If you take it out, I’ll get you good.

213
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,980
I passed out because I’m afraid of blood.

214
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
You’re fine now.

215
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,380
Thanks.

216
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,300
The sea!

217
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,480
Mork, come on.

218
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,440
Between a snow kind of cold and a breezy cold by the sea,

219
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,380
the latter seemed like a better option.

220
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,180
Yes, I don’t have a nosebleed and you don’t pass out.

221
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,040
Sorry. Did that ruin your mood?

222
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
It did.

223
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,020
My mood is ruined because history repeats itself

224
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,100
Tee, if I want to show someone that I love him

225
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,940
what should I do?

226
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,860
Holding hands,

227
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,580
staring at his eyes,

228
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,980
smiling,

229
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,360
being next to him…

230
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,300
Do you feel the love?

231
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,200
I do.

232
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,040
What about hugging,

233
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,000
kissing on the cheek, kissing on the mouth?

234
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,780
Do you feel the love even more?

235
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,180
For something that’s more than that, can we not do it?

236
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,260
Have you just figured that out?

237
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,440
I just wanted to try, but now I know.

238
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,700
I think we can keep on doing this, just being next to each other.

239
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,660
Something… we just need to wait until the right moment

240
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,160
I’m confident that we’ll be together for a long time and I can wait

241
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,080
I don’t suppose you’re planning to dump me today or tomorrow?

242
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
No.

243
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,140
I think we can walk together slowly

244
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,020
It’s more exciting than running and rushing.

245
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,000
Sure, let’s walk together.

246
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,400
Don’t run away.

247
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
Of course.

248
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,820
Come on.

249
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,420
None of this is real, is it?

250
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,900
You asking me to be your boyfriend and taking me here,

251
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,980
it’s all because of this.

252
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,440
Don’t hurt someone else’s feeling like it’s nothing.

253
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,820
This is still shallow.

254
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,960
Do you know how to swim?

255
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,600
No.

256
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,500
Hop on to my back.

257
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,440
You can help by kicking your legs.

258
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,720
Kick your legs or I’ll let you go.

259
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,360
No!

260
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,840
Let’s head back to shore.

261
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,280
Why, are you scared?

262
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,980
Be still, little one.

263
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,360
Let me examine you.

264
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
Shit!

265
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,800
Your heart is beating faster than normal.

266
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,300
Why is your heart down there anyway?

267
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,660
I like your examination very much krap

268
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,780
You’re so polite.

269
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,100
Very cute

270
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,840
I like it as well.

271
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,500
What about my trembling heart?

272
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,420
How do you plan to fix it?

273
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,960
I’ll take good care of your trembling heart

274
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,520
I’ll keep it close with mine.

275
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,280
I bury you in the sand

276
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,280
because I don’t want you to run away.

277
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,700
I don’t know if one day you’ll disappear from my life.

278
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,660
One thing I want you to know is I’ll be watching you

279
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,300
No matter what you do, know that I’m watching you

280
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,140
No matter where you go,

281
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,180
allow me to join your journey.

282
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,700
No matter where you sleep,

283
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,500
know that you’re in my embrace.

284
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,480
No matter whom you miss,

285
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,780
at least I miss you

286
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,760
No matter whom you love,

287
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,560
remember that I love you

288
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,940
So corny. Quite a series of lines.

289
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,960
Get up already. You’re heavy

290
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,960
Get me out.

291
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,980
Get out yourself.

292
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,200
How do you know this place?

293
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,420
I googled it.

294
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,680
I planned this yesterday when you’re mad at me.

295
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,820
I took you here as soon as you stopped being mad

296
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,580
People who’re mad at each other don’t do something like this

297
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,340
I wanted to do something useful.

298
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,660
I don’t want to waste any more time

299
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,720
If one day I disappear from your life

300
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,500
and won’t come back…

301
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,520
No way

302
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,480
If that time comes,

303
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,740
you have to be able to go on

304
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,420
If one day I disappear

305
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,400
you’ll have to pay attention to class and focus on your study

306
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,980
Don’t let time pass you by.

307
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,160
I’ll come back to you no matter what

308
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Fine.

309
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,930
Promise me something.

310
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,180
First,

311
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,060
when you’re mad, don’t run away far.

312
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,620
Second,

313
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,660
don’t die before I do.

314
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,400
Mork, come in.

315
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,240
Go ahead and take a shower.

316
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,060
If I finish my shower first, I’ll head back right away.

317
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,720
What are you doing?

318
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,560
What have you got?

319
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,500
Just water and snacks.

320
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,360
What do you want?

321
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,140
I want to drive

322
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,540
Come out.

323
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,240
Sit here. I’ll teach you.

324
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,140
Do I have to sit on your lap for you to teach me?

325
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,900
Sit on mine.

326
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,540
It’ll take a second. You’ll be able to drive in no time.

327
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,880
Are you scared?

328
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,380
Scoot over.

329
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,220
Put your hands here.

330
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,780
Why did you buy this?

331
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,700
You seem to know a lot about this stuff.

332
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,440
But you said you’ve never done it

333
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,220
You said you didn’t want to change anyone

334
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,480
So what’s this?

335
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,320
None of this is real, is it?

336
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,080
You asking me to be your boyfriend and taking me here

337
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,640
it’s all because of this.

338
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,500
If you’re horny, watch porn

339
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,020
Don’t hurt someone else’s feeling like it’s nothing.

340
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,700
Bam, I’m about to win!

341
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,700
P’Mork, this is Bam.

342
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,560
Is P’Tee going tomorrow?

343
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,280
I don’t know. Why did you call with Au’s number?

344
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,660
What’s going on with you two?

345
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,080
What do you mean?

346
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,780
Nothing.

347
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,620
I asked P’Au to pass some stuff to you.

348
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
I may not go tomorrow.

349
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,880
When did you know Au?

350
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,020
Just a few hours left and today is over

351
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,580
I don’t know if you know.

352
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,960
Can you please say Happy Birthday to Tee for me?

353
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,200
Oh, that’s right.

354
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,780
Today is his birthday.

355
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,860
I forgot all about it.

356
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,640
He may be a little bit needy. Do what he wants

357
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:51,050
It’s his day.

358
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,850
Who are you talking to?

359
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,400
Can I talk to Au?

360
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,840
I miss you.

361
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,300
Come find me then.

362
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,200
You’ve disappeared since you had…

363
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,280
It’s okay if you don’t have feelings for me

364
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,260
Yourfriend, don’t chat with me now.

365
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,780
I’m feeling stressed out.

366
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,680
Hello, P’Tee.

367
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,660
P’Mork is acting a little strange.

368
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,120
Are you two having a fight?

369
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,560
He’s not with you?

370
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,420
This is not a good time to run out of money.

371
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,020
Here.

372
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,880
What? Oh, I see.

373
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,020
My bro is missing.

374
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,960
Why don’t you post on social media?

375
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,940
Use your followers to your advantage.

376
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,360
Let’s use his photo from his IG.

377
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,280
You’ll find him soon.

378
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,400
Can I have a receipt and a pen?

379
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,160
Sure, hold on.

380
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,280
Yes.

381
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
Thanks

382
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,540
Here are a receipt and a pen.

383
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,140
I’m allergic to shrimps.

384
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Don’t kid about life and death matters.

385
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,540
Here.

386
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,560
Happy Birthday, Jerk.

387
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,300
Thanks.

388
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,680
I’m sorry. Where did you go?

389
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,580
I’ve been looking all over for you.

390
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,500
Why would you?

391
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,740
I’d have to come back eventually.

392
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,340
You’re my ride home.

393
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,060
Can I park and sleep here?

394
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,220
This is beautiful.

395
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,360
Let’s park over there where there is light.

396
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,680
Want to join me?

397
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,960
Don’t talk to me.

398
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,200
Drive and follow me.

399
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,860
Good morning, Mork.

400
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,280
Did you sleep well last night?

401
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,920
For you.

402
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,040
Eat it. It’s so yummy. I’ve had a few.

403
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,480
I’ll be mad if you don’t eat.

404
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,780
Open your mouth.

405
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,780
Yummy, right?

406
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,900
Mork,

407
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,160
I have something to tell you.

408
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,360
I’m allergic to shrimps.

409
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,680
When the allergy kicks in, I’ll feel itchy.

410
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,880
After that, I won’t be able to breathe.

411
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,700
Don’t kid about life and death matters

412
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,400
Shit, why didn’t you tell me?

413
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
What else are you allergic to?

414
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,920
Sit here. I’ll drive.

415
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,120
That’s fine. Let’s go to the school.

416
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,900
I’ll ask my family to bring the medicines.

417
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,040
If I’d told you, would you have bought it?

418
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,780
Shrimps are your favorite.

419
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,620
I was afraid you wouldn’t like me

420
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,180
if you found out I couldn’t eat shrimps

421
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,680
I don’t’ want to change you.

422
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,080
You’re at your best when you are you.

423
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,820
Are you sure you’ll be fine?

424
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Mhm.

425
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,280
Tell me as soon as you’re not okay.

426
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,540
The itching starts?

427
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,560
Let me help.

428
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,340
Are you okay?

429
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,060
I still am.

430
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,340
Hang in there.

431
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,420
Yes, sir

432
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,520
How are you feeling? Okay?

433
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,840
Drive safe.

434
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,820
See you.

435
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,600
Muad, you’re up early.

436
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,480
Where’s Morn? Is he at school?

437
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,240
No.

438
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,880
Where were you last night?

439
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,560
You were on TV last night

440
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,340
On TV? I’m famous now.

441
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,700
Yes, you are.

442
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,040
Your brother was looking everywhere for you

443
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,720
People said you’re here and there.

444
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,160
They’re looking everywhere.

445
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,320
Until we found you on a CC camera.

446
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,520
What you did with Handsome in that snow town,

447
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,800
everyone saw it

448
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,840
The school knows about it.

449
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,280
What did they see?

450
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,500
Did they show the clip on TV?

451
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,040
Did they see our faces?

452
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,560
I think

453
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,700
you shouldn’t go out.

454
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,280
Stay home.

455
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,040
They’re looking to catch you

456
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,240
Catch me?

457
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,500
You’re funny.

458
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,760
You’re funny.

459
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,100
Is life so funny to you?

460
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,860
What about Tee?

461
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,900
What did they say about him?

462
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,620
Don’t worry about other people.

463
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,740
You can resign from the school and be a barber like me.

464
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,180
I paid for your education and you didn’t give a damn.

465
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,120
No, I want to go to school.

466
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,740
I’m going to a school event

467
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,000
Seriously?

468
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,840
Since you were born,

469
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,280
I’ve never seen you want to go to a school event.

470
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,040
And today you want to go.

471
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,960
Don’t yell at your brother.

472
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,360
He hasn’t found out about this.

473
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,260
And this is all your fault anyway

474
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,760
No point being stressed.

475
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,580
Have you eaten?

476
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,180
Muad, do you have any medicines for allergies?

477
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,140
My friend is allergic. What should I do?

478
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,800
We used to have some. They’re your mom’s.

479
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,240
But I got rid of all of them.

480
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,440
Was she allergic to shrimps?

481
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,780
She’s allergic to everything.

482
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,280
You just never paid attention.

483
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,400
Just a moment

484
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,660
Rak Nub Nueb

485
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,280
Hey, when did you get here?

486
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,880
Practicing hard, huh?

487
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,520
I represent my school, so I have to do my best.

488
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,760
Where did you go? Why are you not at home?

489
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,520
I went to pick up Morn.

490
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,000
My house is just around the corner.

491
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,280
I can even get to school with my eyes closed.

492
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,820
The person I care about is here. Where else can I be?

493
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,960
Ew, get out.

494
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,360
I sweat all over.

495
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,920
If you sweat, you need to unbutton a few to let it out.

496
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,800
See, now you’re cooling off.

497
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,020
Thanks, Mork

498
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,880
Come on, I’ll practice with you.

499
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,840
Show me how to throw a mace.

500
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,960
Sure.

501
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,180
I can’t seem to catch the mace

502
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,320
The big rehearsal is tomorrow.

503
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,900
Relax. Don’t be tense.

504
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,640
You noticed?

505
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,520
I have a third eye.

506
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,600
Let’s find something refreshing to eat first and practice later

507
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,260
Wait over there.

508
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,800
Oh, you once said if you’re feeling blue, eat ice-cream.

509
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,260
It will freshen you up.

510
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,120
What are you doing?

511
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,800
I couldn’t let it go to waste.

512
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,640
You’re crazy.

513
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,160
Relaxed now?

514
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,920
Yeah

515
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,420
Whenever you feel blue, I can take care of you.

516
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,300
Go and try again

517
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,780
Yay! See? I told you

518
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,100
Don’t worry about that

519
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,120
Worry about getting kicked out of school.

520
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,940
Think it over and hard

521
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,120
If you don’t let him go,

522
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,300
you’re dragging him down with you
