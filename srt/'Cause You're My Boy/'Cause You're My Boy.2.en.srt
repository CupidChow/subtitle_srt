1
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,760
Are you or aren’t you?

2
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,100
Am I what? I’m a 100% straight

3
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,980
I meant, are you a hair washer?

4
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,140
I can’t stand the heroine. She’s acting like a virgin.

5
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,600
‘I’m a virgin. I don’t like this guy.’ Look at her

6
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,240
You can go home now.

7
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,480
Wash the clothes and return them as soon as you can

8
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Don’t forget.

9
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,120
You bring an umbrella and walk with him

10
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,120
We can lend him an umbrella. He can return it later

11
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,040
His dorm is just around the corner.

12
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,800
Can’t you just walk him there?

13
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,220
Clients are most important for our business

14
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,120
Don’t sigh.

15
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,840
Bro, here’s an umbrella.

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,300
You show up for this, huh?

17
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,420
Any more umbrella?

18
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,200
I don’t need your question. I’m watching a soap.

19
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,260
Bro,

20
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,620
your boyfriend looks handsome with this haircut

21
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,620
You’re too rough on your brother. High on energy much?

22
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,460
Muad, this guy is the most handsome in the school

23
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,520
When he posts his pictures, he gets over 30,000 likes

24
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,020
That many likes?

25
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,260
What are you waiting for? We need to snap his picture

26
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,680
Handsome, have a seat first.

27
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,240
Snap his picture. Quick!

28
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,900
We need to promote our shop

29
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
Can I use your phone?

30
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,640
Mork’s phone is shabby.

31
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,500
Take a good picture. Make sure you focus on his hair.

32
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,260
Muad, not yet. Only he in the picture first

33
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,760
You didn’t tell me.

34
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,080
Let me take a selfie.

35
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,080
Make sure you see his hair. Three of us.

36
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,260
1 2

37
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,380
I’m posting in IG.

38
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,660
Location is Muad Moo Barber

39
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,160
Tagging myself.

40
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,800
Following.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,700
Then, post.

42
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,620
Thank you.

43
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,480
Get home safe.

44
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Let’s go.

45
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,540
Come on in. I was tasked to take you to your dorm.

46
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,900
Here we are.

47
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,000
You know where I live?

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,700
You just told my dad

49
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,720
It has stopped raining

50
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,000
Why didn’t you tell me?

51
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,200
I’ll talk to your girlfriend.

52
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,600
Can’t stop smiling, huh?

53
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,620
I’ll help you with the toilet.

54
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,140
Good. I’ll clean it the first week.

55
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,960
You take the following two weeks.

56
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,780
I’m out of here.

57
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Mork,

58
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,920
sweet dreams

59
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,000
Don’t sweet dreams me. I’ve got chills

60
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
See you.

61
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,540
Hey, next time, have your hair washed by P’ Som.

62
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,520
I’m not very good at it

63
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,420
Now I’m really out of here

64
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,960
Wait, Mork.

65
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,800
What are you doing here?

66
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,320
I’m finding something to eat.

67
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,400
Morn!

68
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,860
Come here. What are you doing here?

69
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,060
What’s up?

70
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,420
What are you doing?

71
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,180
Nothing. I’m getting some flowers for Muad

72
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,540
Right?

73
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,860
I just haven’t done it yet.

74
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,600
Sawasdee krap.

75
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,260
I’m hungry.

76
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,760
Morn, 7 Eleven?

77
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,200
Your treat.

78
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,900
Sweet dreams.

79
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,240
That’s the third time.

80
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,980
Should we just sleep here?

81
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,440
Sweet dreams.

82
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,480
I’m really leaving.

83
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,640
Muad, why didn’t you lock up?

84
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,740
Aren’t you afraid of burglars?

85
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,260
You’re getting popular now, you crew-cut gay

86
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,620
Gay my ass.

87
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,560
He’s mad. He must not have seen the Line chat.

88
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,180
Let me show it to you.

89
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,020
That may get you in a better mood.

90
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,240
Shit!

91
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
It’s your brother’s doing.

92
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,600
Look at this.

93
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,360
Morn, you asshole!

94
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
Did you put him up to this?

95
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,900
Auntie, same menu, please.

96
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,360
Just a sec.

97
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,020
Your favorite dish: fried shrimp with basil on rice with egg

98
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,160
What’s up, sis?

99
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
You’re eating egg? I want to see your egg.

100
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,240
So cute.

101
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,020
Can I join you?

102
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,580
No.

103
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,660
Can I or not?

104
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,400
Sit if you want to. It’s a free country.

105
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,820
Hey, what are you doing?

106
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,640
That’s my friend.

107
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,520
Sit properly.

108
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Let me hide behind you.

109
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,020
Cover me.

110
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,560
More.

111
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
More.

112
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,340
Okay.

113
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,080
No, I’ll go.

114
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,320
Tee, eat.

115
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,600
Have some food.

116
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Basil?

117
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,640
What, you don’t like it?

118
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,420
No, I can eat it.

119
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,000
I got it for you

120
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,380
The ice is melting.

121
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,860
I thought these are all for you

122
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,220
You got here late.

123
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,140
Your eyes are swollen. Have you been crying?

124
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,360
I didn’t sleep at all last night.

125
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,780
What were you doing? Masturbating?

126
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,960
Are you upset that your girl dumped you?

127
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,160
Call her

128
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,820
720 calls. You were calling her all night.

129
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,720
I don’t think she broke up with you because of me.

130
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,240
It’s because you’re annoying.

131
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,520
You can use my phone to call her.

132
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,560
She didn’t pick up. Maybe her phone is turned off

133
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,660
Or the battery is dead.

134
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,440
Did she call back?

135
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
No.

136
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,360
Who’s calling? Let me see.

137
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,040
Stay out of it. It’s my dad.

138
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,900
Well, well, well. You made a debut as a couple yesterday.

139
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,420
Now, you get your sweet on in the canteen.

140
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,160
What are you doing here?

141
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,540
I’m here for my order

142
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,920
Where is my stuff? Give it to me.

143
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,920
Here you go. 500 baht. Pay up.

144
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,580
These three are for free.

145
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,480
Good boy.

146
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,980
When will you two update your relationship status?

147
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,560
I can guarantee that you’ll have tens of thousands followers

148
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,420
Hey, you got your things, now scoot.

149
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,700
Otherwise, I’ll take back the freebies.

150
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,820
Bad temper, huh? Fine, I’ll go.

151
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,060
What’s your Facebook ID?

152
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,700
I know, Nueamork Muadmoo Barber

153
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,460
Here’s my one.

154
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,620
So? It’s your business.

155
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,480
It’s our business.

156
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,440
Be my boyfriend.

157
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,260
Huh? What?

158
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,460
What did you do?

159
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,660
I like dudes. No! I am a dude.

160
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,920
Hello, Bambie.

161
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,420
You’re pretty but Tee is in a committed relationship now.

162
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,640
Here’s my one.

163
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,440
So? It’s your business

164
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,000
It’s our business.

165
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,100
Be my boyfriend

166
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,320
Huh? What?

167
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,860
What did you do?

168
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,140
I like dudes. No! I am a dude

169
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,460
Not for real

170
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,860
Are you being funny right now?

171
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,160
Bambie…

172
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,040
I see. You’re trying to get her attention.

173
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,260
Is this the way?

174
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,740
You’re trying to win back a girl by seeing a guy.

175
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,080
How is that going to work?

176
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,960
I can’t get someone else into this mess.

177
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,060
You’re the perfect candidate. You just had a gay rumor

178
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,180
Asshole.

179
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,100
Plus, it’s already too late.

180
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,060
Here’s my request. You clean the toilet alone for three weeks

181
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Mhm.

182
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,120
What we need to do is

183
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,160
take a picture and post it on social media as much as possible

184
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,840
I’m begging you.

185
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Are you getting back at me?

186
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,820
Don’t make me more embarrassed than I already am.

187
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,040
I wasn’t going for that

188
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,240
We are a couple at school. We need to abide by the rules

189
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,640
Huh?

190
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,820
Sawasdee krap, Bro.

191
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,260
Sawasdee krap, Bro’s Boyfriend

192
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,900
It’s good that you two are here.

193
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,580
Record a video for me

194
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,900
Okay.

195
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,880
You can use my phone.

196
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,060
A video? What video?

197
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,000
Follow my instruction. Don’t mess this up.

198
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,920
Let’s go.

199
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,360
Guys, listen up.

200
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,680
Mork and Tee will make an announcement.

201
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,340
Come and watch.

202
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,500
I, Mungkorn Jiaranontanan, Class 11/1.

203
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:07,100
I, Nueamork Jirapakpinit, Class 11/7.

204
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,140
Say it. Say it. Say it.

205
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,000
Tee,

206
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,140
do you take me to be your boyfriend?

207
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,640
I do.

208
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,020
Were they really trying to take off our pants?

209
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,120
Yes, I was helping them the other day.

210
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,340
Jerk.

211
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,980
Give it up.

212
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,860
What are you doing in there?

213
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,000
Psychos.

214
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,880
What’s up?

215
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,380
I need to pee.

216
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,600
Go and pee. No need to tell me.

217
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,920
Turn around

218
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,040
I don’t want to see yours. I have mine.

219
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
I think they’re all gone

220
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,960
They took your shirt.

221
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,900
Good that they returned it.

222
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,040
Or I’ll have to use some paper to cover myself up

223
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,360
That’d be bad.

224
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,560
What are you doing?

225
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
What are you doing?

226
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,720
You can wear this one

227
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,880
No. This one is fine.

228
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,060
See you at the toilet cleaning session.

229
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,600
I’m not doing it with you.

230
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,300
See you tomorrow then

231
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,840
Tomorrow is Saturday.

232
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,180
6 AM. See you in front of the school.

233
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,460
Dress nicely.

234
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,200
That’s all for today.

235
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,500
Don’t forget to submit a report next week.

236
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,300
Students, pay respect

237
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,920
Thank you.

238
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,260
Hello.

239
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,580
Hello, did someone just call me with this number?

240
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
What?

241
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,320
Who is this? Anything you want to talk to me about?

242
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,000
If you remain silent, I’ll hang up.

243
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,860
You’re feisty.

244
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,960
Who did you want to talk to? Are you a psycho?

245
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,700
Hello, Bambie

246
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,400
You’re pretty but Tee is in a committed relationship now

247
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,460
Sorry.

248
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,600
You think I’m a psycho but you’re still talking to me.

249
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,260
She hung up.

250
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,760
What are you laughing at?

251
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,640
I just want this whole thing to end.

252
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,180
I give in.

253
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,740
Let me ask you something

254
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,680
Did you and that jerk really get together?

255
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
You were fighting yesterday.

256
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,020
Today, you exchanged shirts.

257
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,460
So, are you…?

258
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,940
Am I what?

259
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,140
I give in.

260
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,660
I don’t mind if you have a boyfriend

261
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,320
Listen to me, I’ll tell you this.

262
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,520
A boyfriend may not stay with you forever

263
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,320
But I will.

264
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,220
Give me a hug.

265
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,980
This is just a ruse. We’re not really together.

266
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,560
I’m going.

267
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,740
Where are you going?

268
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,840
I’m going home

269
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
See you.

270
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,380
Okay, see you

271
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,040
Whom I like is none of your business.

272
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,620
I care about you.

273
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,240
You’re not my type, Ching

274
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,780
Can’t I smile at my boyfriend?

275
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,780
Boyfriend my ass.

276
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,520
Break up with Tee.

277
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,260
He never cares about you.

278
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,320
This does not concern you.

279
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,900
Why not?

280
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,220
Whom I like is none of your business

281
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,060
I care about you.

282
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,180
Your business is mine

283
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,780
Haven’t you seen the clip?

284
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,820
You’re not my type, Ching

285
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,220
You’re late again.

286
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
Let’s go.

287
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,800
Not yet. Let’s wait for your boyfriend.

288
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,680
He kept me company for a while.

289
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,000
He just went to the toilet.

290
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,300
You asked someone to come home with

291
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,680
and it didn’t occur to you to consult me?

292
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,420
The tuition fee is due tomorrow.

293
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,560
Again?

294
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,600
How much?

295
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,220
Same price.

296
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,220
I do want to take additional courses.

297
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,220
This one, this one and this one.

298
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,640
Others took it and their scores increased

299
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,040
But these are so expensive.

300
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,400
Muad Moo wouldn’t allow me to take these

301
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,480
It’s fine. I can ask for Gord’s materials

302
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,240
What are you smiling for?

303
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,440
Have you talked to Bambie?

304
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,100
Can’t I smile at my boyfriend?

305
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,600
Boyfriend my ass

306
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
Have you cleaned the toilet?

307
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,380
How was it?

308
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,800
It was fun.

309
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,960
Good, you had fun while cleaning the toilet.

310
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,060
You’re weird.

311
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,620
Come on

312
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,140
Come on and hop up.

313
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,740
I’m here.

314
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,880
Right on time.

315
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,580
My live feed today got so many followers.

316
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,640
Muad Moo Barber will be slammed with clients

317
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,880
Won’t P’ Mork be upset that you do this?

318
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,060
Why would he?

319
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,560
More followers, our shop will be more popular

320
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,780
He wouldn’t mind.

321
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,740
Simple as that.

322
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,000
Did you once tell me how you got your name?

323
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,320
I was addicted to my pillow when I was a kid.

324
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,240
What about if a pillow hugs you?

325
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Stop it.

326
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,640
Why did you stop?

327
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,200
I wasn’t going to drop you off

328
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,460
I’m here to withdraw money

329
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,760
See you tomorrow

330
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,980
Here.

331
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,000
Get home safe

332
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,500
Sawasdee krap, I need a suggestion

333
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,340
I want a lot of followers for my barbershop account

334
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,420
Want to increase sales? Want to be a net idol?

335
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,680
Here, we have a list of followers

336
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,060
We guarantee explosion!

337
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,720
How many followers do you want?

338
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,520
As many as possible.

339
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,020
100,000 Thai IG followers for 19,999 baht.

340
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,300
Interested?

341
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,280
Yes.

342
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,600
Transfer now and place an order.

343
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,760
Bummer!

344
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,320
Muad, here’s some food.

345
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,600
Smells good. What do you have?

346
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,880
Be a good student.

347
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,400
Thank you.

348
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,180
Has anyone made orders today?

349
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,580
I noted it down in that book.

350
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,680
Have a bite.

351
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,760
Don’t you want to eat?

352
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,880
Aren’t you going to eat?

353
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,500
I’m on diet

354
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,820
Come on, just a little

355
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,260
Fine.

356
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,120
It’s yummy. Let me have it.

357
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,040
Hey, let’s share

358
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,620
Come and get it if you want it.

359
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,060
We’ll end up with nothing to eat.

360
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,340
Fine, let’s share.

361
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,380
Mork.

362
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,420
Where is everyone?

363
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,120
They went to get something.

364
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
We might see Bambie today.

365
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,340
Will she come and see you?

366
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,200
No, she’s a drum major.

367
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,300
You guys are a perfect match.

368
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,000
Two drum majors as a couple

369
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,400
We are a couple.

370
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,080
Can you take this?

371
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,580
And this.

372
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,900
Let’s take a picture.

373
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,460
1 2 3 Selfie!

374
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,060
I take good pictures

375
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,180
I’ll leave this camera with you.

376
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,660
You pretend to take photos of me

377
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,660
but take whatever pictures you want.

378
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,420
How does this work?

379
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,920
Here

380
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,900
Just touch gently.

381
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,260
Shit, are you for real?

382
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,540
Come here.

383
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,200
It can zoom very far

384
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,340
You can look at whatever you want to.

385
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,260
Shit, that sounds creepy

386
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,620
You’re a creepy dude.

387
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,020
Try to take a photo of something.

388
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,320
Why are you smiling?

389
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,380
I must look funny. Let me see

390
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,300
Not funny. You’re cute.

391
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,080
Let me take a photo of you.

392
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,260
No.

393
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,400
Why?

394
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,220
I want to be the one who sees you smile.

395
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940
Hungry?

396
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,100
Let’s find something to eat.

397
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
Wait.

398
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,220
Have they contacted you?

399
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,980
No.

400
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,240
Let’s go.

401
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,180
Wait for me.

402
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,380
What did you get?

403
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,500
(he means condoms, I am guessing as they are on average 52 mm in width)

404
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,880
52

405
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,700
What? Why did you get it?

406
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,880
I’ve never seen a real one before

407
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,740
Have you never?

408
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,740
Why, are you happy?

409
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,000
Why, are you happy?

410
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,640
Why would I be happy?

411
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,660
Rookie.

412
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,920
You are experienced?

413
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,780
If I say no, will I look like a dork?

414
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,520
I never have.

415
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,700
I’m happy

416
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,920
Happy for what?

417
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,680
You’re just a kid.

418
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,440
wait for me

419
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,440
You came out of nowhere.

420
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,660
So, what’s up?

421
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,340
You’re here to take his photos

422
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,820
It’s nothing.

423
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,340
Don’t you think this is too much?

424
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,140
Seriously, one, you gave in to him during that session with the teacher

425
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,720
Two, you asked him to be your boyfriend yesterday.

426
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,000
Three,

427
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,740
you held his hand.

428
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,300
Four, you made a debut at school.

429
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,740
You’ve done all this. What does it mean?

430
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,520
It’s a joke.

431
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,720
Mork, this is getting messy. Stop it.

432
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,540
Delete the relationship status.

433
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,460
Unfriend him on Facebook

434
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
This won’t continue for long. I’ll…

435
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,860
We shall see.

436
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,320
Think carefully what you do.

437
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,160
Have you ever thought of winning me back?

438
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,800
Buying a new bike?

439
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,740
Be careful with your money.

440
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,620
I’m just window shopping.

441
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,320
Hey.

442
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,680
We’ve been out for a while

443
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,520
Let’s go back to the class

444
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,880
No, it’s so hot outside.

445
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,540
Let’s chill here in an air-con room

446
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,560
Won’t the teacher be upset?

447
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,400
We told her that we’d go to the toilet

448
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,220
She’ll be suspicious that we’ve been out this long.

449
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,400
I know. It’s fine

450
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,140
Let’s take a photo.

451
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,300
What photo?

452
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,460
A selfie.

453
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,180
For Muad Moo Barber.

454
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,880
Muad Moo Barber.

455
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,080
Posting on IG.

456
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,360
Do you think this caption is good?

457
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,040
If you don’t want to be lonely, come on over

458
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,500
Did you come up with it yourself?

459
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,040
No, I remember it from somewhere.

460
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,540
Too racy?

461
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,620
I’ve done my research.

462
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,840
If it’s not racy, people won’t like

463
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,740
But what you said is valid. It may be too racy.

464
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,640
I should just delete it.

465
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,180
Don’t. Next time think more carefully.

466
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,400
You’ve already posted this one.

467
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,720
I will ask for your input before I post next time

468
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,880
What should I do to get as many as followers as you?

469
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,340
Why do you need it?

470
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,540
I want to make my dad proud.

471
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,820
I want people to like Muad’s barbershop

472
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,040
Give me your phone then.

473
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,940
Order some food.

474
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,120
Okay, do you want anything?

475
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,640
No.

476
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,540
You look tired.

477
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,740
Did you wait long?

478
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,940
So long.

479
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,520
Thanks.

480
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,940
Here. Wipe it yourself.

481
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,940
No, we’re a couple.

482
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,720
You have to do it for me.

483
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,480
What now?

484
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,140
All good.

485
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,440
Not sure if it’s because of this

486
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,140
Or this.

487
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,860
Don’t.

488
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,600
Let me see the pictures.

489
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,180
Are there a lot of hot girls in there?

490
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,360
You can’t look.

491
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,120
P’ Tee, can I have a picture with you?

492
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,020
Sure.

493
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,380
Shit, what do I do?

494
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Have you ever thought of winning me back?

495
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,170
Bam!

496
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,400
I’m going to go.

497
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,280
Mork, you said we’d leave together.

498
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,640
You said you’re trying to get her back.

499
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,340
Listen to me.

500
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,460
Go back to her.

501
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,940
Leave me alone.

502
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,680
I’m sorry.

503
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,340
It’s fine. It’s my bad.

504
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,520
Let’s get something to eat.

505
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,360
My treat.

506
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,380
I want to watch a movie.

507
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,200
We need to eat first.

508
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,320
Let’s go.

509
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,880
Let’s find something to eat

510
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,180
You go first.

511
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:57,360
Can I have a Sen Yai without blood cakes, shrimp balls or squid?

512
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,800
You’re so picky

513
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,760
Same for me.

514
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,720
Two Thai teas.

515
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,000
You like shrimp and basil on rice, but don’t like noodles, right?

516
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,880
Good memory.

517
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,120
Normally, people who like basil don’t like noodles.

518
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,700
You made it up.

519
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,220
How would you know? Don’t you like noodles?

520
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,480
Here’s the thing.

521
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,680
People who like noodles select only the type of noodle they like

522
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,000
so random

523
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,980
Maybe I like Sen Yai like you.

524
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,440
Maybe people who like Sen Lek will change their mind to Sen Yai.

525
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,520
Yeah?

526
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,380
It’s not uncommon.

527
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,160
Take my mom. My mom used to like Sen Lek.

528
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,560
But Muad liked Sen Yai.

529
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,180
Then, my mom adopted his preference

530
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,880
It may be difficult, but with the right motivation

531
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,500
anything is possible.

532
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,420
Do you like Sen Yai like your dad?

533
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,940
I don’t like noodles in general.

534
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,500
There you go.

535
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,220
I just wanted to pick a topic to debate with you. So?

536
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,160
Nothing.

537
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,960
There he is.

538
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,840
Thanks.

539
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,120
Thanks.

540
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,180
Season it for me.

541
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,800
Sure.

542
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,520
Do you want spicy?

543
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,040
I don’t like spicy

544
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,240
All done?

545
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,780
Have a go.

546
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,720
It may be a little sweet.

547
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,760
You like fish balls, don’t you?

548
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,020
Here you go.

549
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,520
You’re good at taking care of people

550
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,260
I’m not good at it.

551
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,780
I just care.

552
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,280
Don’t you like basil?

553
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,460
I may like it if I try.

554
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,420
You’ve been around me a lot lately?

555
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,720
Have you grown fond of me?

556
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,000
I don’t like guys.

557
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,140
That can change, too.

558
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,100
You just need the right motivation.

559
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,000
Enough. It’s just the two of us.

560
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,780
No need to pretend for anyone.

561
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,420
It’s getting cold.

562
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,020
Wait a minute. You’ll get dry soon.

563
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,060
Try rubbing your hands like this.

564
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,620
What the hell am I doing?

565
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,220
I have to pee.

566
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,600
Go to the toilet with me.

567
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,280
Go.

568
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,540
You dropped me off. Now go.

569
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,100
You’re still peeing?

570
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,060
Don’t come closer.

571
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,060
I don’t want to watch you

572
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,320
Why didn’t I hear you pee?

573
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,400
I can’t pee.

574
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,760
I have a boner

575
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,060
Mork, help me.

576
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,600
Hey, you’re still here.

577
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,940
I just finished my practice.

578
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,480
Here.

579
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,880
Thanks.

580
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,660
Let me borrow it. I’ll return tomorrow

581
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,620
See you.

582
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,880
See you.

583
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,700
Thanks for last night.

584
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,900
With pleasure.

585
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,360
I got this for you.

586
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,600
Have you eaten?

587
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,320
Yes.

588
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,940
Let’s eat it now then.

589
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,660
Open your mouth.

590
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,900
Good stuff, right? I eat it every day. Yummy.

591
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,100
Shit, I haven’t done my homework.

592
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,460
Help me do it.

593
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,240
Sure.

594
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,460
Wait for me.

595
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,320
I know loneliness well.

596
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,760
The feeling when you want to hug someone.

597
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,840
Don’t ever say you don’t have a friend

598
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,160
That hurts for a friend like me.

599
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,340
If you don’t have it, why would you cover it up?

600
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,480
Let me see.

601
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,240
Tee is not gay.

602
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,280
How do you know?

603
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,500
Have you proved it?
