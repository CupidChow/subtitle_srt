1
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,720
Any questions?

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,180
Mr. Nueamork.

3
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,880
You requested a pass to the bathroom since the beginning of the class

4
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,720
And you’ve just come back.

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,540
Do you have diarrhea?

6
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes, Teacher. My tummy hurts.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,720
I deserve sympathy, right?

8
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,560
Good. If you’d shown up

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,140
you wouldn’t have had the strength to do a quiz at the end, would you?

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,180
What?

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,000
Bye. 10 marks. Raw

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,020
Wait, Teacher? Teacher. Teacher

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,100
Teacher...

14
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,440
She’s gone

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,440
No no

16
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,320
Hey, Ooh and Ton, want to go the game shop?

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,540
You ditched the afternoon class and now you’re asking me to play?

18
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,020
Yeah, let’s go.

19
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,420
Shit, Ooh. You always spoil him.

20
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,340
Ton, you’re too uptight

21
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,440
Ooh, my man.

22
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,580
Your hair is getting long.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,700
So?

24
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,360
We’ll be inspected for the Reserved Officer Training Corps program.

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,920
Don’t forget to cut your hair.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,760
Most barbershops are closed on Wednesday

27
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,000
But Muad Moo Barber opens every day.

28
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,260
You just had to promote your dad’s shop.

29
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,740
Let’s go.

30
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,500
On cloud nine

31
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,600
What’s happening down there?

32
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,320
He’s such a showoff. He had it coming

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,060
We should head home. This is bullshit

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,780
Guys, I’ll help you.

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,020
What the hell? You, Judas!

36
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,060
Assholes!

37
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,680
Assholes!

38
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,800
Hey, bring back my pants!

39
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,440
P’ Mork!

40
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,700
What is this? A new fad?

41
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,960
What? No!

42
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,720
Fun facts, huh?

43
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,280
Oh, you’d want to know what’s inside, wouldn’t you?

44
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,720
I’ll show you.

45
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,660
Let’s go.

46
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,640
I’m going home.

47
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,100
Where are you hurried to?

48
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Show me what you’ve got

49
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,180
There is a hole there

50
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,320
P’Mork, where are you going?

51
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,040
Wait for me.

52
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,700
Going home so soon.

53
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,940
P’ Mork!

54
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,500
Hello, I’m Mork.

55
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,420
The coolest 11th grader in town

56
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,760
from face all the way to haircut.

57
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,380
My dad runs the no.1 barbershop in this area.

58
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,400
True story

59
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,100
This is Muad Moo, my dad.

60
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,560
He’s the strongest barber on earth

61
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,080
He may be chubby but h moves like water when he cuts

62
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,640
Not just hair on your head, he cuts other body hair as well

63
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,060
except one ****.

64
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,920
Apart from Muad Moo, there’s one more member in my family,

65
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,900
Morn, my younger brother.

66
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,660
He just started his 8th grade but his life is full of drama

67
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,580
The best one is he got hit by a car last year because

68
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,960
he’s busy looking at his phone while crossing the road.

69
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,580
His leg was broken for three months.

70
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,860
Muad Moo had to confiscate his mobile phone indefinitely

71
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,480
He no longer has the screen addiction

72
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,080
but he comes home very late.

73
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,240
I don’t know what he’s up to.

74
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,720
Our house is really close to school

75
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,720
but I’ve never seen him get home before me.

76
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,180
Hey, from my friend.

77
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,980
Due tomorrow.

78
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,040
Sorry, I can only do 5 handwriting styles per day.

79
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,920
I can’t do the 6th

80
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
I have to get this done now

81
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,300
He’s got a buddy called Gord

82
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,920
Their names go together: Gord Morn (hug a pillow).

83
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,240
But their personalities do not

84
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,020
I don’t know how they’ve become friends.

85
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,900
My name is Mork. My dad’s is Moo.

86
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,400
My bro’s is Morn. My mom’s is Mee

87
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,020
Everyone says I take after my mom because I look like a half foreigner

88
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,580
Morn takes after my dad 100%.

89
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,900
Yes, Mommy Mee is an angle now

90
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
She doesn’t have to get a headache over Morn like me.

91
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,480
Even though she’s passed, I believe that Mee is still around

92
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,520
Why?

93
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,800
Mork!

94
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,180
Check my lotto.

95
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,020
Here’s why.

96
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,520
Mee comes to Muad Moo almost every night to give the lotto numbers

97
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,760
Muad Moo buys it almost every time

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
Has he ever won?

99
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,180
Maybe once

100
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,640
I don’t just sit around waiting for him to win a lotto

101
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,960
I have a side job that pays handsomely

102
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,200
Yes, my business that pays is selling porn movies.

103
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,900
I sell all kinds of porn: Asia, colored, 3p, outdoor

104
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,500
Outdoor has been selling well lately.

105
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,620
I don’t know why it’s popular

106
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,400
For me, porn does not need prop.

107
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,020
Just a fine actress is enough.

108
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,260
Arm, are you here for a haircut?

109
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,980
Yes.

110
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,580
You said your daddy is big deal

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,040
Better be safe than sorry

112
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,560
What about the outdoor film that I asked?

113
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,900
Did you get it?

114
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,920
I have a bunch.

115
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,180
Get a good grip of my iPad.

116
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,580
Don’t let it get wet.

117
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,160
This is for preview only.

118
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,800
Let me get my haircut first.

119
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,880
Oh, the other person that is totally the highlight of our shop is P’Som

120
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,740
She’s a beauty with a big rack but still keeps her manhood.

121
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,380
She’s the reason why our shop is never empty

122
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,680
I’m here until late today.

123
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,420
Can I go home early tomorrow?

124
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
My hubby has run away again

125
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,000
You’re a lady. Why do you have to chase after a guy?

126
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,860
Let a guy come to you for once.

127
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,960
I’m not chasing after anyone. I’ve met someone new

128
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,260
He’s outside. I’ve got to go.

129
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,360
And this is our barbershop.

130
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,580
We’re chilling and friendly.

131
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,900
Are you done? Don’t forget.

132
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,460
You’ve got it. I’ll deliver tomorrow.

133
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,320
Turn this way.

134
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,380
The most annoying client is the one who comes just before we close.

135
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,020
We’re closed.

136
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,860
I said we’re closed.

137
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,520
Have you ever cut hair before?

138
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,100
Want to give it a try?

139
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,320
1 2 3.

140
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,720
What do you want?

141
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,140
I want shit to go down.

142
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,140
Don’t be all talk

143
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,380
We’re closed.

144
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,000
I said we’re closed

145
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,140
Just a quick one.

146
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,000
Just make it short enough so I won’t get busted

147
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,280
Wait right here.

148
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,900
Why are you just standing there? Come in

149
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,340
Muad Moo, come! The client is waiting.

150
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,660
I know

151
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,880
Mork, have you checked my lotto like I asked you to?

152
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,180
I forgot.

153
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,480
You forgot?

154
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,620
When I ask you to do something, it’s like I’m talking to nobody

155
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,040
Useless.

156
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,080
Give me the phone. I’ll call to check myself

157
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,980
What are you doing there? Come here

158
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,540
Do you want to get a haircut tomorrow or something?

159
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,520
Okay.

160
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,260
Do you want a Christ or a Singto?

161
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,520
He’s just a student.

162
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,620
I was kidding.

163
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Why are you still standing here?

164
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,200
Pick Morn up already. He’ll cry if you get there late.

165
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,220
He can wait. Let me do my business first.

166
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,160
You call and check now. The bookie may go to bed soon.

167
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,920
Right, wait a second.

168
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,340
I see that you don’t like a catalog.

169
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,720
Maybe some previews will get you interested

170
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
I have everything at a reasonable price

171
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,260
She’s not picking up

172
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,780
Do you have a style that you want?

173
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,120
Not too short - just so I won’t get busted during the inspection tomorrow

174
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,500
You’ve got it.

175
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,980
I guarantee the inspector will scream like a lady

176
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,600
What grade are you in?

177
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,660
Grade 11

178
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,340
You’re buff for an 11th grader.

179
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,300
Do you play sports or work out?

180
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,260
I go to the gym.

181
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,760
Good. Ask Mork to go with you next time.

182
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,900
He does nothing but scratching his balls and write DVDs

183
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,880
When he has money, he spends it all on girls.

184
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,060
That’s an exaggeration.

185
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,320
Why are you smiling? Pick your movie.

186
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,700
Have you decided?

187
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,360
Don’t threaten my client.

188
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,620
Where did you cut your hair last?

189
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,760
Not here, I suppose.

190
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,420
I’ve just moved to this alley.

191
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,680
Come back here again.

192
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,280
Cut here once and you’ll never want to go anywhere else

193
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,260
I’ll make you handsome.

194
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,100
Handsome

195
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Wait a second.

196
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,020
Hello, Muay.

197
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,300
I called you a while ago. Why didn’t you pick up?

198
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,980
What? Really?

199
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,340
I won the lotto! I won!

200
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,060
Mork, close the shop. I’ll go to Muay.

201
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,660
Wait, Muad Moo!

202
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,080
And he’s gone.

203
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,690
Go home. Come back tomorrow.

204
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,980
The barber isn’t here.

205
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,580
Have you ever cut hair before?

206
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,480
Why, want to give it a try?

207
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,760
Mhm

208
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
Ready?

209
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,740
Mhm.

210
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,660
Hey, stay still or you’ll lose your ear.

211
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,360
I’ll count.

212
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,720
1

213
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,780
2

214
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,240
3

215
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,220
Hey, you can come back to cut hair with my dad tomorrow.

216
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,920
I need to go to bed. I’m tired.

217
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,360
Wait!

218
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,060
You need to take responsibility.

219
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,380
So what? You asked me to cut your hair.

220
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,940
I didn’t ask you to do a shit job

221
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,660
Come back and fix it tomorrow. I’ll tell my dad.

222
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,380
Shit, if you are not satisfied,

223
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,980
would you want a free haircut for a lifetime here?

224
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,880
Go home.

225
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,280
Get out of here.

226
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,320
Go!

227
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,700
What do you want?

228
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,340
I want shit to go down.

229
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,920
Oh, you’re all talk.

230
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,820
Don’t do that.

231
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,140
I don’t want trouble.

232
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,260
If you don’t want trouble, don’t talk shit.

233
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,700
Come back and fix your hair tomorrow.

234
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,980
Don’t prance around the school with that hair

235
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,080
or people will say shit about my shop.

236
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,060
I haven’t gone live yet and it’s all over

237
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,640
Let’s take a look at the clip.

238
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,160
Hey, you!

239
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,280
That way, please

240
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,000
Shit!

241
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,860
Clean the toilet for 3 weeks

242
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,860
That may give you time to reflect on what you’ve done

243
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,920
Bro, you’re late. What were you up to?

244
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,220
Just got some stuff to deal with.

245
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,640
Drive slow. Wait for Gord

246
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,820
Let’s go

247
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
Put this on.

248
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,460
What did you that for?

249
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,780
Your friend is cute.

250
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,300
Sawasdee krap.

251
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,380
Sawasdee ja

252
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,680
Nong Gord, your skin is paler than what I expected

253
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,140
Help me.

254
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,400
What’s wrong?

255
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,480
I’m afraid.

256
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,980
What’s this?

257
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,940
Are you hiding behind Morn because you’re hiding from me

258
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,480
or do you want to get close to someone?

259
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,780
No, nothing like that.

260
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,780
Your name is Ching

261
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,180
Do you speak Ching Chong, Chang Chong?

262
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,400
Silly.

263
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,140
Have a seat.

264
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,720
P’Mork, stop there.

265
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,360
We have something to straighten out

266
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,740
What thing?

267
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,540
Who’s this?

268
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,820
What’s that?

269
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,400
You got a lot of likes

270
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,760
I’m good at this

271
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,240
If you want many likes

272
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,740
you two are a shippable couple

273
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,080
I can take a photo of you two.

274
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,660
Over 10,000 likes are guaranteed.

275
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,300
Getting likes? So what?

276
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,800
What are you talking about? You’re so outdated.

277
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,320
These days getting many likes will get you somewhere.

278
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,640
How does that work?

279
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Confused?

280
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,300
Let me explain it.

281
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,460
When you get many likes, you’ll become a net idol

282
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,540
You’ll get work like reviewing stuff, attending events, doing series

283
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,020
These days people’s lives are changed because of the likes

284
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,140
You get likes and you get all that?

285
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,700
Not convinced? Take a look.

286
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,440
This is my friend.

287
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,740
Hey, I’m going to bed.

288
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,720
What?

289
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,440
You’re not going to eat?

290
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,720
You can’t wait to go inside, can you?

291
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
Here, see?

292
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,100
Is this how a lotto winner sits?

293
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,780
I didn’t win.

294
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,980
Auntie Muay got it wrong

295
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,180
I was shocked.

296
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,460
What happened to that handsome boy?

297
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,720
Sawasdee, Muad Moo.

298
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,920
What’s this?

299
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,260
What?

300
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,180
This.

301
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,680
How did that get here?

302
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,160
Whose is this?

303
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,560
Tee’s.

304
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,080
Hey, take a photo for my IG.

305
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
Fine.

306
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,400
1 2.

307
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,700
What are you doing?

308
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,520
I opened an IG account for our shop

309
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,580
We’ll gain a lot of followers

310
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,040
Let me see

311
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,280
followers. Yeah, this is great

312
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,380
I don’t know how to increase the followers.

313
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,240
What about a funny clip?

314
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,140
Record this.

315
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,240
Okay.

316
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,220
Mork, you’re overreacting.

317
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,440
How’s the baton?

318
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,980
It’s good

319
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,840
You give it back to the owner tomorrow

320
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,780
Leave it here and Morn will ruin it.

321
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,420
Don’t forget to apologize to Tee for me

322
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,440
He is probably mad at me.

323
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,300
Kiatkamol Witthaya School

324
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,400
Mork, you’re early today.

325
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,640
Sure thing.

326
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,180
What’s this? Whose stick is it?

327
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,740
Shit, it looks cool.

328
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,820
Let me hold it.

329
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,280
This is mine. Leave it alone.

330
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Yours?

331
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,780
Yours? I’ll be damned if I believe that

332
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,400
Whose is it? Tell us.

333
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,360
Au, our school has only one drum major

334
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,440
Who?

335
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,760
There he is.

336
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,160
The one who got hit by a ball.

337
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,220
Honestly, he rubs me the wrong way

338
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,120
Watch.

339
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,160
He’ll take off his hat and show his perfect haircut

340
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,320
And the teacher is going to praise him like he’s won a Nobel prize

341
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,700
You always get it right. You can go ahead

342
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,900
See? That doesn’t surprise me at all.

343
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,580
I’ll be back.

344
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,460
Hey, you!

345
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,740
My friend called. You didn’t hear?

346
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,400
That way, please

347
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,820
Buddy, where did you get this haircut?

348
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,940
I want the exact same screwed up haircut you have.

349
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,340
Mork, he didn’t go to your dad’s, did he?

350
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,240
You left it. Here you go.

351
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,780
You’re asking for it, aren’t you?

352
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,380
Hey, Au

353
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,680
His hair is so screwed up

354
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,300
Mork, you need to see this.

355
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,680
It’s so ugly.

356
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,160
Don’t ever let this happen at your shop

357
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,080
Don’t be mad.

358
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,560
Shit!

359
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,820
Stop it!

360
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,120
Why did you beat him up?

361
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,540
He kicked me first.

362
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,380
Mungkorn kicked you first?

363
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,360
My dear, tell me what happened?

364
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,520
He punched me first.

365
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,440
What did you say?

366
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,650
Quiet and back off.

367
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,290
I’m sitting right here.

368
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,620
Please continue

369
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,560
Those two were not relevant

370
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:46,680
Let them go. This is between me and him.

371
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,520
That’s not true. I punched him

372
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,460
Mork didn’t do anything.

373
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,680
Don’t worry.

374
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,220
If you want suspension, you’ll get it

375
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,760
Now, it’s time to confess.

376
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,640
Who did what?

377
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,340
That will lessen the punishment.

378
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,100
friends were not involved.

379
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,100
What did you say?

380
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,880
My two friends were not involved

381
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,060
Only me.

382
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,080
Good. You two are dismissed

383
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,060
But Miss…

384
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,060
I said leave

385
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,280
Go!

386
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,960
So, Nueamork, why did you beat him up?

387
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,520
What happened?

388
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,440
Quiet? Good.

389
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,460
Clean the toilet for 3 weeks

390
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,680
That may give you time to reflect on what you’ve done

391
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,060
Write a report on your reflection and submit to me

392
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Thank you.

393
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,260
Seriously, I’ve asked your dad to come and meet many times.

394
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,420
He never showed up and your house is just around the corner

395
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,840
If something like this happens again, I won’t save you

396
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,240
Didn’t you hear me? I told you to wash your friend’s hair.

397
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,820
Trust me.

398
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,700
Washing can’t screw up my hair, right?

399
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,100
Want a piece?

400
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,700
Tee,

401
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,520
I don’t get this part.

402
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,640
How do we solve this equation?

403
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,000
This adds to this, then minus this.

404
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,580
Get it?

405
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,280
Tony, I’m here.

406
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,200
Do you have my order?

407
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,020
10 gay porn movies plus one free DVD.

408
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,800
Kisses.

409
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,020
His girlfriend?

410
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,960
Ahem,

411
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,720
hello.

412
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,860
Your order has arrived.

413
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,540
What order?

414
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,180
Your order

415
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,200
10 gay porn films.

416
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,340
Very hardcore, just the way you like it.

417
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,700
I give you one free one

418
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,000
Bambie!

419
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,460
I’m rooting for you. Bye!

420
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,800
Mork!

421
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,220
You get startled easily

422
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,360
Give me the remote.

423
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,260
Hey, what brings you here?

424
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,360
I just want to check up on you

425
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,420
How are you?

426
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,100
I’m well.

427
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,000
Is that Mork? You’ve grown up so quickly

428
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,320
Sawasdee krap.

429
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,740
How are you? What grade are you in?

430
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,200
Grade 11.

431
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,100
You’ll have to take an entrance exam soon

432
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,540
What do you want to study?

433
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,220
My son just got into a medical school last year

434
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,920
He says he wants to go to a medical school

435
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,760
But I don’t think he’ll ever become a doctor.

436
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,400
Bro, hot water burns my hand.

437
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,440
Get some toothpaste to put it on the scald.

438
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,600
Who taught you?

439
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,820
If you put it on, you’ll get infection.

440
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,200
If it swells or burns, go see the doctor.

441
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,200
I said I’d make you the tea. You didn’t listen

442
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,460
Stubborn.

443
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,860
Let me see.

444
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,440
This is nothing

445
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,520
Don’t touch it.

446
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,940
I think your son has the potential to become a real doctor.

447
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,620
Morn, if you still have your hands and legs

448
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,760
ride your bike to buy some flowers for your mom.

449
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,420
Excuse me, our shop is closed

450
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,660
Hey, handsome. You’re all wet. Have a seat.

451
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,040
Hello.

452
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,060
I’m so sorry for yesterday. I thought I won the lotto

453
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,480
I left everything behind.

454
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,380
Did a dog gnaw on your hair?

455
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,380
That’s fine. I’ll fix that.

456
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,780
Mork, get some clothes for your friend to change

457
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,960
What, Muad?

458
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,120
I said bring the clothes

459
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,440
Fine.

460
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,140
You’ll catch a cold

461
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,140
How did you get here like this? You’ll catch a cold

462
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,320
Here

463
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,900
Change your clothes here. I’ll fix your hair after

464
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,860
Come out after you’re done.

465
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,840
Whoa!

466
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,700
Mork, why didn’t you bring clean pants for your friend?

467
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,400
You brought a pair smeared with your jizz instead

468
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,000
Don’t say that. I’m embarrassed.

469
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,520
You weren’t embarrassed when you ejaculated.

470
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,320
What’s jizz?

471
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,880
Go back to your room.

472
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,120
Bring a new pair.

473
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,340
I’ll get it.

474
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,960
Here, this one should be clean.

475
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,340
Come here. I’ll fix your hair.

476
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,700
Bro, so what’s jizz?

477
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,500
It’s an adult thing.

478
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,820
Can I borrow your phone?

479
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,300
Here.

480
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,000
My tummy hurts.

481
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,800
Mork, bring a dry cloth and dry your friend’s hair

482
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
What, Muad?

483
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,640
I have to go to the bathroom.

484
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,040
Muad! Muad!

485
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,760
Will this haircut be done?

486
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,580
Feeling shy?

487
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,220
What?

488
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,320
You’re blushing.

489
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,440
Shy, my ass. I’ve just never done it before.

490
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,980
Then, it’s cool.

491
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
What?

492
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,800
Someone has just answered.

493
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,620
What did they say? Is it about the jizz?

494
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,440
Whose profile did you use to ask that question?

495
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Yours. It’s your phone.

496
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,520
Shit! Give it back. Delete that now.

497
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,080
Why would I? Someone else has answered.

498
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,280
What did they say?

499
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,900
She said, ‘thank you for showing your true colors.’

500
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,160
My son is popular.

501
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,440
What’s her name?

502
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,320
B-A-M-B-I

503
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,700
How do you pronounce that?

504
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,960
Bambai? Bambie?

505
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,680
Give it back!

506
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,360
Cut it short.

507
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,660
All done.

508
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,960
Final check. Do you like it?

509
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,800
Yes.

510
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,000
The back looks really good.

511
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,300
You like it?

512
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,100
Yes.

513
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,820
Mork, you’re next.

514
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,540
Me?

515
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,240
Yes, you

516
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,140
I don’t have any hair.

517
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,300
What else can you cut? My neck?

518
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,420
Just say no then. You had to be snarky, huh?

519
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,380
If you’re not going to get a haircut, wash your friend’s hair.

520
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,360
Huh?

521
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,920
Didn’t you hear me? I told you to wash your friend’s hair.

522
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,220
It’s fine.

523
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,620
See? He doesn’t want it.

524
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,080
And I’ve never washed hair before.

525
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,180
It’s our protocol. Cut and then wash.

526
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,340
This is according to ISO 6969.

527
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,360
Go and practice so you can actually do something

528
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,220
You can’t be the son of a barber but don’t know how to do barber stuff

529
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,180
Go to the shampoo bed. Mork will follow you in a minute

530
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,700
Okay.

531
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,240
Please.

532
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,660
Come on, why is it taking you so long?

533
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,860
Next time, try to say no, okay?

534
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,500
Trust me.

535
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,440
Washing can’t screw up my hair, right?

536
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,120
Are you messing with me?

537
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,100
This hairstyle really suits you, I’m telling you

538
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,340
It’s a mohawk.

539
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Fine, I’ll take it down.

540
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,400
Look at my hair. You have some, I don’t.

541
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,240
Here, get some.

542
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,660
Why did you act like we didn’t know each other?

543
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,360
It’s better this way.

544
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,480
It’s been three years. How have you been?

545
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,200
Shut up

546
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,700
Are you or aren’t you?

547
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,000
You don’t like guys?

548
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,660
That can change

549
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,680
You just need a motivation

550
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,900
Be my boyfriend.

551
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,440
What the hell?

552
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,940
I’m a dude.
