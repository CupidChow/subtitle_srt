1
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,600
You still have it.

2
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,500
Your grandma is still beautiful.

3
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,640
She loves to eat chestnuts, doesn’t she?

4
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,220
Her favorite food is chestnuts

5
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,500
Yours are noodles and porridge.

6
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,740
There’s one more.

7
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,480
What?

8
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,400
You.

9
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,320
What’s wrong?

10
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,700
While you wait,

11
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,380
find something to read.

12
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,200
What subject do you like?

13
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,340
You’d want to know, wouldn’t you?

14
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,620
None.

15
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,320
Except one.

16
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,140
Hmm?

17
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,540
You.

18
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,580
I forgot. You’re not a subject. Sorry

19
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,560
Seriously,

20
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,840
I do like biology and English

21
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,600
You can go to a medical school.

22
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,560
Do you still want to?

23
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,340
Me?

24
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,080
Do you think I can do it?

25
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,340
Be confident

26
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,280
Let’s tutor bio first.

27
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,700
We can do English tomorrow.

28
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,180
No!

29
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,360
Homework makes me tired already

30
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,880
Just a little bit of tutoring is enough.

31
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,280
What school do you want to go to study?

32
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,980
In Samyan area.

33
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,400
The scores they accept is very high.

34
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,940
We will not go to the same school.

35
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,640
That’s sad.

36
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,620
If you are motivated, everything is possible

37
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,320
I’ll finish my homework.

38
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,620
Read this

39
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,040
while I do my homework.

40
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,400
Wake up.

41
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,520
Let me sleep.

42
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,260
Come on.

43
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,760
Otherwise I’ll go.

44
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,220
No!

45
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,440
Get up then.

46
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,100
Come on!

47
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,620
Get up.

48
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,000
Sit here.

49
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,580
Come on.

50
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,440
What subject is your homework?

51
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
It’s done!

52
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,460
I’m not drunk tonight.

53
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,880
My dad will hear.

54
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,620
I’m jealous of him being in a relationship

55
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,180
Don’t make it complicated.

56
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,020
Look for something simple near you

57
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,980
The monks are coming. We can offer them food.

58
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,500
You never do what I ask.

59
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,620
I had to ask your friend to buy stuff.

60
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
Let’s go to the canteen.

61
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,980
There are not a lot of people this early.

62
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,880
With few people there, they cook better food

63
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,400
Don’t sulk.

64
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,080
You know I really don’t care what other people think

65
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,800
Sawasdee krap.

66
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,780
Are you here to help?

67
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,400
I’m here to help

68
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,620
check if it’s clean.

69
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,380
Why don’t we compete who’ll finish first?

70
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,460
I’ll finish before you anyway.

71
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,420
Oh, you always finish early.

72
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,340
Mork, let me ask you something

73
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,280
Do you think sex is necessary for people to be in love?

74
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,740
What do you think?

75
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,040
Don’t ask if sex is necessary

76
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,340
Ask...

77
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,320
if love is there

78
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,100
Are you still considering being a star/ net idol?

79
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
I am…

80
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,780
considering that it’s not going to work

81
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,000
It’s not my path.

82
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,860
What New and Ryu said was right.

83
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,220
I should stop trying to be a wannabe

84
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,840
People who are born with a silver spoon

85
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,700
will get good things

86
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,020
Their life will be comfortable

87
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,320
People like me will never get anything like that

88
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,700
That’s not true, Morn.

89
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,040
People can’t choose how they are born.

90
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,780
But they can choose how they live.

91
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,600
Don’t ever doubt yourself.

92
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,160
If you put your mind to it, you can do anything.

93
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,180
But I never do anything right.

94
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,700
I always mess things up.

95
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,440
You can mess things up a million times if you have me

96
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,560
I will never leave you.

97
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,920
Sawasdee krap.

98
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,640
How are you going home today?

99
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,560
We’re taking the bus.

100
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,300
Interesting

101
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,460
Let us come with you.

102
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,700
Why are you hesitating? I’m your brother

103
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,040
Fine, come with us.

104
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,360
Hey,

105
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,480
Gord has a question for you.

106
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,080
I was just kidding

107
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,660
He wanted to know if you’ve … yet?

108
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,860
What…?

109
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,420
No, I was kidding. I didn’t say that.

110
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,700
Like this.

111
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,040
You want to know, don’t you?

112
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,820
I do

113
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,420
How about this?

114
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,560
Don’t hurt your brother

115
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,820
How did you push him to end up like that?

116
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,060
How would I know?

117
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,440
Don’t take too long or you’ll miss the last bus

118
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,640
Take the money.

119
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,540
It’s fine.

120
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,080
Take it. You paid for my brother.

121
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,740
I told you it’s fine

122
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,240
If you want to give me something, give me your hand.

123
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,940
What?

124
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,980
Come on.

125
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Come on.

126
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,940
I won’t try to test what you are.

127
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,120
I won’t let you go no matter what

128
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,860
Smart. I’ll reward you.

129
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Here, open your mouth

130
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,940
Open your mouth.

131
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,720
Come on.

132
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,060
Bro, can I have your phone?

133
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,500
Aren’t you going to share?

134
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,500
Get one for me as well.

135
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,300
Here.

136
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,480
I’m jealous of him being in a relationship

137
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,080
You’ll have one.

138
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,220
You make it sound so easy

139
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,300
Don’t make it complicated.

140
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,320
Look for something simple near you.

141
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,440
You’re taking the bus home today.

142
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,120
I’m right here. Can you see me?

143
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Let’s log into Muadmoo’s IG account.

144
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,400
Try posting a photo now.

145
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,740
They say this is the peak time to get most likes.

146
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,320
Are you sure?

147
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
Yeah.

148
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,180
If it doesn’t turn out like what you said, I’ll kick your butt

149
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,060
Sure, let’s try. Let’s take a picture.

150
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,400
Posting it now.

151
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,940
We shall see

152
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,120
Hey, people are liking this photo.

153
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,440
You’re cute, Morn. That’s why people like your photo

154
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,380
What are you looking at? Look the other way.

155
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,420
Keep it like this. It’s cute.

156
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,000
I’m embarrassed.

157
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,180
Did you see the UFO?

158
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,900
Where?

159
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,640
Hey, slow down or you’ll crash into something.

160
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,440
What kind of silly joke is this?

161
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,660
Just let it go.

162
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,640
Look, they’re moving in together.

163
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,960
We should copy them.

164
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,800
Just let it go.

165
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,040
Why are there so many books?

166
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,380
Let me help you.

167
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,900
These are for you to read.

168
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,220
I’ve read them all many times already.

169
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,300
Really?

170
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,380
Do I have to read them?

171
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Morn,

172
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,460
do you have any homework?

173
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,400
Take a shower and finish your homework.

174
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,640
Why do I have to do it now? It’s due on Monday

175
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,340
And Thursday and Friday are holidays.

176
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
We don’t get days off.

177
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,040
We have the marching band practice.

178
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
P’ Tee, you have to go to school on Saturday, right?

179
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,280
Since we have days off tomorrow and the day after, shall we go somewhere?

180
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,880
You have to practice the parade on Saturday.

181
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,740
Tomorrow we have the military training but let’s play hooky

182
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,340
Don’t.

183
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,880
Fine.

184
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,460
Enjoy the feast!

185
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,100
Cheers!

186
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,080
You guys are back.

187
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,400
Come. We have a party tonight

188
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,000
What party?

189
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,060
Muad won the lotto today.

190
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,180
You won! How much?

191
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,560
3,000 baht.

192
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,120
You’d spend it all tonight.

193
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,860
I thought you’d won 30 million

194
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,100
Come on. It’s not like he wins every day, right?

195
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,860
Yes.

196
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,800
Fine.

197
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,400
Money is not an issue, but food surely is.

198
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,780
Eat till you drop

199
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,700
Handsome, take the mic.

200
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,440
Sing this song for me

201
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,880
Me, too?

202
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,440
Sing it well for me

203
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,480
The first time I met you that day

204
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,700
You’re the dream I’d been chasing

205
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,860
When my eyes meet yours

206
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,140
When I see your smile, when we are close

207
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,540
When your hand is next to my heart

208
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,560
You make me feel like when I was 14

209
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,880
When I had my first love

210
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,140
I feel butterflies in my stomach

211
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:59,000
I feel like I’m 14 again

212
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,380
Enough, I’m fed up with love.

213
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,700
Give it to me.

214
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,680
How does it work?

215
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,160
Tell me what song you want to sing.

216
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,360
Let me put it on for you.

217
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,140
4723

218
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,200
Why don’t you sing it?

219
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,180
You sing

220
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,460
Sing it well.

221
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
“Best friend”

222
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,320
Here it comes. Cheers. Prepare for a good song

223
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:49,980
A friend is in love with you secretly

224
00:24:51,580 --> 00:25:01,720
Never told you cuz I’m afraid I’d get hurt and lose you

225
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,740
The closer we are, the more I’m drawn to you

226
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,120
Why are you smiling?

227
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,160
P’ Ching, no need to record a video.

228
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:21,220
When you look at me, I can’t bear to look at you

229
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:27,800
So close yet so far

230
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,500
You’re my best friend. I can’ tell you

231
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,460
Cheers!

232
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,900
Hello, what are you doing?

233
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,880
Watching porn.

234
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,220
Stop it.

235
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,260
Shall we go somewhere tomorrow?

236
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,700
I’ll have you all to myself.

237
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,640
Is that right?

238
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,900
Holding a pillow doesn’t keep you warm

239
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,080
How can you go to sleep?

240
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,040
Silver-tongued, huh?

241
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,120
You’re not able to talk like this when we’re together

242
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,440
Sweet dreams.

243
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,340
Sweet dreams, Mork

244
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,400
An asshole is calling. Don’t answer.

245
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,440
Hello, are you asleep?

246
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,820
I’m still wide awake.

247
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,800
Come on down.

248
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
What?

249
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
Come down.

250
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,980
Tee, can I stay over tonight?

251
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,180
I brought my own blanket

252
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,600
No.

253
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,180
Tee, can I stay over tonight?

254
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,660
I already brought my own blanket.

255
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,420
Well, I happened to deliver porn to you,

256
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,900
no, someone in the neighborhood.

257
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,960
I need to take a dump. I’ve got to go now.

258
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,440
Tee, I’m begging you I have to take a dump now

259
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,180
Let me use your bathroom

260
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:25,920
I’m so tired when I get out because it’s a big dump.

261
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,660
So, I fall asleep right away

262
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,200
Mork, you’re so smart.

263
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,680
Let’s go with this one.

264
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,120
Hey, Mork.

265
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,780
Why did you bring the blanket?

266
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,460
The blanket in my room should be big enough.

267
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,960
Stick with the plan.

268
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,160
Who says I’ll stay here tonight?

269
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,840
I’m out for a walk

270
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,180
and it’s getting cold so I have the blanket with me.

271
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,800
Shit, why did you say that?

272
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,600
What about…that?

273
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,640
Oh, right.

274
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,540
I’ve come here to deliver porn to a client in this building

275
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,220
I’ll have to go up.

276
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,780
Which apartment?

277
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,740
I can drop it off for you.

278
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,440
No, I have to deliver it by hand.

279
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,660
I’ll go up there myself.

280
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,480
It’s already 2 AM.

281
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
If you knock on his door,

282
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,420
you may get dragged inside the room

283
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,420
Give it to me.

284
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,980
Damn

285
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,320
Since you’re not going to stay over,

286
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,140
let’s go out for a walk then

287
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,540
Good.

288
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,120
I’ll keep him company during the walk

289
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,140
Then, I’ll sneak up to his room,

290
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,140
no, ask him to go to his room

291
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,200
Then, I’ll go to sleep.

292
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,120
That’s right. This is a good plan.

293
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,320
You’re awesome, Mork.

294
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,880
Who are you talking to?

295
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,200
I’m talking to mosquitoes.

296
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,240
You bit me. Where are you going?

297
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,000
If I ever see you again…

298
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,220
You’re so tough with mosquitoes.

299
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,760
Hold onto this for me.

300
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,420
Bring it up to your room.

301
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Hold onto to it for now. I’ll get it back when I leave

302
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,820
I’ll bring it up later.

303
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
It is cold

304
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,260
Keep it like this. It’s cute.

305
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,580
I’m embarrassed

306
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,820
Don’t be. You’re cute.

307
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,740
Smile. Come on.

308
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,020
Smile.

309
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Smile.

310
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,760
Smile. Bigger.

311
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,860
So cute

312
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,000
Let’s go

313
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Shit!

314
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,900
Even though the world is small, can you stay in it and keep me company?

315
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,420
You took a peek. Checking out the size?

316
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,740
You asked me a question the other day

317
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,080
about how big my world is.

318
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,120
I think ...

319
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,460
my world is so small.

320
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,520
Because there’s only you in it.

321
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,920
But, seriously, my world is small.

322
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,420
Small and walled up.

323
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,680
No freedom.

324
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,760
Each day for me is home, school and drop off my brother.

325
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,480
Just taking care of the people I love

326
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,240
even though I know they will leave

327
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,260
not knowing how difficult it is for the people they leave behind.

328
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,280
Sometimes I feel like the world is so small

329
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,060
that there’s not enough room for everyone,

330
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,440
especially me.

331
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,080
Even though the world is small, can you stay in it and keep me company?

332
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,480
Someday

333
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,460
we can get out of this world together.

334
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,060
Out of this world?

335
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:50,260
I feel like I’m an alien sometimes.

336
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,920
Just because I’m different,

337
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,040
do they need to change me to be like others?

338
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,120
Will they change you?

339
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,580
I’m not an alien.

340
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,980
I’m just a human

341
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,380
Don’t change.

342
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,200
I think you’re special.

343
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,080
Did you see the UFO? Over there!

344
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,180
Where?

345
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,820
Again?

346
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,100
You fall for my tricks so easily

347
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,660
Come here.

348
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,760
Stay still.

349
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,940
You look like an alien now.

350
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,360
Stay still.

351
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,680
If you wanted to kiss me on the cheek, you could just say so

352
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,860
So, did you see the UFO?

353
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,440
Are you scared?

354
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Me? Scared?

355
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,160
Why would I?

356
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,180
You’re silly

357
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,580
If you’re not, then kiss me.

358
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Mork,

359
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,360
what you said about the world is so small

360
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,760
there’s not enough room for everyone,

361
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,200
the world may not want you to be alone

362
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,140
How?

363
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,860
The world may want us to be together.

364
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,720
Earlier,

365
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,360
I asked you to be my fake boyfriend.

366
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,560
Today, can you be my real boyfriend?

367
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,940
I have to go

368
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,420
Where are you going?

369
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,800
Do you like where we are?

370
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,300
If you don’t, get out

371
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,280
If you do,

372
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,920
let’s get together and be a couple.

373
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,860
Seriously?

374
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,120
I never joke

375
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,860
Fine, let’s do it.

376
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,820
Really?

377
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,140
Yeah.

378
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,920
So, it means you like me as well.

379
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,620
Yeah.

380
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,100
I like you.

381
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,960
That’s why I said yes to being your boyfriend.

382
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,920
Why do you need me to spell it out?

383
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,640
We are a couple

384
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,200
No breakup.

385
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,120
Want to be my boyfriend? You’d better catch me

386
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,080
Sure

387
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,160
Mork, sit down

388
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,420
Sit!

389
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,200
What do you do each day?

390
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,700
Your room is so tidy.

391
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,740
Even the bed sheet is crisp.

392
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,140
I haven’t slept on it. I was reading a book

393
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,880
But if I do something else,

394
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,160
there will be wrinkles for sure.

395
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,900
Stop it.

396
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,100
Why are there no books on your shelf?

397
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,560
Did you give all of your books to me?

398
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,340
I brought all my books to your house

399
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,680
I read them all.

400
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,900
Where should I sleep?

401
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,240
I want to go to bed.

402
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,300
No way.

403
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,360
You have to take a shower first

404
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You ran this evening and you haven’t taken a shower

405
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,060
Come on, get up!

406
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,420
Can I skip the shower?

407
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,080
Morning is coming up soon

408
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,640
The towel is in the bathroom

409
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,940
Don’t take a peek

410
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,920
What are you doing here?

411
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,040
I forgot to tell you how to use the shower head.

412
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,600
Shit, get out. I’m taking a shower.

413
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,060
Come here.

414
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,720
Don’t chase me away

415
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,580
I want to watch my boyfriend take a shower

416
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,460
Psycho.

417
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,970
Feeling good?

418
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:55,140
Do you remember when you washed my hair?

419
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,780
You were gentle.

420
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:03,040
Gentle? I screwed up your haircut

421
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,200
You were so pissed at me.

422
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,200
Why?

423
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,560
I only have three things I’m proud of.

424
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,580
Is this the right way to massage?

425
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,520
Yes.

426
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,520
What are the things you’re proud of?

427
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,440
I’m proud that I’m handsome.

428
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,300
Ugh!

429
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,580
It’s not easy to be this handsome.

430
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,860
How could you screw up my hair like that?

431
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,700
I couldn’t stand you.

432
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,080
You’re handsome. Why do you care?

433
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,920
What about the other two?

434
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,780
One is about school.

435
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,700
I’m not a talented student but I’m studious

436
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,100
I’ve read all the textbooks for the high-school level

437
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,960
I’m so damn proud.

438
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,600
You pick weird things to be proud of.

439
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,860
If it were me,

440
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,800
I’d be proud of ..

441
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,240
being rich or having a big stick.

442
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,980
You took a peek. Checking out the size?

443
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,740
Other stuff I have is not really mine.

444
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,580
But I’ve put the effort and attention to this thing.

445
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,620
What about the other one?

446
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,320
Being your boyfriend.

447
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,180
Sorry!

448
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,260
Are your eyes okay now?

449
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
I’m fine.

450
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,680
Sorry.

451
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,580
I’m fine now.

452
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,500
Get out already. I’m going to take a shower.

453
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,220
Whose boyfriend is this? So cute.

454
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,140
Are you sure it’s yours?

455
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,440
Stop saying I’m cute and get out.

456
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,900
I have to take a shower.

457
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,900
What should we do?

458
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,360
Can I see you after class?

459
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,480
I have to go. See you tonight

460
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,800
Wait, Mork.

461
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,400
Don’t leave yet.

462
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,160
Who were you talking to?

463
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,400
I have the military training in the afternoon

464
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,200
Are you free tomorrow?

465
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,100
Aren’t you hanging out with me today?

466
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,800
Well…

467
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,200
I have to see Bam today.

468
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,860
I have to go.

469
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,720
Are you okay?

470
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,220
Mork, wait for me.

471
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,500
Leave me alone.

472
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,060
It’s not too late

473
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,300
to go back to her.

474
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,880
You and I haven’t been intimate.

475
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,100
When we walk upstairs, you raise my hand.

476
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,780
When we stop, you kiss me.

477
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,800
Why aren’t you smiling today?

478
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,580
I don’t like Daddy. He spoils only Morn

479
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,960
Where are you going? Where are you staying?

480
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,960
Will one thing lead to another?

481
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,120
I like it too

482
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,920
What did you do with him there?

483
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,940
What about Tee?Everybody knows about it, so does the school

484
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,280
What about Tee?

485
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,040
Don’t worry about other people!
