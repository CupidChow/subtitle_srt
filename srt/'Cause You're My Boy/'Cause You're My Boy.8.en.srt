1
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,480
Is this the building, Morn?

2
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,640
Yes, Mama.

3
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,860
I’m going to class now.

4
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,160
Sawasdee krap

5
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
See you, Bro.

6
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,140
See you.

7
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,520
I used to drive Tee to school.

8
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,860
But he said he was embarrassed

9
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,400
and told me to drop him off here

10
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,520
I went to pick him up but couldn’t find him.

11
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,560
So, I went into the school.

12
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,380
I looked for him everywhere until I met his teacher.

13
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,580
His teacher said

14
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,660
he didn’t want anything to do with Tee.

15
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,720
Tee refused to answer his questions or follow any instructions

16
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,260
Then, I finally found out that Tee hadn’t been in class for a while

17
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,660
After I dropped him off, he wouldn’t go to school

18
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,100
but to a game shop instead

19
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,420
I looked everywhere for him

20
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,440
until I found him

21
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,480
looking all messy and dirty by the side of the road

22
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,320
I felt like

23
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,780
such a bad mom, seeing him on the street

24
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,540
From a lazy, quiet yet stubborn kid in secondary school,

25
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,060
he became a studious student in high school

26
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,880
So, any mistakes made shouldn’t be repeated.

27
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
If it looks like it may happen again,

28
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,400
we should nip it in the bud

29
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,080
at least for now.

30
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,080
Please try to forget about Tee

31
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,860
and stay away from him for a while

32
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,540
If you still love him, you can talk to me then.

33
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,780
It will prove

34
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,740
how true is your love for him.

35
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,980
Morn logged into his Line account but didn’t log out.

36
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,360
Dear Muadmoobarber, as you purchased a promotion package

39
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Shit, Morn.

40
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Hey, Bro.

41
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,580
Finished class?

42
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,660
Where’s your bike?

43
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,380
I didn’t bring it

44
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,920
After the stadium, I came here right away.

45
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,220
I didn’t go home first like a certain someone.

46
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,340
Where is Morn?

47
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,260
Are you confused with the date?

48
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,540
Morn doesn’t have class today

49
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,420
How can that be? I gave him the money for tutoring class.

50
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,820
I’m telling you Morn doesn’t have class today.

51
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,480
Where have you been? I’m so hungry.

52
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
If it weren’t for this, I’d be starving.

53
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,600
What kind of food do we have at home?

54
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,020
You’re so smart. Figure it out yourself.

55
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,760
What’s wrong with him?

56
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,600
How can I get home? I have only 5 baht.

57
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,680
I can get you a taxi.

58
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,740
No, I don’t want to bother you.

59
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
No problem. I can take care of it.

60
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,280
No, I got it. See you.

61
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,440
Wait! I’ll walk with you.

62
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,020
I know I can’t stop him,

63
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,720
but can I stop you?

64
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,440
A jerk is calling. Don’t pick up

65
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,760
Hello, Mork.

66
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,980
I’m okay.

67
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,420
I’m out of the hospital now.

68
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,600
I miss you.

69
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,480
Are you still mad at me?

70
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,020
Where are you? Tell me now or I’ll hang up.

71
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,540
Do you want me to pick you up?

72
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,280
If not, don’t bother to come here.

73
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,580
I’m glad we are able to have a nice conversation.

74
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,280
Don’t come.

75
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,720
I have no idea where I’m walking now.

76
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,580
Why are you walking? Don’t you have any money?

77
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,480
It’s so quiet.

78
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,720
I’m scared.

79
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,580
Don’t be. I’m right here beside you.

80
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,740
Look around and see what’s there.

81
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,360
It’s creepily quiet. I’m scared.

82
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,520
Come quickly.

83
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,540
Hi, Bam.

84
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,340
I have something important to ask you.

85
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,620
Can you please find out where Tee is now?

86
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,900
Au said your phone can track his location.

87
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,500
Don’t be mad at him

88
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,380
I don’t know how to use it.

89
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,380
Hold on, let me ask P’ Au.

90
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,360
Bam, finish your homework and go to bed.

91
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,740
Don’t wait for Dad.

92
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,960
Someone’s on the phone.

93
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,220
Hello.

94
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,980
Au?

95
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Tee.

96
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,480
Let’s go home.

97
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,560
You’re freaking heavy.

98
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,620
I don’t want to go home.

99
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,540
Get on the bike.

100
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Smile for me

101
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,680
Now, I’m feeling better.

102
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,900
Don’t ever do this again.

103
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,480
Worried about me?

104
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,980
Don’t be mad at me.

105
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,580
I’ve got a lot of things on my mind

106
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,540
What are they? You can rant with me.

107
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,620
You may feel better.

108
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,700
Morn spent his tuition fee on…

109
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,780
On what?

110
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,540
Nothing. I can talk to him later.

111
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,840
This reminds me of the first day I met you

112
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,140
On the first day of the seventh grade,

113
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,500
I came to school late.

114
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,760
I didn’t know where my classroom is.

115
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,040
I saw you carry a science box, looking dapper

116
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,720
but you forgot to zip your pants.

117
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,200
Such a big twist.

118
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
You remember that?

119
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,920
Of course.

120
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,840
Really?

121
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,740
You didn’t zip up your fly

122
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,900
I don’t know why but I decided to zip it for you

123
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,360
I thought you’re an easy target for my pranks.

124
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,580
You followed us and got into trouble.

125
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,940
You followed Ton and me to a game shop.

126
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,960
You wouldn’t eat or go home, and you got sick.

127
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,340
I had to take you home that day.

128
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,720
We’ve known each other for a long time.

129
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,220
I stayed over at your place for the first time and the last

130
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,840
Muad Moo and Morn were out of town that day

131
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,400
And you disappeared from my life

132
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,780
Was it because of me?

133
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,340
No, it’s not.

134
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,720
I was just startled.

135
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,200
You ignored me after that.

136
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,340
You ignored me first.

137
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,060
I saw you get out of your car in front of the school

138
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,780
and looked right through me.

139
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,360
So, I thought you’re mad at me

140
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,740
and you disappeared for a year

141
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,180
until we became strangers.

142
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,420
That’s not it at all.

143
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,540
I got into a fight with my mom in the car.

144
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,940
I forgot my glasses at your place.

145
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,900
That’s why I didn’t see you.

146
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,680
I now understand why you’re not talking to me.

147
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,600
You thought I ignored you, so you ignored me.

148
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,500
Well, I guess that’s how it went.

149
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,420
So, we are good?

150
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,680
But I didn’t understand one thing

151
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,380
When we went to the beach and you saw the condoms

152
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,000
why were you so mad?

153
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,500
You looked so at ease with this kind of thing.

154
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,280
I thought if you and I got together, you’d leave me.

155
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,000
But if not, then we’re still together.

156
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,260
I wanted you to wait for it until I say so.

157
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,240
Come on, let’s go home.

158
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,260
Why are you bleeding?

159
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,100
Why aren’t you taking care of yourself?

160
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,220
Mork, why did you leave your brother at the tutoring school?

161
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,040
You know he has only 5 baht, so he had to walk home

162
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,460
Did you know that he…?

163
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,720
He what?

164
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,900
Never mind.

165
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,940
I’m going upstairs. It’s hot.

166
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,240
Who’s there?

167
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,920
It’s me.

168
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,080
Are you taking a shower?

169
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,720
Hold on,

170
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,780
I’m doing laundry.

171
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,060
Are you washing my socks?

172
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,620
Yeah, I want to do something for you.

173
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,520
Sorry for my post that made you end up on the news.

174
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,940
You can go first.

175
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,960
Again?

176
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,800
What’s wrong?

177
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,980
Don’t come near me. My nose is bleeding.

178
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,130
Sit down.

179
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,230
Are you all right?

180
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,020
Why are you bleeding?

181
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,200
Morn, get some ice.

182
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,560
Why aren’t you taking care of yourself?

183
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,780
Are you two…?

184
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,020
Yes.

185
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,020
What are you going to do next?

186
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,360
Now I have Mork. That’s all I need.

187
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,160
What if you don’t?

188
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,540
I won’t let that happen.

189
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,720
What if I ask you?

190
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,020
You wouldn’t do that. I can tell.

191
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,760
You love Mork.

192
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,260
You want him to be happy and I’m making him happy

193
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,060
I’d do anything for him. He’s very special to me

194
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,260
Can I not go? I lost the book yesterday

195
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,120
I got a new one for you.

196
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,020
Thank you, Daddy.

197
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,560
I’ll be a good boy.

198
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,960
Let’s go to class.

199
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,540
Hey, you’re awake.

200
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,080
Why are you here?

201
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,900
Muad, where’s Tee?

202
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,140
He must have gone home.

203
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,100
You woke up late, didn’t even drop off your brother.

204
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,900
Your friend’s come to see you. Be nice to him.

205
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,820
Such a rude question that you asked.

206
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,660
Don’t mind him. That’s how he is.

207
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,860
That’s fine. I’m used to it.

208
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,040
From your client.

209
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,160
So, why are you here so early?

210
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,760
Are you not well?

211
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,900
You’re leaving?

212
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,620
I think I…

213
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,560
Sit down.

214
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,500
Are you in a hurry?

215
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,680
Can you wait for…like… 20 minutes?

216
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,220
You always keep me waiting.

217
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,520
After I wait, will you go with me?

218
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,920
If you go, I can wait.

219
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,280
I want to get some work out of the way.

220
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,380
This is about your problem with the police.

221
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,700
In that case, are you free?

222
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
Can you help me find some gay porn?

223
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,800
Just keep looking at the screenshots

224
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,580
They won’t be that different from straight porn

225
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
but...

226
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,420
I don’t know where to look from, though.

227
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,960
I don’t have a regular website.

228
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,820
Start from Google.

229
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,600
No problem if you can’t find it but have a look first.

230
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,020
I’ll take a shower.

231
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,040
Fine.

232
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,500
How’s it going?

233
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,240
All done.

234
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,480
You’ve found them all?

235
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,280
And I printed the cover, too.

236
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,680
Shit, are you…?

237
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,720
Oh, you know the websites and all.

238
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,880
You’re a rookie.

239
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,180
Let’s go. We have to post these.

240
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,740
Let’s go to the post office.

241
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,480
Come on.

242
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,380
Sawasdee Muad.

243
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,740
Why did you do all that?

244
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,380
I don’t know

245
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,380
It’s just paying a fine for parking

246
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,200
I’ll pay you back.

247
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,940
No need. Don’t pay me back.

248
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,480
Are you hungry? Let’s find something to eat.

249
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,420
Don’t think too much.

250
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,580
Let’s stop by the post office.

251
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,160
We’re going to the mall anyway.

252
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,140
Why don’t we catch a movie, too?

253
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,140
Just the two of us?

254
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,320
I’m not in the mood.

255
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,550
It’s my treat.

256
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,640
Light up your mood a bit.

257
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,420
The point is I want to watch a movie.

258
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,640
Just having you here is enough.

259
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,140
Why?

260
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,420
I don’t have anything to offer

261
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,800
Why are you doing these things for me?

262
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,700
You think too much

263
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,880
We are friends. This is what friends are for.

264
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,640
Eat your breakfast.

265
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,900
Eat so you will grow.

266
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,500
Don’t run too fast.

267
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,460
A jerk is calling. Don’t pick up.

268
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,440
Mork, are you awake?

269
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,960
Mork, come and get me.

270
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,340
Mork, are you still awake?

271
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,240
Come down.

272
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,420
Mork.

273
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,380
Stop shouting! People are trying to sleep.

274
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,400
Shit! 150 missed calls.

275
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,200
This is a nice place to sleep actually.

276
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,260
Been here since last night?

277
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,420
Mhm, the owner of the house wouldn’t let me in

278
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,920
I didn’t know

279
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,820
Go and change. Let’s go to school and find something to eat.

280
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,780
Wait, don’t change the subject.

281
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,900
Why didn’t you pick up my call yesterday?

282
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,560
Bam confiscated my phone.

283
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,280
She wanted it to be her day.

284
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,320
I got it back in the evening and I called you right away.

285
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,940
Really?

286
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,600
On my honor as your boyfriend.

287
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,760
You’re mad, aren’t you?

288
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,740
Why would I?

289
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,400
If you’re not, you wouldn’t let me stay outside all night.

290
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,960
The mosquitoes bit me all over.

291
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,680
Look. Poor old me.

292
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,480
Can we go to school now or what?

293
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,180
Don’t change the subject.

294
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,220
Change your clothes then.

295
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,140
Help me change.

296
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,880
Eat your breakfast.

297
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,800
Eat so you will grow.

298
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,740
So sweet.

299
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,700
What are you doing?

300
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,260
You two are still together, huh?

301
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,920
Yeah, Au. Tell him.

302
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,240
Look at his face.

303
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,780
Eat it now. You can’t eat if the teacher comes.

304
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
It looks yummy.

305
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
Can I have a bite?

306
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,560
He won’t share!

307
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,120
Why are you smiling?

308
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,040
I bought the food and water

309
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,320
and wrote that note to trick you.

310
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,980
Really?

311
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
No.

312
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,520
Au, you jerk!

313
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,280
Still the same guy.

314
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,100
Mr. Bear my ass. That doesn’t suit me.

315
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,680
A love letter

316
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,840
Let’s see.

317
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,380
To Mork, please take your medicines

318
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,040
Get well soon.

319
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,020
So sweet.

320
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,300
What?

321
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,440
Don’t run so fast.

322
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,540
So sweet, right?

323
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,480
Nueamork,

324
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,520
who are you here for?

325
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,780
Is there anything urgent?

326
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,600
Nothing.

327
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,780
If there’s nothing, go to your class.

328
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,320
Who’s teaching?

329
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,250
Where is he?

330
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,900
I don’t know.

331
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,150
Don’t worry about him.

332
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,120
Top students may find my class too boring or not like my teaching

333
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,720
They may sneak out to read on their own

334
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
or go to one of those tutoring classes.

335
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,380
He’s a top student, so don’t worry about him

336
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,540
Worry about yourself.

337
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,640
Go to your class.

338
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,900
If you don’t, I’ll report this to your teacher.

339
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,320
Mork, how are you?

340
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,920
Of course, you are not dressed properly.

341
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,360
You’re wearing a ring.

342
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,640
Can you remove it and let me keep it for you?

343
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,260
Fine, don’t give it to me.

344
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,680
But don’t wear it to school. Understand?

345
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,700
Yes.

346
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,220
Do you have anything that you want to share with me?

347
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,300
The teachers want to have a chat with you at noon today

348
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,960
After you finish your lunch,

349
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,040
please come see us at the administration office.

350
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,760
They have something to talk to you.

351
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,120
But don’t be afraid.

352
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
I’ll be sitting right beside you.

353
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,000
How’s it going, Muad?

354
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,540
It’s been a while.

355
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,540
Hey, aren’t you hungry?

356
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,240
Scoot over and let me sit.

357
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,460
I think Bro is mad at me

358
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,220
It’s all in your head.

359
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,660
He seems passive-aggressive.

360
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,420
He must be mad about me posting on IG

361
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,440
and making a big deal out of it.

362
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,980
When we care about someone that much,

363
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,060
or love someone that much,

364
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,920
that’s how you react.

365
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,960
What if I went missing? What would you do?

366
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,960
No way.

367
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,640
I won’t let you disappear.

368
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,920
We will always be the Gord-Morn duo.

369
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,560
Come on, don’t worry.

370
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,180
I had a look at Muad Moo Barber IG yesterday.

371
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,560
Our followers almost reach 200,000.

372
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,980
Don’t you think it’s strange?

373
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,900
The numbers of followers and likes are drastically different

374
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,600
And I haven’t posted any pictures lately.

375
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,620
Oh?

376
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,780
You can tell me anything. You know that, right?

377
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,100
Tell you what? You and I have no secrets.

378
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,640
That’s right.

379
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,260
You tell me everything.

380
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,520
What happened to Muad Moo Barber IG?

381
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,580
Dear clients, we are going through some difficulties

382
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,750
IG is conducting a vigorous scan for spams,

383
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,080
resulting in a decrease in followers and likes

384
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,840
The auto like system has temporarily stopped.

385
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,540
This affects all shops across the board.

386
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,020
Please stay tuned for next notifications.

387
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,240
So, the incidence happened when you went to another province

388
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,040
with the student there?

389
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,000
No, he didn’t go with me.

390
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,760
I went alone

391
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,760
I remember now. You have a brother.

392
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,280
What is his name?

393
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,280
Why, what did he do?

394
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,980
Nothing, he seemed nice

395
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,940
I asked him to help with some photocopying once.

396
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,160
Today I found a Post-It note saying

397
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,440
“please don’t expel my brother.”

398
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,160
You won’t believe what I say anyway.

399
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,000
There’s no point to keep on talking.

400
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,400
You will kick me out of school in the end.

401
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:28,100
Listen, we’ve got to the point where you need to tell the truth.

402
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,360
All of us here are not particularly fond of you

403
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,880
but we are not out to get you.

404
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,940
You would understand, right?

405
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,540
So, tell us whom you went with

406
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,980
Director, his parent is here.

407
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,860
Should we invite him in now?

408
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,960
I want to speak with them in private.

409
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,980
Sawasdee krap.

410
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,120
Hi, Son

411
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,860
How’s it going, Muad?

412
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,920
It’s been a while.

413
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,080
Have you eaten?

414
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,260
Yes, I have

415
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,260
So, are you saying that you went with someone from another school?

416
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,780
He said that he went with a friend from another school.

417
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,400
He’s a grown-up.

418
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,700
Sorry?

419
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,840
He’s a grown-up. Let him speak.

420
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,240
A school has a code of conduct

421
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:56,880
that cannot be contradictory to ministerial rules

422
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,540
This is the school’s code of conduct.

423
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,600
With this violation of the code,

424
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,920
we must follow the school’s regulations.

425
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,140
We can deduct his points for this action.

426
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,420
And that’s all the points he has left.

427
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,740
I hope you understand that the school has tried

428
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,580
to give him opportunities to redeem himself with good behavior

429
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,920
But he has neglected them.

430
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,600
The school has tried many times to invite his parent for a discussion.

431
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:41,860
But he said he didn’t tell you or you couldn’t come.

432
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,320
You don’t understand.

433
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,660
My dad is a barber. He’s very busy

434
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,400
I don’t want him to waste time on this nonsense.

435
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,400
I think you need a new environment, a new circle of friends.

436
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,140
Do you still want to come to school?

437
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,600
I think another school may suit you better.

438
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,020
It may help you change for the better.

439
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,900
It will definitely remove a cancerous cell from this school,

440
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,220
leaving only good ones.

441
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,960
I’m sorry to inform you that you will have to find a new school.

442
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,960
P’ Mork and P’ Tee, I got all the ingredients

443
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,120
Thank you, P’ Tee, for letting me use your kitchen.

444
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,800
Tee is always kind.

445
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,340
Let’s help Gord cook some food.

446
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,220
If we don’t finish, we won’t be able to surprise Morn

447
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,540
Wow, your fabulous dishes

448
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,560
Fried vegetables. So fresh it’s still raw.

449
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,420
The dark soup.

450
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,720
It must be new because I’ve only seen a clear soup.

451
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,820
Lastly, the burned omelet.

452
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,880
It smells so good and very crispy

453
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,960
but is it edible?

454
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,800
There. There.

455
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,480
I shouldn’t have tried to surprise him.

456
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,520
Sorry, P’ Mork. Sorry, P’ Tee.

457
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,920
That’s all right. Let’s find a way to fix it.

458
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,160
Give me a minute.

459
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,640
What’s up with P’ Mork?

460
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,640
He always does this when he’s figuring something out.

461
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,190
Let’s help him figure it out.

462
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,000
How long do we have until Morn gets here?

463
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,100
About half an hour.

464
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,620
Don’t tell me…

465
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,180
If I resolve the situation, you must reward me.

466
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,560
Why me?

467
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,340
Hold this.

468
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,320
And root for me.

469
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,700
5...

470
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,360
4...

471
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,720
3..

472
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,440
2...

473
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,120
1. Time’s up.

474
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,040
You did such a fantastic job.

475
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,040
I can’t believe you pulled it off.

476
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,060
I told you there’s something I’m good at.

477
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,420
Right on time.

478
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,080
Let me get the door.

479
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,500
Don’t be the third wheel.

480
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,660
Come on, let’s go

481
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,180
You’re so late.

482
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,920
We’ve been waiting for you.

483
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,500
Come on.

484
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,440
Why would you visit a guy in the middle of the night?

485
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,500
Can I talk to the same old Gord?

486
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,220
Give me just 5 seconds.

487
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,260
I may sleep with someone else.

488
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,140
Will you break…

489
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,260
No,

490
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,120
stop talking.
