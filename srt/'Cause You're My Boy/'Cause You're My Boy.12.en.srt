1
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,680
Are you hurt?

2
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,960
Mork,

3
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,820
I’m so sorry.

4
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,280
I’m the reason you ended up here.

5
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,480
You and Tee were hit by a car.

6
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,840
Is Tee all right?

7
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,860
Mork,

8
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,380
I’m so sorry.

9
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,400
I can’t believe it took something like this to happen

10
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,140
before I could come to my senses

11
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,420
I could have lost Tee before I could stop

12
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,120
This is not okay.

13
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,040
Why do I have to be so stubborn?

14
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,180
Why do I have to want things to go the way I imagine?

15
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,700
I sometimes forget

16
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,900
that everybody should live their life.

17
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,600
It’s his life.

18
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,960
I don’t own anyone.

19
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,160
I’m sorry, Mork.

20
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,420
I give in.

21
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,820
Let me be nice to you

22
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,680
like you are to me

23
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,240
Please?

24
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,420
How could I say no?

25
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,100
What did the doctor say about Mork having frequent nosebleeds?

26
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,020
Is there anything we can do to treat him?

27
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,860
There is but you should also be prepared.

28
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,460
Your friend sucks.

29
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,220
That’s not nice, Tee.

30
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,100
My friend is the top in his field

31
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,620
If so, how could he say there’s no way to treat Mork?

32
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,100
You should go in.

33
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,260
Tee probably doesn’t want to see me

34
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,800
Luckily, the car stopped in time

35
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,280
You guys only have minor injuries

36
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,780
There is a way to treat him,

37
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,500
but there are steps and procedures

38
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,580
No!

39
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,120
What else could we do?

40
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,980
Stop being a child.

41
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,050
Move to another hospital

42
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,840
To where?

43
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,380
This is the best there is.

44
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,220
Find someone good to treat Mork

45
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,920
I told you. We can give it a try

46
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,020
but you also need to prepare yourself for the worst as well.

47
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,740
This kind of disease is chronic. Can you understand that?

48
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Yes.

49
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,320
Calm down. I understand your concern

50
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,640
Now.

51
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,880
May I excuse myself, Muad.

52
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,360
Mork, try to relax and get rest

53
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,940
Let me handle this.

54
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,940
Don’t worry.

55
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,760
I’ll take care of Mork.

56
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,700
I want to take care of Mork, too

57
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,100
I want to be with him.

58
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,840
Oh, Mork.

59
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,920
This.

60
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,380
What?

61
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,580
Mama gave you this?

62
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,460
This is our family ring.

63
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,880
Our last name is engraved on it

64
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,180
Mama must want you to be her daughter-in-law

65
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,700
Here.

66
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,000
No wonder I couldn’t find it.

67
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,460
You already took it.

68
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,020
You’re engaged. The Reaper won’t take you

69
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,440
The Reaper will feel sorry for me and won’t take you

70
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,420
I’m happy to do this for you.

71
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,280
We will fight on together.

72
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,020
Don’t ever give up.

73
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,660
Are you still going abroad?

74
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,540
How can I?

75
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,660
I gave a promise to someone.

76
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,360
I promised not to go anywhere far.

77
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,360
You said it. Can’t you remember?

78
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,620
Well, you disappeared on me

79
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,340
I didn’t. I was quietly following you.

80
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,180
Mama told me that if I went away for a year

81
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,900
and came back for college, she would leave me alone

82
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,760
I don’t know if she meant it.

83
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,800
Really?

84
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,880
But now she told me that I don’t have to go anymore

85
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,520
I can stay here and take care of you.

86
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,520
Oh, you don’t have to. You should go

87
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,840
Don’t worry about me.

88
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,160
You should do what Mama wants some time

89
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,940
I miss you all the time.

90
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,760
When you miss me, you can come see me.

91
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,260
I miss you all the time. I can’t go anywhere.

92
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,050
Thank you for everything.

93
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,660
Don’t worry about me getting sick

94
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,580
I’m a die-hard.

95
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,420
Fight on.

96
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
We’re closed for today. Please come back tomorrow.

97
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,580
I’m not here for a meal. I want to talk to the cook

98
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,920
Please turn the next page for me.

99
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,420
Can you remember the first time we met?

100
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,280
I forgot to zip my fly and you zipped it for me

101
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,660
It’s the first time.

102
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,160
Hello.

103
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,420
What’s going on?

104
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,380
What are you doing?

105
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,020
May we have the permission to disturb the patients?

106
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,900
You all came barging in. No permission needed

107
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,880
We’re worried about you.

108
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,710
No need.

109
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,620
I’ll be out hanging with you guys in no time

110
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,900
How are you, Tee? Are you still hurt?

111
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
It hurts where you squeeze

112
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,570
P’Mork, are you doing a good job taking care of Tee?

113
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,560
And the two of you live happily ever after

114
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,960
So Disney.

115
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,400
That was dead.

116
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,260
P’Mork, lift your left arm.

117
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,900
P’Tee, lift your right arm.

118
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,500
What’s this?

119
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,540
You have promise rings now.

120
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,660
Can I get one?

121
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,340
You two get well soon.

122
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,700
It feels weird being alone just me and Morn

123
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,880
Are you afraid of your feelings toward each other?

124
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,180
Are you okay?

125
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,540
I’m happy.

126
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
You?

127
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,140
It’s been lonely.

128
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,280
When I go to the UK,

129
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,400
you don’t have to see me off at the airport.

130
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,400
Just call me from time to time.

131
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,640
Sure thing. I will.

132
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,720
But if I forget and you miss me, call me

133
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,720
You should apply for a passport.

134
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,060
You can come and visit me.

135
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,780
I think I have a passport.

136
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,540
There was a school trip at that time.

137
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,260
But I didn’t pay so I didn’t go.

138
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,720
I think it should be in my cabinet

139
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,500
It is not expired yet.

140
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,460
But I can’t visit you. I’m poor

141
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,140
I can come back to see you often

142
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,420
I’m rich.

143
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,120
Keep in touch, buddy.

144
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,780
Let’s hug

145
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,160
Fight on.

146
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,200
Get well soon.

147
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Remember to eat so you will grow

148
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,440
Got it.

149
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,040
All done

150
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,120
We’re closed for today. Please come back tomorrow

151
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,020
I’m not here for a meal. I want to talk to the cook

152
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,800
How long will our fight go on?

153
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,040
Not long after now.

154
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,380
That easy, huh?

155
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,860
You’ve come to your senses.

156
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,840
Tee and Mork are beyond just a fling

157
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,680
If you want to keep pushing on, you will…

158
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,400
Hey, to be honest,

159
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,980
I’ve known about these two for a long while

160
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,560
I wasn’t being pushy.

161
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,040
I know that Tee never looks at me romantically

162
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,900
But what can I do? He’s my friend.

163
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,540
You’re the one who boss me around.

164
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,060
A friend should give a friend some space

165
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,200
Well, I…

166
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,280
Hey, I know when you’re crazy for someone, you go hard

167
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,850
Now, I’m relieved

168
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,440
I said what I wanted to say. See you

169
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,320
Hey, wait.

170
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,240
I’m sorry, my dear friend.

171
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,940
I’m so sorry.

172
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,300
It’s all right.

173
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,340
Want to help me closing the shop?

174
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,740
Put away the chairs.

175
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,860
4 chairs.

176
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,380
Do you know that I made reservations here months in advance?

177
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,740
There’s only one table.

178
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,770
Why did you go through all that trouble?

179
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,080
We can eat anywhere.

180
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,220
No, we can’t. It’s my birthday.

181
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Morn,

182
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,900
eat what’s in front of you

183
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,240
Leave your phone for now.

184
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,220
In a second.

185
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,020
The ice-cream will melt.

186
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,160
You go ahead. I’m going to the bathroom.

187
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,040
Happy birthday to me.

188
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,040
Gord, people come and go but you stay.

189
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,320
We grow up together, do silly things together

190
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,000
I want you to know that you’re my inspiration

191
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,980
Do you know you make every day in my life so special?

192
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,880
Don’t ever think that you’re alone

193
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,600
You always have me right here

194
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,280
I want you to know that I think of you.

195
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,660
For me, this world doesn’t mean a thing if you’re not in it.

196
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,360
Happy birthday, Gord.

197
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,700
I’ll be there for you, always

198
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Read it?

199
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,420
Mmm.

200
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Let’s pinky swear not to leave each other behind.

201
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,240
I swear

202
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,580
Hey, you ate all the cake.

203
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,040
You didn’t wait for me.

204
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,920
Order one more

205
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,860
I’ll order it.

206
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,860
Hey, I have something to give you

207
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
What?

208
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,180
Seaweed?

209
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,800
It’s your favorite snack and mine, too.

210
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,140
I know it’s not expensive

211
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,180
But it’s something that brings us together often

212
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Thank you.

213
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,540
Give me some.

214
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,160
Hold on.

215
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,620
Let me put it away for now

216
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,340
We don’t need it

217
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,220
What?

218
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,900
Hey, can I hug you for 5 seconds?

219
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,260
You hug (Gord) a pillow (Morn).

220
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,680
And a pillow hugs you

221
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,900
Let’s stay for 5 seconds

222
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,540
1

223
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,780
2

224
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,400
3

225
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,040
4

226
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,840
5

227
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,680
Something you just need to let go.

228
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,900
Welcome to Muad Moo Barber

229
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,220
Have you prepared yourself for the worst?

230
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,520
Let it happen as fate decides.

231
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,940
Something you just need to let go.

232
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,800
Or you’ll get hurt when it doesn’t go the way you plan

233
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,340
I’m not afraid of getting hurt.

234
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,240
For me, it doesn’t make a difference how Mork is.

235
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,580
I want to be with him, taking care of him.

236
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,980
Whatever I can do for him

237
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,660
while I still breathe, I’ll do it

238
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,460
I’ll do my best until our time is up.

239
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,560
I’ll make every minute worthy of his love.

240
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,860
Have a bite. Good job.

241
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
I’m getting fat from your feeding

242
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,380
You’re cute even when you’re fat.

243
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,200
Do you like the hat I got you?

244
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,580
I do

245
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,880
May I have a minute?

246
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,860
Of course, Mr. Ton

247
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,680
I’ll be back.

248
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,300
Hey, how are you?

249
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,880
I’m good.

250
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,980
Do you know our class was so fun today?

251
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,400
I can’t believe I can be a good student

252
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
This is for you.

253
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,320
If you don’t catch up, you’ll be stupid. Got it?

254
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,440
Wow, for me? You’re already a good student

255
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,770
When you’re in class, it looks like you’re asleep

256
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,660
But I know you’re listening.

257
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,960
When the grades are out, you come out on top.

258
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,400
Only if it’s upside down. Don’t remind me

259
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,120
Today, the teacher gave us a lot of homework

260
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,220
But don’t worry. A smart guy like me can finish it in a minute

261
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,620
Let’s do it together.

262
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,320
I’m going to put this away

263
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,800
Let’s do our homework.

264
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
I’ll teach you every step of the way.

265
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,560
Here is yours.

266
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,880
Awesome.

267
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,560
The teacher went over Page 113.

268
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,020
We can check back later. I’ll show you how it’s done.

269
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,440
See this example.

270
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,100
Sawasdee, Bro and Bro’s Boyfriend.

271
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,460
Sawasdee krap.

272
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,140
We got you some fruits.

273
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,700
I’ll put these on the table

274
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,100
Sure.

275
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,040
How are you?

276
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,860
I’m good.

277
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,800
What about you? Do you have homework?

278
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,080
Have you done it?

279
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,680
We have a lot of homework.

280
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,620
We’re going to some now.

281
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Good.

282
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,420
Do you want anything to eat?

283
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,460
Some orange, please.

284
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,310
Okay, in a moment

285
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
Yummy?

286
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,180
Eat more.

287
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,140
Look at them.

288
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,060
Look over there.

289
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,040
Wake them up.

290
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,760
Morn, Gord.

291
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,360
Morn, Gord.

292
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,700
Wake up.

293
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,460
Go home.

294
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,800
It’s almost midnight

295
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,300
See you, Bro.

296
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,760
Later, Bro.

297
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,200
Get home safe.

298
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Tee,

299
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,440
you don’t have to be here day and night.

300
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,600
You can go home

301
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,000
Your blood pressure is normal.

302
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,520
Get a lot of rest. You’ll be out in a few days.

303
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,260
Doc, do you think I can be a doctor?

304
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,600
Sure, you can. I think you have what it takes.

305
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,060
Recover soon and go to medical school.

306
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,300
Yes, I will try

307
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,540
Tee,

308
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,920
Doc told me I could get out in a few days

309
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,820
It’s not for good.

310
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,800
It can come back any time

311
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,380
But now I’m all right.

312
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,620
Thank you

313
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,080
Are you finished? I’m getting hungry

314
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,200
Almost. You can fry these.

315
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,160
So mean.

316
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,940
Grandma, Sawasdee krap.

317
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,660
Mama, Sawasdee krap.

318
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,980
P’Lek, Sawasdee krap

319
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,240
Grandma, you have visitors.

320
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,620
What are you making?

321
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,720
Same old dishes.

322
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
Do you want anything special?

323
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,460
Any same old dishes that you make are special.

324
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,240
Let me help you

325
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,420
Since when do you know how to cook?

326
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,900
You can’t eat that

327
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,450
You two have come to a truce.

328
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,820
No truce for you.

329
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,840
Non-sense

330
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,840
I’ll cook for you today.

331
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,480
Mork, come and sit with me.

332
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,800
You’re all well now. I’m happy for you

333
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,580
I’m happy, too.

334
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,060
Are you hungry?

335
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,740
Keep your belly full so you’ll be healthy.

336
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,700
Grandma, have this.

337
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,920
It’s yummy.

338
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,120
Thank you.

339
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,140
Everybody, please eat as much as you can

340
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,540
What are you waiting for?

341
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,680
Put food on your plate yourself.

342
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,600
Fine.

343
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,020
Oh, come on. I’ll do it for you.

344
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,260
I was kidding.

345
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,800
He’s good at pampering us.

346
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,740
How can we not love this guy?

347
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,140
Mork, take him here more often.

348
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,440
Sure

349
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,120
Mama, eat this. It’s delicious

350
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,280
It may not be as delicious as your cooking.

351
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,940
But I think it holds up.

352
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,120
I’m good. Let me put some food on Mork’s plate

353
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,740
Have this. Tee said it’s delicious.

354
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,060
Grandma, do you want anything?

355
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Mork,

356
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,500
make a wish here.

357
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,440
Our family comes to worship here every year.

358
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,840
This is a holy place

359
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Thank you.

360
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,620
You, too, Tee.

361
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:49,360
I wish you two remain good friends for the rest of your lives

362
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,650
Take good care of each other. Focus on your study.

363
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,640
Yes, Mama.

364
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,720
Take it easy. Don’t get too wild, both of you

365
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,660
Yes, Dad.

366
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,020
Bro Tee, please don’t leave Bro Mork.

367
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,680
Yes.

368
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,000
Bro Tee, please don’t hurt Bro Mork

369
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,280
If you don’t know what you’re talking about, be silent

370
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,900
Of course, we know. We’re 14 years old now.

371
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,700
Bro Mork, please love Bro Tee to the max.

372
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,900
There’s no one else who loves you more than him.

373
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,220
I can guarantee that.

374
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,540
Thank you for being a good friend of Tee’s.

375
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,740
Here.

376
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,440
400 baht.

377
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,840
Here.

378
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,860
Just kidding. We’re family. Family helps each other

379
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,520
Here he comes.

380
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,160
What are you two up to?

381
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,540
Nothing.

382
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,220
Hey, don’t forget to buy souvenirs for me

383
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,980
Me, too. Don’t forget about me

384
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,980
Do you want popcorn for souvenirs? We’re just going to the movie.

385
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,340
I see.

386
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,360
You should get going then. Bye

387
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,980
Take care of yourself.

388
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,200
What’s with him?

389
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,710
Oh, I see.

390
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,520
What? What are you up to?

391
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,310
Let’s do homework

392
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,170
There’s no homework.

393
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:25,720
You’ll get some.

394
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,980
What homework?

395
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,300
You’re going abroad tomorrow.

396
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,050
I want to spend every quality second we have left with you.

397
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,540
Come over to my house tonight.

398
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,860
Is that a good idea?

399
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,860
I need to come back home before midnight.

400
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,960
I am Cinderella.

401
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,620
No, it’s my dad and bro. I don’t want them to worry

402
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,200
Do you really have to come back before midnight?

403
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,760
We haven’t done anything

404
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,060
Let’s see a movie first.

405
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,900
Mork, wake up.

406
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,920
Wake up!

407
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,660
No. What are you going to do?

408
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,100
Wake up now.

409
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,580
I don’t want to.

410
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,000
Wake up now.

411
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,340
Wake up!

412
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,980
Are you going to bed or not?

413
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,200
No.

414
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,560
No?

415
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,480
Fine, I give in.

416
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,060
Let’s go to bed.

417
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,880
Was that so hard?

418
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,760
Why do you bring a lot of stuff?

419
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,720
Are you really going by yourself?

420
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,120
Or do you take someone here with you?

421
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,560
Are you ready?

422
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,740
Can I have a second?

423
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,660
Don’t forget about me.

424
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,560
I have something for you.

425
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,760
Close your eyes.

426
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,220
Come on.

427
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,080
Fine.

428
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Oh, you’re blindfolding me.

429
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,800
Selfie!

430
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,860
Did you take it?

431
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,140
Yes.

432
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,480
So, where are you taking me?

433
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,220
You’ll see

434
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,620
Same rules. Take my hand and don’t let go.

435
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,960
Got it

436
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,660
Don’t touch anything down there.

437
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,140
You have to put on the headphone as well.

438
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,060
Let me test if you hear anything

439
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,800
You’ll have to say you don’t hear it.

440
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,040
I love you.

441
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:32,020
I love you, too, my Tee.

442
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,880
Rak Num Nuek

443
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,820
Look at the sky.

444
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,880
The stars are beautiful.

445
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,760
What’s up with you?

446
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,800
You left the party suddenly

447
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,080
Nothing.

448
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,200
You should go back.

449
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,360
I’m fine

450
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,880
How can I go when my someone special is out here?

451
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,620
So, what’s wrong? Can you tell me?

452
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,960
Nothing.

453
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,080
If there’s nothing, why are you avoiding me?

454
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,820
You don’t pick up my calls.

455
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,320
You’re here in this party and acting strange

456
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,980
Well, I…

457
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:46,820
What?

458
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,920
Sit down.

459
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,120
You’re like this when you’re stressed out.

460
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,520
Wait here just a second.

461
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,860
Stars are happy when they’re up there

462
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,260
Cheesy.

463
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,480
Eat this. You may feel better.

464
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,900
So, what’s bothering you? Can you tell me?

465
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,840
I’m just afraid.

466
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,340
Of what?

467
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,020
Someday we may be apart,

468
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,460
and you forget about us like you did before.

469
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,800
That’s all?

470
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,020
Do you trust me?

471
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,160
Yes

472
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,500
If you do, keep at it

473
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,140
Trust that I’ll never forget you and keep you in my heart

474
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,140
You just go to study. It’s not like you’re not coming back.

475
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,840
For you.

476
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,600
You’ll see.
