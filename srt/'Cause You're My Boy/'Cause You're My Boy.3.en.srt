1
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,780
You’re still peeing?

2
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,280
Don’t come closer.

3
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,460
I don’t want to watch you

4
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,800
Why didn’t I hear you pee?

5
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,960
I can’t pee.

6
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,460
Hard-on

7
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,220
Mork, help me.

8
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,460
Help me by waiting outside.

9
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,220
I can’t concentrate

10
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,500
I thought you’d ask me to do something

11
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,280
Go.

12
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,940
You need to concentrate, huh?

13
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,860
Let me see.

14
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,820
What the hell?

15
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,840
Don’t ruin my shirt

16
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,760
Get out.

17
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,680
What?

18
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,160
Small?

19
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,080
You can sulk but you’re not going anywhere.

20
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,800
Stop being a jerk.

21
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,800
Stop playing, Natee.

22
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,600
I’m not playing.

23
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,760
It’s cold here.

24
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,840
Hold my hand

25
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,760
Hold your hand?

26
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,760
Tee, wake up. The film has ended.

27
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,900
Tee.

28
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,940
Tee, wake up.

29
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,640
Let me carry this for you

30
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,020
Come on.

31
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,120
Just a second.

32
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,280
Why are you still sitting? Need a hand?

33
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,880
A hand for what?

34
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,920
Go and wait outside.

35
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,400
Your boner.

36
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,040
What boner?

37
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,580
Why would you cover that area with a bag then?

38
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,960
Let me see

39
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,140
Don’t

40
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,360
Just sit and wait.

41
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,620
Is this the hair salon that’s popular with a lot of followers?

42
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,360
It is.

43
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,260
It’s not too expensive.

44
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,480
We have to try it.

45
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,320
Come, let’s set up a plan.

46
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,600
What plan?

47
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,840
I’ll have my hair cut. Wait for me

48
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,760
You want me to wait for you to get a haircut?

49
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,660
We’re here. I just have to try it.

50
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,720
I may have some ideas to upgrade Muad Moo Barber.

51
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,560
Please take a video of me inside.

52
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,960
Are we allowed? What if we get caught?

53
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,360
We won’t.

54
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,360
Use this camera and hang it around your neck

55
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,740
Turn it on and pace around inside

56
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,020
That’ll do it.

57
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,540
What do you want me to capture?

58
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,540
Since when a client walks in and somebody greets them at the door

59
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,240
until they finish

60
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,260
Some day Muad Moo Barber will no longer be a no-name hairdresser

61
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,120
My dad will be the greatest barber on earth.

62
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,060
Biggest belly maybe

63
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,640
I’m counting on you to save my shop

64
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,800
Please record it.

65
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
Fine.

66
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,160
See you on Monday. I’ll take you to casting

67
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,400
You’ve made the right decision.

68
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,020
It pays a lot to be a star.

69
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,560
You can help out your family.

70
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,920
See you.

71
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,900
Where are all the taxis?

72
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,820
Mork, are you going to sit like that forever?

73
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
So?

74
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,180
How’s the movie? Was it fun?

75
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,240
I don’t know. Watch it yourself.

76
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,120
You slept throughout.

77
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,020
Let’s watch it together again

78
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,120
My phone is dying.

79
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,660
Can you please charge it?

80
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,260
The charger is in the bag.

81
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,660
Here comes the taxi.

82
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,520
Is Bambie your first girlfriend?

83
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,060
I’ve known her since we were kids

84
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,660
Our families are close

85
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,780
Answer the question.

86
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,660
Is she your girlfriend?

87
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,040
A friend.

88
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,500
So what’s the deal?

89
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,460
If you’re not going to get her back

90
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,460
what am I doing here?

91
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,700
She asked me to be her boyfriend when we were in grade 9.

92
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,500
But I didn’t say anything.

93
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,760
Quiet means yes, doesn’t it?

94
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,080
She’s everything.

95
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,100
She’s more than a friend.

96
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,200
But not a girlfriend.

97
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,440
I love her but doesn’t want to hurt her any more than this.

98
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,380
If I say she’s not the one, she’ll wait for me

99
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,740
If I say I like boys,

100
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,700
that won’t hurt her

101
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,980
as much as I say I like other girls

102
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,620
But you’ll eventually like other girls

103
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,060
I feel sorry for her.

104
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,720
Your first boyfriend is sitting right here

105
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,320
Don’t ever say you don’t have a friend

106
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,060
That hurts for a friend like me.

107
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,940
Here’s your apartment.

108
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,720
Let me borrow your camera and copy some pictures

109
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,260
I’ll walk you back.

110
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,680
I walk you. You walk me. When will this end?

111
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,440
So, what about you?

112
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
What?

113
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,600
Without a boyfriend, you’re not lonely.

114
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,560
You have friends, a father, a brother.

115
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,020
Who said I don’t have a boyfriend?

116
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,740
What about your parents?

117
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,960
Friends?

118
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,380
Aren’t you lonely, not having friends?

119
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,600
Do you think the world is big?

120
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,400
I don’t know. Do you?

121
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,780
It’s so big.

122
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,340
I want to go to many places… with someone.

123
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,160
Do you want to go overseas?

124
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,420
Somewhere in Thailand is fine.

125
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,720
Do you have any place that you want to go?

126
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
I want to see snow

127
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,220
If I see snow just once, I’ll be so happy.

128
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,340
Have you seen it?

129
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,520
What will you do when you see it for the first time?

130
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,180
I’ll take my clothes off and run naked in the snow.

131
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,980
Not only that, I want to watch and see

132
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,300
how many minutes it’ll take to turn water into ice.

133
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,760
What water?

134
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,260
I won’t tell you.

135
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,600
What about you?

136
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,180
Where do you want to go?

137
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,340
To the beach.

138
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,620
The beach?

139
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,040
Sure, let’s go together

140
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
Really?

141
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,540
Really.

142
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,260
But the beach can be lonely

143
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,140
I know loneliness.

144
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,180
There are two types.

145
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,980
One,

146
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,700
I’m so lonely tonight. I can’t take it anymore

147
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,220
Jerk!

148
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,520
But that’s not my kind of loneliness

149
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,920
The world is big

150
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,880
But often times I feel like I don’t have a place in it.

151
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,020
Often times I am among so many people

152
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,700
but feel like I want to disappear.

153
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:08,340
The second type of loneliness is when you want to hug someone.

154
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,000
Feel better?

155
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,720
Don’t ever say you don’t have a friend.

156
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,280
That hurts for a friend like me.

157
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,920
I’m going to go.

158
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,740
Why does it have to rain now?

159
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,660
You have to be my guinea pig today.

160
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,600
I’m forcing you.

161
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,560
Sawasdee Muad Moo.

162
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,700
Sawasdee krap.

163
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,540
You’re home late

164
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,700
A client came and asked about the Sarah film.

165
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,720
Do you have it?

166
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,260
Whose camera is that?

167
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,700
My friend’s.

168
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,260
Good. Don’t let me find out that you stole it

169
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,880
Why would I do that?

170
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,560
What do you take me for?

171
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,000
Just kidding.

172
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,260
Mork, you use someone else to buy food for you.

173
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,860
Yesterday, it’s your dad. The other day, it’s Morn

174
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,700
Today, it’s that handsome boy.

175
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,300
Why don’t you come here yourself?

176
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,880
What? Who?

177
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,820
I have a lot of customers today. Come here yourself.

178
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Muad,

179
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,900
did you order food?

180
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,100
I didn’t. Are you going to?

181
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,500
Order Sen Lek with soup for me. Make it spicy.

182
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,640
Hello, Auntie.

183
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,260
Here you go. Your friend said the shrimp basil is for you

184
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,580
Two noodles with soup are for Muad and Morn.

185
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,620
Why are you standing here smiling?

186
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,760
Go on already.

187
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,400
If my daughter, Ching, shows up, she’ll be all over you

188
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,400
Okay.

189
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,940
Hey, what did my friend order?

190
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,760
Chicken basil.

191
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,420
You want to try, huh?

192
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,700
P’Mork

193
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,640
You’re here to see me.  I’m blushing now.

194
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,580
What do you have?

195
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,680
Do you know Bambie?

196
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,700
Bambie?

197
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,840
Which one?

198
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,100
My school has a lot of Bams.

199
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,040
The one who’s a drum major.

200
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,700
Why? Are you interested in her?

201
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,200
No, is she in your class?

202
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,220
Yes, but she’s sitting alone in front of the class.

203
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,100
She’s rich. Her family owns the market over there

204
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,420
I want to see her. Can you set up a meeting for me?

205
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,660
What? No! I don’t want to see her.

206
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,020
We’re fighting

207
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,900
Please.

208
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,020
Please. Please.

209
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,580
Please. Please.

210
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,520
I know that every Sunday after she finishes her swim,

211
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,220
she helps her mom collect fees at the market.

212
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,100
I see her often there when I shop for things for my mom

213
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,060
Really?

214
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,700
Will you go tomorrow?

215
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,580
Yes, why?

216
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Will you come with me?

217
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,860
Yes.

218
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,640
What have you got for me?

219
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,160
The shrimp basil is yours

220
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,340
Can you recover the deleted files?

221
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,120
I think so but need to check with Gord

222
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,400
Gord, can you do it?

223
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,920
I need some time.

224
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,020
But I can’t guarantee.

225
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Let me try. Just a second

226
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,800
Muad, here’s noodles for you.

227
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,580
Spice it up yourself. I brought you a lot of chili

228
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,820
Why did you choose noodles today?

229
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,160
You usually go for the fried basil.

230
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,280
I have transferred THB 19,999 to you.

231
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,340
Username: @Muadmoobarber

232
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,700
100,000 followers.

233
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,260
Thanks for using our service

234
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,660
We will start the process on Monday.

235
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,560
It will be completed within a week.

236
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,360
Are you done?

237
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,320
need a second. It won’t be long

238
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,000
Done.

239
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,640
Such a player.

240
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,220
What are you talking about?

241
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,480
I’ve recovered the photos.

242
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,580
It’s your sweetheart.

243
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,500
Mork has a sweetheart?

244
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,900
We need to celebrate

245
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,120
He’s been in a relationship for days.

246
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,300
What does she look like? Is she beautiful?

247
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,100
Your girlfriend must be more beautiful than your mom

248
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,720
More importantly, she must be healthy and strong.

249
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,180
Don’t find a weak one who dies too soon like my wife.

250
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,880
Don’t tell Dad. I’ll bust your balls

251
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,540
His sweetheart…

252
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,320
I’ll do it for real.

253
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,680
has muscles.

254
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,560
Go away. You don’t get to eat.

255
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,100
Go and do your homework.

256
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:23,640
His sweetheart is rich, beautiful…

257
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,040
more importantly, very strong.

258
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,860
Tee is not gay.

259
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,000
How do you know?

260
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,440
You’re the lucky first to try this.

261
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,720
You made me a guinea pig for your new shampoo formula?

262
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,660
Why is it dark in here?

263
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,400
Silly.

264
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,400
It’s time to unveil your secret, Tee.

265
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,240
P’ Mork! It’s 8 AM. Are you coming?

266
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,680
P’ Mork, I’m going to be late for my shopping run

267
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,300
You said you could make it

268
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,220
What’s the matter?

269
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,800
Your crotch!

270
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,820
Let me get changed. I need to grab my wallet.

271
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,820
There’s no time. We’re running late

272
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,740
Khun Ying, today we have the cabbage that you like.

273
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,340
Selected just for you.

274
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,540
Can I have two cabbages and 1 kilo of tomatoes?

275
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,320
Bam!

276
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,040
Bam!

277
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,760
Who’s that?

278
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,260
I told you to dry your hair properly before you left.

279
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,460
I’ll be back.

280
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,200
Bam! Bam! Wait!

281
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,480
Where are you going? Why are you walking away?

282
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,440
Shit! Banana!

283
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,580
What did you say?

284
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,660
I meant the banana here.

285
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,560
banana

286
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,000
I have something to talk to you.

287
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,940
I pulled a prank on Tee the other day.

288
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,780
He didn’t order gay porn

289
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,480
So?

290
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,920
You pulled pranks on each other until you became a couple?

291
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,740
He’s been calling you all night.

292
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,160
I think you should talk to him

293
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,500
No need to talk. I’m just a friend. Is that clear?

294
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,540
He loves you, P’Mork.

295
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,280
That’s not true.

296
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,180
I think you should talk to him.

297
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,580
He loves you.

298
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,880
Why are you so eager to help?

299
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,600
Did Tee hire you?

300
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,080
Since I’m talking to his boyfriend

301
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,540
please tell him to come home.

302
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,840
His family is worried.

303
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,500
He’s an adult now, not a child

304
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,460
What? Did he run away?

305
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,340
What kind of boyfriend are you?

306
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,060
If you love him, try to take care of him

307
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,600
I’m not his boyfriend.

308
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:45,200
I want to take care of him but he…

309
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,660
Tee is not gay.

310
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,080
How do you know?

311
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,220
Have you proved it?

312
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
So heavy.

313
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,160
Have you talked to Bambie?

314
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,420
Yes.

315
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Ching,

316
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,140
can I ask you something?

317
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
What?

318
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,400
Can you tell if…er…

319
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,760
Stop it. If you have something to ask, just ask.

320
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,520
Can you tell if someone is gay?

321
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,000
This is how you find out.

322
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,920
If you jump on anyone like this, that person will be startled.

323
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,680
It’s not to test if he’s startled.

324
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,980
How then? Do you look at the pinky?

325
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,120
Or how he looks at his foot?

326
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,980
No, that’s to test if he is a she.

327
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,720
I hugged you not because I want to startle you.

328
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,480
I want to know that made you quiver.

329
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,560
Don’t!

330
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,560
Don’t stop!

331
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,160
No, stop it. There are people here.

332
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,940
Did you? Tell me. We’re friends here.

333
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,840
Yes. Why?

334
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,280
So, you get turned on by girls

335
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,360
But it’s not about that.

336
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,840
Now I’m confused.

337
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,340
It’s about whether you get turned on by guys

338
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,520
I can’t just jump on a guy to test that.

339
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,520
This is a sexual orientation.

340
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,260
If you want to know if he is gay,

341
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,060
you find out whether he get turned on by guys

342
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,500
You don’t need to jump on a guy.

343
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,840
It could be…

344
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,080
Porn. You have a lot of that.

345
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,340
Where did you go since early morning?

346
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,720
Why haven’t you showered yet? You have a tutor session.

347
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,340
No, I’m busy.

348
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,100
Seriously.

349
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,500
Do you know our IG followers have increased to over 10,000?

350
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,980
Really?

351
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,280
Am I great or what?

352
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,800
The reason is because your brother is handsome

353
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,640
Ew!

354
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,260
Why don’t you stop posting my pictures? I’m embarrassed

355
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,420
Why, you know I did it for the sake of our shop.

356
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,720
Fine, I can post my own pictures.

357
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,480
P’ Ching told me I’m cute.

358
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,980
Sure.

359
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,300
I have something to ask you. Please keep it a secret

360
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,620
If I am to become a star, do I have your permission?

361
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,880
I trust you.

362
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,360
I think you’re mature enough.

363
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,740
I love you so much.

364
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,360
Someone is here to see you.

365
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,120
He’s waiting for you in your room.

366
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,120
Did you just let someone go to my room?

367
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,620
It’s your boyfriend, so that’s appropriate.

368
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,660
What are you doing here so early, messing with my iPad?

369
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,020
Password?

370
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,500
No way I’ll tell you.

371
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,840
Don’t ever come to my room again if I don’t give my permission

372
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,380
My room is dirty. I am ashamed.

373
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,320
I noticed. You’ve got lots of ants

374
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,700
Here, there, everywhere.

375
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,320
That joke was weak.

376
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,880
Go home. Come on. Go.

377
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,820
No.

378
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,060
No.

379
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,320
Why are you so protective of your iPad?

380
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,480
Got porn in there?

381
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,340
Yes.

382
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,750
You can watch

383
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,280
but...

384
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,500
under my supervision only.

385
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,740
Wait just a second.

386
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,660
Mork.

387
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,460
Hold on, just a second

388
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,560
I want to eat porridge. Can you make it for me?

389
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,760
Watch porn now, eat later.

390
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,540
Just a second and you can watch it.

391
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,320
I don’t want to watch it

392
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,760
Watch it.

393
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,840
No.

394
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Here.

395
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,260
Watch.

396
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,040
Come on.

397
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
No.

398
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,900
Watch it.

399
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,620
Come here.

400
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,540
Open your eyes

401
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,980
Shit!

402
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
Mork,

403
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,120
give me a hug.

404
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,340
Muad, hold this.

405
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,580
Are you crazy?

406
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,120
You’ve made porridge but put it in a bag.

407
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,580
Why did you make only one bowl?

408
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,720
I had enough money for just one.

409
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,300
Tee, you’re here just in time.

410
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,280
Have some porridge made by my son

411
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,300
No.

412
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,840
I just bought it from the place around the corner.

413
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,280
It’s almost 10. I’m surprised that any place is still opened

414
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,720
It smells so good.

415
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,500
Shrimp porridge?

416
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,920
Shrimp and pork.

417
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,280
What shop sells this menu?

418
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,840
When I went to the shop, they almost sold out.

419
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,400
So they mixed everything together.

420
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,460
Here it is.

421
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,960
Only one set. What about you?

422
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,620
I’ve eaten.

423
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,540
You have it.

424
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,260
I told you I’ve eaten.

425
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,980
Someone else can eat it. I have to go home

426
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,820
Thanks. Make pork porridge next time. I’ll join you

427
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,780
Yeah, go home.

428
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,700
Someone else can eat it.

429
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Mork.

430
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,060
I don’t sell gay porn anymore.

431
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,400
Only straight people stuff.

432
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,220
I just bought one from you last week.

433
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,780
What’s up with you?

434
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,440
Write down the film you want.

435
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,680
This is a new arrival, Guys Wide Open

436
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,960
Do you live at that apartment around the corner?

437
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,160
I’m not going there.

438
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,960
Shut up.

439
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,380
If you don’t have anything to do, go somewhere else

440
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,620
Don’t just sit here moping. You’re ruining my shop’s vibe.

441
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,280
Where are you? Come see me. Let’s grab a beer.

442
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,760
Seriously?

443
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,860
There’s light out. Where do you expect to drink a beer?

444
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,840
Same place.

445
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,760
Come on, my treat.

446
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,840
Shit!

447
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,660
Shit, we’ll be there.

448
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,740
I’ve got over 20,000 followers!

449
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,740
Let me see.

450
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,060
I’ve been waiting for you for a long time

451
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,340
What’s this smell? It’s very bad.

452
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,200
What smells bad?

453
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,340
Did you take a shower today?

454
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,080
You may be right.

455
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,640
Disgusting.

456
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,440
What’s there to eat at home?

457
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,660
Why did you ask me?

458
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:15,380
You mentioned porridge this morning. I want to eat that

459
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,080
Before you get home, stop by a porridge shop.

460
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,420
Sure. I’ll make a stop.

461
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,580
Sawasdee krap, Muad.

462
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,160
What’s up with you?

463
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,960
Where is Morn?

464
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,740
He’s buying something.

465
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,320
Your friend got you the dessert.

466
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,020
He said he went back to his home in Yaowarat so he got it from there

467
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,780
Really?

468
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,820
Why would you be so happy?

469
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,040
Here he comes.

470
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,000
Muad, Sawasdee krap.

471
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,460
I knew he’d come back.

472
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,560
You went home and left me there.

473
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,760
Drinking milk?

474
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,820
I don’t see you drink it often

475
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,780
Your boyfriend got it for me, saying it’s yummy and healthy

476
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,980
Did you eat the dessert that I got you?

477
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,180
I don’t like it. Someone else can eat it.

478
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,640
Sulking much?

479
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,960
Sulking my ass!

480
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,720
I’m tired. I’m going to bed.

481
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:47,380
Morn, see off the guest and lock up.

482
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,000
No, your boyfriend will help me with my homework

483
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,860
Gord, stay over tonight.

484
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,480
I’m going to bed.

485
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,500
Don’t stay up too late, kids.

486
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,720
Good night.

487
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,480
Sawasdee krap, Muad.

488
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,280
Let me see

489
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,600
Bro’s Boyfriend,

490
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,640
it’s past midnight

491
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,520
Why don’t you sleep here?

492
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,560
I’ll find you some clothes.

493
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,760
Come on, wake up.

494
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,520
The clothes are in Bro’s room

495
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,800
Sleep in Bro’s room, okay?

496
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,880
I’ve turned on the light for you

497
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,980
Look, I’ve got over 20,000 followers!

498
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
Let me see.

499
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,100
I’m happy for you.

500
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,740
Be a little happier.

501
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,120
Can you not go tomorrow?

502
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,520
How did you know?

503
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,060
You and I don’t have secrets

504
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,460
We use the same phone.

505
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,800
They told me I’m cute.

506
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,520
They asked me to model for them

507
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,460
How can you trust them?

508
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,600
It’s fine. I’ve looked at their IG. It checks out

509
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,700
When did you want to be a star?

510
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,010
Seriously, I never thought about becoming one

511
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,340
When I was a child, my mom died because

512
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,420
Dad didn’t have enough money to support her treatment

513
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,060
I just want to open a new shop for him

514
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,120
and pay for my own tuition fees

515
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,060
I want to help out my family.

516
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,700
Look, you helped me get these 20,000 followers.

517
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,320
Thanks

518
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,740
But from now on, it’s me to carry it through.

519
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,900
I haven’t done anything.

520
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,060
You’ve done something. You’ve posted stuff on your IG

521
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,840
I’m sorry.

522
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,180
It’s okay. I know you’re worried about me

523
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,300
but I can take care of myself.

524
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,320
But you don’t have a weapon to defend yourself.

525
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,840
What if something happens.

526
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,860
You overthink it.

527
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,000
Here, take it.

528
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,440
What’s this?

529
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,880
If someone tries to hurt you, hit them with this belt.

530
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,260
If someone tries to sell you, sell this belt for some money.

531
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,200
I think your life is worth way more than this belt.

532
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,740
Are you crazy? No.

533
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,220
I’m serious.

534
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,840
Take my phone tomorrow. Line me if something’s up.

535
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,440
Don’t worry about me. I can take care of myself.

536
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,460
Can I come with you tomorrow then?

537
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,480
Sure, wait for me at a bookstore nearby.

538
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,460
Okay.

539
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,440
If anyone tries to hurt me, I’ll hit them like this.

540
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,280
If you want to know if he is gay,

541
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,520
you find out whether he get turned on by guys

542
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,980
You don’t need to jump on a guy.

543
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,180
It could be…

544
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,240
Porn. You have a lot of that.

545
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,980
Mork, are you gay?

546
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,340
Since you’re here, let me test you.

547
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,800
What test?

548
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,920
Watch it.

549
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,940
It’s time to see the test result.

550
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,420
Don’t!

551
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,020
Have you ever wanted to touch a penis?

552
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,360
Sure.

553
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,140
