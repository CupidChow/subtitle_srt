1
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,560
If you want Mork to continue in this school,

2
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,780
stay away from him.

3
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,860
Ma!

4
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,080
It’s better that way.

5
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,820
When you continue with your higher education

6
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,480
you will be apart anyway.

7
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,060
You don’t have to tell him about your study

8
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,660
Are you here?

9
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
On my way.

10
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,340
I’m at the canteen

11
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,020
I’ve ordered you some food.

12
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,140
Why are you smiling like a crazy person?

13
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,720
I’m not crazy. I’m just happy.

14
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,140
About what?

15
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,660
About you not being kicked out of school anymore

16
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,300
I even prayed for you at the shrine at school

17
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,020
Talk about commitment.

18
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,120
What did you offer the god?

19
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,120
No snacks for 3 classes

20
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,860
That’s it?

21
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,440
3 classes are a lot

22
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,920
I’m hungry all the time

23
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,980
Thank you.

24
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,520
You got a second chance.

25
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,500
Make the most of it.

26
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,680
This is as far as I can take you.

27
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,700
I’m coming in.

28
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,420
Let me copy it.

29
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,740
I’m copying, too.

30
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,500
What are you doing?

31
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,600
Some extra homework due this morning.

32
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,840
You should copy it now.

33
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
I don’t have to. I’m done.

34
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,660
Copy this.

35
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,540
Shit, he’s finished!

36
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,700
Where did you copy from?

37
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Nowhere! I did it on my own

38
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,560
If you don’t believe me, give it back

39
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,180
No. I am copying it.

40
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,540
It’s almost 8 AM.

41
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,280
Au, take this one

42
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,500
We need to hurry.

43
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,620
Will I finish it in time?

44
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,640
Mork, our class will start soon!

45
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,680
Don’t mind him. Let’s finish this.

46
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,500
Valedictorians - Middle School

47
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,860
What are you shouting about?

48
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,860
Gord, Morn – I’ve been looking all over for you.

49
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,000
Sawasdee krap.

50
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,640
Your grades have improved so much

51
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,600
Have you been going to tutoring classes?

52
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,040
Yes, Miss.

53
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,440
Keep up the good work.

54
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,820
Your dad will be proud

55
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,120
Sawasdee krap

56
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,740
She’s gone

57
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,080
I can’t believe that those classes really pay off.

58
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,600
Determination never betrays.

59
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,220
You’re determined, and it shows in your grades.

60
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,960
Knowing this, I’ll keep the determination going for a long time

61
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,840
Sure.

62
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
I have to thank you, Gord.

63
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,180
Thank yourself.

64
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,000
I know. I just want to thank you, too.

65
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,920
It’s good that I didn’t turn into a net idol.

66
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,600
That wouldn’t suit me.

67
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,220
I’m good with just being a student.

68
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,680
Who says? You can be anything you want.

69
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,900
You’re talented. You’re cute.

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,120
I’ve heard that a lot.

71
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,020
So, where are we going to celebrate?

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,560
It’s up to the star of the event here.

73
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
What do you want to eat?

74
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,520
Yes, Mork. Daddy Au is paying.

75
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,420
Yeah, what do you want to eat?

76
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,660
We’re celebrating that our assignment got a full mark.

77
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,660
It’s on me.

78
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,440
Umm… I think I’ll have something I need to do.

79
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,820
Wait, you said you think you will have something?

80
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,640
So, do you have it or you don’t?

81
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,700
I have to go. See you.

82
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,540
Rain check!

83
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,640
What’s up with him?

84
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
Grandma.

85
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,200
Are you here to see Tee?

86
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,780
Yes, Mam.

87
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Is he here?

88
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,840
He’s upstairs.

89
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,820
Oh?

90
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
Are you two having a fight?

91
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
No.

92
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,900
Do you know something?

93
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,480
Even though Tee is a good boy

94
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,620
but when he’s being naughty,

95
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,700
he’s so stubborn that I want to spank him in the butt

96
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,580
Do you spank him in the butt?

97
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,040
Of course. When he’s exceptionally naughty,

98
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,340
I spank him hard.

99
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,360
But the more I spank him, the worse he gets,

100
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,000
unlike when I hold him.

101
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,700
That’s when he obeys and follows what I tell him

102
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,860
You two, try to talk to each other.

103
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,260
Whatever is on your mind, say it out loud

104
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,640
Don’t keep it to yourself.

105
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,520
You don’t know if you will have another chance to say it.

106
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,780
People may not know when they die or separate from their loved ones.

107
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,140
He has little time left here.

108
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
What do you mean?

109
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,180
Remember my words.

110
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,580
If you have something to say or do, get it done now

111
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,800
before it’s too late.

112
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,440
Go. Go to him.

113
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Thank you.

114
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,580
I know you’re in there.

115
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,300
Although you don’t come out to see me or talk to me,

116
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,300
I’m here to tell you that I love you.

117
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,020
Even though you avoid seeing me, don’t respond to my texts

118
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,940
or go far away,

119
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,780
I will keep on loving you.

120
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,860
You should have told me about your study.

121
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,540
Why?

122
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,480
Were you afraid that I wouldn’t let you go?

123
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,920
I probably wouldn’t.

124
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,780
We had drifted apart for years

125
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,020
Now that we’ve reconnected and loved each other,

126
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,180
you decide to leave again?

127
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,840
When you’re there,

128
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,040
take good care of yourself

129
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,100
Don’t get sick too often.

130
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,320
I’m worried about you.

131
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,440
When you’re there,

132
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,860
update your posts on IG and Facebook often,

133
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,800
so I won’t miss you too much.

134
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,980
In your pictures,

135
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,940
smile a lot

136
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,720
So I’ll know that you are happy even though you’re far away.

137
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,920
Are we really saying goodbye this way?

138
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,700
Won’t you give me a chance to see you one last time?

139
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,980
I promise

140
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,680
that I will let you go.

141
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,180
I won’t hold you back

142
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,980
I won’t make you uncomfortable.

143
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,240
Just give me one last chance to see your face,

144
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,460
to hold you one last time.

145
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,100
I’m sorry for asking too much.

146
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,720
I’ll get going.

147
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,740
Safe travels.

148
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,840
Take care

149
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,200
I love you

150
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,980
I love you so much

151
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,680
Hey, this setting calls for a horror movie

152
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,840
No way, it’s scary.

153
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,500
Come on, it won’t be that bad.

154
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,560
No, I don’t want to watch it

155
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,160
Trust me.

156
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,520
No.

157
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,260
Have a look

158
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,300
No ghost yet.

159
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,060
No!

160
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Turn it off.

161
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,640
The ghost is gone. You can watch it now.

162
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,680
It’s gone.

163
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,100
Turn it off.

164
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Fine, turning it off.

165
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,120
Let’s watch something else.

166
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,160
What?

167
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,420
This one.

168
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,140
That’s enough. Let’s go to bed

169
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,100
I’m so tired

170
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,160
Just go to bed

171
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,480
Fine.

172
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,360
Sweet dreams, Morn

173
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,720
Sweet dreams, Gord

174
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,000
See you in my dreams.

175
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Sure.

176
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,580
Don’t go anywhere far.

177
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,000
Don’t be apart.

178
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,760
Don’t run away.

179
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,140
Muad!

180
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,700
Relax, it’s your children

181
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,660
You startled me.

182
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,920
You’ve got a lot of stuff to give alms to the monks.

183
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,200
I dreamed of your mom last night.

184
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,760
She looked so thin.

185
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,280
So, I woke up early to buy food for alms.

186
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,940
I wanted her to eat delicious stuff

187
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080
Muad,

188
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,800
do you miss Mee?

189
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,680
Of course, I miss her

190
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,860
I miss her every day.

191
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,760
Come and drop in my dream again, Wifey

192
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,580
Don’t forget to give me the winning numbers.

193
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,920
How did you cope with it when she’s gone?

194
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,020
Despite being so in love, you weren’t together in the same place.

195
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,700
Mork, listen to me carefully.

196
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,680
For people in love, it’s not ‘gone’.

197
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,960
It just moves

198
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,580
from here

199
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
to inside here.

200
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,220
It may be hard at first.

201
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,040
But don’t rush it.

202
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,640
Live your life as normal.

203
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,770
If you can’t forget, don’t.

204
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,740
Although you don’t have them beside you,

205
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,520
they are in here the whole time.

206
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,280
Trust me,

207
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,260
for those in love,

208
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,020
even though your loved one is far away,

209
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,880
it feels like they’re close to you all the time.

210
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,560
Do you know why?

211
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,600
Because you always miss them

212
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,060
Muad, here come the monks

213
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,800
Come on kids, help me give alms

214
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,700
Take this.

215
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,220
Thanks, but can you get off my back?

216
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,600
Oh, I forgot. Sorry.

217
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,860
I have a question?

218
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,140
What?

219
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,240
Have you ever thought about going far away?

220
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,400
No

221
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Good.

222
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
Why?

223
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,680
Don’t go anywhere far.

224
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,480
Don’t be apart.

225
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,620
Don’t run away

226
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,900
I won’t go anywhere

227
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,400
I’m good right here.

228
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,000
Say it again one more time

229
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,240
I won’t go anywhere.

230
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,040
I’m good right here

231
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,860
with someone here.

232
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,640
You didn’t say that the first time.

233
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,100
You didn’t stick to the script.

234
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,240
I didn’t but it means the same thing.

235
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
Okay

236
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,640
Let’s go to class.

237
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,380
Is USA very far away?

238
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,700
Not that far

239
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,740
It only takes 12 hours to fly there

240
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,800
Is the air ticket expensive?

241
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,860
I don’t know. I didn’t pay it myself.

242
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,440
It must be. Mama was complaining.

243
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
How do you feel when you’re on the plane?

244
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,580
Like you can fly?

245
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,840
It feels like you have a hole inside

246
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
like you’re on a rollercoaster

247
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,420
when you’re at a high point.

248
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,260
Will you have a pomegranate juice to drink there?

249
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,860
Probably not, but there should be pomegranates there.

250
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,780
I can make the juice myself

251
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
I want to taste it.

252
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,100
If you make it yourself, tell me what it tastes like.

253
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,020
I want to know.

254
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,420
Sure, I’ll tell you.

255
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,080
If you ever get lonely, call me

256
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
Even though there’s a significant time difference,

257
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,420
I’ll make the time

258
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,800
If you get bullied by anyone, tell me

259
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Although I’m far away

260
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,460
I’ll pray for the Superman spirit to save you.

261
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,480
Are you a superhero?

262
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,320
You won’t forget me, will you?

263
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,880
Like I won’t forget you

264
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,200
I’ll keep you here.

265
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Mork,

266
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,020
if memories make you suffer or make you cry,

267
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,160
please forget about me.

268
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
If memories make you…

269
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,820
Do they hurt you?

270
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,420
Will you forget me?

271
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,780
They don’t hurt me.

272
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,880
They are valuable to me

273
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,620
When I don’t see you or hold you,

274
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,340
the memories of us will help me through any difficulties.

275
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,500
Don’t forget me.

276
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,500
Don’t tell me to forget you

277
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,760
Let me remember you.

278
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
I don’t have anything else left

279
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,820
No one will mind if I keep you in my memories, right?

280
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,160
No one. No one will mind at all

281
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
I’m sorry.

282
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,820
I’m so stupid, I’m sorry.

283
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,000
What’s up, Au?

284
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Where are you?

285
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,840
The Memorial Bridge.

286
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,500
Come out here.

287
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,900
Ton is craving for a certain malty drink

288
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,060
It’s on me

289
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,140
I’m not available. I’ve got something to do

290
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,080
Come on, we’re parked right in front of your house.

291
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,380
I give you 5 minutes. Come out.

292
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,220
You should go with your friends.

293
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,600
I have to go home.

294
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Take care of yourself.

295
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
Don’t get drunk too often

296
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,960
Block some time to study.

297
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,980
Study hard.

298
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
You can do it

299
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Tee!

300
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,400
Tee!

301
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,120
Tee!

302
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,740
Mork, aren’t you going to drink some?

303
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,860
We’ve got a lot here

304
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,000
I told you to buy only one crate.

305
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,120
You bought it like you’re starving for it.

306
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,420
I was in a lot of stress.

307
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,620
And this is a going away party.

308
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,700
A going away party?

309
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,940
To send Au off abroad.

310
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,940
That’s a long way away.

311
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,020
You just need an excuse to drink.

312
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,720
I’ve totally forgotten about that.

313
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,900
I’m sorry.

314
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,120
It will be just you and me who are most handsome in the school

315
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,680
I will take care of his fan club.

316
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,940
Jerk, I don’t have any.

317
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,400
What about a girl who’s like, ‘P’Au, can I take a photo with you?’

318
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,120
Or ‘P’Au, can I take a selfie with you?’

319
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,120
She won’t just change her crush from me to you.

320
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,460
Au, what are you saying?

321
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,720
Hey, Au, he’s laughing.

322
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,660
That’s right, I see it.

323
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,340
I’ve seen you brooding all day long like this.

324
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,380
We thought you’re having constipation

325
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,860
but then we saw you go the bathroom.

326
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,460
Shit, you’re being dramatic.

327
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,900
Dramatic? We knew that we needed to have drinks with you.

328
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,240
So, what’s the occasion of this?

329
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,440
The occasions are I want to get drunk,

330
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,920
send Au off abroad one year in advance

331
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,560
and cheer you up.

332
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,380
Thanks so much.

333
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,340
If you’re feeling thankful, you should love us even more

334
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,240
It’s just us now, got it?

335
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,420
I love you guys so much.

336
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,220
Stay friends like this forever.

337
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,380
Yes. Au, come on. Cheers!

338
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,040
Cheers!

339
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,120
Cheers!

340
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,820
Are you having a fever?

341
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,140
Want some?

342
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,380
Have mine. We’ve got a lot left.

343
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,320
Have some if you’d like.

344
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,780
Clink it one more time

345
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,980
Cheers!

346
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
Hello, Muad.

347
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,680
Come inside, Gord.

348
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
Do you want some water?

349
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,780
Is Morn here?

350
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,680
There he is.

351
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Morn!

352
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,280
What’s with the commotion this early?

353
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
What is this?

354
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,500
Let me see.

355
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,100
Valedictorians.

356
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,280
Hey, it’s you!

357
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,580
Valedictorians. Wow!

358
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,980
Is this real?

359
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,100
Wow, good job, Son!

360
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,340
Is this for real?

361
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,660
Bro, look at this.

362
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,800
Hey, that’s you.

363
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,020
Yes, it is me.

364
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,060
What have you done wrong to make the front cover?

365
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,200
That’s not funny

366
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,740
Kidding. Congratulations!

367
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
What’s going on?

368
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,560
Keep up the good work. We have to get going.

369
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,140
Sawasdee krap.

370
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Take care.

371
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,700
See you.

372
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,700
Sawasdee krap.

373
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
See you.

374
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,280
Bye.

375
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,200
Congratulations.

376
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,240
What about you? Aren’t you going to school?

377
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,640
Take a shower or you’ll be late.

378
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,420
I’m not going today. I’m not feeling well.

379
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,860
Hey, Mork.

380
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,440
What’s wrong with him?

381
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,380
Muad, you can keep this one in the shop.

382
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
For me?

383
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,100
That’s mine.

384
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,120
Come on, let him have it

385
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,420
I’ll show it to my customers.

386
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,340
Tee, you have your passport with you, right?

387
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,480
I do, Grandma.

388
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,300
Good. What about your mobile phone?

389
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,680
Here.

390
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,700
Call me as soon as you arrive.

391
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,160
Don’t keep me worried.

392
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,260
What about my cookies?

393
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,820
I have them here.

394
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,580
Eat them on the plane in case the food is horrible.

395
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,780
You’re so worried about him.

396
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,160
Your favorite grandson is going away.

397
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,920
Of course, I’m worried.

398
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,360
Even though Tee is not at home all the time

399
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,740
he’s never traveled this far away from me.

400
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,160
What about medicines? Do you have them with you?

401
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,100
If you run out, tell me right away

402
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,940
I’ll send them over.

403
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,900
Okay, let’s go.

404
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,880
Safe travels. Study hard and finish soon

405
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,960
so you can come back here soon enough

406
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,180
Sawasdee krap.

407
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,540
Good luck, dear

408
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,020
Au, I’m busy now. Let me call you back.

409
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,980
What did the doctor say about Mork having frequent nosebleeds?

410
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,780
Is there anything we can do to treat him?

411
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,520
There is but you should also be prepared.

412
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,900
Morn, please eat something.

413
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,980
Leave your phone for now.

414
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,320
You go ahead. I’m going to the bathroom.

415
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,600
Let me serve you a bite
