1
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,680
This is a sexual orientation.

2
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,880
If you want to know if he is gay,

3
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,600
you find out whether he get turned on by guys.

4
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
Porn. You have a lot of that.

5
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,640
Mork, are you gay?

6
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,540
Since you’re here, let me test you

7
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,260
What test?

8
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,300
Watch it.

9
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,780
It’s time to see the test result.

10
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
Don’t!

11
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,440
It’s not hard.

12
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,960
Get your hand off, otherwise it will.

13
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,920
I’m sorry, Tee.

14
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,880
I’m sorry.

15
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,520
Wow, you got up early to do laundry.

16
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,120
No need.

17
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,700
The storm will come. Big one.

18
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,480
Startled much?

19
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,840
You did a number on me since early morning.

20
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,660
I got told off by my mom yesterday.

21
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,920
Really? You didn’t drink much yesterday

22
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
She still gave you a hard time?

23
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,540
Let me treat you with this bag of snack.

24
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Eat.

25
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,580
Ton,

26
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,160
can I ask you something?

27
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,120
What?

28
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Have you ever wanted to touch someone’s penis?

29
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,300
What kind of question is that?

30
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,380
Of course.

31
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,020
Shit! That hurts.

32
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,260
Au, help me.

33
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,820
Why would you ask him that?

34
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,260
I wanted to know why you’d want to.

35
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,080
If I want to, I want to.

36
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,660
It’s my happiness.

37
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,020
Calm down, or it will be hard.

38
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Is this a good idea?

39
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,680
Come on.

40
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,040
You won’t get nervous when you go to a casting tonight.

41
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,480
Fine.

42
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,660
Back straight.

43
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,440
I got this

44
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,320
Is that Charnsamorn?

45
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,620
What are you wearing?

46
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,220
The belt isn’t right and you’re wearing sunglasses.

47
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,600
Why are you dressed like this?

48
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,240
Let me see your hair.

49
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,400
What business do you have with Charnsamorn?

50
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,840
His hair is long. How can I let him pass?

51
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,940
Come here.

52
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,160
No, can’t do. You must book an appointment in advance.

53
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,480
Book in advance?

54
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,780
Go to IG and search for Muad Moo Barber.

55
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,340
Then, look at ‘contact for work’

56
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,780
Right, I go there?

57
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,060
Then, book an appointment.

58
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,100
Right, I book an appointment there.

59
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,240
I’m all booked up for today.

60
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,280
I should select other days then.

61
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,760
How do I do this?

62
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,300
Wait, come back!

63
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,440
Your bro is a badass.

64
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,080
It comes natural

65
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,880
I shouldn’t have.

66
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
You shouldn’t have what?

67
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,040
None of your business.

68
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,680
For me, love is protecting someone you love,

69
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,180
especially your family

70
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,260
Today in our homeroom, we have a special guest coming

71
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,800
She’s a beautiful doctor called Doctor Mei.

72
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,840
She will come to talk about sex and love.

73
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,540
Please give a big welcome to our guest speaker

74
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,340
Sawasdee kha.

75
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
Sawasdee krap

76
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,880
Today I will talk about a subject that teens like you may find interesting

77
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,940
Love.

78
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,940
What is love? Can anyone tell me?

79
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,200
Sex.

80
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,580
What about you?

81
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,440
Er…I think…love is…

82
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,160
waiting.

83
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,280
Wait for what?

84
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,380
For someday

85
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,260
when she turns to me.

86
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,260
What about you?

87
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,020
I don’t know.

88
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,700
Give it some thoughts.

89
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,740
Maybe it’s when you feel like you want to hug someone

90
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
I guess.

91
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,920
Hug who?

92
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,100
What about you?

93
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,440
For me, love is protecting someone you love

94
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,660
especially your family.

95
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,500
A psychologist named Robert Sternberg came up with

96
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,860
a triangular theory of love

97
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,340
The triangular means it is comprised of 3 components.

98
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,520
Intimacy,

99
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,380
passion and commitment.

100
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,860
Love must have these 3 components to make it complete

101
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,380
If you’re missing one, that’s not love.

102
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:02,660
But it can be friendship, infatuation

103
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,780
or

104
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,220
fatuousness.

105
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:13,680
What is the difference between true love and complete love?

106
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,700
I don’t know.

107
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,440
What can we use to judge if it’s true love?

108
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,000
Why should we judge it?

109
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,260
True or complete love sounds perfect but it may not exist.

110
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,680
Sometimes,

111
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,420
imperfect is a form of beauty

112
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,320
I believe nothing is perfect in this world.

113
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,720
But there are things that suit or doesn’t suit us.

114
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:58,440
Does each of you know what you like or what your sexuality is?

115
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,740
Why do we need to label it?

116
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,400
Each of us is different

117
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,180
People have come up with labels just so we have names to refer to

118
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,060
Remember this though.

119
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,080
People don’t become gay, lesbian or bisexual.

120
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,640
They just fall in love with another person.

121
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,100
I didn’t say that. That’s a quote from Calum Hood

122
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:38,260
If a guy likes another guy, how will they….?

123
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,760
You didn’t pay attention to class earlier, Mork.

124
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,580
Remember I said

125
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,460
that the triangular theory of love has 3 things.

126
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,680
Passion, commitment and intimacy.

127
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,980
Love and sex are two different things.

128
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:18,760
Love doesn’t depend on sex but passion can confuse you.

129
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:27,220
Passion can lead to commitment, which can lead to intimacy.

130
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,500
That may bring about sexual desire that may seem impossible.

131
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,940
So, when we’re close to someone,

132
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,020
we may have sexual desire for that person.

133
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,920
For example, a man can be attracted to another man

134
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,620
But I’m a man.

135
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,020
How do you know? Being gay isn’t wrong.

136
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,560
I don’t agree with trying to change your truth as well as others’.

137
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,360
Accepting who you are is the most important thing.

138
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,800
For example, my spouse.

139
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,700
We got married, built a family, had a child.

140
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,280
We finally got a divorce

141
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,060
because he can’t stop being gay.

142
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,020
Something cannot be changed.

143
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,660
We need to listen to our heart.

144
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,340
Once you hear it, accept it.

145
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,960
One last thing.

146
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,620
Sometimes, you wait to be judged by the society.

147
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,860
You need to get married by this age.

148
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,960
You need to work by this age.

149
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,660
You need to have babies by this age

150
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,200
When you can’t meet those expectations,

151
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,100
you feel upset because you let the society down

152
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,720
There’s nothing wrong with being single.

153
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,220
Being single and lonely is way better than

154
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,360
being someone else’s plaything.

155
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,600
Thank you.

156
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,960
Tee.

157
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,380
What are you doing here?

158
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,860
I want to see if you’re still in school.

159
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,580
Go back.

160
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,580
Don’t ever do this again.

161
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,520
I’m embarrassed.

162
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,380
Let’s eat.

163
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,060
Morn.

164
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,640
I heard you’ve been trying to make it big lately.

165
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,000
Do you want to be famous?

166
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,620
Promoting your shop and yourself.

167
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,360
If you think about it, you may want to join my gang.

168
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,000
I have a tip to tell you

169
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,860
I see you’re with this guy. He didn’t get you very far.

170
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,300
My gang is recruiting a new member.

171
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,400
What do you think?

172
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,620
It’s fine but many thanks.

173
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,680
Well, let me just give you the tip anyway.

174
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,760
Good looking people are born that way.

175
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,700
Rich people, too.

176
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,600
Bastards like you wouldn’t know.

177
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,560
Being in our gang will change your life.

178
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,480
If you want in, just text me.

179
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,840
But he doesn’t have a phone.

180
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,960
You can send a pigeon. I’ll be waiting

181
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,200
Let’s get something to eat.

182
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,120
Let’s go, buddy.

183
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,660
Besides being jerks, they’re extremely short.

184
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,320
They come up to my shoulder

185
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,180
I don’t think I should go to the casting. Bad omen.

186
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,400
Be confident.

187
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,120
You’re just as cute as ever.

188
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,640
Come on. Let’s eat something.

189
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Let’s go home

190
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,840
You guys go ahead.

191
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
What’s up with you?

192
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,780
Are you sure?

193
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,020
Let’s go then.

194
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,740
See you.

195
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,600
Later.

196
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,120
Bye.

197
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,820
What’s up with her?

198
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,660
What’s the matter?

199
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,280
Are you hungry?

200
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
I don’t want it

201
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,040
How long are you going to wait for?

202
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
What?

203
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,580
No matter how long you’re waiting, I’ll wait with you.

204
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,440
Hello, where are you?

205
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,620
Hello.

206
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,860
Anything I can help you with?

207
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,740
It’s fine.

208
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,200
Come on, tell me where you are.

209
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,720
It’s really fine

210
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,380
Stay there. I’ll come to you

211
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,960
You found me.

212
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,280
Look who you’re talking to.

213
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,800
Wasn’t that because of my clue?

214
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,540
You said you’d find me on your own

215
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,840
When you send the photo, I was about to find you.

216
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,720
Do you have a beef with me?

217
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,820
Don’t push it.

218
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,760
This room is off limit.

219
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,600
You have a secret now?

220
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,640
I’m hungry. Let’s find something to eat

221
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,460
Noodles or basil?

222
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Well…

223
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Let’s go.

224
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,960
Hello, where are you?

225
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,140
I’m in my supercar.

226
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,000
Hello, where are you?

227
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,680
I’m in my supercar.

228
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,200
I’ll see you in two minutes.

229
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,440
okay

230
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,840
Do you think it’s the same person?

231
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,400
No.

232
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,480
There are other Morns.

233
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,880
Let’s go to the parking lot.

234
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
Don’t stress out.

235
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,260
Are you from Chang Thai Modeling?

236
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,860
Yes, it’s me.

237
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,820
I don’t look like my profile pic, right?

238
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,940
I posed like a girl in my profile pic but I am actually a man

239
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,740
Only the two of you?

240
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,060
Yes.

241
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,620
Great. Let’s go.

242
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,920
I’m going go.

243
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Stay with me

244
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,160
This is Morn. I’m Gord.

245
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,720
This is Gord. This is Morn.

246
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,800
You guys have cute names.

247
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,040
Gord Morn. Hug a pillow.

248
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,640
Are you guys together?

249
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,120
No.

250
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,240
Let’s take a picture with the car.

251
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,660
That’s all right.

252
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
We should talk about the casting.

253
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,260
Do you want a ride in this car?

254
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,480
My driver is out to get something.

255
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,340
If you want to be a model,

256
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,420
we need to see what you’ve got.

257
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,480
Let’s go to the bathroom

258
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,260
I can’t wait.

259
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,960
Hold on a second.

260
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,560
What does that mean?

261
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,000
I don’t know.

262
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,160
Should we call the police?

263
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,880
I’ll catch up with you after I’m done.

264
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,940
Let’s go. Come

265
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,920
Come here. Come.

266
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,120
Let my friend go

267
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,980
Can we talk without using force?

268
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,760
Mister, please don’t touch my boss’s valuable

269
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,180
I should go. I have something to attend to

270
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,040
It’s a scam after all.

271
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,800
It’s okay.

272
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,500
Please.

273
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,160
Is this your car?

274
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,140
My dad’s.

275
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,420
Why didn’t you tell me?

276
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,580
I wasn’t sure. I was just wondering.

277
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,440
My dad buys stuff arbitrarily

278
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,000
Look at the plate.

279
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,760
The alphabets come from my surname

280
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Don’t be upset.

281
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,140
Don’t be naughty and wreck my dad’s car

282
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,300
He’s…

283
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,080
He’s following me all the time.

284
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,780
That’s why I’ve moved out to the apartment.

285
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,740
Who asked him? Your parents?

286
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,880
Yes.

287
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,500
Even when you’re overseas?

288
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,120
That’s okay. You’re not alone. You have me.

289
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,360
My stomach hurts.

290
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,040
Do you want some medicines?

291
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,220
Your Doraemon bag has everything.

292
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,480
The situation was tense so I have a stomachache.

293
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,040
What kind of person is that?

294
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,100
He said he’s from the casting studio and lied about the car.

295
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,220
How do I take off this belt?

296
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,400
It’s a little tricky. I set a code.

297
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,480
Only I can unlock it.

298
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,040
What? Seriously?

299
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,320
What if I have to rush to the toilet?

300
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,740
What kind of belt is this?

301
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,900
I’m kidding. I need to watch out for you.

302
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,400
You’re a dummy.

303
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,700
You’re gullible.

304
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,860
What if somebody hurts you? Who will save you?

305
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,380
You

306
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,440
I’m not a dummy. I got through today.

307
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,680
I’m happy to have a friend like you.

308
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,100
We’ll be friends forever. Gord Morn Duo.

309
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,620
Nothing will tear us apart.

310
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,680
Oh, since we didn’t go to a casting,

311
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,260
we should go to class.

312
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,460
Okay, please go to the tutor building.

313
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,540
Please drive slowly. I want to stay here as long as I can

314
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,740
I’m tired.

315
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,580
Boo!

316
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,280
You’re early today.

317
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,840
I was tired after class.

318
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,900
But when I see your face, it disappears.

319
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,480
I can go for another 10 classes

320
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,860
Overstatement much?

321
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,980
Who are you looking for?

322
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,940
No one.

323
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,660
Your boyfriend is in the bathroom.

324
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,320
I wasn’t looking for him

325
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,840
Whose phone is that?

326
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,920
Your boyfriend gave his phone so I can play games.

327
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,920
Why would you take his phone?

328
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,200
Use mine.

329
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,780
My games are way better.

330
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,000
Let’s switch.

331
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,780
No.

332
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,580
Look at his Facebook page.

333
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,100
There are a lot of posts

334
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,860
He posts something almost every day

335
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,220
But I never see him update anything

336
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,920
His Facebook page is totally empty.

337
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,060
Mork, let’s go to Yaowarat together.

338
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,580
Nueamork and Muad Moo are tagged.

339
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,400
I see why you can’t see it.

340
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,160
The status is set to ‘only me’.

341
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,260
Let me see.

342
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,100
Look but don’t touch.

343
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,720
He shouldn’t have been shy.

344
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,500
If he tags and invites you directly, you’ll go anyway

345
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Smartmouth.

346
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,420
What?

347
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,220
Scroll down a bit. I saw something.

348
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,060
Nosy much?

349
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,000
Seriously, are you guys faking to be together?

350
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,120
I can tell

351
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,340
Faking a relationship is trendy now

352
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,080
There you are.

353
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,100
Bro’s Boyfriend, he wants to go to Yaowarat.

354
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,280
What? I didn’t say that.

355
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,500
Yes, you said you wanted to drink a pomegranate juice

356
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,320
You’re asking for it again

357
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,100
Let’s go. My treat.

358
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,520
Yay!

359
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
Be careful.

360
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,700
Gord, let’s go to Yaowarat

361
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,720
If you don’t go, I’ll tell your bodyguard and your parents.

362
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,740
They won’t let you go anywhere on your bike.

363
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,520
Don’t tell my parents.

364
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,900
I want to have a hipster life.

365
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,840
Let’s go be hipsters.

366
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,360
Let’s go to Yaowarat.

367
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,600
Hold my bag

368
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,780
Okay

369
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,380
Let’s go.

370
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,620
Your friend can stay over. I’ll allow it.

371
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,340
Give it back.

372
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,100
Have a seat.

373
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,980
I’m so hungry.

374
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,580
Morn, what do you want to eat.

375
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,420
Everything.

376
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,740
Wait.

377
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,660
Just kidding.

378
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,120
What kind of porridge do you want?

379
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,040
Mixed.

380
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,600
You didn’t ask me what I wanted.

381
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,380
I don’t want porridge. It’s hot.

382
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,140
It burns my mouth, got it?

383
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,140
Bro’s Boyfriend,

384
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,720
your Facebook status that you set for ‘only me’.

385
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,560
Morn, return his phone. Don’t be rude.

386
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,180
Wait, P’ Mork, this is good.

387
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,300
You wanted to see it, didn’t you?

388
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,040
I never did

389
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,380
Give his phone back now.

390
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,720
Bro’s Boyfriend, it’s better to let it out.

391
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,400
Don’t keep it to yourself. Trust me.

392
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,360
Morn, no.

393
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,080
You’re not going to tell him? Fine.

394
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,120
What did you send?

395
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,680
Don’t read it.

396
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,760
What? It’s my phone.

397
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,120
You can’t stop me.

398
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,540
UFO!

399
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,580
UFO!

400
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,100
I’m not stupid

401
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:39,480
P’ Tee, there’s something in my glass

402
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,360
Please have a look.

403
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,620
Where, Gord?

404
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,180
I don’t see anything

405
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,280
My mistake.

406
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,960
I miss Mork

407
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,540
You’re so slow.

408
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,980
I was on Gord’s bike to his dorm and walked here.

409
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,260
And I was faster than you.

410
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,400
Do you have any homework for Tee to tutor you?

411
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,980
No. If I had, I wouldn’t ask you to go to Yaowarat.

412
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,100
You don’t but I do.

413
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,560
Go upstairs now. It’s getting late. Aren’t you afraid of ghosts?

414
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,940
Dad!

415
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,140
I forgot the helmet.

416
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,440
It’s dangerous.

417
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,680
You have homework.

418
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,060
I can help you so you’ll finish it quickly.

419
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,760
Sure.

420
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,820
I’ll walk you home after we finish

421
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,020
Okay.

422
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,480
Sawasdee krap, Muad

423
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,000
Muad, sawasdee krap.

424
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,380
Here, I got you some toasts.

425
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,920
You’re home late.

426
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,980
My friend will stay until late.

427
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,820
But don’t worry. I’ll lock up.

428
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,060
Your friend can stay over. I’ll allow it.

429
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,440
Make yourself at home.

430
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,120
Thank you

431
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
Excuse me.

432
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Come on in

433
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,240
Do you want to take a shower?

434
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,800
I can take a shower at my apartment.

435
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,840
Let me look at your homework before you get tired

436
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,960
Do you have homework?

437
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,640
You can yours done first.

438
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,520
Wait a moment then. I’ll be quick.

439
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,100
No need to hurry. I’ll play a game in the meantime

440
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,880
Your wallet is nice.

441
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,180
Let me see how much cash you have.

442
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,900
In your pricey wallet, there’s only 100 baht.

443
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,220
So?

444
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,820
3 years ago.

445
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,460
Don’t look at that picture.

446
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,360
Give it back.

447
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:05,980
No.

448
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,040
Give it to me.

449
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,000
Let go.

450
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,180
You still have it.

451
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:27,300
Rak Nub Nueb

452
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,600
Can we take a break before we continue tutoring?

453
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,400
6 minutes.

454
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,040
That’s too short.

455
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,460
60 minutes.

456
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,960
That’s too long.

457
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,800
Where are you going?

458
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,600
We have 60 minutes.

459
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,880
We should find something to relax the mind

460
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,080
Hey, where are you going?

461
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,660
Let me and Gord come.

462
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,540
No way.

463
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,900
I’ll tell Muad, then.

464
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,920
I’ll give 100 baht.

465
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,180
That’s too low.

466
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,600
400?

467
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,580
Deal.

468
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,200
Don’t come back too late or Muad Moo will yell at us.

469
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
I know.

470
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,220
Let’s go.

471
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,780
Where are we going?

472
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,800
You’ll find out.

473
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,720
Good for the soul, right?

474
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,100
Do you like ice-cream?

475
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,980
Mhm… cool breeze and yummy ice-cream

476
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,760
they chase away tiredness very well.

477
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,660
Try it.

478
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,520
It’s true. I feel lighter.

479
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,600
When I feel tired,

480
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,440
I like to come here.

481
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,240
It makes you feel small and your problem smaller.

482
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,040
But I think you’ll have more problem coming up.

483
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,240
What problem?

484
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,200
It’s been 50 minutes.

485
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,880
We need to go back to study

486
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,900
No, why are you so strict?

487
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,060
I want to go to sleep

488
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,680
Smooth.

489
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,540
I’m sleepy.

490
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,880
So, you like guys

491
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,780
I like you.

492
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,340
Oh, I forgot. It’s not a class subject.

493
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,960
I won’t try to test what you are

494
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,520
I won’t let you go no matter what

495
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,020
Smile. Bigger.

496
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,660
Cute.

497
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,360
Where are you going?

498
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,320
Do you like this?

499
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,320
If you don’t, get out.

500
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:05,120
If you do, let’s get together and be a couple.
