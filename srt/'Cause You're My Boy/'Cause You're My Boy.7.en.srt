1
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,000
I think...

2
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,740
you should lay low.

3
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,060
Stay home

4
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
They’re looking to catch you.

5
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,780
Catch me?

6
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,920
You’re funny.

7
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,200
You’re funny.

8
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,560
Is life so funny to you?

9
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,480
What about Tee?

10
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,600
What did they say about him?

11
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,100
Don’t worry about other people.

12
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,300
You can resign from the school and be a barber like me

13
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,480
I paid for your education and you didn’t give a damn

14
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,460
No, I want to go to school.

15
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,140
I’m going to a school event.

16
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,600
Seriously?

17
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,660
Since you were born,

18
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,420
I’ve never seen you want to go to a school event

19
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,720
And today you want to go.

20
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,760
Where is Mork? Have you come back from the snow town?

21
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,780
I saw your news this morning. You got moves.

22
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,200
Who’s that pretty boy?

23
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,220
Are you coming today? People are waiting to see you

24
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,120
Can I quit being your friend? I am ashamed

25
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,600
Hey, Mork. You’re here.

26
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,380
For you.

27
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,980
I’m not hungry yet

28
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,640
What’s wrong?

29
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Nothing.

30
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,020
Mork,

31
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,940
help me with this button.

32
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Thanks.

33
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,880
I’m sorry.

34
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,160
For what?

35
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,920
You haven’t heard?

36
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
What?

37
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,520
Nothing.

38
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,200
Close your eyes.

39
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,820
I’ve got something for you

40
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,640
Come on, close your eyes.

41
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,400
Give me your hands.

42
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,460
Now, open your eyes.

43
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,960
“You are my world, Mork.”

44
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,700
I really mean it.

45
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,500
Let’s go out.

46
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,920
I think people are starting to come.

47
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,100
Go ahead.

48
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,340
You have to get ready.

49
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,220
Oh?

50
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,700
I need to go to the bathroom.

51
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,160
I can wait.

52
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,680
You go ahead.

53
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,380
Please look after my camera and bag

54
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,100
go on

55
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,600
Don’t take too long.

56
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,480
Good luck, Tee.

57
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,760
I’m so sorry, Tee.

58
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,260
Mork, why are you backing away?

59
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,160
Ton!

60
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,960
Of course, it’s me.

61
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,000
Help me get this out.

62
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,460
Shit!

63
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,760
How is it? Cool?

64
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,240
Very cool.

65
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,520
Why are in the mascot costume?

66
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,300
Feeling lonely.

67
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,400
No friends, no girls.

68
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,680
But this turned out to be good.

69
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,660
When I was walking here

70
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,480
girls were coming to hug me and take photos with me.

71
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,060
I only see guys walking around here

72
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,700
Just roll with me.

73
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,480
I think you should lay low

74
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,920
Stay home.

75
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,100
They’re looking to catch you.

76
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,620
Ton.

77
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,650
Hmm?

78
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,380
I have a favor to ask.

79
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,650
What?

80
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,000
Hey, your bro is back.

81
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,340
I saw him at the school this morning

82
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,280
Mhm, I need to delete that missing person post on IG.

83
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,340
So many followers, it’s like they were bought.

84
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,340
That’s insane.

85
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,120
It is.

86
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,340
I spent all that money Bro gave me on the tutoring classes

87
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,860
Did you ask them how much it was?

88
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,160
That’s why you know it’s expensive?

89
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,740
Yeah, more than 10,000 baht.

90
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,820
You have to be stupid to buy it.

91
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,540
I really hate buying things that are not real.

92
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,460
I can’t stand it.

93
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,080
You hate it?

94
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,960
Of course, why would you spend money on things that are not real?

95
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
What’s up with you? Why are you making that face?

96
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,100
Must be the weather

97
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,260
. It’s so hot here.

98
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,620
Wasn’t it weird yesterday?

99
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,140
New and Ryu were nice all of the sudden

100
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,680
They recruited me to join their gang.

101
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,200
“The Freaking Handsome Gang”.

102
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,240
Be careful. Their behavior was quite suspicious

103
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,160
Don’t assume the worst.

104
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,020
It’s getting late. We’ll miss the parade.

105
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,420
You ask for the bill while I go to the bathroom.

106
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,160
Sure.

107
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,380
Yeah, I have it with me.

108
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,100
Don’t forget it next time

109
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,800
I’m on my way.

110
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Free hug?

111
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,760
You’re giving away free hug, right?

112
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,340
Can I have one?

113
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
Hello.

114
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,180
Why would I do that, P’ Mork?

115
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,540
Why would I do that, P’ Mork?

116
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,400
Please take care of him.

117
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,440
P’Tee’s stuff.

118
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,740
Ching…

119
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,520
What have you done to Tee?

120
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,720
You’ve done a poor job in taking care of him

121
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,800
Forward

122
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,560
march.

123
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,800
Always run away.

124
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,180
Who are you talking about?

125
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,240
Don’t worry that I will rock your boat.

126
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,040
I will back away

127
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,580
Because of the news about him?

128
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,120
Because my best friend isn’t okay with it.

129
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,240
First I thought if she wasn’t okay, to hell with her

130
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,740
But when she’s not around,

131
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,780
it makes me feel so lonely

132
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,040
If your friend is a jerk, stop being friends with her.

133
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,100
No need to care if she’s lonely.

134
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,720
Typical you. Stop being headstrong.

135
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,140
That’s what I am.

136
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,400
I forced you to do stuff.

137
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,880
We’re not friends anymore. What else do you want?

138
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,980
Ching.

139
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,740
All this time I forced you to do things – I’m sorry for that

140
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,020
You can tell as many people as you want about my secret

141
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,680
I’ve stopped asking you for help.

142
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Ching!

143
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,700
Do you think keeping a distance from him will make this go away?

144
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,800
You’ve heard.

145
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,080
Of course. I worry about you.

146
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,420
So, what are you going to do next?

147
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,660
Whatever punishment you get, he should get it, too

148
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,540
I shouldn’t have let him get close to you.

149
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,040
Au,

150
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,820
we haven’t done anything.

151
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,100
Was what we did so wrong?

152
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,700
Do you think what you did was right?

153
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,500
In the clip you’re wearing the school shirt, for crying out loud

154
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,840
What were you thinking?

155
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,280
Do you know how much it hurts me

156
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,420
seeing you go down because of that jerk?

157
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,820
Let me tell you.

158
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,520
If he loved you, he wouldn’t let this happen.

159
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,380
About the news, I’ll handle it.

160
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,340
How?

161
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,060
At this stage, why are you still protecting him?

162
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
Tee!

163
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Tee!

164
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,240
Tee!

165
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,560
Tee!

166
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,400
Please get him to the hospital.

167
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,940
He’s allergic to shrimps.

168
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,960
What have you done to Tee?

169
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
You’ve done a poor job in taking care of him.

170
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,500
please help Tee.

171
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,020
He’s very important to me.

172
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,560
But I’m not taking care of him well enough

173
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,860
Tee!

174
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,080
Tee! Wake up!

175
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,900
I’m just jealous of someone

176
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,560
who doesn’t have to put in any efforts

177
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,080
but ends up with a good thing.

178
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,840
Hey, he’s already dead.

179
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,240
Don’t be a jerk.

180
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,500
Wake him up

181
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,600
Wake up, Mork.

182
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,260
Wake up, Mork.

183
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,720
Wake up now.

184
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,880
Get out of there.

185
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,580
Pretty bad shape.

186
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,620
How can you be this tired?

187
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,220
Will you be okay?

188
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,640
What about Tee?

189
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,840
Worry about yourself before someone else.

190
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,980
Don’t worry.

191
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,680
He’s at the hospital now.

192
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,180
The doctor said he’s lucky to reach the doctor in time

193
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,900
And you fainted.

194
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,320
Bambie is looking after him. You can relax.

195
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,220
Where are you going?

196
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,960
Getting something to eat. It’s getting late.

197
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,640
I’m not going.

198
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,680
If you’re not, go home already.

199
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,860
Au, take it easy.

200
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,400
Your friend is on the news.

201
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,240
You don’t want to see anyone, do you?

202
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,060
Don’t worry about that.

203
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,180
Worry about getting kicked out of school.

204
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Jerk,

205
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,280
it wouldn’t kill you to be supportive

206
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,820
It’s true. He’s ruined the school’s reputation.

207
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,740
That’s way too harsh

208
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,520
I think he will be suspended at most.

209
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,580
If you get lonely, I can stop by after class.

210
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,700
Your place is not far from the school.

211
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,920
I want to go home.

212
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,200
Mork, let’s go find something to eat.

213
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,640
These are a bit hard to remove.

214
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,360
Here, wear these.

215
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,040
My friend looks cool.

216
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,200
Hey, take it easy.

217
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,240
Are you okay?

218
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,360
I think we should get something to eat

219
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,620
Sip some iced tea while eating a hotpot

220
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,160
It may cool you down a little bit.

221
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,980
Stressing out now doesn’t solve anything.

222
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,600
Better to eat.

223
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,400
Let’s find something to eat.

224
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,580
Many good places around here. Come on.

225
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,360
Come on.

226
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,960
Fine.

227
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,560
I think this place is good.

228
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,060
Mork doesn’t eat cilantro.

229
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,260
Yes, sir

230
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,600
What do you think I should do?

231
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,640
I didn’t think it’d be such a big deal

232
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,900
Your brother looked for you everywhere on social media

233
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:17,080
He covered all celebrity IG accounts and popular FB pages,

234
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,480
even those gay student pages

235
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,940
You like and follow these pages?

236
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,240
No, my FB friend shared it with me.

237
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,980
You accept a lot of gay friend requests, don’t you?

238
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,880
I accept all. How could I have known which ones are gay?

239
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,280
What should I do next?

240
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,160
I don’t want to involve Tee in this kind of thing.

241
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,720
His record is clean.

242
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,480
I don’t want him to lose that because of me.

243
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,280
The reason his record is clean is because of money, don’t you know?

244
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,440
I know someone who has connections.

245
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,100
He may be able to help you.

246
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,440
Really?

247
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,700
Yes, if there’s anything I can help you, I will

248
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,720
Seeing you like this and Au getting upset…

249
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,400
Don’t blame this on me.

250
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,400
If it were you, how would you help him?

251
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,840
If it were me,

252
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,200
I’d go to the police station and pay a fine

253
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,660
No, I meant how would you help Tee out of this mess?

254
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:33,520
I’d ask my parents to talk to the school, asking them not to kick him out.

255
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,940
You can do that?

256
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,880
His father does everything he wants

257
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,920
This is nothing.

258
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,140
About the news clip, I’d ask them to stop broadcasting.

259
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,620
About the CC TV footage, I’ve checked.

260
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,560
There’s only the one at the snow town.

261
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,100
We just need to ask them to delete it.

262
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,240
Why do you know so much?

263
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,100
How do you know?

264
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,880
Don’t be ridiculous. Everybody knows this stuff.

265
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,160
You know, don’t you?

266
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,280
Do I?

267
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,600
How would anybody else know?

268
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,260
Fine, I checked the location of the mobile phone.

269
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,760
My mobile phone?

270
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,940
Tee’s phone from Bam’s phone.

271
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,060
What for?

272
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,260
Because he cares about you

273
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,260
Let’s not talk about it and eat instead.

274
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,160
Do you want anything else?

275
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,120
Put all that meat inside the pot.

276
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,800
You’re treating me to this meal.

277
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,660
Did you know Tee before?

278
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,820
Why didn’t I know about it?

279
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,920
Why do you think I knew him?

280
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,840
You seemed to know lots about him.

281
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,860
You knew him before and you didn’t tell me either

282
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,280
Don’t avoid my question.

283
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,040
I didn’t tell because I didn’t want to know him

284
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,760
and I didn’t want you to know him.

285
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,500
He didn’t want to know me.

286
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,160
Because of Bam?

287
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,340
I forgot something in Tee’s bag.

288
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,640
Are you going to get it back

289
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,460
or ask Bam to bring it to you?

290
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,400
Never mind.

291
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,440
Hello, Muad.

292
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,940
Today P’ Tee fainted all of the sudden.

293
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,620
P’ Mork went to help him and passed out as well

294
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,920
But it’s okay. He was brought to the hospital.

295
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,180
Don’t worry. Bro will come home eventually.

296
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,060
I’m on my way home now. See you at home.

297
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
Give it to me.

298
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,780
Have you heard about your brother?

299
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,140
Someone had a footage of him from a CCTV and posted it on the net.

300
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,500
What CCTV? Let me see

301
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,460
Hold on.

302
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
Shit!

303
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,880
With your ‘missing person’ posts, lots of people were interested

304
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,600
People mixed it up and changed the narrative.

305
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,460
Morn, you caused trouble once again.

306
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,260
Bro will be so mad at me.

307
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,620
No, he loves you. Everybody does

308
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,900
Look, your fan club got you all this stuff.

309
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,560
That’s another thing. When did I have a fan club?

310
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,480
All I got is headache!

311
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,940
Come on. You go home and relax.

312
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,540
Then, you apologize to P’ Mork

313
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,760
Will he be okay?

314
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,580
He’ll be fine. It’s not a big deal.

315
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,300
Not everyone thinks so.

316
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
Let’s go home.

317
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,900
Shit, what time is it?

318
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,140
Shit! Why didn’t you wake me up?

319
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,380
I couldn’t be bothered

320
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,340
And I wanted to take my time thinking about something.

321
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,880
What were you thinking about?

322
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,860
I think I’m jealous.

323
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,400
Of whom?

324
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,720
My life and how it’s messed up so badly?

325
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,680
No.

326
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,720
I’m just jealous of someone

327
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,340
who doesn’t have to put in any efforts

328
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,220
but ends up with a good thing.

329
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,900
Get off already or your dad will be worried.

330
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,840
Do you have anything on your mind?

331
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,940
I do

332
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,280
I have something that I’m not brave enough to do.

333
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,300
Something I don’t know if I should do.

334
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,400
What do you think?

335
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,520
Regret for things you haven’t done is better than

336
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,460
regret for things you’ve done.

337
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Something you can’t just go back in time and change it

338
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,440
I want you to think carefully. Don’t make the same mistake I did.

339
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
True.

340
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,600
Go on.

341
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,820
Thanks for helping me.

342
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,160
If there’s anything I can do to help you, let me know

343
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,880
Morn, do you have this much homework?

344
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,560
You’re doing 5 workbooks.

345
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,600
There’s mine and there are other people’s.

346
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,360
They hired me to do it.

347
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,000
Kids these days hire people to do their homework?

348
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,660
Yeah and it pays well.

349
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,200
If I’m rich, I’ll renovate your shop.

350
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,620
Morn, you’re a student.

351
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,500
Your job is to study.

352
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,760
Earning money is my job.

353
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,520
Morn, do you have to go to your tutoring class?

354
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,220
Yes, but I can go later.

355
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,300
If you choose this path, you’ll go through a lot of hard times

356
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,220
That’s Mama’s car.

357
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,110
Morn,

358
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,890
do your homework upstairs

359
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,810
You love him much?

360
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,610
Do you love him much?

361
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,750
Yes.

362
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,970
Have you thought this through?

363
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,050
I have.

364
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,410
Think about it some more. Think real hard about it.

365
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,630
Are you ashamed?

366
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,310
Of course.

367
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,710
It’s worse when you behaved like that.

368
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,090
Why didn’t you say so sooner?

369
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,390
I thought you’re okay all along

370
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,650
Do I need to say it?

371
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,410
Aren’t you supposed to know what’s appropriate?

372
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,610
Let me ask you. Is it real?

373
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:53,290
True love for you people – does it exist?

374
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,110
If it doesn’t, then what is this?

375
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,170
What is what?

376
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,790
What’s inside my heart.

377
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,910
I love him so much.

378
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,750
No matter how many times you ask me to think it over

379
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,210
the answer is I love him.

380
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,310
I miss him like you miss Mom.

381
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,150
I want to see him all the time.

382
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,790
I want to eat something with him.

383
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,870
When I see him in a bad shape,

384
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,390
it makes me want to be with him more.

385
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,330
You’ve thought it through.

386
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,470
Yes, I have.

387
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,850
It doesn’t matter if it takes me one minute,

388
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,970
one day, one year

389
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,430
or the rest of my life to think,

390
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,370
the answer remains the same.

391
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,350
The answer is…

392
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,070
I love him so much.

393
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,850
If you choose this path,

394
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,790
you’ll go through a lot of hard times

395
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,430
There will be tears for you, Mork. Are you up for it?

396
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,650
Your boyfriend will shed a lot of tears as well.

397
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,890
Can you stand seeing him cry?

398
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,750
If you don’t let go, you’re dragging him down with you

399
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,530
Isn’t that a selfish thing to do?

400
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:46,010
Even if I let him go, he will cry nonetheless.

401
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,290
If we cry together,

402
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,790
he’ll have me to console him

403
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,290
You can’t console him forever, trust me.

404
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,290
Go and give your brother a lift.

405
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,290
No matter what happens, don’t neglect your responsibility.

406
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,830
I’m your father.

407
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,990
I’ll stand by you no matter what.

408
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,930
Morn, let’s go.

409
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,970
Come on, Bro.

410
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,930
Whose car is it in front?

411
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,610
That’s Mama’s car

412
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,490
I’ll say hi to her.

413
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,510
Sawasdee krap, Mama.

414
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,990
Are you going to your tutoring class?

415
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,350
Have you eaten?

416
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,530
Hop on, I’ll give you a lift.

417
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,150
Sawasdee krap.

418
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,190
They look yummy.

419
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,110
The food is ready. Let’s dig in.

420
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,310
Yummy.

421
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,190
Are you close to Au?

422
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,790
I know him. He’s in my gang.

423
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,430
Your gang seems quite a troublemaker.

424
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,970
You used to get into fights all the time.

425
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,710
Au’s mom once was called to come to the school

426
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,850
So, I went in her place.

427
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,130
This is a good thing about boys.

428
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:22,350
If you don’t do well in school, you find a lot of friends instead.

429
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:25,330
But my son, Tee, doesn’t have many friends

430
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,330
You know Au?

431
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,870
Our families are close.

432
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,490
Can I taste your dish? It looks delicious.

433
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,770
Of course.

434
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,490
How is Tee doing?

435
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,130
I got a tummy ache. I’ll be back

436
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,490
Mama, I’ll be back in soon.

437
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,010
I was in a meeting, so I couldn’t go

438
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,990
I asked P’ Lek to take care of him.

439
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,230
She said he’s not in a good mood.

440
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,830
Are you free today?

441
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,510
Would you accompany me to buy some tea

442
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,490
Tea for Tee?

443
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,330
For Grandma.

444
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,790
Besides noodles, Tee doesn’t like any Chinese

445
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,650
No surprise, his dad is Thai.

446
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:25,370
I’ve told him to get me a nice Chinese daughter-in-law

447
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,590
She’d be familiar with Chinese customs and traditions,

448
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,370
not eating beef – that kind of thing.

449
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,510
This way, there won’t be a lot of adjustments like me and his dad

450
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,730
Will you visit him today?

451
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,290
I don’t think so

452
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,090
P’ Lek called and said Tee was so stubborn

453
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,670
He’s asking to be released even though

454
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,550
the doctor recommended him to stay overnight.

455
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,330
Maybe you can try to stop him

456
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,770
I can’t stop him.

457
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,390
I know I can’t stop him,

458
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,910
but can I stop you?

459
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,850
Please don’t look at me like that.

460
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,810
I know I must look really bad right now

461
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,070
You are a sweet person but…

462
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,990
If you can’t stop him, you can’t stop me either.

463
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,030
I didn’t want to do this

464
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,810
Seeing the news makes me so stressed out

465
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,670
Can you please give me peace of mind

466
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,250
and promise me that you will stay away from him?

467
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,630
I have to choose the best path for my son

468
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,590
Can you please try to understand me?

469
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,610
No, I don’t.

470
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,530
Tee’s a grown-up

471
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,610
He knows what’s right and wrong.

472
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,930
He can make decisions for himself.

473
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,510
And he’s chosen me.

474
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,010
You know what’s right and wrong.

475
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:50,770
A good man belongs to a good woman.

476
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,710
Together they can have true love.

477
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,210
Do you know what Tee said?

478
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,570
He told me not to care what you say.

479
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,110
Do what we want to do and let you go.

480
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,810
Can you just wait for me to die first

481
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,310
so I won’t have to take this?

482
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,510
If I stay, I can’t take it.

483
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,030
He’s my son. I take care of him well.

484
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,050
I won’t let a mosquito bite him.

485
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,990
Do you know what Tee said?

486
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,550
He said most parents know what their kids are

487
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,190
yet still try to change them.

488
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,470
Mork,

489
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,590
it’s not trying to change them.

490
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,430
This is what nature tells you.

491
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,190
You know that a man belongs to a woman.

492
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,990
There are other things.

493
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,270
He will go to college, get married and have kids

494
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,110
What do you have to offer?

495
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,510
My love.

496
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,030
Love that doesn’t exist?

497
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,910
What do you mean it doesn’t exist?

498
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,390
Mork

499
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,550
If it was someone else, I may accept it.

500
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,990
But this is someone in my family

501
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,450
This is my son

502
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:23,610
Why do you understand other people’s sons but not your own?

503
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,250
Have you ever thought of your family?

504
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,850
Have you ever thought of your family?

505
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,710
Someone like me who may be more acceptable to this

506
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,750
chooses not to accept it

507
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,910
What about others?

508
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:42,510
Those who are not familiar with this will look down on you.

509
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,430
What will happen to your loved ones?

510
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,330
How can they answer to the society?

511
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:50,270
Don’t answer. It’s none of their business.

512
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,550
I really love him.

513
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,950
How can you say that?

514
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,870
It’s been less than a week and you’ve caused so much trouble.

515
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,330
If Tee gets kicked out of school, what can you do?

516
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,930
Do you have a future?

517
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,250
You can’t even see into your future

518
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,290
In your future, do you have Tee in it?

519
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,310
In 10-20 years, where will Tee be?

520
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,930
Will you leave him?

521
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,630
If you had a future,

522
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,710
you wouldn’t do this kind of thing

523
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,770
What do you want?

524
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,830
Anything besides me leaving him, tell me.

525
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,830
I’ll do it.

526
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,010
About the beef…

527
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,250
People in Tee’s family don’t eat beef.

528
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,930
What would you do?

529
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,370
It’d go against your preference

530
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,810
Tee is allergic to shrimps.

531
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:54,550
Grandma doesn’t eat fish.

532
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,470
What is left for you?

533
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,970
We also observe the vegetarian festival every year

534
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,170
That will just cause difficulty for you.

535
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,170
What about school?

536
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,350
Tee’s grades will be lower, and your grades will be worse.

537
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,590
That’s not true.

538
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,910
I will study with him every night.

539
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,610
How is that possible?

540
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,710
I know you’re not a good student.

541
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,890
You are placed in the bottom of your class.

542
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,290
All you do is picking a fight with someone.

543
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,330
It’s good that your friend comes from a powerful family

544
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,230
What about college?

545
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,910
You’re eleventh grade.

546
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,270
Aren’t you supposed to prepare for that to make your dad proud?

547
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,590
What school do you want your in-law to study in? I…

548
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,390
Please don’t think I’m mean

549
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,730
But if you nip this in the bud, it won’t hurt too much.

550
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,230
Don’t go deeper into this rabbit hole.

551
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,310
Love is not about two people.

552
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,910
Even if just one person objects to your love

553
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,270
that love is not a good thing.

554
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:55,550
If you break up with Tee now,

555
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:00,690
you may find a nice girl who turns to be your soulmate.

556
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,570
You don’t get it because you’re too young.

557
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,210
You’ll thank me later.

558
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:06,830
About the news,

559
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,210
I’ll handle it and talk to the school.

560
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,970
You won’t be in trouble and your life will go on.

561
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,830
But you must stay away from Tee.

562
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,570
To silence the news, you guys can’t be seen together.

563
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,670
You must have silenced the news about Tee before.

564
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:28,430
He did something, and you used money to keep it quiet

565
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,150
What?

566
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,050
My son is good person.

567
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,770
If you loved him, you wouldn’t ask me that.

568
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,110
It’s not easy to keep something quiet like on TV.

569
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,350
How many people can you keep quiet with money?

570
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,350
If I could, I wouldn’t be asking you to stay away from Tee.

571
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,630
Bad news is countered by good news.

572
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:56,730
Bad action is offset by good action, keeping yourself clean

573
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,330
Tee is a good person.

574
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:02,990
Give him a chance to redeem himself.

575
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,230
I’m begging you.

576
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:09,590
Please stay away from him.

577
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,330
Mork,

578
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,230
do you want him to skip school for another year?

579
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,170
Jerk is calling.

580
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,230
I have Mork now. I’m okay

581
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,930
If you don’t?

582
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,970
I won’t let that happen.
