1
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,140
Ton, can I talk to Mork privately?

2
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Au

3
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,340
Did anything happen between us?

4
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,920
Go take a shower

5
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,200
Get up. You're messing up my bed

6
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,780
I will take off your socks

7
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,820
You're so dirty right now

8
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,840
No, just your socks

9
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,140
Not your shorts

10
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,100
Tee

11
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,880
I'm not Tee

12
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Au

13
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,590
Can you come out here?

14
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,180
To be honest

15
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,240
I don't want to be near you anymore

16
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,780
Every time I get close to you

17
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,240
I get you into troubles

18
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,640
I always thought you belonged with me

19
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,380
although it's never been true

20
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,980
I'm feeling ashamed and don't know what to do when I'm with you now.

21
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,200
Feel free to hate me

22
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,220
But you're my friend, Au

23
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,600
Do you still think I'm your friend?

24
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,880
You're best friend

25
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,200
and you will always be

26
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,280
Thanks

27
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Mork

28
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,080
You won't tell anyone my secret, right?

29
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,640
I will spread it on any social medias. Be prepared.

30
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,640
Are you serious?

31
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,120
You're so naive

32
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,640
I was just kidding

33
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,840
Easy Easy

34
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,960
Thank you so much

35
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,180
Just smile. We're cool now.

36
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,260
Let's go. We don't want to miss the fun Chemistry class

37
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,120
Hmmm you...

38
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
What?

39
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,200
You don't have to walk us to the school

40
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
No, I won't

41
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,140
We will meet with you at your barber shop after school

42
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,300
And I will help find a new school for you

43
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,440
I know you will miss us

44
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,140
No new school

45
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,900
I think you should, for your future

46
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Nope

47
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,180
I won't have to because the principal told me I was able to keep studying at our school

48
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,060
For real?

49
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,940
I'm going to the class you guys now

50
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,580
So you're no longer expelled?

51
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,020
Yes

52
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,560
So you will be with us?

53
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,040
Yep

54
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm so glad

55
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,920
You're a bad student. Always cut the classes

56
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,560
See you guys later

57
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,600
Do you like this bad boy?

58
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,900
Any plans this evening?

59
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,140
No plans

60
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,600
Can I book you?

61
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,300
Tell me what you want to do first?

62
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,100
Help me study

63
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,060
Seriously?

64
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,820
Will Teacher Tee be kind to me?

65
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,320
At your house?

66
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,660
No No

67
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,680
Yours is better

68
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,160
Let's go now

69
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,290
Calm down. Go to the class first

70
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,980
No need to go to class. I will tutor you myself

71
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,940
You're scaring me now

72
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Let's go to the class

73
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,900
Do you like this version of me?

74
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,120
Let's go to the class. We're late now.

75
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,420
Welcome back to the school. Student Nueamork.

76
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,440
Thanks

77
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
I have to thank you.

78
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,760
Thank you. You have been protecting me all along

79
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,980
It's what I'm supposed to do

80
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,380
Let’s do this one.

81
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,880
Sure, it’s so easy.

82
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
Wrong answer.

83
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,680
Come on.

84
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,080
Here’s the correct answer

85
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,160
Let’s do this one next.

86
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,320
I’ll get this one right for sure.

87
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,240
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock

88
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,820
Also wrong

89
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,940
I’m not done yet

90
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Here it is.

91
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,460
Here.

92
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,080
Are you messing with me?

93
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,600
I am certainly not

94
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,080
You’ve got all 10.

95
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,080
That’s enough. Take them off.

96
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,280
Stay still. I’ll take them off for you.

97
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,700
Are you all right?

98
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,440
About what?

99
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,240
About you and Mork.

100
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,760
Aren’t you going to tell me?

101
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,800
There’s nothing to tell.

102
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,200
Come on.

103
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,500
Just kick the ball.

104
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,280
Hey, Ton and Au.

105
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,700
You’re kicking a ball now.

106
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,240
Are you done with the assignment?

107
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,580
What assignment?

108
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,580
The elective class

109
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,140
It’s due very soon.

110
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,580
Mr. Yothin’ class.

111
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,540
That’s right

112
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,340
Shit.

113
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,120
Have you not started it?

114
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,240
No.

115
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,740
Pick up the phone.

116
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Hello.

117
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,060
Mork.

118
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,920
What?

119
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,880
Elective Yothin.

120
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,780
Huh?

121
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Elective Yothin.

122
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,900
What’s that?

123
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,140
Mr. Yothin’s elective class

124
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,960
There’s a fieldwork due tomorrow

125
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,620
What are we going to do?

126
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,460
Yeah, what are we going to do?

127
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,840
What’s the problem?

128
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,460
Who are you with?

129
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,440
I’m with Tee. I have to go

130
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,620
What did he say?

131
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,460
Let’s talk more in Line chat.

132
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,200
Let’s go.

133
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,060
Was that Au?

134
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,600
Mmm… about the elective class.

135
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,000
We have a tourism assignment due in two days.

136
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,060
We don’t know what we’re going to do.

137
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,740
Let’s take a trip

138
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,900
A trip where? I have an assignment due soon

139
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,080
Let’s go and find out.

140
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,700
Morn,

141
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,100
wait!

142
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,380
Where are you going?

143
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,900
What?

144
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,240
Can I ask you not to go?

145
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,660
What?

146
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,280
I’m sorry.

147
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,880
You said a trip and you’ve taken me here?

148
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,620
I thought you meant in another province

149
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,060
The assignment is about tourism.

150
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,720
It doesn’t say that it needs to be somewhere far, though

151
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,260
We should tour around Bangkok.

152
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,680
Lots of cool places to see

153
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,660
especially here.

154
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,680
You’re the host. Be our tour guide

155
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,920
Of course

156
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,600
Let’s go.

157
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,620
Let’s go

158
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
Thanks.

159
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,560
Did you take that photo for your assignment?

160
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,280
Why didn’t you use this camera?

161
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,880
No, I took it for myself.

162
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,820
Do you have anything else to say?

163
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,460
I just want to thank you for today

164
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,960
You’re helping us with our assignment.

165
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,580
You must be exhausted.

166
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,000
I wanted to come here anyway.

167
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,820
You like to travel, huh?

168
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
I do.

169
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,000
I like you, too.

170
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
Anything I can do for you, I will.

171
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,920
If you smile, I want to smile with you

172
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,060
If you feel hot, I want to feel hot, too.

173
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,530
If you’re tired, I want to be tired with you.

174
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,640
I don’t want to be away from you

175
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,980
Promise me you will stay close to me no matter what happens.

176
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,320
Whoa, we have over 7,000 followers

177
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,700
Wow, awesome!

178
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,160
Let’s celebrate.

179
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,940
But we need 10,000 followers.

180
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,300
You’re right

181
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
I have an idea.

182
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,940
What?

183
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,180
Here, this is for increasing the number of followers.

184
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,860
You two must wear these.

185
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,780
Are you sure this will work?

186
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,940
Hai! Welcome to Bangkok.

187
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,260
Thief! Mom, I have to go.

188
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,820
Au, where are you?

189
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,960
My camera got stolen.

190
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,460
I couldn’t catch him.

191
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,260
Hurry here.

192
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
Yes.

193
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,260
Happy, birthday, Morn

194
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,380
So bummed.

195
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,040
Someone reached out to you.

196
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,140
They wanted you to promote their shop.

197
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,060
You’re kidding me.

198
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,580
This is real. Good money, too

199
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,680
Au, his boyfriend is rich. He won’t go

200
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,700
Jerk!

201
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,440
Let’s eat

202
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,240
What’s up, Mama?

203
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,600
I’m having dinner with friends. I’ll call you back.

204
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,540
I’m going to the toilet. I’ll be back

205
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,560
Is that our camera?

206
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,360
Let me take back my bag.

207
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,180
Now I’m relieved.

208
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,100
Let’s eat.

209
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,940
The toilet is too far.

210
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,480
Where’s the bag?

211
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,260
Let’s go

212
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,480
Not too tough, eh?

213
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,900
Let him go.

214
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,360
I got my camera back.

215
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,320
Here, cherish it.

216
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,940
I see that you’re so bummed out earlier

217
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,080
Give it a little kiss

218
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,940
Here’s the noodles.

219
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,800
Let’s eat.

220
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Yes, I’m starving.

221
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Move.

222
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,140
Fine, I won’t sleep here

223
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,620
Where will you sleep then?

224
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,740
It’s my business.

225
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,460
Where did you go? You got home late

226
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,940
I played football. I was stressed out

227
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,820
What else do you want to ask?

228
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,100
I know I did you wrong.

229
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,420
But I don’t want you to be mad at me today

230
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Why?

231
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,060
Today is a special day.

232
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,160
Happy Birthday, Morn.

233
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,300
You asked me if there’s anything real

234
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,780
What’s real comes after you open my present

235
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,180
I think I’m ready for you to know how I feel

236
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,620
I want to talk to you more, get to know you more,

237
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,360
become closer so that no one else can come between us.

238
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,880
But it takes time.

239
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,040
It’s fine. When you’re ready, you can say hi to me then

240
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,820
I can wait.

241
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,900
Happy Birthday, Morn.

242
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,440
Thank Muadmoo for bringing you to this world

243
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,540
Don’t you want to hurry home?

244
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,440
Aren’t your parents calling to get you home?

245
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,700
I don’t know. I turned off my phone.

246
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,800
Tee!

247
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,000
How can I go back now?

248
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,780
I have more places that I want to take you

249
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,660
Where?

250
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
You’ll find out soon.

251
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,260
You had the energy to come here

252
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,080
When I’m here, I feel energized

253
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,400
We’ve been walking everywhere today

254
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,660
You must be tired. I’m sorry

255
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,020
Not at all. It was fun.

256
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,580
Let’s come back again.

257
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,660
Sure but next time it will have to be for leisure only

258
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,340
not work.

259
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,060
Sure, can you wait a second?

260
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,360
I’m going to the bathroom.

261
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,160
What does this mean?

262
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,820
Ha ha ha!

263
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,440
What did I do wrong? I’m sorry.

264
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,480
What was that?

265
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,100
What does this mean?

266
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Ha ha ha!

267
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,820
What are you laughing at?

268
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,600
The god is laughing.

269
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,800
Ask the god.

270
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,700
Don’t ask me. I don’t know

271
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,040
Ha ha ha,

272
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,120
why were you laughing? I’m confused

273
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,800
Do you really want to know what it means?

274
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,760
To be honest, I don’t want to now

275
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,880
Why?

276
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,540
I don’t need a divine answer to know I’m feeling happy.

277
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,660
Wow!

278
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,620
If you think I’m mean now,

279
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,860
know that I can be even more so

280
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,900
Grandma.

281
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,720
Sawasdee krap.

282
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,980
Tee, you’re home.

283
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,540
You’re still up

284
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,880
I’m working on this garment

285
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,380
Mork is staying over with me tonight

286
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,740
Have you had dinner?

287
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,060
I’ve brought you some snacks.

288
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,580
Oh, very nice.

289
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,660
He picked it himself.

290
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,940
It looks delicious. Let’s eat it together.

291
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,420
Give me a hug.

292
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,140
I’ve been out all day.

293
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Hope you don’t mind if I smell funny.

294
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,450
Why is he the only one getting a hug?

295
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,920
What about me?

296
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,960
Come on. Get here then

297
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,000
I love you both.

298
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,860
Let’s eat the snacks.

299
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,180
I’ll put it in a bowl.

300
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,960
Tee,

301
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,100
when did you come home?

302
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,780
If you got here a while ago, why didn’t you take a shower?

303
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,520
Don’t hug Grandma when you’re all sweaty and dirty

304
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,840
Tee, before you take a shower, come talk to me in my room

305
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Yes.

306
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,180
Can you teach me how to sow?

307
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,420
Sure.

308
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:52,460
I’ve been sowing since I was a young girl.

309
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,540
I thought we talked through this stuff

310
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,580
I don’t think we ever talked

311
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,400
You just told me to do this and that

312
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,860
And did you do any of the things I told you?

313
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,780
Everything I told you or cautioned you…

314
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,520
it comes from a good place.

315
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,840
I’ve been there.

316
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,620
I’ve seen how this kind of relationship will end

317
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,180
Tee, if the love is good,

318
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,220
it won’t come back and hurt you

319
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,140
Like your love that is hurting me now?

320
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,280
Tee.

321
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,440
It’s true. You said you loved me

322
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
but you won’t let me be happy.

323
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,380
Who do you love really? Me or yourself?

324
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,520
Tee, be quiet

325
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,560
So beautiful.

326
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,720
I’ve loved crafts since I was a student.

327
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,720
It’s not hard. I can teach you if you’re keen.

328
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Mork.

329
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,860
Don’t you want to go home?

330
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,560
It’s getting late. Your family may be worried.

331
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,760
Umm…yes, I am going.

332
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,640
Please tell Tee that I’m leaving.

333
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,860
How are you getting there?

334
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,400
By bus.

335
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,920
I’ll give you a lift.

336
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
Let’s go.

337
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,380
Sawasdee krap.

338
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,500
God bless.

339
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,820
If you think I’m mean now,

340
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,500
know that I can be even more so

341
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,380
From now on, if I see you with Mork,

342
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,800
I will unfix what I’ve fixed with the school Director

343
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,060
I think you know what that means.

344
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,000
If you want Mork to continue in this school,

345
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,260
stay away from him.

346
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,040
Ma!

347
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,980
It’s better that way.

348
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,720
When you continue with your higher education,

349
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,540
you will be apart anyway.

350
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,920
You don’t have to tell him about your study.

351
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,000
Rak Num Nueb

352
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,520
Why are you taking me to the gym storage room

353
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,900
in the middle of the night?

354
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,260
I forgot something in my locker.

355
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,260
You could just come alone.

356
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,920
I’m scared.

357
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,800
Don’t you think I am, too?

358
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,760
I am scared of ghosts,

359
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,440
especially in the gym. So scary

360
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,960
I’ve got chills down my spine.

361
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,820
Sorry.

362
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,260
You did that on purpose.

363
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,220
I didn’t.

364
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,500
What’s up with the ghost in the gym?

365
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,100
Tell me more

366
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Sit down.

367
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,100
Here it goes.

368
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,340
They say there is a lady

369
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,020
with a long hair

370
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,640
sitting in the gym.

371
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,860
They say this is where she died

372
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,660
She died here?

373
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,020
Yes.

374
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,300
How did she die?

375
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,820
How would I know? I wasn’t there when she died.

376
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,820
Don’t be a smartass

377
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,580
Is that a lady ghost?

378
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,620
I don’t know.

379
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,280
Let me check it out.

380
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,540
Don’t go. No.

381
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,900
I have to see.

382
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,820
It’s okay. Give me the flashlight

383
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
Mork.

384
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,120
I’ll be back soon. Just close your eyes.

385
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,940
But she may appear anyway

386
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,340
Open your eyes.

387
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,420
Happy Birthday!

388
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,520
Mork.

389
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,720
Yes, today is my birthday.

390
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,700
You picked the worst place.

391
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,180
The storage room in the gym?

392
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,080
I even bought this lion suit.

393
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,300
Isn’t it cute?

394
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,940
It is.

395
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,480
You have to tear it open for me

396
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,580
Sure

397
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,620
Why here?

398
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,420
I know that you’re scared of the gym ghost

399
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,640
So, I made a plan with the janitor.

400
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,420
I organized everything.

401
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,160
We’re eating the ice-cream with the lights on.

402
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,640
Are they okay with it?

403
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,900
It’s fine.

404
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,480
I bought the ice-cream beforehand.

405
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,140
I wired electricity from in front of the gym.

406
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,120
You really prepared for this thing

407
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,380
Thank you.

408
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,980
I’m so happy.

409
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,620
Cheers.

410
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,120
Are you scared?

411
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,900
I’m not. Ghosts are not real.

412
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,180
The plug may be loose.

413
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,640
I’m not either

414
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,300
What are you shouting about?

415
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,220
It may be hard at first.

416
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,600
But don’t rush it. Live your life as normal

417
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,440
If you can’t forget, don’t.
