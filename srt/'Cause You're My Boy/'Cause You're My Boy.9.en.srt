1
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,540
With this violation of the code,

2
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,480
we must follow the school’s regulations

3
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,380
I hope you understand that the school has tried

4
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,420
to give him opportunities to redeem himself.

5
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,160
I think another school may suit you better

6
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,560
It may help you change for the better

7
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,340
It will definitely remove a cancerous cell from this school

8
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,900
leaving only good ones.

9
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,060
I’m sorry to inform you that you will have to find a new school

10
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,020
How did it go?

11
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,840
What did they do to you?

12
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,880
Tell what they did to you.

13
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,920
Are you all right?

14
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,100
If I am, will you be happy?

15
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,620
Mmm.

16
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,820
Then, I did the right thing.

17
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,140
It’s okay. Keep calm. Things will work out.

18
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,060
It’s okay. We’ll get through this.

19
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,360
The truth has come out.

20
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,480
Look at this. Your followers have reduced to this.

21
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,940
What?

22
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,600
So few.

23
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,660
How are you?

24
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,360
I’m bummed.

25
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,020
Fight on. Don’t give up.

26
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,620
Hey, my followers went from 100,000 to 20,000

27
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,260
I can only hope to get them back.

28
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,120
Someone must have sabotaged me or reported me

29
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,360
It wouldn’t have been like this otherwise

30
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,160
What would I do if I have only one follower left?

31
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,880
Who’s that one remaining follower?

32
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,800
I don’t know.

33
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
Take it easy.

34
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,900
Having no customers will stress Dad out.

35
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,000
We can help each other out.

36
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,820
How?

37
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,840
I’ll tell you later.

38
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,140
Let’s go.

39
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Gord, wait.

40
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
What?

41
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,580
I know you are the ‘Friend’.

42
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,420
Having so much fun, aren’t you?

43
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,460
Don’t you find it funny

44
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,660
that I have to pose as someone else to talk to you?

45
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,860
You don’t have to say anything.

46
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,220
I know.

47
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,060
Who are you really?

48
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,180
The closer we are, the less I seem to know you.

49
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,140
I am your friend

50
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,000
Are you?

51
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,860
Can I talk to the same old Gord?

52
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,180
Just for 5 seconds?

53
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,820
Which Gord do you want to talk to?

54
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,420
The one who lent you the phone is me.

55
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,840
The one who bought you the IG followers is me.

56
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,260
The one who bought you the likes and comments is me

57
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,560
The one who asked his fan club to be your fan club is me.

58
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,700
The one who talked to you on Twitter is also me

59
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,320
Which one do you want to talk to now?

60
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,980
Do you think that I’m okay with you going behind my back like this?

61
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,320
Is there any truth to our friendship?

62
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,940
I can’t take it.

63
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,740
Which floor?

64
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,440
Same floor.

65
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,220
Tee! Why…

66
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,240
Tee.

67
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,300
Tee.

68
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,120
Tee, talk to me.

69
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,300
Can you hear me?

70
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,100
Tee, get up and talk to me.

71
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,960
Tee, can you hear me?

72
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,020
You’re here.

73
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,200
What’s wrong with our son?

74
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,000
He’s fine. You can go now.

75
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,320
I brought food. Let’s eat together.

76
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,220
What have I done to deserve this?

77
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,380
Mei, don’t pick a fight now.

78
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,580
He’s sleeping. Why don’t we eat?

79
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,740
Why am I in this mess?

80
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,300
What bad karma have I done to deserve a son who acts this way?

81
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,740
Stop talking about karma!

82
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,160
It has happened. Karma’s got nothing to do with this

83
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,800
Can’t you see? You’re selfish.

84
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,720
You blame others but not yourself.

85
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,580
My son turning out this way

86
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,020
being with a boy instead of a girl that he can start a normal family with

87
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,360
do you know who is to blame?

88
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,320
You! He got this from you!

89
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,980
I’ve told you many times, Mei. You’re wrong.

90
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,980
I am not gay.

91
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,200
Stop it! I believe what I saw.

92
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,200
And I saw you and…

93
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,920
Get out!

94
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,200
Tee.

95
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
I escaped to get away from all this

96
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,860
but you brought it here anyway.

97
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,700
Tee.

98
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,600
I will run as far as I can from you!

99
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,720
Tee! Listen to me

100
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,280
Tee!

101
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,160
Calm down, Mei.

102
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,140
Calm down.

103
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,720
Calm down, Mei.

104
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,260
Calm down.

105
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,740
My son turning out this way,

106
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,260
being with a boy instead of a girl that he can start a normal family with,

107
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,760
So, any mistakes made shouldn’t be repeated

108
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,480
If it looks like it may happen again,

109
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,040
we should nip it in the bud

110
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,880
at least for now.

111
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,660
Please try to forget about Tee

112
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,640
and stay away from him for a while.

113
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,480
If you still love him, you can talk to me then.

114
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,380
It will prove how true is your love for him.

115
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,540
Are you going to jump into the river?

116
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,860
Do you remember what I said?

117
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,340
Often times when I’m among a crowd,

118
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,340
I feel myself disappearing.

119
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,840
Go home.

120
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:37,060
When you see something, it all depends on your viewpoint

121
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,660
From this viewpoint, do you like it?

122
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,520
If you don’t, move it.

123
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,880
I told you to go home

124
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,820
Do you still like this viewpoint?

125
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,840
I said go home.

126
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,940
I don’t want to hear this anymore.

127
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,340
If you don’t want to see something

128
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,060
you can change your viewpoint

129
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,820
or close your eyes.

130
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,000
When you turn back,

131
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,260
you will always see me right beside you.

132
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,700
In this small world

133
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,200
when you can’t see anyone,

134
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
there’s still hope

135
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,940
because I will always be with you.

136
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,320
Whenever you go, I go.

137
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,180
Stop with your complicated talk

138
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,200
Take 3 steps backward.

139
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,240
You can do it.

140
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Can’t you see?

141
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,760
You do a simple thing and my world gets bigger.

142
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,480
Stop fooling yourself.

143
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,700
Give up your hope

144
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,840
I’m done.

145
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,300
Try and think about other people for once.

146
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,460
It’s not only you and me in this world.

147
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,540
You have your mama.

148
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,520
I have my dad and brother. That’s already a heavy burden

149
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,680
I can’t even get myself together.

150
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,980
I will only drag you down with me.

151
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,980
Do you understand? No one can help me.

152
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,780
Everything is messed up

153
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,720
There’s no hope, no worth

154
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,340
Stop putting more burden on me.

155
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,140
Go home.

156
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,880
What are you doing? Don’t come near me

157
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,440
Don’t come closer.

158
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,000
Leave me alone.

159
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,860
You and I can’t be together.

160
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,400
Hey, Mork.

161
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,580
Where have you been?

162
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,020
Want some of this?

163
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,400
Take it easy! Slow down!

164
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,020
Muadmoo DVD

165
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,120
Bam, where is Au?

166
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,900
I should be asking you.

167
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,080
What is up with you and P’ Au?

168
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,460
Hey, you. Can I borrow your phone to call my family?

169
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
Sure.

170
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,200
Can I have it?

171
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,260
Whoa! Easy, Man.

172
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,120
Can I have it?

173
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,960
I’m begging you.

174
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,040
I asked nicely and you wouldn’t give

175
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,040
Bastard! Go away!

176
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Mork,

177
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,580
you’re all right.

178
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,040
Don’t be scared.

179
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Let’s go.

180
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,440
Let’s pay respect.

181
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,740
What is this for?

182
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,280
Moon blocks for divine answers.

183
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,440
What did you ask?

184
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,260
Do you love me?

185
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,940
If you love me,

186
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,900
I’m not scared of anything.

187
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,220
Mork, we’re home.

188
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,720
I’ll introduce you to the driver, P’ Lek.

189
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,340
He always flirts with Mama.

190
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
I have to go.

191
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,240
Mork!

192
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,580
Where are you going?

193
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,520
My family must be worried. They’re waiting for me

194
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,800
Not just yet. I brought you all the way here.

195
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Let’s go.

196
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,340
Why would you come to a guy’s house in the middle of the night?

197
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,960
If you get lonely, press 0 and call me.

198
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
Sawasdee krap

199
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Sawasdee.

200
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,600
No need to ‘wai’ him.

201
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,500
This is P’ Lek, the driver.

202
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,580
Driver my ass.

203
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,820
I’ll tell your mom.

204
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,500
Such a snitch. No game.

205
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,160
I’m his dad.

206
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,020
Don’t listen to him. You’ll get a headache for nothing.

207
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,760
Just knowing that he has a friend makes me happy.

208
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,420
Dad? Ask Grandma if anyone in this house

209
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,200
accepts you as a family member.

210
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,500
But he might.

211
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,560
Do you?

212
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,280
Is Mama upstairs?

213
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,880
She’s not home yet.

214
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,740
You should call her.

215
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,200
She’s out looking for him

216
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,240
I told her not to but she wouldn’t listen

217
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,220
I said, ‘if you take his wife home, he’ll be home.’

218
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,760
Where is Tongpeng?

219
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,420
Have you been taking care of him?

220
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,460
He must be in the back

221
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,920
Will your friend be scared?

222
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,120
Don’t be scared. He’s friendly.

223
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,580
Who says I’m scared?

224
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,380
Try this.

225
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,800
When an adult gives you something,

226
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,120
you have to take it.

227
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,820
I’m not joking. It’s yummy.

228
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,340
I eat this often.

229
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh? Eat some more then

230
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,240
I’ll be back.

231
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,540
You’ve woken up so early.

232
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,680
Woken up? I haven’t slept.

233
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,520
Serving this house is so exhausting.

234
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,180
Can I have some?

235
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
What about you?

236
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,940
What is your relationship with him?

237
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,760
I’m his friend.

238
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,420
We speak frankly in this house.

239
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,620
Whatever you are to him,

240
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,740
tell him to come home.

241
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,220
Grandma cannot eat or sleep.

242
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,140
They spoiled him so much.

243
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,020
No wonder he grew up to be a brat.

244
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,960
What are you talking about?

245
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,220
Nothing.

246
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
Right?

247
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,420
Let’s go, Mork.

248
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,700
Wait, can I have a word with you?

249
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,660
A serious talk

250
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,960
Why would you come to a guy’s house in the middle of the night?

251
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,040
I’m also a guy.

252
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,300
That’s true

253
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,980
But wait.

254
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,720
If you get lonely, press 0 and call me.

255
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Sure.

256
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,120
Mork,

257
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,960
Mork, take a shower.

258
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,520
I’ve turned on hot water for you.

259
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,060
Why are you still awake?

260
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
Tee.

261
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Mmm?

262
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,620
I have something to confess

263
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,120
I may have slept with someone.

264
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,540
I am not sure.

265
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,160
I think it happened.

266
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,080
If you are …

267
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,720
breaking up…

268
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,320
No,

269
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,560
stop talking

270
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,920
Go to sleep.

271
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,660
Mork, drink some milk.

272
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,580
Good stuff.

273
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:03,400
I’ve been giving Tee milk every day since he’s little

274
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Thank you.

275
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,700
I will bring you a wonton soup.

276
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,580
Here. Enjoy your meal.

277
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,120
Thank you.

278
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,080
Get comfortable and make yourself at home.

279
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,360
I’m going to continue with my chore.

280
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,480
May I answer your phone, please.

281
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,900
Grandma, is Mork downstairs having breakfast?

282
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,500
Does he say it’s yummy?

283
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,980
It is.

284
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,260
Oh, it’s you.

285
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,920
Have you eaten?

286
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,360
. Where are you?

287
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,460
Come down already. I miss you.

288
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,800
You miss me? Come to the rooftop then.

289
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,320
There is a rooftop

290
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,440
Okay. I’ll be there.

291
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,400
Thank you, Grandma.

292
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,740
Come here.

293
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,060
What are you doing?

294
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,700
Next in the queue

295
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
I’m not your dog.

296
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,380
Hold this.

297
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,740
This one is called Chiaohua.

298
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,840
Huh?

299
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,180
Chiaohua.

300
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,820
Chiao what?

301
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,980
This is Luengchang.

302
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,860
And this is Tongpeng.

303
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,960
I’m going to test you.

304
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,080
What is his name?

305
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,120
I can’t. Chinese names are hard to remember

306
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,500
I can take a guess.

307
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,820
This one is Chiaohua.

308
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,440
What about this one?

309
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,620
How about this? Chee Chiaohua [Pee that barely misses the head]

310
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,300
Chee Luengchang [Light yellow pee].

311
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,160
Chee Tongpeng [Pee straight

312
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,540
Where is he? Don’t bark.

313
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,700
How did you figure it out?

314
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,020
Do you know who named them?

315
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,060
Who else?

316
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,160
Papa named all three of them.

317
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,160
He loves them very much

318
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Papa is P’ Lek?

319
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,160
Tee, I have something to tell you.

320
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,860
I’ve noticed it a long time and I want to tell you.

321
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,300
You’re a tease.

322
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,160
I meant the veggies.

323
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,360
Their leaves are big.

324
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,980
Did Grandma grow them herself?

325
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,160
I think she’s awesome. Very healthy.

326
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,280
That’s how rich people are I guess.

327
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,500
Go and suck up to Grandma.

328
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,640
I will wash the dogs and myself.

329
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,840
Then, we go to school together

330
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,800
Is sucking up necessary?

331
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,740
It’s nice to approach those in power

332
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,000
Grandma is the power in this house

333
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,860
Don’t pay attention to Mama.

334
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,260
Who cares what she says?

335
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,500
I helped Grandma grow basil over there.

336
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,880
Really?

337
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,180
Come and help me eat it.

338
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,840
I don’t want it to get old and die first

339
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,680
Sure, I will help you.

340
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,660
Mork, drink milk

341
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,520
Today I have something special for you.

342
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,120
Look, I made these myself.

343
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,840
These cookies are handmade by me.

344
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,160
Thank you.

345
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,660
Go ahead.

346
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,560
How is it?

347
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,760
It’s so delicious.

348
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,660
Eat them all.

349
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,580
Can I bring them home?

350
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,660
I want my brother to have them, too

351
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,860
I’ve never tasted anything this yummy

352
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,100
That’s all right

353
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,060
If you like them, eat them all

354
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,980
I can bring more cookies for you

355
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,300
Thank you very much.

356
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,220
I’ll be back.

357
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,000
Here, this is for your brother.

358
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
Thank you.

359
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,740
Eat these first.

360
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,140
Yes, mam.

361
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,220
I have to excuse myself.

362
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,860
Are you leaving?

363
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,680
Aren’t you going to wait for Tee?

364
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,040
Umm…

365
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,720
Mork, get in. I’ll give you a lift.

366
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,640
Sawasdee krap.

367
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,540
Are you ready to go to school?

368
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,920
I’m sorry for what I said yesterday

369
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,580
I may have been too harsh.

370
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:01,500
If you want to come back, I’ll give you another chance

371
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,400
Hey, Ton. Where are you going?

372
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,680
To see Au

373
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,280
Let me come with you

374
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,280
Au, did anything happen between us?

375
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,560
Are you okay?

376
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,280
With what?

377
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,940
With the thing between you and Mork.

378
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,660
Stay still. I’ll take it out for you.
