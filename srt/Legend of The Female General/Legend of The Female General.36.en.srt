00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,990
It is

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,110
the war drums being beaten.

25
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,830
Commander.

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,950
Crisis at the border.

27
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,390
Wutuo attacks Mingshui

28
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,789
and Huayuan simultaneously.

29
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,470
No time to waste. Go to the palace now.

30
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,790
(Longtai Hall)

31
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,910
Wutuo actually broke the peace treaty

32
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,190
and invaded us again.

33
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,190
That's so unscrupulous!

34
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,910
Xiao Jue.

35
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,510
You lead troops to Mingshui.

36
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,670
This time, we must teach Wutuo a lesson

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,510
and ensure
they never dare invade us again.

38
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,750
As you command.

39
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,510
He Yan.

40
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,150
I order you to lead the Fuyue Army

41
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,230
and defend Rundu with Li Kuang

42
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,030
to guard against Wutuo's raids.

43
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,990
Your Majesty.

44
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,150
There's no battle in Rundu.

45
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,550
Yet Wutuo's forces

46
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,990
are approaching Huayuan.

47
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,030
It's threatening.

48
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,310
There's no current conflict,

49
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,829
but Wutuo is full of tricks.

50
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,310
We must be alert.

51
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,790
As for Huayuan,

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,510
I've sent Yan He there,

53
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,470
with Chu Zhao as military supervisor

54
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,710
to assist.

55
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,230
Yes, understood.

56
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,110
His Majesty wants me to guard Rundu,

57
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,390
but Li Kuang is there.

58
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,590
Why send me too?

59
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,030
In my opinion,

60
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,790
His Majesty still distrusts us.

61
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,150
An emperor's balance of power
is an age-old strategy.

62
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,790
But there's wisdom

63
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,350
in this arrangement.

64
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,350
Rundu lies between Huayuan and Mingshui.

65
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,470
It allows quick support to both cities.

66
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,150
Promise me

67
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,829
you'll return safely.

68
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,670
Take Wang Ba's team

69
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,350
to Rundu with you.

70
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,070
There's no battle there.

71
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,670
Keep them with you.

72
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,550
I have Feinu and Shen Han.

73
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,990
With them guarding you,

74
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,150
I'll feel assured.

75
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,550
Okay.

76
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,110
Miss He.

77
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,670
Congratulations.
You've won imperial favor

78
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,230
and secured the supervisor position.

79
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,350
A little tiger is roaring.

80
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,870
A little tiger is roaring.

81
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,670
A little tiger is roaring.

82
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,550
What's wrong?

83
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,790
The baby kicked me.

84
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,830
Behave yourself,

85
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,710
or I'll punish you when I return.

86
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,350
Don't threaten our baby.

87
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,950
Yan He.

88
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,910
This time,

89
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,110
let me go with you.

90
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,990
I went along with troops before.

91
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,550
This is different!

92
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,470
You're pregnant now.

93
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,390
The due date is still weeks away.

94
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,630
Besides,

95
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,430
as a general's wife,

96
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,830
I can endure hardships.

97
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,030
Fine.

98
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,310
I'll stay by your side

99
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,790
and see the birth of our baby.

100
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,590
I'll be the best father in the capital.

101
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,680
(Xiao Mansion)

102
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,380
(Xiao Mansion)

103
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,390
You guys

104
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,990
focus on the war.

105
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,350
My wife and I will handle home affairs.

106
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,870
Miss He.

107
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,030
May you return safely.

108
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,930
(Xiao Mansion)

109
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,320
(Rundu City)

110
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,630
General He, time to eat.

111
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,910
General He.

112
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,430
I heard you returned
to write battle reports.

113
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,070
Haven't started yet?

114
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,030
Nothing to report.

115
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,750
Wutuo forces

116
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,310
continue assaults on Huayuan

117
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,510
and Mingshui,

118
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,390
while Rundu remains peaceful.

119
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:19,990
General.

120
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,870
General! Emergency!

121
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,710
New battle report.

122
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,110
Wutuo sent reinforcements

123
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,030
to attack Huayuan.

124
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,390
General Yan has fought nonstop
for two days.

125
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,950
- Mai.
- Yes.

126
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,909
You go tell Li Kuang

127
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,309
that I'll leave 5,000 soldiers

128
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,309
to defend the city.

129
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,990
The rest will reinforce Huayuan with me.

130
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,510
- Yes.
- Yes.

131
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,600
(He)

132
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,790
I heard you all rushed here

133
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,790
from Rundu

134
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,590
and repelled enemies with Yan He.

135
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,510
I've prepared a banquet

136
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,990
to honor your victory.

137
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,550
- Great.
- Great.

138
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,110
- Great.
- Great.

139
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,070
Xiu, I'm back.

140
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,030
He has returned.

141
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,790
Madam.

142
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,830
What's wrong?

143
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,230
Careful, Madam.

144
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,070
What's happening?

145
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,670
Someone!

146
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,870
Madam is going into labor.

147
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,030
Someone!

148
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,310
- General Yan!
- General!

149
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,350
- General!
- General Yan!

150
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,310
Medic!

151
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,270
Medic!

152
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,270
Medic!

153
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,470
Don't.

154
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,470
Don't tell Xiu.

155
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,470
She's pregnant.

156
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,230
Don't alarm her.

157
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,550
Hang in there!

158
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,030
The medic is coming.

159
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,390
Promise me.

160
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,030
Xiu.

161
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,710
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,830
Take a deep breath and push!

163
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,950
Deep breath, Madam.

164
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,830
Keep pushing!

165
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,670
Push harder!

166
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,110
Push! Keep pushing!

167
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,950
Breathe in.

168
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,350
Breathe in.

169
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,390
Breathe in.

170
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,510
Madam.

171
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,710
Y-Yan He...

172
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,950
Push, Madam!

173
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,150
Push! Hold your breath!

174
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,070
Hold it! Keep holding!

175
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,030
Hold your breath!

176
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,870
Almost done!

177
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,950
Yan He

178
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,950
is still mopping up remaining enemies
behind the lines.

179
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,550
He'll return later.

180
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,390
Push harder, Madam!

181
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,630
Hold your breath and push!

182
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,470
That's it!

183
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,710
Hold and push!

184
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,030
It's born!

185
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,870
Madam!

186
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,150
Congratulations!

187
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,430
It's a girl!

188
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,310
She's born, Madam!

189
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,950
She's beautiful!

190
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,150
Careful.

191
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,510
It's Muxia.

192
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,350
Muxia?

193
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,470
Yan He chose this name.

194
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,430
Liangjiang for a boy,

195
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,790
Muxia for a girl.

196
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,190
Muxia,

197
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,590
your father is a great hero.

198
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,550
Muxia, you will grow up

199
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,830
to carry on your father's legacy.

200
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,870
Muxia

201
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,590
will become

202
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,830
a good general

203
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,870
like her father.

204
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,190
So adorable.

205
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,270
Muxia.

206
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,110
Muxia.

207
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,040
(Yan)

208
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,590
Are Mrs. Yan and the child safe?

209
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,350
Safe?

210
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,630
Yes,

211
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,030
they're safe.

212
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,150
But the child lost her father at birth.

213
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,790
Father and daughter

214
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,190
never even met.

215
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,790
This battle could have ended sooner

216
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,230
with fewer casualties.

217
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,670
All because of your loyal advice,

218
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,870
His Majesty

219
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,230
feared our concentrated military power,

220
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,870
ordering me

221
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,350
to station the Fuyue Army in Rundu,

222
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,150
scattering our forces.

223
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,230
So, we couldn't deliver
a decisive blow to Wutuo.

224
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,190
Is this the outcome

225
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,070
you wanted,

226
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,830
Mr. Chu?

227
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,950
You don't deserve to get wasted.

228
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,990
Stay sober and atone for this.

229
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,070
This is

230
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,710
to honor the fallen soldiers.

231
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,590
(Zilan, you're smart and diligent.)

232
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,190
You will earn scholarly honors.

233
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,390
When you grow up,

234
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,790
you'll become a good
and respectable official.

235
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,990
(Then no one will
dare bully you anymore.)

236
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,550
Mother.

237
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,950
Don't cry, Zilan.

238
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,790
I'm just tired.

239
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,270
My poor son.

240
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,590
(Mother, I'll take you away
from the Chu family.)

241
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,950
We don't have to endure their insult.

242
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,390
Mother.

243
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,110
Mother!

244
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,550
(I only fear)

245
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,710
you'll end up alone.

246
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,350
From now on,

247
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,550
stop pushing yourself so hard.

248
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,150
Spare yourself.

and ministers had been united,

with generals defending Wei,

I was wrong.

276
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,830
It's Mingshui.

277
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,310
After losing in Huayuan,

278
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,870
Wutuo sent more troops to Mingshui.

279
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,390
Their troops from Huayuan

280
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,870
are already advancing there.

281
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,150
The Xiao Army can't

282
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,190
resist much longer with weak forces.

283
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,390
We must reinforce them!

284
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,830
Mr. Jiang, you stay here.

285
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,350

286

Vice Director of the Secretariat,

337
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,830
prioritized personal desires

338
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,150
and sowed discord repeatedly,

339
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,790
making the military strength divided,

340
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,550
allowing Wutuo's invasion.

341
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,310
War reignited,

342
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,070
causing immense suffering.

343
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,990
He is hereby dismissed

344
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,830
and exiled to the borderlands

345
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,710
and will never return.

346
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,830
By Imperial Decree.

347
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,830
Thanks for your hard work.

348
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,270
Rise, please.

349
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,710
Thank you.

350
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,710
Your Majesty.

351
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,870
Amidst urgent warfare,

352
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,750
I prioritized military necessity,

353
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,990
leaving Rundu

354
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,110
without permission.

355
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,350
This defied imperial orders.

356
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,870
I deserve punishment.

357
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,790
Your Majesty.

358
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,550
General Feihong
contributed to the victory.

359
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,750
She committed no crime.

360
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,310
Good judgment.

361
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,670
Xiao Jue, you also

362
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,870
contributed to the victory.

363
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,070
Rewards for you both

364
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,630
have been sent to your mansions.

365
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,790
Well,

366
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,590
you may leave.

367
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

368
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,590
Yan He.

369
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,630
Actually,

370
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,590
when I married you,

371
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,070
I knew

372
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,830
this day might come.

373
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,430
But I never expected

374
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,670
that it'd happen so soon.

375
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,790
But don't worry.

376
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,390
Since I've married you,

377
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,950
I'll never regret it.

378
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,950
No matter how difficult,

379
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,230
I'll live on resolutely

380
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,270
and raise our child well.

381
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,150

382
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,550
Muxia.

383
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,430
May you grow up healthy.

384
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,950
Your father

385
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,350
will surely watch over you.

386
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,270
Careful!

387
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,270
Slow down!

388
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,190
Soldiers fight on the battlefield

389
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,350
for this peaceful life.

390
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,230
If Yan He

391
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,310
could see this,

392
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,350
he might rest in peace.

393
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,510
Sadly,

394
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,110
he and Chengxiu

395
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,110
are already separated by death.

396
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,750
Huaijin,

397
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,430
we promised each other

398
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:30,990
to face the future

399
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,870
and cherish every single day.

400
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,390
Even if eventually...

401
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,830
Even if one of us dies in battle,

402
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,710
the other one must keep living
courageously

403
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,030
to see our nation's splendor and peace.

(General Feihong's Mansion)

405
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,750
This road feels too short.

406
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,030
If only we could walk longer together.

407
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,390
We have time.

408
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,590
I'll always stay with you.

409
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,550
We live together when we're alive.

410
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,190
After death, we'll be

411
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,750
buried together.

412
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,270
I'll give you a spot beside me.

413
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,710
Who asked you to do that?

414
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,390
I'm the renowned General Feihong!

415
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,270
Well,

416
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,710

417
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,710

Excuse me,

420
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,630
if I may interject?

421
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,030
Stop talking

422
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,150
about the spot.

423
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,830
An imperial edict arrived.

424
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,790
Come and take it.

432
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,430
I hereby grant you marriage.

433

May you two stay together happily

434
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,110
and guard borders and people together.

435
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,230
