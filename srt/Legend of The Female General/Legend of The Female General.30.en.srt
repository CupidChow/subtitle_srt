=Episode 30=

23
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:45,816
Your Majesty is merciful

24
00:01:46,057 --> 00:01:49,417
and forgives their deception.

25
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:52,096
Yet General Fengyun,

26
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:54,417
as military commander,

27
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,096
deceived us all

28
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:58,657
for personal reasons.

29
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:01,456
It may

30
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:03,217
disappoint the troops.

31
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:12,097
Your Majesty.

32
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:13,496
That makes sense.

33
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:14,760
Moreover,

34
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:17,257
Attendant Wu'an is a woman.

35
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,417
Her presence in military camps
is inappropriate.

36
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:21,776
If soldiers start

37
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:22,736
following this example

38
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:24,776
and hide women in camp,

39
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:27,176
military order will be ruined.

40
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:28,817
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:30,336
Though I have personal motives,

42
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:31,697
I'm not keeping a lover.

43
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:33,577
I know He Yan's capabilities.

44
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:34,776
After deliberation,

45
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:36,257
I enlisted her in the army.

46
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,137
She stayed in Yezhou Garrison

47
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:39,896
after rigorous evaluations.

48
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:41,336
Her current achievements

49
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:42,817
are evident to all.

50
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,257
As Commander of Yezhou Garrison,

51
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,616
whether she passed tests

52
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:46,977
or earned military merits

53
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:48,697
was all under your authority.

54
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:50,824
Miss Xu.

55
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,072
Before His Majesty,

56
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:53,496
mind your manners.

57
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:56,808
Attendant Wu'an

58
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,776
fought against Rida Muzi of Liehe tribe

59
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:00,857
and killed Wutuo's general Huyate.

60
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:03,216
She also helped lift the siege of Rundu.

61
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:04,456
These accomplishments

62
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:05,656
were witnessed by all.

63
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:07,776
It can't be fabricated.

64
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:17,544
Your Majesty.

65
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:19,336
Miss Xu was wrong.

66
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:20,817
I passed my evaluations

67
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:21,697
and earned

68
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:23,496
my military merits publicly

69
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:25,257
in real combat.

70
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:26,736
My comrades in Yezhou Garrison

71
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:28,216
and buddies in Rundu

72
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:29,896
can all vouch for me.

73
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:33,697
Regarding the military order mentioned

74
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:34,824
by Chancellor Xu...

75
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:37,000
Your Majesty,

76
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,137
though I'm a woman,

77
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:41,417
I have aspirations to protect our nation

78
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:43,257
and serve Your Majesty.

79
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,697
Fortunately, I possess some skills

80
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:48,017
and opportunities to fulfill my wish.

81
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:49,320
Your Majesty.

82
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:51,056
I firmly believe

83
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,297
that one's virtue and capability

84
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:55,336
shouldn't be judged

85
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,744
by gender.

86
00:03:57,297 --> 00:03:58,216
Women

87
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:00,017
with genuine talent

88
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:01,176
deserve opportunities

89
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:02,817
to serve Wei.

90
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:14,017
Your Majesty.

91
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:14,977
Soldiers follow rules.

92
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:16,617
So do women.

93
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:18,536
Attendant Wu'an eloped with a man.

94
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:19,497
It's inappropriate

95
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,257
and damages social morals.

96
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:22,976
She is virtueless.

97
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:24,416
No matter how capable she is,

98
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:26,336
she doesn't deserve
to serve in the army.

99
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:28,216
Mr. Wei is mistaken.

100
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:30,177
Your Majesty.

101
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:31,017
I

102
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,776
never eloped with He Yan.

103
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:47,216
I respect her,

104
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:48,872
value her,

105
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,776
and won't let anyone

106
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,296
slander her.

107
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,096
She graces my view,

108
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:02,856
occupies my mind,

109
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:04,936
and claims my heart.

110
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:13,536
Well said. "My view, my mind,

111
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:15,497
and my heart."

112
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:17,497
I can't believe a straight man

113
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:18,497
like you

114
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:21,617
can be so affectionate.

115
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:25,256
Empress.

116
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:26,656
You are

117
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:28,697
a paragon of virtue for all women.

118
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:30,377
What's your judgment

119
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:31,817
of Attendant Wu'an's virtue?

120
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:35,336
Common soldiers are plentiful,

121
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:37,017
but good generals are rare.

122
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,416
Attendant Wu'an serves Wei

123
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:40,617
and defends our territory.

124
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:41,817
She's loyal to the nation.

125
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:44,536
If we constrain her
with conventional rules

126
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,656
for women,

127
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,976
our nation will

128
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:49,976
lose a brilliant soldier.

129
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:52,697
Thus, I believe

130
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:54,737
Attendant Wu'an
has committed no offense.

131
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:56,737
On the contrary, she is meritorious.

132
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:00,536
That makes sense.

133
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:02,497
The Empress is from a military family.

134
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,937
When I led the expedition years ago,

135
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:07,336
she not only accompanied me,

136
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:09,577
but also fought alongside me
on the battlefield.

137
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:12,096
Attendant Wu'an
follows the Empress's example

138
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:13,296
by serving in the army.

139
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:15,336
That's a good thing for Wei.

140
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:17,800
Attendant Wu'an.

141
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:18,817
I think

142
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:19,817
you deserve to

143
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:20,856
be promoted.

144
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:21,776
Therefore,

145
00:06:21,776 --> 00:06:23,257
I'll bestow upon you a marquis title.

146
00:06:23,577 --> 00:06:24,456
Starting today,

147
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:25,672
you are

148
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:27,776
Marquis Wu'an.

149
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,377
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

150
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:40,896
Your Majesty is wise.

151
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:45,776
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

152
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:00,096
Who would have thought

153
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,416
Attendant Wu'an was a woman?

154
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:02,697
She's now Marquis Wu'an.

155
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:03,856
I never expected

156
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,096
that General Feihong

157
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:06,336
would lose to a woman.

158
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:07,776
It was humiliating.

159
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,536
General.

160
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:12,424
General.

161
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:15,137
I lost because of my existing injuries

162
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:17,336
that gave her the advantage.

163
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:18,920
Of course.

164
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:28,017
Let's go.

165
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:28,872
Let's go.

166
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:35,848
Commander.

167
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:37,377
Did I embarrass you today?

168
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:39,592
Absolutely not.

169
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:42,017
You are...

170
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:43,048
I am

171
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:44,737
your view,

172
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:46,456
your mind,

173
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:48,008
and your heart.

174
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:08,177
Why are you here?

175
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,617
Why aren't you

176
00:08:09,737 --> 00:08:10,664
chasing after He Yan?

177
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:12,520
Pingting.

178
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:14,017
Don't be mad.

179
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:15,096
Don't try to fool me.

180
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:16,216
I saw it clearly.

181
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:19,416
Chu Zhao,

182
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,697
since you're with me,

183
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:21,577
you can't

184
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:22,568
like other women.

185
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:24,216
I'm very possessive towards you.

186
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:25,976
I'll never permit my husband

187
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:27,336
to keep concubines.

188
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:28,488
You misunderstand me.

189
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:29,776
I've long suspected

190
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:30,696
He Yan's gender.

191
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:31,816
I planned to figure it out

192
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:32,857
and then impeach Xiao Jue.

193
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,080
Really?

194
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:36,737
Of course.

195
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:38,816
Then why

196
00:08:39,097 --> 00:08:40,457
didn't you speak for me?

197
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:41,696
Instead, you defended her!

198
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:42,896
Pingting.

199
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:43,816
As an official,

200
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:45,097
openly speaking for you

201
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:46,296
would make it worse.

202
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,137
His Majesty would grow suspicious,

203
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:49,737
suspecting my motives

204
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,977
and even Chancellor Xu.

205
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:53,176
He might think the Chancellor sent you

206
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,056
to deliberately target Xiao Jue
and He Yan

207
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:56,337
to eliminate rivals.

208
00:08:58,176 --> 00:08:59,457
I see.

209
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:01,936
I made a mistake

210
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:03,896
and ruined your plan.

211
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:05,656
You haven't ruined anything.

212
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:07,097
I should thank you.

213
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:09,217
Thank heavens

214
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:10,337
you exposed it publicly.

215
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:11,857
Had I blindly reported it

216
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:13,617
to His Majesty,

217
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:15,457
I'd be facing punishment now.

218
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:18,632
By the way,

219
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:20,337
how did you

220
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:21,936
discover Attendant Wu'an

221
00:09:22,056 --> 00:09:23,144
is a woman?

222
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:25,448
Come on.

223
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:32,536
Because I

224
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:34,536
saw the painting in your study.

225
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:38,377
You won't blame me, right?

226
00:09:40,977 --> 00:09:41,936
How could I blame you?

227
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:44,737
But based on a painting,

228
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:45,737
you accused He Yan

229
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:46,936
before His Majesty.

230
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:48,137
That was risky.

231
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,617
If Attendant Wu'an were a man,

232
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,857
wouldn't you

233
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:52,776
face punishment?

234
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:54,497
Don't worry.

235
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:56,497
I did that with complete certainty.

236
00:09:58,977 --> 00:09:59,896
Fine. I'll tell you.

237
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:03,296
He Rufei told me

238
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:04,488
that He Yan is a woman.

239
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,137
So your plan

240
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,416
was to challenge He Rufei

241
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:21,536
publicly?

242
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:23,208
Exactly.

243
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,097
The valiant General Feihong

244
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,097
couldn't even defeat

245
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:27,377
a novice like Attendant Wu'an.

246
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:29,377
The competition

247
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,416
not only humiliated He Rufei,

248
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,416
but also made His Majesty and officials

249
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:34,656
grow suspicious.

250
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:36,416
But today,

251
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,416
it was truly perilous.

252
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:40,840
Huaijin,

253
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:42,217
thank you

254
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:44,137
for telling His Majesty earlier

255
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,017
that I am a woman.

256
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:47,217
Otherwise,

257
00:10:47,217 --> 00:10:48,097
I'd be in trouble.

258
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:49,776
Xu Pingting

259
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,536
only met you once,

260
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:53,617
yet she was certain in court

261
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:55,576
that you're a woman.

262
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:57,896
Someone must be behind this.

263
00:10:59,497 --> 00:11:00,457
Who else could it be

264
00:11:01,056 --> 00:11:02,056
besides He Rufei?

265
00:11:02,857 --> 00:11:04,176
But I heard Xu Jingfu

266
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,097
dotes on Xu Pingting, his only daughter.

267
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:07,776
He actually

268
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:09,217
used Xu Pingting.

269
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,257
He's in big trouble.

270
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:13,096
Chancellor.

271
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:15,576
This was all premeditated.

272
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:17,536
She wanted to humiliate me

273
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,017
in public.

274
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:20,696
This is revenge!

275
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:22,137
Chancellor.

276
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:23,056
We can't just...

277
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:24,816
Can't what?

278
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:28,776
He Rufei,

279
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:30,857
my daughter Pingting

280
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:33,257
never pays attention to state affairs.

281
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:34,857
How did she know

282
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:36,457
He Yan is female?

283
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,536
You used her.

284
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,656
How dare you!

285
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:46,936
Forgive me, Chancellor.

286
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:47,816
I made a mistake.

287
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:49,416
I only wanted His Majesty

288
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:50,816
to punish them for deception,

289
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:52,337
ruining His Majesty's trust.

290
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:53,536
Then,

291
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:54,377
we'll be safe.

292
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,857
Why didn't you

293
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:58,217
expose He Yan yourself?

294
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:03,017
I've told you.

295
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,857
We should make our decisions together.

296
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,457
Seems I'm too old

297
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:13,457
and I've lost my authority.

298
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,257
Since you have your own plans,

299
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:19,377
why should I work with you?

300
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:21,640
Chancellor.

301
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:23,097
Chancellor.

302
00:12:23,097 --> 00:12:23,977
I made a mistake.

303
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:24,896
Forgive me, Chancellor.

304
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:26,176
Don't abandon me.

305
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:27,457
Should I help you?

306
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:29,977
I told you to wait,

307
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:32,936
yet you stirred up things.

308
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:35,497
Now the entire court knows

309
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:37,656
she's a woman.

310
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:39,377
How could they not suspect?

311
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:41,337
With endless rumors,

312
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:43,696
if His Majesty

313
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:45,377
orders an investigation,

314
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:46,656
could your family

315
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:48,536
be tough enough

316
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:50,497
to endure an interrogation?

317
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:52,137
He Rufei.

318
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:54,737
It's not that I'm abandoning you.

319
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:58,137
The point is you're hopelessly foolish!

320
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:18,728
Yes.

321
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:19,977
None of my family

322
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:21,737
has any backbone.

323
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:25,176
We won't withstand the interrogation.

324
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:27,528
Chancellor Xu.

325
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:29,457
In desperate circumstances,

326
00:13:30,497 --> 00:13:32,737
I'll choose to die together.

327
00:13:34,257 --> 00:13:35,536
If I suffer,

328
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,776
you, the mastermind behind treason,

329
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,257
will suffer too.

330
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,217
Do you think

331
00:13:48,696 --> 00:13:51,296
anyone would believe a disloyal man
like you?

332
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:53,936
Verbal claims mean nothing.

333
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:55,536
But what if I reveal

334
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:58,337
your correspondence with Wutuo?

335
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:05,936
You actually deceived me

336
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:09,176
and didn't burn those letters!

337
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:11,944
Chancellor,

338
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:14,017
I know my abilities are limited,

339
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:15,816
and I am not

340
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:16,977
as ruthless as you.

341
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,408
Therefore,

342
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,576
I have to keep something

343
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:22,217
to protect myself.

344
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,377
Fine.

345
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:36,617
Young people always make mistakes.

346
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:38,017
He Rufei.

347
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,257
Pingting

348
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:42,257
is my only daughter.

349
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,536
If you use her

350
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:46,217
again,

351
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:50,017
I'll show no mercy.

352
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:51,977
I'll never

353
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:53,776
let it happen again.

354
00:14:56,056 --> 00:14:58,576
With current tensions high,

355
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:00,656
you must stay composed.

356
00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:02,344
I need time

357
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:04,337
to think about the remaining matters.

358
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,936
Once I devise a plan,

359
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:07,257
I'll let you know.

360
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:09,128
Yes.

361
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,017
As you command.

362
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:18,504
Anyway,

363
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:20,097
thank you.

364
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:21,928
He Yan.

365
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:23,144
From now on,

366
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:24,337
I will

367
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,337
deal with all your worries with you

368
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,168
and trust you

369
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:30,176
completely.

370
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:32,552
Okay.

371
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:33,896
It's a deal.

372
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:35,377
A high five?

373
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:37,800
Anyone watching might think

374
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,056
we'd become sworn siblings.

375
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:51,576
I didn't mean that.

376
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:54,280
Xiao Jue.

377
00:15:55,017 --> 00:15:56,337
I've liked you for a long time.

378
00:15:58,296 --> 00:15:59,400
Now,

379
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:00,377
I like you even more.

397
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:51,048
Yan.

398
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:52,816
When we heard news from the palace,

399
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:53,896
we were terrified.

400
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:55,896
We knew you were amazing,

401
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:57,217
but never imagined

402
00:16:57,457 --> 00:16:58,457
that even General Feihong

403
00:16:58,656 --> 00:16:59,617
wasn't your match.

404
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:01,737
Of course.

405
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:03,337
I'm the top one of Yezhou Garrison.

406
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:07,112
By the way, Miss Song,

407
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:08,816
Mrs. Xiao mentioned

408
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:10,017
that you just returned today

409
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:11,576
and came here without going home.

410
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,217
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

411
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:14,697
You should celebrate with family.

412
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:16,977
Are you facing difficulties?

413
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:18,376
Yan.

414
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:19,296
As you know,

415
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,816
we ran away to avoid marriage.

416
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,056
If we return home,

417
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:23,497
how will we explain to our parents?

418
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:25,616
Back then, you and Mr. Cheng decided

419
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:27,217
to cancel your engagement.

420
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:28,616
Now, it seems

421
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:30,257
you're getting married.

422
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:32,737
Who knows what he's thinking?

423
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:35,017
He's usually so eloquent,

424
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:37,096
but he avoids talking about marriage.

425
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:37,977
He might as well

426
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:38,897
marry his medical books

427
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:39,784
for all I care!

428
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:41,376
Enough of that.

429
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:42,457
He's ruining our mood.

430
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,752
Yan,

431
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,017
when will you

432
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:46,457
and Commander Xiao get married?

433
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:49,536
Preparations should start.

434
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:50,776
Six wedding rituals

435
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:51,657
must be observed.

436
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:53,296
Don't let Miss He be slighted.

437
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:54,696
Mrs. Xiao.

438
00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:56,168
We

439
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:57,697
haven't decided to get married yet.

440
00:17:58,136 --> 00:17:59,257
It's too early to prepare.

441
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:00,657
It's not too early.

442
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:02,257
There's so much to prepare.

443
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:03,657
I think we're pressed for time.

444
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,336
I never expected

445
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:07,017
that the accomplished Marquis Wu'an

446
00:18:07,096 --> 00:18:08,056
would be a woman.

447
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:10,257
This Huaijin.

448
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:11,897
I know it's serious business,

449
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:13,457
but he should've at least

450
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:14,457
told us

451
00:18:14,497 --> 00:18:15,464
about the girl he likes.

452
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,096
This is all I could prepare in time.

453
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,937
Later, we'll go to shops

454
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:21,296
to buy more stuff you prefer.

455
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:23,257
These are

456
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,536
all women's garments.

457
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:27,376
Taotao told me everything about you.

458
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,776
You've suffered a lot

459
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:29,977
to become what you are.

460
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:31,376
But after suffering

461
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,360
comes happiness.

462
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,296
Now,

463
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:34,897
as the marquis appointed by His Majesty,

464
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:36,417
you needn't wear men's clothes.

465
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:37,937
Time to wear women's clothes.

466
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:39,056
Exactly!

467
00:18:39,056 --> 00:18:40,616
We'll show everyone

468
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,177
how brilliant you are

469
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:43,417
as Marquis Wu'an.

470
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:44,657
This will

471
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:45,856
make all women proud.

472
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,056
Brother.

473
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,576
Why are you

474
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:56,520
joining them?

475
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:58,697
You kept such a huge secret,

476
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:00,096
yet I'm the one being scolded?

477
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:02,056
You brought that girl to your courtyard

478
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:03,336
upon entering the city.

479
00:19:03,816 --> 00:19:05,336
You could be careless before,

480
00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:06,897
but continuing like this

481
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:09,217
would show disrespect to Miss He.

482
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,536
Commander Xiao,

483
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:34,937
if you treat Yan poorly,

484
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:36,737
though I can't fight you,

485
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:38,657
I can poison you.

486
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:42,697
The court banquet is formal.

487
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:44,217
Let's relax and have

488
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:45,296
a Mid-Autumn dinner.

489
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,008
Under the full moon,

490
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:49,257
let's celebrate with liquor.

491
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:06,152
He Yan.

492
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:09,697
Even carefree souls

493
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:11,977
become restrained

494
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:14,497
before their beloved.

495
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:17,544
Really?

496
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,017
Why do I feel

497
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:20,657
you were quite bold back then?

498
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,457
You never knew

499
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:27,856
how nervous I was.

500
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,257
Are you nervous now?

501
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:34,457
You'll know later.

502
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:49,128
(Chu Mansion)

503
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:55,376
You don't have to watch lanterns

504
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:56,424
with Miss Xu.

505
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,737
Just make an excuse to decline.

506
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:01,977
Given Pingting's temperament,

507
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:04,376
if I don't say yes,

508
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,336
she'll make a scene.

509
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:08,856
The time isn't right yet

510
00:21:09,697 --> 00:21:11,056
to break with Chancellor Xu.

511
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,376
He Rufei actually dared

512
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:22,497
to use Xu Pingting.

513
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:24,177
He will definitely

514
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,288
rile Chancellor Xu.

515
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:27,096
He won't have a good end.

516
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:32,816
Finally, she no longer needs

517
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:33,697
to hide her gender.

518
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:35,856
Next, she will

519
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:39,536
reclaim her status as General Feihong.

520
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:51,758
Have the Chengs sent
the betrothal certificate?

521
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:53,056
Not yet.

522
00:21:53,056 --> 00:21:54,017
But don't worry.

523
00:21:54,017 --> 00:21:54,897
After your pride

524
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:55,856
was hurt that day,

525
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,744
the Master and Madam were heartbroken.

526
00:21:57,744 --> 00:21:58,824
They won't allow the Chengs

527
00:21:58,824 --> 00:22:00,136
to waste your prime years.

528
00:22:00,376 --> 00:22:01,576
They confront the Chengs

529
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:02,576
to cancel the betrothal.

530
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:05,136
They should have arrived by now.

531
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:06,576
My parents

532
00:22:07,816 --> 00:22:08,657
went to the Chengs'?

533
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,056
Miss.

534
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:15,257
Where are you going?

535
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:20,712
(Cheng Mansion)

536
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:32,217
To be honest,

537
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:33,776
I truly

538
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:34,897
like Taotao.

539
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:37,056
It's just a pity

540
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:39,776
that Lisu isn't fortunate enough
to marry her.

541
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:42,576
Children have their own happiness.

542
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:44,417
(Betrothal Certificate)

543
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:45,737
Lisu's betrothal certificate.

544
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:48,177
Today, we return it to your family.

545
00:22:48,897 --> 00:22:49,800
Mother.

546
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:53,257
Mr. Cheng, Mrs. Cheng.

547
00:22:53,816 --> 00:22:54,657
Father, Mother.

548
00:22:57,096 --> 00:22:58,056
Well...

549
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:04,072
Taotao.

550
00:23:04,657 --> 00:23:05,737
You want...

551
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:07,464
Father.

552
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:09,417
I'm having a headache.

553
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:10,816
Could you feel my pulse?

554
00:23:11,112 --> 00:23:12,017
Let...

555
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:12,937
Let me check for you.

556
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:17,017
Your pulse shows good health.

557
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,177
Just some liver heat imbalance.

558
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:21,497
Taotao is a physician herself.

559
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:23,497
- She knows she has a headache.
- No...

560
00:23:23,497 --> 00:23:25,296
Yet physicians can't treat themselves.

561
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:26,737
That's why she came to you.

562
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:28,177
Taotao.

563
00:23:28,177 --> 00:23:29,336
Your father misdiagnosed.

564
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:30,576
Since you're unwell,

565
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,056
you should return home to rest.

566
00:23:34,937 --> 00:23:35,944
See you.

567
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:37,064
Let's go.

568
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:38,017
Wait...

569
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,096
I...

570
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:40,296
With my years of experience,

571
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:41,977
how could I misdiagnose?

572
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:43,937
Song.

573
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,096
Wrong diagnosis, period.

574
00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:47,257
Why so chatty?

575
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:48,536
Exactly.

576
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:49,737
Hurry back and rest.

577
00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:51,376
I won't keep you any longer.

578
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:57,417
How is that possible?

579
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:06,017
(Cheng Mansion)

580
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:07,016
Careful.

581
00:24:09,776 --> 00:24:10,856
See?

582
00:24:10,937 --> 00:24:12,217
I told you she's not ill.

583
00:24:13,657 --> 00:24:15,536
Now I understand why Lisu and Taotao

584
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:17,616
haven't been together yet.

585
00:24:18,017 --> 00:24:18,920
Why?

586
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:21,737
Because of you.

587
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:24,217
What do I have to do with that?

588
00:24:24,776 --> 00:24:26,257
Taotao is your own daughter,

589
00:24:26,336 --> 00:24:27,856
inheriting your stubbornness.

590
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:29,937
Lisu is your disciple,

591
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,697
learning your stubbornness.

592
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,800
When stubbornness clashes,

593
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:35,257
they both get hurt.

594
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:36,177
I...

595
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:37,096
Well...

596
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:38,737
Wait...

597
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:40,217
What kind of reasoning is that?

598
00:24:46,937 --> 00:24:47,856
Xu Jingfu

599
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:50,096
didn't punish He Rufei.

600
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:51,976
This shows

601
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,336
He Rufei has something

602
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:55,177
incriminating against Xu Jingfu.

603
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:57,697
That's why Xu Jingfu feels threatened.

604
00:24:59,616 --> 00:25:00,536
But after this,

605
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:01,992
mistrust will grow

606
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:03,376
between them.

607
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:05,217
We'll have them sawing off

608
00:25:05,457 --> 00:25:06,697
the branch they're sitting on.

609
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,497
You seem to have a plan.

610
00:25:08,697 --> 00:25:09,736
How can I help?

611
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:11,017
I'm meeting someone.

612
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:16,424
Miss He.

613
00:25:16,697 --> 00:25:17,768
Commander Xiao.

614
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:18,856
Mr. Chu.

615
00:25:18,856 --> 00:25:19,720
Please sit.

616
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:23,656
Miss He.

617
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:24,897
On the Mid-Autumn Festival,

618
00:25:24,897 --> 00:25:26,136
Miss Xu was certain

619
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:27,176
that you were a woman

620
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:28,488
because...

621
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:31,136
Because I painted a portrait

622
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:33,056
of you in women's clothing,

623
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:34,457
and she saw it.

624
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:37,320
Anyway,

625
00:25:37,816 --> 00:25:39,096
it's my fault.

626
00:25:39,616 --> 00:25:40,697
I apologize.

627
00:25:40,937 --> 00:25:41,816
Please forgive me.

628
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:44,257
No need to apologize.

629
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:47,017
Actually,

630
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:48,136
He Rufei

631
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:50,257
is the true mastermind.

632
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:52,296
So, you knew too.

633
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:54,017
To prevent further issues,

634
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:55,417
I hope Mr. Chu

635
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:57,177
will properly keep that painting.

636
00:25:57,937 --> 00:25:59,096
If inconvenient,

637
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:00,616
I'll handle it.

638
00:26:04,056 --> 00:26:05,376
No need to trouble you.

639
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:09,737
Since it's my portrait,

640
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:11,576
I should

641
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:13,056
keep it.

642
00:26:14,257 --> 00:26:15,336
By the way,

643
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:16,536
congratulations, Miss He.

644
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,096
You can finally stop pretending
to be a man

645
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:21,177
and become a female marquise.

646
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,576
One day,

647
00:26:22,576 --> 00:26:23,657
you will

648
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:25,017
become a female general.

649
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:27,336
I appreciate your kind words.

650
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:28,872
In fact,

651
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:30,816
I invited you here today

652
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:32,576
because I have a request

653
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:34,336
to ask of you.

654
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:41,856
I won't help bad people.

655
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:44,056
But regarding your request,

656
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:45,737
I'm afraid I cannot help.

657
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:46,977
After all,

658
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:48,056
he's my mentor.

659
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:49,417
I cannot

660
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:50,977
betray my mentor.

661
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:53,896
Mr. Chu,

662
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:55,177
don't reject me at once.

663
00:26:55,737 --> 00:26:57,136
Let me share a story first.

664
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:10,457
He Rufei and I

665
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,177
are step-siblings, no blood relation.

666
00:27:16,872 --> 00:27:17,832
Back then,

667
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,096
he was frail and sickly,

668
00:27:19,616 --> 00:27:20,616
living at Yuhua Temple.

669
00:27:21,497 --> 00:27:22,816
I took over his identity.

670
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:25,737
That's my history

671
00:27:25,816 --> 00:27:26,737
with He Rufei.

672
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:28,897
Now that I've returned,

673
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:31,457
I will reclaim

674
00:27:31,497 --> 00:27:32,657
what belongs to me.

675
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:35,304
Miss He...

676
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:36,576
Mr. Chu,

677
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,897
I'm not telling you this

678
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,096
to seek your pity.

679
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:42,017
I want you to understand

680
00:27:42,697 --> 00:27:43,897
how the mentor you revere

681
00:27:44,536 --> 00:27:45,937
resorts to ruthless means.

682
00:27:46,376 --> 00:27:47,657
To eliminate dissidents,

683
00:27:48,576 --> 00:27:49,737
he colluded with enemies

684
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:51,816
and planned the Mingshui massacre.

685
00:27:52,977 --> 00:27:54,056
Not only that,

686
00:27:54,697 --> 00:27:56,017
to cover his crimes,

687
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,417
he repeatedly conspired with Wutuo,

688
00:27:59,056 --> 00:27:59,937
plunging Huayuan,

689
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:01,544
Rundu,

690
00:28:01,856 --> 00:28:02,888
and Jiyang

691
00:28:03,177 --> 00:28:04,177
into war.

692
00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:05,800
Now,

693
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:07,576
he can sacrifice lives

694
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:09,417
for personal gain.

695
00:28:10,177 --> 00:28:11,080
One day,

696
00:28:11,177 --> 00:28:12,576
he'll continue doing evil

697
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:14,376
to satisfy his desires.

698
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:16,904
Mr. Chu,

699
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,376
you claim officials

700
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:19,376
are helpless sometimes.

701
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:21,336
But since you serve the court,

702
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,497
shouldn't the nation come first?

703
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:27,336
You said you go

704
00:28:27,977 --> 00:28:29,336
with the flow.

705
00:28:30,697 --> 00:28:31,897
But have you considered

706
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:34,737
what kind of flow you go with?

707
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:38,952
Therefore,

708
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:40,497
I hope

709
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,576
you will help.

710
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:58,737
What's your next plan?

711
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:00,657
Just let me know

712
00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:02,497
if there's anything I can do.

713
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:11,697
He Rufei must possess

714
00:29:12,096 --> 00:29:13,536
evidence of Xu Jingfu's crimes.

715
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:15,528
And the evidence

716
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,217
is hidden in his house.

717
00:29:19,497 --> 00:29:20,657
I've been away for too long.

718
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:22,816
It's time to return home.

719
00:29:23,657 --> 00:29:25,697
But that's only part of the plan.

720
00:29:26,536 --> 00:29:27,496
I need both your help

721
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:29,776
with the rest.

722
00:29:37,017 --> 00:29:38,056
Congratulations.

723
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:39,177
You'll achieve your goal.

724
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:43,336
Chancellor Xu's power wanes.

725
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:45,376
Exposing his misdeeds

726
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:47,536
is already inevitable.

727
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:56,744
(General Feihong's Mansion)

728
00:29:58,977 --> 00:29:59,856
(I'm back.)

729
00:30:00,856 --> 00:30:01,937
(General Feihong's Mansion)
(Times have changed.)

730
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,217
(Things have changed.)

731
00:30:06,616 --> 00:30:08,136
(I once believed this was home.)

732
00:30:09,096 --> 00:30:10,096
(Yet it nearly)

733
00:30:10,096 --> 00:30:11,376
(became my burial ground.)

734
00:30:11,457 --> 00:30:12,897
(He Yan's true gender)

735
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:14,536
(must never be revealed.)

736
00:30:15,536 --> 00:30:16,392
(Otherwise,)

737
00:30:16,737 --> 00:30:17,776
(you two)

738
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:19,177
(will die without a proper grave.)

739
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:31,017
Madam,

740
00:30:31,017 --> 00:30:31,897
since you're here,

741
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,096
go and see Miss He.

742
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:35,112
Watch your words.

743
00:30:35,657 --> 00:30:37,017
There is only the Young Master.

744
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:39,016
The Young Lady...

745
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,737
is recuperating at Yuhua Temple.

746
00:30:58,136 --> 00:30:59,217
(In this house,)

747
00:30:59,937 --> 00:31:00,897
(the only person)

748
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:02,776
(I care about is my mother.)

749
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,336
(I wanted to see her, but didn't dare.)

750
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:08,552
(I wonder)

751
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,336
(how she's doing now.)

752
00:31:23,497 --> 00:31:24,584
He Yan?

753
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:26,376
She...

754
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:28,816
She actually came here herself.

755
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:31,417
Perfect timing.

756
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:32,977
Let me see

757
00:31:33,296 --> 00:31:34,856
what she

758
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,336
is up to.

759
00:31:41,787 --> 00:31:48,776
(General Feihong's Mansion)

760
00:31:56,096 --> 00:31:57,096
Seems like

761
00:31:57,576 --> 00:31:59,576
I really scared you badly.

762
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:01,704
Brother.

763
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:04,017
What brings you here,

764
00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:06,336
Marquis Wu'an?

765
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,257
Is General Feihong too frightened

766
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:10,376
to remember basic hospitality?

767
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:11,937
Aren't you going

768
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,737
to invite me in for tea?

769
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:18,344
Look.

770
00:32:18,457 --> 00:32:19,536
I come bearing no sword.

771
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:30,376
Please, Marquis Wu'an.

772
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,017
You're our honored guest.

773
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,457
(General Feihong's Mansion)
Please come in.

774
00:32:33,457 --> 00:32:34,417
Come in.

775
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:35,432
Okay.

776
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:45,544
(General Feihong's Mansion)

777
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:56,072
(Not tempted by praise)

778
00:32:57,928 --> 00:32:58,856
Chancellor.

779
00:32:58,856 --> 00:33:00,177
General Fengyun Xiao Jue is here.

780
00:33:00,443 --> 00:33:01,376
(Not tempted by praise,
nor cowed by slander)

781
00:33:01,376 --> 00:33:02,417
Let him in.

782
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:03,457
Yes.

783
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:20,336
General Fengyun,
this is a real honor, having you visit.

784
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:22,856
Forgive me for not welcoming you

785
00:33:23,457 --> 00:33:24,336
at the gate.

786
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:25,776
I apologize.

787
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:27,096
That's alright.

788
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:28,497
Please sit.

789
00:33:29,737 --> 00:33:30,824
Tea for our guest.

790
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:36,897
What brings you here

791
00:33:36,977 --> 00:33:38,296
today?

792
00:33:38,856 --> 00:33:40,017
I want to talk about He Rufei

793
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:42,657
with you.

794
00:33:45,177 --> 00:33:46,497
He Rufei?

795
00:33:50,616 --> 00:33:51,536
General Xiao,

796
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:54,017
you've come to the wrong person.

797
00:33:55,017 --> 00:33:57,536
I'm barely acquainted
with General Feihong.

798
00:33:57,697 --> 00:33:59,497
Nothing to talk about him.

799
00:34:04,497 --> 00:34:05,897
I heard

800
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:08,696
you and he studied together

801
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:12,417
in your youth.

802
00:34:12,857 --> 00:34:14,777
I think your connection

803
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:17,576
runs deeper than mine with him.

804
00:34:18,096 --> 00:34:20,136
I'm familiar with General Feihong,

805
00:34:20,736 --> 00:34:22,056
but He Rufei

806
00:34:23,176 --> 00:34:25,017
is the real General Feihong?

807
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:29,497
Your words puzzle me,

808
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:32,656
General Xiao.

809
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:33,800
Chancellor Xu,

810
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,576
stop pretending not to know.

811
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:39,256
He Rufei persuaded Chai Anxi

812
00:34:39,337 --> 00:34:41,337
to steal the Xiao Army's march map.

813
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,056
Colluding with Wutuo forces.

814
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:46,377
Suppressing my father's urgent missives.

815
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:48,897
Leading to Xiao Army's defeat
at Mingshui.

816
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:53,256
30,000 Xiao Army soldiers died.

817
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:55,696
He Rufei harmed He Yan

818
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:57,616
and pretended to be General Feihong.

819
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,297
To cover the truth,

820
00:34:59,857 --> 00:35:01,616
he repeatedly tried to kill He Yan

821
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:02,897
and got the Seven Tiger Generals

822
00:35:02,897 --> 00:35:04,056
killed in the Huayuan Battle

823
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:05,256
as part

824
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:07,417
of his deals with the Wutuo.

825
00:35:09,337 --> 00:35:11,096
He deliberately abandoned Rundu,

826
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:13,817
leaving it besieged

827
00:35:14,897 --> 00:35:16,216
and nearly conquered.

828
00:35:18,176 --> 00:35:19,457
What a shock!

829
00:35:20,616 --> 00:35:21,576
That is

830
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:23,377
outrageous!

831
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:26,176
He Rufei's guilt is undeniable.

832
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:27,560
However,

833
00:35:28,656 --> 00:35:30,377
he's merely a pawn

834
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:31,777
in someone else's game.

835
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,417
The real villain

836
00:35:36,937 --> 00:35:39,017
is the mastermind pulling the strings.

837
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:57,384
This is

838
00:35:58,096 --> 00:36:00,216
the tea you've liked since childhood.

839
00:36:01,017 --> 00:36:02,417
Does it not suit your taste?

840
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:04,296
No.

841
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:05,897
I just fear poison.

842
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:10,897
You tease me.

843
00:36:11,576 --> 00:36:12,552
Everyone, leave.

844
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:20,536
How guilty

845
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:22,297
you must be.

846
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:24,176
Dismissing them like this.

847
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:25,417
Shall we

848
00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:27,136
speak frankly?

849
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:31,464
Let me guess.

850
00:36:32,017 --> 00:36:33,176
Both of you

851
00:36:33,576 --> 00:36:34,696
must have regretted.

852
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:36,736
You regret

853
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:38,817
not having killed me.

854
00:36:40,256 --> 00:36:41,256
But I promise you.

855
00:36:41,777 --> 00:36:42,856
Very soon,

856
00:36:43,377 --> 00:36:44,897
you'll be more regretful.

857
00:36:49,096 --> 00:36:49,960
Rufei.

858
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:51,696
Don't think

859
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:53,536
becoming Marquis Wu'an

860
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:55,216
makes you invincible.

861
00:36:56,337 --> 00:36:57,977
I killed you once,

862
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,857
and I can kill you again.
