=Episode 9=

23
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:47,464
Mr. Chu.

24
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,904
Mr. Sun want to see
you in the reception hall.

25
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:55,425
Attend to your duties, Mr. Chu.

26
00:01:58,824 --> 00:01:59,785
Rest well.

27
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:29,704
Commander Xiao.

28
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:34,904
Mr. Sun.

29
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:38,385
Might I know why you're here?

30
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:40,425
This courtyard

31
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:41,784
is particularly elegant,

32
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:42,944
so I took a stroll.

33
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,425
But I lost my way.

34
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:46,585
I'm sorry

35
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,105
I haven't been a better host

36
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,105
and shown you

37
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:50,145
around the premises.

38
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:52,425
Since the sunshine today

39
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:56,425
is mild,

40
00:02:57,224 --> 00:02:59,464
shall we have tea in the pavilion?

41
00:03:00,944 --> 00:03:01,585
This way.

42
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:03,184
Have some tea.

43
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:04,105
Have some tea.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,472
Young Master.

45
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:07,784
The account records

46
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:09,184
are in Sun Ling's secret room.

47
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:10,265
Earlier,

48
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:11,784
I concealed myself and was waiting,

49
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:12,944
but observed

50
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,585
Xiao Jue stealthily entering the study.

51
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:25,425
Young Master,

52
00:03:26,385 --> 00:03:27,025
could he also be

53
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:28,064
after account records?

54
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:33,064
He couldn't have found

55
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:34,504
Sun Xiangfu's dealings

56
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:35,664
with Master.

57
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:38,280
He's likely
after Yezhou Garrison's tax ledgers.

58
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:40,265
But if he obtains them first,

59
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:41,385
we'll lose

60
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:42,105
the initiative.

61
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,184
Yingxiang,

62
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:45,944
watch

63
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:47,105
Xiao Jue's every move.

64
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:48,585
Yes.

65
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:11,945
Commander Xiao, have some tea.

66
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:15,945
This smells like

67
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:17,585
the Junshan Yinzhen tea.

68
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,625
Excellent quality indeed.

69
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:21,304
Mr. Sun,

70
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:23,745
your generosity knows no bounds.

71
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:27,904
A gift from my friend.

72
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:28,984
Otherwise,

73
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,585
with my meager official salary,

74
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,585
I couldn't afford such fine tea.

75
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:36,825
Knowing

76
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:38,065
our men in Yezhou Garrison

77
00:05:39,224 --> 00:05:40,745
still lack military pay,

78
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,464
I feel really uneasy

79
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:47,424
drinking such fine tea.

80
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:50,864
Commander Xiao,

81
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:52,825
your words ring true.

82
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:54,984
Military life is arduous.

83
00:05:55,544 --> 00:05:57,585
I share their hardships in spirit.

84
00:05:58,745 --> 00:06:01,424
But Yezhou suffers yearly calamities

85
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:02,945
and poor harvests,

86
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,385
making provisions and pay impossible.

87
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:06,825
Previously,

88
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:08,825
border trade supplemented our funds,

89
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:09,784
but now,

90
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,185
constant clashes with Wutuo

91
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,505
have halted all commerce.

92
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:13,864
Thus

93
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:15,145
revenues vanished.

94
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:16,104
No income means

95
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:17,265
people can't pay taxes.

96
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,065
Without taxes,

97
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:21,065
how can I procure military funds?

98
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:26,664
Forgive my frankness,

99
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:30,505
as Yezhou's magistrate,

100
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:32,304
when I think of soldiers

101
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:33,544
enduring hunger,

102
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:36,705
my heart aches.

103
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:38,464
If selling myself

104
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:40,544
could raise funds,

105
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:42,344
I'd gladly trade myself

106
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:43,224
for military funds

107
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:44,864
to support our troops.

108
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:52,464
Your words

109
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:54,344
are truly moving.

110
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:00,065
Were it not for our garrison

111
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:01,705
going unpaid for a long time,

112
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:04,065
I might believe what you said.

113
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:07,825
Master.

114
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:10,185
Mr. Chu has arrived at the hall.

115
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,185
Mr. Chu has arrived?

116
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:13,928
Yes.

117
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,585
Commander, should we...?

118
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:16,505
Perhaps...

119
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:17,864
Okay.

120
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,304
I understand your meaning.

121
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,945
Do as you please.

122
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,304
I'll return shortly.

123
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:55,705
Why does it hurt so much?

124
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:09,705
(This thing must be poisonous.)

125
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,065
(He hasn't gone far)

126
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:28,185
(and is still secretly watching me.)

127
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:30,344
(This poison...)

128
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:32,385
(He doesn't just want to kill me.)

129
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,265
(And Xiao Jue, too.)

130
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:47,345
What's up?

131
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:48,064
Let go.

132
00:08:48,424 --> 00:08:50,025
Someone placed a poisonous ball on me.

133
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:20,345
Another wasted effort.

134
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,184
Another wasted effort.

135
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:23,664
He...

136
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:30,584
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

137
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:31,865
What are you doing?

138
00:09:32,784 --> 00:09:33,465
Why not smile?

139
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:35,064
Why smile?

140
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:36,225
How can you smile?

141
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:37,064
Not smiling.

142
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:38,184
Not smiling? Why not?

143
00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:39,505
Why smile?

144
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,304
Get lost.

145
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:41,064
Get lost.

146
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:49,904
They fell into the water.

147
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:51,345
They'll wash up

148
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:52,625
thoroughly.

149
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:54,225
That scented ball became useless.

150
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:57,385
Falling into the water
right after we replaced

151
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:58,745
his scented ball.

152
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:01,345
This is too much of a coincidence.

153
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,265
He must be faking blindness.

154
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:08,184
That young man

155
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:09,824
is truly unnatural.

156
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:13,145
Slippery as a loach,

157
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:15,625
he's impossible to grasp.

158
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:36,784
My belt!

159
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,544
Belt! Where's my belt?

160
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:41,544
Where's my belt?

161
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:42,505
Belt.

162
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:44,625
Uncle!

163
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,505
I can't find my belt.

164
00:10:46,704 --> 00:10:48,145
Could you fetch it for me?

165
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,824
Here.

166
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:24,385
You're so good to me.

167
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:28,265
You called me uncle, after all.

168
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:30,664
Uncle,

169
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:33,064
what about my allowance?

170
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:34,424
Where is it?

171
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,625
It's not worth being your nephew.

172
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:53,145
You're unlucky to have

173
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:54,385
a heartless uncle.

174
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:55,944
Who said that?

175
00:11:56,304 --> 00:11:57,505
You're clearly warm-hearted

176
00:11:57,704 --> 00:11:58,345
and magnanimous.

177
00:11:58,664 --> 00:11:59,584
General Fengyun,

178
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:01,105
as good

179
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,505
as your reputation.

180
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:07,824
Earlier,

181
00:12:08,465 --> 00:12:10,184
you really went all out.

182
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:13,625
I couldn't let you get involved.

183
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:15,064
Fortunately,

184
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:16,064
that scented ball

185
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:17,145
is now useless.

186
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:20,944
There were many methods,

187
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:23,184
but you chose the most foolish one.

188
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:26,904
It indeed required suffering,

189
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:27,944
but

190
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:30,105
it was also undoubtedly the fastest way.

191
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:37,505
Cold?

192
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,304
Put on your clothes.

193
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:51,304
If you catch a cold,

194
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:52,985
I won't care.

195
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:10,625
Ding Yi

196
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:13,105
is clearly targeting Xiao Jue.

197
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:15,664
I'll investigate this thoroughly.

198
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:02,184
You want to kill Cheng Lisu,

199
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:03,985
but General Feihong

200
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:05,145
clearly ordered you to take

201
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:06,424
Xiao Jue's life.

202
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:09,304
He keeps sabotaging things.

203
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:10,784
Killing him

204
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,544
would eliminate

205
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:13,944
Xiao Jue's right-hand man.

206
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:15,824
Then

207
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:18,424
matters would become much simpler.

208
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:25,824
This isn't a bad approach.

209
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:30,145
I just worry that Xiao Jue...

210
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:36,784
(It was indeed He Rufei.)

211
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,225
(But why would He Rufei
want to kill Xiao Jue?)

212
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:01,704
Guards!

213
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:02,664
Assassin!

214
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:04,985
Assassin! Hurry!

215
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:06,824
Over here!

216
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,944
Hurry!

217
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:34,984
Hurry!

218
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:36,744
Over here.

219
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:38,024
Hurry.

220
00:15:57,544 --> 00:15:58,145
Go on.

221
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:02,280
This way.

222
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:03,528
Hurry.

223
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,145
(Hide in the Commander's room.)

224
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:28,184
(Why is he bathing at this moment?)

225
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:35,584
Did I enter the wrong room?

226
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,368
This...

227
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:44,944
Where am I?

228
00:16:44,944 --> 00:16:47,544
Take off your stealth outfit
before playing these tricks.

229
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:00,584
Commander Xiao? Are you sleeping?

230
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:20,705
Trespassing into my room.

231
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:22,384
Is this

232
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:24,705
how you treat your guests?

233
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:27,185
Sorry, Commander Xiao. A thief entered.

234
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,465
I feared it would disturb you,
so I came to investigate.

235
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:32,544
You should thoroughly

236
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:33,505
check every inch

237
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:36,225
of this room.

238
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:38,185
You are skilled in martial arts.

239
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:39,705
Why would you fear a thief?

240
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:41,864
But

241
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:44,185
Mr. Cheng lacks skills in martial arts.

242
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:45,745
When I visited his room,

243
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:47,544
he wasn't present.

244
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:51,905
My nephew

245
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:53,465
has a fondness

246
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:55,225
for the pastries
from Shiyunju in Yezhou,

247
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:57,304
so my man took him there.

248
00:17:58,505 --> 00:17:59,176
Is there

249
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:02,064
a problem with that?

250
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:04,745
My apologies.

251
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:30,344
Thank you.

252
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,824
It's lucky

253
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:34,025
that you bathe daily.

254
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:35,225
The servants

255
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:36,304
deliver water every day.

256
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:39,784
Why was Ding Yi after you?

257
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:42,505
Why were you wearing

258
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:44,225
a stealth outfit?

259
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:52,864
That black-clad figure earlier

260
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:54,985
was you, right?

261
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:58,465
Why ask questions

262
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:00,225
you know the answers to?

263
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:04,824
Why pretend to be blind?

264
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:08,624
Not pretending.

265
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:09,864
It's just

266
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:11,304
that I'm blessed,

267
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:12,624
so I can recover

268
00:19:12,624 --> 00:19:14,624
slightly faster than others.

269
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:17,144
Significantly faster.

270
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:21,185
But I was

271
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:22,344
truly blind

272
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:23,544
for your sake.

273
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:25,025
Don't be ungrateful.

274
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,225
He Yan.

275
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:33,945
Get out.

276
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:53,425
(Why would He Rufei send someone)

277
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,784
(to assassinate Xiao Jue?)

278
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:56,985
(What is he truly after?)

279
00:19:58,425 --> 00:19:59,025
(No.)

280
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:00,784
(I can't just wait.)

281
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:16,864
You want to kill Cheng Lisu,

282
00:20:17,745 --> 00:20:18,705
but General Feihong

283
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:19,784
clearly ordered you to take

284
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:21,144
Xiao Jue's life.

285
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:23,584
He keeps sabotaging things.

286
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:25,784
Killing him

287
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:27,104
would cut off

288
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,624
Xiao Jue's right-hand man.

289
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:29,985
Then

290
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,225
matters would become much simpler.

291
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:35,304
(Sun Xiangfu's servant)

292
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:37,384
(is actually He Rufei's man?)

293
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:39,864
(The delay in rescue at Mingshui,)

294
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:42,144
(the political betrayal in court,)

295
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:44,144
(and the assassination in Yezhou.)

296
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:46,624
(He Rufei,)

297
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:48,745
(in my memory,)

298
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:51,144
(you weren't this treacherous.)

299
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:54,144
(What corrupted you so?)

300
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:58,104
(Or did I misjudge you from the start?)

301
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:00,185
(Was this your true nature?)

302
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:02,025
(Besides,)

303
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:08,144
(what role)

304
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:11,225
(does she play in this?)

305
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:31,185
Young Master,

306
00:21:31,344 --> 00:21:32,344
someone was eavesdropping

307
00:21:32,344 --> 00:21:33,824
on Sun Xiangfu and Ding Yi's talk.

308
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:35,344
Ding Yi chased him

309
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:36,384
to Xiao Jue's room.

310
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:39,185
Xiao Jue happened
to be bathing at the time.

311
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:40,745
Perfect timing.

312
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:42,505
Yeah, perfect timing.

313
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:44,945
Xiao Jue must already know by now

314
00:21:45,144 --> 00:21:46,064
He Rufei sent Ding Yi

315
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:46,945
to kill him.

316
00:21:47,144 --> 00:21:48,104
Let him know.

317
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:49,665
After all, He Rufei

318
00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:50,864
is the one who did it.

319
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:55,185
Young Master,

320
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:56,705
you've been reading so long.

321
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:58,025
Have a rest

322
00:21:58,185 --> 00:21:58,945
and have some soup.

323
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,584
This goji and fish soup is
good for the eyes.

324
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:02,544
Alright.

325
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:24,864
Who's there?

326
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,265
Trying to act mysterious?

327
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,544
Today, I'll send you to the grave.

328
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,465
Let me be the one to send you off.

329
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:48,864
In your next life,

330
00:22:49,425 --> 00:22:51,584
don't collude with wicked people again.

331
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,945
(That voice belongs to Cheng Lisu.)

332
00:22:59,384 --> 00:22:59,985
What?

333
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:01,344
Can't you recognize me?

334
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:03,144
Who exactly are you?

335
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:10,025
You're not Cheng Lisu.

336
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,025
He has no martial skills.

337
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:13,185
Who do you think

338
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:14,425
I am?

339
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:16,745
No matter who you are,

340
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:18,505
today, you'll be killed.

341
00:23:54,304 --> 00:23:55,584
You've really chosen

342
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,784
a fine burial spot for yourself.

343
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:00,784
This place is used by the Sun family

344
00:24:00,985 --> 00:24:02,784
to suppress vengeful souls.

345
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:04,344
Each Buddha statue

346
00:24:04,665 --> 00:24:05,905
represents a vengeful soul.

347
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:07,344
Soon,

348
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:10,025
you'll become one of them,

349
00:24:10,864 --> 00:24:12,465
being trapped for eternity.

350
00:24:13,505 --> 00:24:14,945
I'm a vengeful ghost crawling out

351
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:16,104
from the Netherworld.

352
00:24:16,784 --> 00:24:18,104
I care nothing for reincarnation.

353
00:24:18,505 --> 00:24:19,304
Besides,

354
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:20,824
if I can come and go freely,

355
00:24:21,265 --> 00:24:22,665
these paper charms and clay statues

356
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:24,544
are just worthless objects.

357
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:26,384
They mean nothing.

358
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:30,985
Don't close it.

359
00:26:32,665 --> 00:26:34,064
Let me watch

360
00:26:34,584 --> 00:26:35,824
how this storm

361
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:36,945
will wash over the world.

362
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:41,544
Let's make Sun Mansion

363
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:42,665
descend into chaos.

364
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:45,064
The more chaos, the better for you.

365
00:26:45,945 --> 00:26:46,864
I wonder what role

366
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:48,905
Mr. He will play

367
00:26:49,665 --> 00:26:50,665
in this game.

368
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:02,985
Does your master He Rufei

369
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:05,945
know about your incompetence?

370
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:09,864
Ding Yi.

371
00:27:10,905 --> 00:27:12,265
I won't fall for

372
00:27:12,384 --> 00:27:13,304
the same person twice.

373
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:14,945
Today,

374
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:17,745
it's my turn to send you to the grave.

375
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,624
Let's see if you can earn rebirth.

376
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:23,544
Who exactly are you?

377
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:30,665
You once killed

378
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:32,824
a blind woman.

379
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:36,185
Who do you think I am?

380
00:27:37,384 --> 00:27:38,624
He Yan.

381
00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:42,064
But

382
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:43,784
if you tell me

383
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:46,505
why He Rufei wants Xiao Jue dead,

384
00:27:47,824 --> 00:27:49,465
I'll make your death quick.

385
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:52,705
Do you care about Xiao Jue that much?

386
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:55,344
We are companions

387
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:57,864
who've survived
life-and-death situations.

388
00:27:58,304 --> 00:27:59,225
Of course I care.

389
00:28:01,824 --> 00:28:02,945
Even if I die,

390
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:05,104
I'll never betray

391
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:05,945
my general.

392
00:28:10,025 --> 00:28:11,665
Since you won't talk,

393
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:13,784
go tell the God of Death.

394
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:20,784
I'm a ghost of the one you murdered.

395
00:28:21,745 --> 00:28:23,544
I clawed my way out of the Netherworld,

396
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:26,745
and came here to claim your life.

397
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:40,265
Who exactly are you?

398
00:28:48,104 --> 00:28:48,665
Commander.

399
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,384
What do you mean by that?

400
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:52,665
I have pretended
to be Cheng Lisu for a few days.

401
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:53,745
Don't you recognize me?

402
00:28:54,185 --> 00:28:55,144
I'm He Yan.

403
00:28:59,265 --> 00:29:00,265
What did you mean

404
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:02,784
by "I'm a ghost of the one

405
00:29:04,104 --> 00:29:05,064
you murdered"?

406
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:09,465
I was just trying to scare Ding Yi.

407
00:29:12,225 --> 00:29:13,584
Still refusing to tell the truth?

408
00:29:14,745 --> 00:29:15,745
Miss He.

409
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:20,905
You're clearly a woman,

410
00:29:21,985 --> 00:29:23,584
yet registered under a male identity

411
00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:25,705
to join Yezhou Garrison.

412
00:29:27,104 --> 00:29:28,265
May I ask you

413
00:29:28,864 --> 00:29:30,025
what your intentions are?

414
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:31,864
Commander.

415
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:33,505
When did you find out?

416
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:37,025
I thought

417
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:38,905
you were a spy sent by He Rufei.

418
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:42,624
But you just killed his man.

419
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:48,185
So why exactly

420
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,705
did you hide your identity
to join Yezhou Garrison?

421
00:29:53,144 --> 00:29:54,144
If you tell the truth,

422
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:56,624
I'll consider letting you
join the battalion.

423
00:29:57,304 --> 00:29:58,344
(A trap?)

424
00:29:58,705 --> 00:29:59,584
(I don't buy it.)

425
00:30:01,985 --> 00:30:02,505
Commander.

426
00:30:02,905 --> 00:30:03,745
Are you serious?

427
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:08,185
My registration

428
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,784
is true.

429
00:30:10,304 --> 00:30:11,185
But when my mother

430
00:30:11,985 --> 00:30:13,304
was pregnant with me,

431
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,025
she met a wise seer.

432
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:17,025
The seer said

433
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,064
if she bore a son,

434
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,144
he'd be a military prodigy.

435
00:30:21,624 --> 00:30:22,544
But if it were a girl,

436
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:24,705
she would die early.

437
00:30:25,505 --> 00:30:26,784
That's why since birth,

438
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:29,104
I've been raised as a boy.

439
00:30:29,465 --> 00:30:30,344
So the registry

440
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:32,104
listed me as male.

441
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:34,304
By that logic,

442
00:30:35,144 --> 00:30:35,945
the Fuyue Army moves

443
00:30:35,945 --> 00:30:37,945
you demonstrated while taming horses

444
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:39,985
were also taught to you

445
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:41,425
by this seer in your dreams?

446
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:44,505
Not exactly.

447
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:46,824
Living as a boy,

448
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:48,104
I naturally aspired

449
00:30:48,465 --> 00:30:49,544
to become a general

450
00:30:49,864 --> 00:30:50,745
and make my mark.

451
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:52,225
Just like you, Commander.

452
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:57,225
After joining the Fuyue Army,

453
00:30:57,824 --> 00:30:59,624
I achieved some success.

454
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,104
Unfortunately,

455
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:03,225
my squad leader discovered my identity.

456
00:31:03,624 --> 00:31:05,104
Luckily, he was kind

457
00:31:05,584 --> 00:31:06,864
and didn't expose me.

458
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:08,144
But

459
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:09,344
he feared implication,

460
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:10,705
so he made me

461
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,025
claim injury to retire

462
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:14,104
and return home.

463
00:31:18,722 --> 00:31:23,784
(Exsoldier in the Fuyue Army, He Yan
retired after injuries half a year ago.)

464
00:31:23,784 --> 00:31:25,225
(Thankfully, Master forged)

465
00:31:25,304 --> 00:31:26,304
(my registry thoroughly.)

466
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:30,185
Commander.

467
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,864
Well,

468
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:32,104
I've answered all.

469
00:31:32,344 --> 00:31:33,025
Don't you think

470
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:34,384
I'm now qualified

471
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,304
to join the battalion?

472
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:37,104
If your identity was exposed before,

473
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:38,985
why enlist again?

474
00:31:39,544 --> 00:31:40,784
What if the past repeats?

475
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:43,745
I want to be a general

476
00:31:44,824 --> 00:31:46,225
and protect my country.

477
00:31:46,945 --> 00:31:47,985
Moreover, I trust

478
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:48,824
the Xiao Army

479
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:50,945
won't dwell on trivialities,

480
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:52,824
but value true talent

481
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,225
and give me a fair chance.

482
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:13,905
Keep up.

483
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:16,265
The corpse...

484
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:17,824
Let Feinu handle it.

485
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:20,784
Commander.

486
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:22,384
Why walk so fast?

487
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:24,425
Waiting to get caught?

488
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:43,624
Commander.

489
00:32:44,584 --> 00:32:45,584
Help me apply medicine.

490
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:46,665
I can't reach it.

491
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:49,624
You're playing a man,

492
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:51,745
but not a real man.

493
00:32:53,344 --> 00:32:54,465
You're a noble man,

494
00:32:55,025 --> 00:32:56,384
so I trust you completely.

495
00:33:21,224 --> 00:33:21,745
Commander.

496
00:33:22,144 --> 00:33:23,225
Could you be gentler?

497
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:25,064
I'm made of flesh and blood.

498
00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:28,265
Now you feel pain?

499
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:29,985
Weren't you tough earlier?

500
00:33:31,624 --> 00:33:33,344
Different circumstances.

501
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:34,985
On the battlefield,

502
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:36,304
as a soldier,

503
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:37,624
even with my last breath,

504
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:39,144
I'd fight to the end.

505
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:40,864
Now, during peace,

506
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,544
I should properly recuperate.

507
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:46,064
Your reading paid off.

508
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:48,705
Though I'm a woman,

509
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:50,985
my military tactics and martial skills

510
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,025
rival any man's.

511
00:33:52,425 --> 00:33:53,265
I believe

512
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:54,864
you've witnessed it firsthand.

513
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:00,905
Why did you

514
00:34:01,985 --> 00:34:02,985
fight with

515
00:34:03,025 --> 00:34:03,624
He Rufei's man?

516
00:34:09,184 --> 00:34:11,104
It was all for you, Commander.

517
00:34:13,664 --> 00:34:14,345
For me?

518
00:34:15,825 --> 00:34:16,465
Exactly.

519
00:34:16,825 --> 00:34:18,224
I overheard someone plotting

520
00:34:18,505 --> 00:34:19,425
to kill you.

521
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:20,905
As your subordinate,

522
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:21,985
it's my duty

523
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,465
to eliminate all threats to you.

524
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:24,785
So I decided

525
00:34:24,865 --> 00:34:25,945
to investigate covertly.

526
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:27,744
But someone spotted me.

527
00:34:28,184 --> 00:34:29,985
He tried to silence me.

528
00:34:30,385 --> 00:34:31,345
Every strike was lethal.

529
00:34:31,664 --> 00:34:32,825
I couldn't hold back.

530
00:34:33,345 --> 00:34:34,025
After all,

531
00:34:34,385 --> 00:34:35,825
I need to keep myself alive

532
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:37,104
to serve you.

533
00:34:48,264 --> 00:34:49,184
Commander,

534
00:34:50,945 --> 00:34:51,905
do you still not believe

535
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:52,785
what I'm saying?

536
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:54,544
My loyalty to you

537
00:34:54,865 --> 00:34:56,025
is truer than gold.

538
00:34:56,624 --> 00:34:58,104
Every word comes from my heart.

539
00:34:58,664 --> 00:34:59,184
I swear it.

540
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:03,624
Stay still. I'm not done.

541
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:15,584
Commander,

542
00:35:16,785 --> 00:35:18,425
can I join the battalion now?

543
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:24,305
Why are you

544
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:26,905
so fixated on

545
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:29,624
joining the battalion?

546
00:35:43,985 --> 00:35:44,584
Obviously,

547
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:46,064
it's because I admire you.

548
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:48,144
I want to achieve greatness

549
00:35:48,865 --> 00:35:49,704
under your command.

550
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:51,025
Commander,

551
00:35:51,744 --> 00:35:53,025
everyone in your battalion

552
00:35:53,345 --> 00:35:54,064
earned their place

553
00:35:54,104 --> 00:35:55,104
through genuine skills.

554
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,305
You value merit above all.

555
00:35:57,985 --> 00:35:58,664
That's why

556
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:00,985
I sought to join your ranks,

557
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:02,465
to prove

558
00:36:02,945 --> 00:36:03,985
no matter one's status

559
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:05,345
or gender,

560
00:36:05,945 --> 00:36:07,184
anyone can achieve greatness

561
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:08,544
and serve the nation.

562
00:36:09,624 --> 00:36:10,305
Where there is

563
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:11,744
a will,

564
00:36:12,425 --> 00:36:13,264
there's a way.

565
00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:14,704
Someday,

566
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:17,025
I'll become a renowned general.

567
00:36:20,385 --> 00:36:21,224
Your speech

568
00:36:21,785 --> 00:36:22,905
was flawless

569
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:24,465
and quite convincing.

570
00:36:25,544 --> 00:36:26,280
But

571
00:36:27,544 --> 00:36:28,785
do you think I'll believe that?

572
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:30,624
If you don't tell the truth,

573
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:32,544
then leave Yezhou Garrison.

574
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:34,224
You can't go back

575
00:36:34,385 --> 00:36:35,385
on your word!

576
00:36:37,544 --> 00:36:38,624
If you're not honest,

577
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,785
don't demand honesty from others.

578
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:43,184
If you expel me,

579
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:44,104
you'll regret it.

580
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:45,785
Regret?

581
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:47,505
I admit

582
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:48,465
you have talent,

583
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:50,224
but the Nine Banners Battalion

584
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:52,345
is full of talented people.

585
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:55,104
I can't even stay

586
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:56,704
in Yezhou Garrison much longer.

587
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,064
In short,

588
00:36:59,064 --> 00:37:00,144
if you drive me away,

589
00:37:01,505 --> 00:37:02,264
I'll spread rumors

590
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:03,785
that you have a sweetheart.

591
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:06,544
After all,

592
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:08,264
everyone knows you avoid

593
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:09,584
romantic entanglements.

594
00:37:14,825 --> 00:37:17,104
Go ahead. Who'd believe such nonsense?

595
00:37:17,465 --> 00:37:18,425
Words aren't convincing,

596
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:20,144
but I have evidence.

597
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:21,905
Commander,

598
00:37:22,345 --> 00:37:23,505
I happen to know

599
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:25,584
you have a red mole

600
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,544
an inch above your waist.

601
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:29,704
Only an intimate partner

602
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:31,744
would know

603
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:33,224
such private details.

604
00:37:41,624 --> 00:37:42,664
Nonsense.

605
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:44,425
It's not nonsense.

606
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:47,505
Commander,

607
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:49,064
your looks are exceptional,

608
00:37:49,465 --> 00:37:51,144
and even that charming mole

609
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:53,264
is perfectly placed

610
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:54,825
and cute.

611
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:56,544
It makes people

612
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:58,144
hard to forget.

613
00:37:59,425 --> 00:38:00,305
- You...
- Commander.

614
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:01,744
There's something.

615
00:38:03,385 --> 00:38:04,104
Mr. Feinu,

616
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:05,184
come in.

617
00:38:08,424 --> 00:38:08,985
What is it?

618
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:10,224
This is my room.

619
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:26,985
What is it you want to tell me?

620
00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:29,345
Commander.

621
00:38:29,985 --> 00:38:31,144
As you instructed,

622
00:38:31,465 --> 00:38:32,825
I buried the body in the shrine

623
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:33,825
and left clues

624
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:35,345
to see Sun Xiangfu's reaction.

625
00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:37,584
But while burying the body,

626
00:38:38,264 --> 00:38:39,865
I discovered something there.

627
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:45,544
Commander.

628
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:47,144
Perhaps you should go see it.

629
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:13,104
