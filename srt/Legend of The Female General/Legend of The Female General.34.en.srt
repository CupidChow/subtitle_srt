=Episode 34=

23
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,780
Under war's shadow,

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,900
people always suffer most.

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,460
If peace reigns,

26
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,100
I'd gladly retire.

27
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,020
But I intend to be a great general.

28
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,500
How about this?

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,620
I'll support you.

30
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,660
Thank you, General Feihong.

31
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,900
Li Kuang returns to Rundu today.

32
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,340
It should be about time now.

33
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,259
I'll see him off.

34
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,900
Don't you want me to go?

35
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,380
Better not.

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,460
Li Kuang got startled

37
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,620
by Mr. Cheng's

38
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,340
grand display.

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,139
If not for me,

40
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,940
he'd be long gone.

41
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,850
Send the betrothal certificate?

42
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,870
Give it to me.

43
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,579
Cheng Lisu, hey you!

44
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,100
You have

45
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,740
peanut allergy!

46
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,380
Why eat peanut cakes?

47
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,300
Taotao, I...

48
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,220
You remembered my peanut allergy?

49
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,540
Is this really the time for that?

50
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,300
How much you ate?

51
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,140
I'd rather check your pulse.

52
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,900
Your pulse is steady.

53
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,780
You lie to me?

54
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,380
Taotao, I don't.

55
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,900
You care about me too much.

56
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,380
Yes. I care about you and fall for you.

57
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,060
So what?

58
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,020
Give me the thing.

59
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,620
Why stand up?

60
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,180
Song Taotao, I want to marry you.

61
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,340
I love you.

62
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,220
I, Cheng Lisu, have

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,380
fallen for you,

64
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,820
wishing to marry you.

65
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,620
To tie the nuptial knot

66
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,820
and travel together,

67
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,780
writing books and tasting herbs.

68
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,620
I'll only marry you.

69
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,460
What do you think?

70
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,380
I don't want

71
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,500
to tie the nuptial knot.

72
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,260
I'll be lovebirds with you,

73
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,300
so we can travel around.

74
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,700
Right, lovebirds.

75
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,380
Albizia flowers?

76
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,700
They calm the mind and the nerve,

77
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,740
symbolizing marital bliss.

78
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,180
Taotao,

79
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,540
together with you,

80
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,140
I seek no dramatic love.

81
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,140
I only want peace and joy

82
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,420
with you.

83
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,980
It's the wedding invitation

84
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,940
of the Chengs and Songs.

85
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,580
Lisu and Taotao will

86
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,780
marry this month's end.

87
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,980
So fast?

88
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,220
Their families

89
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,300
have done almost

90
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,580
everything of betrothal.

91
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,700
Naturally it is fast.

92
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,900
Finally,

93
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
they could be together.

94
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,940
Yes, they are.

95
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,460
Then when will you

96
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,220
and Miss He end up together?

97
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,340
This loquat tree is still here?

98
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,300
So short.

99
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,300
Huaijin.

100
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,100
Must you show off

101
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,060
in front of me,

102
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,740
and then mock my height?

103
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,060
Back then,

104
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,180
you were so cold.

105
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,300
But I'm lucky.

106
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,540
I remember once

107
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,440
when I failed an exam,

108
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,740
I was locked in a dark room.

109
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,060
(I was starving at the time.)

110
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:15,940
(And then)

111
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,780
(someone secretly gave me loquats.)

112
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,900
I really like

113
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,860
such a kind soul.

114
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,780
You like him

115
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,860
over some loquats?

116
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,740
It's me who gave you

117
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,740
those loquats.

118
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,460
So it was you, Huaijin.

119
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,300
I knew it.

120
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,420
You're the only one

121
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,260
I've ever been so in sync with.

122
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,300
You're truly a lifesaver.

123
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,980
Look at you.

124
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,340
How could you be last again?

125
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,620
Master Wei.

126
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,540
You taught us self-sacrifice.

127
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,700
If I don't endure hardship, who will?

128
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,470
You!

129
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,060
Hopeless.

130
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,130
(Xianchang Academy)

131
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,220
What?

132
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,340
Can't you face me properly?

133
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,380
Xiao Jue.

134
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,300
You are my most proud student.

135
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,980
Why did you...?

136
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,580
Why did he end up liking me?

137
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,659
A woman

138
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:45,700
disguised as a man

139
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,780
and studied here.

140
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,300
That was outrageous.

141
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
You even went

142
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,940
to join the military.

143
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,700
How absurd!

144
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,860
How immoral!

145
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,860
How rude!

146
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,980
Xiao Jue has always
maintained good conduct.

147
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,180
It must be you

148
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,740
who lured him astray.

149
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,140
- Master Wei.
- Master...

150
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,020
I fell for her first.

151
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,940
She is Wei's

152
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,020
first female general.

153
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,140
Frankly speaking,

154
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,540
I'm the lucky one.

155
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,540
You're a grown man.

156
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,980
Don't always talk

157
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,100
about love.

158
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,220
Beauty brings disaster.

159
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,340
So they are

160
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,660
General Feihong and Fengyun?

161
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,380
Yes!

162
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,300
I'll be a general too!

163
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,180
- Me too!
- I'll be a general!

164
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,940
Stop it!

165
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,620
Don't mess around.

166
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,820
Return to your studies!

167
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:33,980
- Yes.
- Yes.

168
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,820
He's a walking contradiction.

169
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,860
When he heard General Feihong

170
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,780
was a woman,

171
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,860
he angrily removed

172
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,500
the calligraphy

173
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,900
she left during her studies.

174
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,820
But then he still

175
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,060
hung it back up.

176
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,260
Huaijin.

177
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,420
Did you

178
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,060
take me here on purpose?

179
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,900
You're no longer

180
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,420
the problem student,

181
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,420
but the Xianchang Academy's pride.

182
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,340
However,

183
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,900
General Feihong,

184
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,980
to preserve your dignity,

185
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,260
should you study

186
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,620
and retake the exam?

187
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,230
(He Rufei, C)

188
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,820
Retaking the exam for this

189
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,340
would be truly shameful.

190
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,580
Besides,

191
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,660
it's in the long past.

192
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,020
After joining the army,

193
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,980
I kept improving

194
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,780
and became a scholarly general.

195
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,980
I master the classics long ago.

196
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
The Virtue chapter?

197
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,900
Unshaken by external things.

198
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,140
How's it, father?

199
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,060
Did I do it well?

200
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,940
Huaijin, if you wish,

201
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,180
I can...

202
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,060
No need.

203
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,580
I mean,

204
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,260
to recite the Virtue chapter again.

205
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,620
What's on your mind?

206
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,380

This is my first time

at Yaojing's Lantern Festival.

215
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,380
It's much livelier than

216
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,180
Water God Festival!

217
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,940
Your wish to wander,

my hand to hold.

219
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,180
Sugar figure.

220
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,210
Huaijin.

221
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,140
Want a sugar figure?

222
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,860
Buy you one.

223
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,740
Well,

224
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,500
one with a phoenix?

225
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,300
Or one with a Kylin?

226
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,000
No.

227
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,260
No?

228
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,900
I have money.

229
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,900
I'll buy you one.

230
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,020
No basket-shaped ones here.

231
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,820
You like baskets?

232
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,380
Someone made

233
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,780
a candy basket
for Mr. Chu in Jiyang City?

234
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,740
Are you

235
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,980
feeling jealous?

236
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,260
I never expected

237
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,300
that the mighty General Fengyun

238
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,980
would become so jealous.

239
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,620
I am jealous.

240
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,340
No matter how generous one is,

241
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,140
after falling for someone,

242
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,700
they'd be jealous easily.

243
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,660
Moreover,

244
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,580
he was up to something.

245
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,820
Back then,

246
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,460
he gave me a tassel.

247
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,820
You know

248
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,220
the hardest favors to repay

249
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,260
are kindness.

250
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,500
But

251
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,820
we are different.

252
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,300
We don't need

253
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,500
clear lines.

254
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,380
Just like you,

255
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,620
I'm also unwavering.

256
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,980
I won't love other man.

257
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,820
Come on.

258
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:23,970
Sir.

259
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,180
One sugar figure.

260
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,500
May I draw it myself?

261
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:27,900
Of course.

262
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,630
Here.

263
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,330
Done!

264
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,460
You can stop

265
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,780
being jealous.

266
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,260
But

267
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,780
this might be too large.

268
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,380
It's hard to carry.

269
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,140
Don't worry, miss.

270
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,260
We can deliver it

271
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,260
to your mansion.

272
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,420
Really?

273
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,980
Thank you so much.

274
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:53,940
This one.

275
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,390
How is it?

276
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,900
General Yan.

277
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,420
He Yan.

278
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,540
What a rare sight!

279
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,700
Never expected you

280
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,300
to stroll through night markets.

281
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,100
This must be

282
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,900
you wife, right?

283
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
(Xia Chengxiu, Yan He's Wife)

284
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,500
In Rundu,

285
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,780
General Yan mentioned you often.

286
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,060
And this

287
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,580
must be General He.

288
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,340
I've long heard of your fame.

289
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,540
Enough with the formalities.

290
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,380
Xiao Jue, you're here
for the lantern riddles too?

291
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,740
Then go solve

292
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,540
the riddles.

293
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,100
Look how many I've solved already.

294
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,860
He's not solving them,

295
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,860
but

296
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,180
I'll solve one for him.

297
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,540
Xiu, I want you to solve one for me too.

298
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,630
Alright.

299
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,500
Pick one.

300
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,740
(Lantern Riddles)

301
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,340
The blue one then.

302
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,300
This character is remarkable
with four strokes...

303
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,620
Where should I hang this lantern?

304
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,700
What's the perfect spot?

305
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,660
Here then.

306
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,820
Even sages would bow before it.

307
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,780
Wait!

308
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,100
Ten and one at the bottom,
and three on top.

309
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,820
It's "Lei".

310
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,180
Brilliant, miss!

311
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,260
This lantern is yours.

312
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,680
Thank you.

313
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:24,900
Sir.

314
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,180
Why is

315
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
hers nicer than mine?

316
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:30,860
Sir!

317
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,980

321
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,260
we're especially lucky today?

322
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,980
Indeed.

388
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,820
you even make Feinu
release Kongming lanterns?

389
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,420
How thoughtful.

390
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,820
♪Chasing the light within my heart♪

391
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,830
♪Burying frailty,
embracing life through death♪

392
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,840
♪You'll meet gazes where storms brew♪

393
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,940
♪With our unwavering true love,
brave the world with me♪

394
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,390
(Chu Mansion)

395
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,300
This was a gift from her.

396
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,740
She said,

397
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,180
"Zilan" means nobility and purity.

398
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,780
Only those who love me

399
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,540
would give me such a name.

400
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,540
She gifted this to me.

401
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,140
She must have loved me.

402
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,820
Young Master,

403
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,660
look at this lantern.

404
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,060
Young Master.

405
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,460
(She loves me.)

406
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,340
She loves me.

407
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,140
She must have loved me.

408
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,300
Why did it shatter?

409
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,460
Why?

410
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,500
Why must it be

411
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,740
the very gift from her?

412
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,500
Young Master.

413
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,060
Why?

414
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,140
Why?

415
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,180
Why can't I

416
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,340
ever have anything I desire?

417
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,870
Young Master.

418
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:44,940
It's fate.

419
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,940
Why force it?

420
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:49,900
Young Master.

421
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,300
Young Master.

422
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,300
Then you'll draft

423
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
the edict.

424
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,100
Understood.

425
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,500
The plum blossoms in the tiny vase

426
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,700
radiate such vibrant fragrance.

427
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,020
Indeed.

428
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,740
This year's plum blooms

429
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,020
are really splendid.

430
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,100
Quite true.

431
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,900
The plum tree south of the city

432
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,020
is also in full bloom.

433
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,300
Yesterday,

434
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,380
General Fengyun went to pluck blossoms

435
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,420
for a young lady.

436
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,260
Xiao Jue?

437
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,980
For which young lady?

438
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,340
She is

439
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,180
no ordinary lady,

440
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,100
but General Feihong.

441
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:46,820
This

442
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,820
has become a romantic legend.

443
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,940
All agree the two generals

444
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,860
are destined.

445
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,460
Young nobles and ladies

446
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,300
now visit

447
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,900
the plum trees in pairs

448
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,940
to pray for blessings.

449
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,700
Indeed.

450
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,780
Fengyun and Feihong

451
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,740
truly make a peerless pair.

452
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,300
He Yan and Xiao Jue

453
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,740
make a peerless pair.

454
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,660
But General Feihong

455
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,020
and General Fengyun

456
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,140
can't be a good match.

457
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,900
What's different?

458
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,260
General Feihong and Fengyun

459
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,420
hold strong military forces.

460
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,980
It's quite special to be

461
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,020
on the rooftop at night.

462
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,300
When I was young,

463
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,780
before joining the army,

464
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,340
I loved the rooftops.

465
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,940
He Mansion's rooftop

466
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,140
was even higher.

467
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,060
My martial arts were poor.

468
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,980
I could only climb using ladders.

469
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,980
Once when I was halfway up,

470
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,980
I fell down.

471
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,180
Afraid of being noticed,

472
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,180
I didn't shout out.

473
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,060
For a long time after,

474
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,260
my back kept hurting.

475
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,060
Why love being on the rooftops?

476
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,780
Because they are high enough

477
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,540
to reach for the moon

478
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,540
and pluck stars

479
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,100
from the sky.

480
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,980
Childish.

481
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,020
What?

482
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,340
Everyone was so.

483
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,220
If you like it,

484
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,980
every rooftop in my mansion

485
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,100
will be yours.

486
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,300
Even after marriage,

487
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:39,780
okay?

488
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,700
Okay.

489
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,460
We'll climb together,

490
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,100
okay?

491
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,840
Okay.

492
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,500
If we need to bring snacks...

493
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,420
As long as you like it,

494
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,660
I'm okay.

495
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,100
What's funny?

496
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,700
I was thinking

497
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,780
the mighty General Fengyun

498
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,900
would climb roofs with me.

499
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,220
Moreover,

500
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,260
I regain control of the Fuyue Army.

501
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,260
You and the Xiao Army

502
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,740
might become obsolete.

503
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,100
Nothing keeping you busy?

504
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,100
Such bold words.

505
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,780
It matters not.

506
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,980
Merit determines

507
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,460
position.

508
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,380
I won't show any mercy.

509
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,340
Likewise.

510
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,700
Instead of this talk,

511
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,220
let's discuss

512
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,500
our wedding.

513
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,500
I've hired

514
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,980
Yaojing's best embroiderers

515
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,060
to make the bridal gown.

516
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,060
So soon?

517
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,540
Soon?

518
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,700
I think it's too slow.

519
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,580
Actually,

520
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,940
I feel the same.

521
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,020
I'll measure your shoulders.

522
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,300
Note this down.

523
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,380
Miss, raise your arm.

524
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,260
(You are a woman,)

525
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,500
(yet fight on the battlefields,)

526
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,940
(outshining all men.)

527
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,540
(You deserve)

528
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,900
(the title of)

529
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,260
(General Feihong.)

530
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,100
Why do you keep staring at me?

531
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,500
Beautiful.

532
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,780
You'll look even more stunning

533
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,780
in the wedding dress.

534
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,940
Why am I the only one being measured?

535
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,980
Marriage

536
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,420
is about us two.

537
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,490
Yes.

538
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,740
I need it too.

539
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:05,980
I want you to.

540
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,300
Me?

541
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,820
Your shoulders

542
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,540
are much broader than mine.

543
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,740
The waist.

544
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,180
Waist?

545
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,620
Measure with hands.

546
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,900
By the imperial decree,

547
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,500
summon General Fengyun Xiao Jue

548
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,500
to the palace.

549
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,340
Your Majesty.

550
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,220
Commander Xiao is here.

551
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,460
I'm Xiao Jue.

552
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,580
Greetings.

553
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,700
Rise.

554
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,500
I summoned you urgently

555
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,300
due to emerging circumstances.

556
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,860
Are the Wutuo people

557
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,380
making any movements?

558
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,500
Exactly.

559
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,940
I got tips from the border.

560
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,180
The Wutuo King had passed away.

561
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,860
His son succeeded the throne.

562
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,540
But his son

563
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,540
is too young.

564
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
While his uncle

565
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,100
has strong military forces,

566
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,220
eyeing covetously.

567
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,580
The officials

568
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,180
are divided into two factions.

569
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,940
The Wutuo

570
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,460
could erupt into civil war any moment.

571
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,740
The uncle has accumulated authority.

572
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Usurping the throne
is just a matter of time.

573
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,260
To get more power,

574
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,740
given his warlike nature,

575
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,700
he'll surely invade the Wei.

576
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,900
You are absolutely right.

577
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,740
Therefore,

578
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,140
we shouldn't just watch idly.

579
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,660
Instead, we must prepare

580
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,660
in advance.

581
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,220
I think

582
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,580
we should discuss this with

583
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,740
General Feihong too.

584
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,020
Generals Fengyun and Feihong

585
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,820
are the twin stars of Wei.

586
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,300
With both of you here,

587
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,460
I can rest easy.

588
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,260
I'm flattered.

589
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,860
It's our duty

590
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,860
to protect the nation.

591
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,660
I heard

592
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,420
you gifted plum blossoms to He Yan.

593
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,340
Your Majesty,

594
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,380
He Yan and I

595
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,140
love each other.

596
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,340
We agreed...

597
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,700
Your Majesty,
Mr. Chu Zhao requests audience.

598
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,780
Let him in.

599
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,080
Yes.

600
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,100
By the imperial decree,

601
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,260
summon Mr. Chu Zhao!

602
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,700
- Your Majesty.
- Rise.

603
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,940
What brings you here?

604
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,420
I come here

605
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,500
for personal matters.

606
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,260
Why be so formal?

607
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,900
I've long admired a lady.

608
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,300
I boldly implore you to issue

609
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,660
a marriage decree.

610
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,420
Please grant me.

611
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,740
I see.

612
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,420
Which lady you admire?

613
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,620
Tell me.

614
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,980
He Yan.

615
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,220
You want to marry He Yan?

616
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,860
- Yes.
- No way!

617
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,300
Your Majesty,

618
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,660
He Yan and I are engaged.

619
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,340
And we're about to marry.

620
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,860
Without proper betrothal rites,

621
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,500
can you call it engagement?

622
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,660
Your Majesty,

623
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,860
I love He Yan...

624
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,460
I know.

625
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,180
You and He Yan

626
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,060
can marry.

627
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,540
But

628
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,500
General Fengyun and General Feihong

629
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,460
cannot.

630
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,660
Your Majesty.

631
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,780
I don't want to split lovebirds,

632
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,620
but I have my considerations.

633
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,020
If you insist on marrying He Yan,

634
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,260
I won't stop you.

635
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,900
But one of you

636
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,060
must surrender

637
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,180
your military authority.

638
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:01,900
Commander Xiao,

639
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,980
you fought so hard

640
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,740
to clear your father's name.

641
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,740
And the Xiao Army

642
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,420
barely regained

643
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,420
morale.

644
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,420
No one else

645
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,980
can command them.

646
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,980
Think it over.

647
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,500
Tomorrow,

648
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,780
tell me your answer.

649
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,260
Besides,

650
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,740
no outsiders shall know

651
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,660
about this matter.

652
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,700
Understood.

653
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:19,860
I admit.

654
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,219
I'm trying to

655
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,260
steal He Yan from you.

656
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,860
But concentrating

657
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,420
military power has been taboo.

658
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,060
He Yan suffered

659
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,980
so much pain

660
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,900
to reclaim her identity

661
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,420
as General Feihong.

662
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,060
Can you watch her give up

663
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,580
everything for you?

664
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,580
And how could you

665
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,860
betray your late father

666
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,820
and abandon the Xiao Army

667
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,980
he entrusted to you?

668
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,620
Xiao Jue,

669
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,179
just admit it.

670
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:51,780
You

671
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:54,340
and He Yan aren't destined.

672
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,179
You and her

673
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,100
cannot be together.

674
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,660
What took you so long?

675
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,060
What did His Majesty say?

676
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,500
The Wutuo King suddenly passed away,

677
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,260
succeeded by his young son.

678
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,660
Wutuo King's brother

679
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,460
is eyeing the throne for usurpation.

680
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,220
His Majesty fears

681
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,700
the Wutuo's civil war

682
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,740
will endanger

683
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,700
the Wei.

684
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,740
Therefore,

685
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,860
we must prepare in advance.

686
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,300
True.

687
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,380
We need to stay alert

688
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,180
of the cunning Wutuo people.

689
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,460
But,

690
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,500
for such crucial matters,

691
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,500
why did

692
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,580
His Majesty only summon you?

693
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,740
Next time,

694
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,380
His Majesty will summon you

695
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,140
to discuss this.

696
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,260
Excellent.

697
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,140
As the General Feihong,

698
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,300
you must soar freely

699
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,820
in the sky.

700
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,940
Young Master,

701
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,340
eat something.

702
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,260
I'm not hungry.

703
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,700
Leave now.

704
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,780
If you've made up your mind,

705
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,620
why being so troubled?

706
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,220
I am troubled?

707
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,540
Having served you for so long,

708
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,180
I can tell

709
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,340
you're troubled.

710
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,060
You resemble

711
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,180
glacial ice,

712
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
crystal clear,

713
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,180
yet chillingly cold.

714
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,420
Miss He

715
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,780
resembles fire,

716
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,980
shining brightly,

717
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,740
yet scorching

718
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,860
when you get close.

719
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,500
Today, you've spoken

720
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,700
too much.

721
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,020
I'm sorry.

722
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,500
Please eat.

723
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,180
Ice and fire cannot be together.

724
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,740
So what?

725
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,320

726
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,260

736
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,860
(I believe I was born)

737
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,900
to be a general.

738
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,020
Sometimes, I even feel

739
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,340
I was a female general in my past life.

740
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,020
Impressive, right?

741

You know why I let you lead them?

742
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,620
