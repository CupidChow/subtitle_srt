But I promise you.

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,039
Soon,

25
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,200
you'll be more regretful.

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,200
Rufei.

27
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:44,960
Don't think

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,960
becoming Marquis Wu'an

29
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,650
makes you invincible.

30
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,400
I killed you once,

31
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,289
and I can kill you again.

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,970
Killing trash like you

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,600
isn't worth dirtying my sword.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,570
S-Stop...

35
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,169
Since childhood,

36
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,410
I've shouldered

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,040
the family heir's responsibilities.

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,410
I earned glory

39
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,200
and the title of General Feihong

40
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,250
to bring glory to our family,

41
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,690
but I never imagined

42
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,890
I'd nearly die

43
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,170
by my own brother's hand.

44
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,690
Master He,

45
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,079
when you heard of He Yan's death,

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,920
what did you feel?

47
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,600
Bitter tears of grief

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,520
or a wave of relief?

49
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,920
This is

50
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,570
our mansion.

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
How dare you act recklessly here!

52
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,410
Since you said so,

53
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,480
if I don't make some trouble,

54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
it'd be impolite.

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,800
What exactly do you want?

56
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,640
I am

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,890
very curious.

58
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,920
Who exactly

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,730
are you referring to?

60
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,170
Second only to the Emperor

61
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,890
and above all others.

62
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,040
Who else could stir such chaos

63
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,410
besides you,

64
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,890
Chancellor Xu?

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,079
Well played, General Xiao.

66
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,890
With just a few words,

67
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,130
you've slung mud at me

68
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,200
and General He.

69
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,600
Where's your proof?

70
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,450
Surely not just

71
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,290
your baseless accusations?

72
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,200
No need to panic, Chancellor.

73
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,890
How could you be certain

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
we lack evidence?

75
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,520
Taotao's drug

76
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,250
actually works pretty well.

77
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
(Just like when I lived here before.)

78
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,570
(Almost nothing's changed.)

79
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:28,960
Guards!

80
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,400
Guards!

81
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,960
Get in here now!

82
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,810
Young Master.

83
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,320
Master.

84
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,010
Master.

85
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,810
Untie me.

86
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,200
Move!

87
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,930
Where's He Yan?

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,370
What are you doing?

89
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,930
Find He Yan immediately!

90
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,640
Rufei.

91
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,159
Rufei!

92
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,400
Master.

93
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,050
The Linglong Box.

94
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,450
Long time no see.

95
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,890
Guards!

96
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,130
Guards!

97
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,960
Guards!

98
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,280
Chaos finally erupts.

99
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,200
Seal off

100
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,280
the entire room.

101
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,210
Don't let her escape!

102
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,130
- Yes!
- Yes!

103
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,570
They arrived faster

104
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,320
than I expected.

105
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,890
Good.

106
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:26,690
She's after

107
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,010
my letters with Chancellor Xu.

108
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,520
(You won't leave alive.)

109
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,159
Quick! Guards!

110
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,960
Keep searching!

111
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,370
Yes!

112
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,250
Check this area.

113
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:36,960
Yes.

114
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,010
Any traces?

115
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:38,890
Nothing.

116
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,890
Keep looking.

117
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,840
This area, too.

118
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,610
Sir.

119
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,570
Why are you here?

120
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,159
For Sun Ling.

121
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,080
Sir.

122
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,890
This death row inmate is involved in

123
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,130
a case supervised

124
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,320
by the Ministry of Justice.

125
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,050
Not long ago,

126
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,490
he was transferred
from Yezhou for trial,

127
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,690
waiting to be killed.

128
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,760
The higher-ups
ordered strict supervision.

129
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,130
Without a reason...

130
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,520
It's you, Mr. Chu.

131
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,250
This way, sir.

132
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,080
After you.

133
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,050
Right this way.

134
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,560
Please enter, sir.

135
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,210
You may leave now.

136
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,039
Yes.

137
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,130
Sun Ling.

138
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:45,640
You...

139
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,210
You are...

140
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,800
C-Chu Zhao?

141
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,250
It's me.

142
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,330
You...

143
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,250
Why are you here?

144
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,160
You're behind bars

145
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
and to be executed soon.

146
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,210
I...

147
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,250
I want to live!

148
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,440
I want to live!

149
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,560
Mr. Chu!

150
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,560
Mr. Chu!

151
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,490
I want to live!

152
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,330
Save me!

153
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,760
Save me! I don't want to die!

154
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,040
Your crime is grave.

155
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,970
No one can save you.

156
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,640
But...

157
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,250
But?

158
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,440
But what?

159
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,680
I can let you

160
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
avenge your father

161
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,640
while still breathing.

162
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,700
(Account Book)

163
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
This...

164
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,490
This is the ledger

165
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,370
of my father's transactions

166
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,890
with Xu Jingfu!

167
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,800
H-How did this end up with you?

168
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,680
Correct.

169
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,330
Your father worked diligently

170
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,760
to embezzle money for him,

171
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,010
only to be sacrificed as a scapegoat.

172
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,760
Dragging your entire family down.

173
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,090
Quite tragic.

174
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,520
Stop the false compassion.

175
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,490
You're partly responsible for

176
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,520
my father's death.

177
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,920
But

178
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,890
(Account Book)
that old fox Xu Jingfu

179
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,090
is the real culprit

180
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,040
who destroyed my family!

181
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,440
My father cherished me dearly.

182
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,970
How could I not avenge him?

183
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,300
(Transactions)

184
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,330
Tell me.

185
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,210
What should I do?

186
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,800
I want you to surrender this ledger

187
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,090
and expose

188
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,400
Xu Jingfu's corruption and bribery.

189
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,640
Officially,

190
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,730
I was never here today.

191
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:51,730
Correct?

192
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:53,760
Yes.

193
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:55,760
Yes.

194
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,250
Father.

195
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,440
Yan.

196
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:41,970
Mother...

197
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,250
(Spirit Tablet of Daughter He Yan)

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,920
(She burns incense, chants scriptures)

199
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,280
(and prays)

200
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,010
(for me daily.)

201
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,800
(So in this mansion,)

202
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,560
(there's still someone
who remembers me,)

203
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,730
(remembers He Yan.)

204
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,760
Madam He.

205
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,610
Is anyone in the shrine?

206
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,090
Don't disturb my prayers.

207
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,130
All of you, out!

208
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:29,890
- Yes!
- Yes!

209
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:32,730
Quickly.

210
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,800
Leave!

211
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,560
Go now!

212
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,640
Hurry!

213
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,090
Go!

214
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,440
Anything?

215
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,680
Nothing.

216
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:51,970
Found her?

217
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,920
- No.
- No.

218
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:55,730
Rufei.

219
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,560
What is

220
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,440
all this commotion about?

221
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,490
Madam.

222
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,800
Did you happen to

223
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,850
see anyone earlier?

224
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,330
I haven't seen anyone.

225
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,330
Rufei.

226
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,730
Rufei.

227
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,540
(Spirit Tablet of Daughter He Yan)

228
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,970
Rufei.

229
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,490
Rufei.

230
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,970
Rufei, don't be like this.

231
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,610
This is your sister's tablet.

232
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,400
Don't.

233
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,970
Let go!

234
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,610
Rufei.

235
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,040
You let her escape.

236
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,680
Is that so?

237
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,370
Enough.

238
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,680
We've had enough tea.

239
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:42,970
General Xiao.

240
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,520
Since you intend to fabricate evidence

241
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,250
to frame me,

242
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,490
then go ahead quickly.

243
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,490
My lord,

244
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,400
Mr. Xiao's man

245
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,160
is outside,

246
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,890
saying

247
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,920
to report something.

248
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,440
Chancellor,

249
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,560
my guard carries no weapons.

250
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,800
Surely you won't obstruct him?

251
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,040
You jest, General Xiao.

252
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,040
Do you recognize this Linglong Box?

253
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,090
Of course.

254
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,850
After all, His Majesty

255
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,160
publicly bestowed it
upon General Feihong.

256
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,890
You

257
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,440
surely remember.

258
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,970
This is General He's stuff.

259
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,250
How did this end up in your hands?

260
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,560
Wasn't it you

261
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,280
who told us to search for evidence?

262
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,040
He Yan happened to be

263
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,400
at the He Mansion today

264
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,920
and retrieved her Linglong Box.

265
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,130
This box contains

266
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,730
intricate mechanisms,

267
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,440
perfect for concealing important items.

268
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,130
He Rufei thought the same,

269
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,400
believing

270
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,760
by keeping

271
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,970
certain life-saving evidence

272
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,560
in here,

273
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,280
he could rest easy.

274
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,210
Unluckily,

275
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,640
it still fell into our hands.

276
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,560
Send him out.

277
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:05,890
Today,

278
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,480
He Yan came to my residence,

279
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,329
attempting to steal

280
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,609
our letters.

281
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,609
What a pity.

282
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,810
Her schemes

283
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,810
still failed.

284
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,200
I never expected

285
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,720
to find anything here.

286
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,050
I got back this box

287
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,200
simply because it

288
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,770
belonged to

289
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:27,890
General Feihong.

290
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,290
Seeing this,

291
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,480
Xu Jingfu would assume

292
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,290
I've obtained evidence

293
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,440
from He Rufei,

294
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,960
regardless of

295
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,160
its actual contents.

296
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,810
After this,

297
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,290
I doubt

298
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,330
Xu Jingfu will continue

299
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,810
to believe He Rufei.

300
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,640
(To He Rufei)
Show me.

301
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
The letters are safe.

302
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,480
Rest assured, Chancellor.

303
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,090
Then show me.

304
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,440
Chancellor,

305
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,200
you already know

306
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,810
the content of these letters.

307
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,240
You just need to know

308
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,050
He Yan

309
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,330
took no evidence with her.

310
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,530
That's enough.

311
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,850
You fear my scrutiny?

312
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,090
Correct?

313
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,570
You distrust me?

314
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,370
Xu Jingfu is cunning.

315
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,480
He won't trust easily.

316
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,810
When I dealt with Xu Jingfu today

317
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,960
at his mansion,

318
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,720
he remained composed

319
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,890
until he saw this Linglong Box.

320
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,610
Then panic set in.

321
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,200
Of course.

322
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,720
He might disregard other things,

323
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,530
but those letters

324
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,890
were written by him personally.

325
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,610
They're irrefutable evidence.

326
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,160
He can't deny it.

327
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,480
He Rufei doesn't

328
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,610
trust Xu Jingfu either.

329
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:49,770
It seems

330
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,640
he wouldn't hand over

331
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,810
those letters to him.

332
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,890
After all,

333
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,480
that's the only bargaining chip he has

334
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,530
against Xu Jingfu.

335
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,370
So from the beginning,

336
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,680
my goal wasn't actually

337
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,290
to obtain the so-called evidence.

338
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,680
Time was too tight

339
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,000
to find anything.

340
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,160
It was just a feint.

341
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,090
We just need to make Xu Jingfu believe

342
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,720
that we've obtained evidence

343
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,370
from He Rufei.

344
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,480
Both of them harbor guilty secrets.

345
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,240
Trust died long ago.

346
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,810
The rupture awaits them.

347
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,330
Just

348
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,200
not tonight yet.

349
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,920
No matter.

350
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,400
It'll come soon enough.

351
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,330
Enough.

352
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,920
Keep these safe.

353
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,640
Don't let them
fall into the wrong hands.

354
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,090
Thank you, Chancellor.

355
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll guard them with my life.

356
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,130
As you witnessed today,

357
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,640
He Yan came to your mansion triumphantly

358
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,770
to flaunt her victory.

359
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,370
This was clearly retaliation.

360
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,960
Xiao Jue and her

361
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,440
came fully prepared.

362
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,240
It appears

363
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,240
we must strike first.

364
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,130
What's your plan?

365
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,680
We must deal with Xiao Jue now.

366
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,770
At least,

367
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,290
we must strip him of military authority.

368
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,920
At the morning court in two days,

369
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,770
I'll handle him myself.

370
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,400
As for He Yan,

371
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,610
that's your responsibility.

372
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,810
At your service, Chancellor.

373
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,210
(Xiao Mansion)

374
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,810
Who is this?

375
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,290
This is

376
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,720
Madam He.

377
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,530
(The Xiao Mansion
and He Mansion are far apart.)

378
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,570
(She deliberately detoured,)

379
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,770
(probably to see me.)

380
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,440
Thank you

381
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,050
for that day, madam.

382
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,680
No need for thanks.

383
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,640
I'm glad you're safe.

384
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,770
It's all that counts.

385
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:19,850
How have you been?

386
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,570
Have your injuries healed completely?

387
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
I've fully recovered.

388
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,680
No need for concern.

389
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,050
(Xiao Mansion)

390
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,680
Yeah.

391
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Leaving the He Mansion

392
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,920
was the best for you.

393
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,480
Madam He.

394
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,400
There are ears.

395
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,480
Be discreet.

396
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,160
But...

397
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,130
Return home.

398
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,000
Take care of yourself.

399
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,200
Your Majesty,

400
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,810
Wutuo envoy Maningbu

401
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,440
arrived in the capital yesterday.

402
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,000
In my humble opinion,

403
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,200
we should host a banquet

404
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,370
in three days

405
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,240
to showcase

406
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,610
our reputation as a civilized nation.

407
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,240
What do you think, Your Majesty?

408
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,530
Approved.

409
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,610
Maningbu's visit

410
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,000
is under orders from the Wutuo King

411
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,200
to establish peace,

412
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,000
cease hostilities between us,

413
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,570
and establish a pact

414
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,200
for perpetual amity.

415
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,810
Wutuo has proposed three terms

416
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,810
for the peace negotiations.

417
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:56,850
First,

418
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,890
Wei and Wutuo

419
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,720
shall be brotherly nations.

420
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,570
Your Majesty, being elder,

421
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,850
shall be addressed
as elder brother by the Wutuo King.

422
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,960
This hierarchy shall continue
for future generations.

423
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,090
Second,

424
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,960
both sides shall withdraw troops.

425
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,570
Border cities
of both nations shall maintain

426
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,160
current defensive structures.

427
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,130
No new fortifications
shall be constructed.

428
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,090
And the third point?

429
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,330
Both sides at the border

430
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,480
shall establish a market

431
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,330
and conduct mutual commerce

432
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,960
with profits split equally.

433
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,640
That's the third proposal.

434
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:43,680
Preposterous!

435
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,400
Wutuo people are cunning.

436
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,480
We can't trust them!

437
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,200
- Exactly.
- No.

438
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,920
If this can prevent war,

439
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,530
it's worth trying.

440
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,480
Chancellor Xu,

441
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:54,680
Mr. Xiao,

442
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,160
what are your thoughts?

443
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,050
In my humble opinion,

444
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,570
since we

445
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,330
want friendly relations with Wutuo,

446
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,610
establishing trade markets

447
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,330
is acceptable.

448
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,920
Our cooperation

449
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,290
will bring mutual benefits

450
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,200
and greatly aid
our people's livelihoods.

451
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,200
Setting aside

452
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,770
the fairness

453
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,200
of this 50-50 split,

454
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,400
I want to ask you,

455
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,810
where does Wutuo plan

456
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,640
to build this market?

457
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,290
Mingshui.

458
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,960
How can it be placed there?

459
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,720
Outrageous!

460
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,610
Unthinkable!

461
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,000
This goes too far!

462
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,770
A provocation!

463
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,440
We cannot agree!

464
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,330
A humiliation!

465
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,640
Clearly intentional!

466
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,160
True.

467
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,920
We mustn't agree.

468
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,570
Your Majesty,

469
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,240
I object.

470
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:54,810
Mingshui

471
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,050
is our strategic border fortress.

472
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,050
Placing the market there

473
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,680
would leave Wei vulnerable

474
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,090
if war reignites.

475
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,370
Moreover,

476
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,810
Mingshui

477
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,680
holds the remains of 30,000

478
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,440
Xiao Army soldiers.

479
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,480
Does Wutuo's proposal

480
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,090
show genuine sincerity

481
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,530
for peace with Wei?

482
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,640
This insults Wei's dignity!

483
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,850
They hold treacherous intentions!

484
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,090
The Xiao Army

485
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,850
serves our nation.

486
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,290
From marshals to foot soldiers,

487
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,680
it is their duty

488
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,090
to fall in battle.

489
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,640
But General Fengyun,

490
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,200
you cling to past grievances,

491
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,570
ignoring the greater good.

492
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,330
How does this honor

493
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,370
our fallen warriors?

494
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,640
Soldiers die in war,

495
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,720
only to become

496
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,050
bargaining chips for others.

497
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,890
General He, if you want compromise,

498
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:56,680
you may,

499
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,680
but

500
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,050
don't make your gains
off their sacrifice.

501
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,200
To me,

502
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,960
until we expose

503
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,570
the Mingshui Battle traitor,

504
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,530
this matter

505
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,090
remains unresolved.

506
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,570
Mr. Xiao,

507
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,130
rise.

508
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,160
Your Majesty,

509
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,130
Wutuo's schemes are endless.

510
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,090
Today's peace treaty

511
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,960
will bring more demands tomorrow.

512
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,240
Must we

513
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,370
repeat the tragedies in Mingshui

514
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,570
and Huayuan?

515
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,640
How many armies do we have

516
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,530
to feed Wutuo's slaughter?

517
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,330
Next,

518
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,400
shall we cede territory?

519
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:50,960
Pay reparations?

520
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,730
Offer peace marriages?

521
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,570
- T-This...
- Yeah.

522
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,440
He speaks the truth!

523
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
There's no bottom line!

524
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,160
How dare you!

525
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,160
What's next?

526
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,000
Wei's imminent collapse?

527
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,440
Such audacity!

528
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,400
Is it because I've treated

529
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,330
you too kindly

530
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,400
that you've become

531
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,000
so oblivious to propriety,

532
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,720
arrogant

533
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and insolent in court?

534
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
Get out of my sight!

535
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,610
Reflect at home!

536
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,890
Establishing markets

537
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,480
and signing treaties are important.

538
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,640
We'll revisit this.

539
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,000
Leave.

540
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,370
Court adjourned.

541
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,770
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

542
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,610
We mustn't fall into Wutuo's scheme.

543
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,290
Indeed.

544
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,050
Xiao Jue is already under house arrest.

545
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,000
Why do you still appear

546
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,530
so troubled?

547
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,680
Xiao Jue is insignificant.

548
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,570
I promised Maningbu

549
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,290
that I'd ensure

550
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,440
the trade market establishment.

551
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,680
Earlier, His Majesty

552
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,680
might've punished Xiao Jue,

553
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,570
but he didn't approve

554
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,200
the trade market proposal.

555
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,000
He no longer obeys me

556
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,050
as blindly as before.

557
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,290
Is this fanfare

558
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,240
enough?

559
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:10,720
Any grander

560
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,130
and Yaojing might gain

561
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,640
a surplus of deaf citizens.

562
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,370
Is this the top scholar's parade?

563
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,330
No exams were held this year.

564
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,570
No champion to celebrate.

565
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,440
Besides, look at the rider.

566
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,480
Rugged features,

567
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,400
coarse demeanor.

568
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,480
He's unlike

569
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,850
any scholar.

570
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,480
In my view,

571
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,240
this must be a wedding procession.

572
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,960
But no bridal attire.

573
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,680
And marrying so late in life

574
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,000
yet making a spectacle?

575
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:34,920
How...

576
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,570
How embarrassing!

577
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,480
Shameful.

578
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,370
Well?

579
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,890
Did I do it well?

580
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,130
Commander Li,

581
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,400
long time no see.

582
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,890
(Ganming Pavilion)

583
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,680
Arrest the owner.

584
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,290
He's a Wutuo spy in disguise

585
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,770
who's lurked here for years.

586
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,370
Everyone,

587
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,530
bring all findings

588
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,090
straight to the Ministry of War.

589
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,810
(Ganming Pavilion)
Trinkets, toys.

590
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,640
Take a look.

591
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,640
Someone!

592
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,090
Someone!

593
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,400
Someone!

594
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,330
Someone!

595
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,160
Someone!

596
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,050
Sun Ling,

597
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,130
stay still!

598
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,090
I...

599
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,400
What are you doing?

600
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,000
I demand an appeal.

601
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
I accuse the current Chancellor

602
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,770
Xu Jingfu!

603
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,370
Nonsense!

604
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,610
I'm not lying!

605
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,890
This ledger

606
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,770
is proof.

607
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,330
With Li Kuang,

608
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,890
General Feihong's old friend, here,

609
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,610
Xu Jingfu and He Rufei

610
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,130
must be losing sleep over this.

611
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,400
More than that.

612
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,330
Mr. Chu

613
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,610
must have visited

614
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,530
Xu Jingfu's residence,

615
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,370
bearing more ill tidings.

616
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,160
Sir.

617
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,640
You've been occupied with state affairs.

618
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,200
What brings you here today?

619
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
I've learned

620
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,440
Li Kuang

621
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,200
entered the capital publicly.

622
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,890
I've heard of it.

623
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,200
What else?

624
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,480
Speak plainly.

625
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,850
Sun Xiangfu's son Sun Ling

626
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,530
was brought to the capital

627
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,610
and has completed trial,

628
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,640
awaiting execution.

629
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,570
Facing imminent death,

630
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,920
he's making his last move.

631
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,440
He suddenly surrendered an account book,

632
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,130
saying

633
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,050
to accuse you.

634
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,440
What is he accusing me of?

635
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,530
Of instigating Sun Xiangfu

636
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,610
to commit large-scale corruption
and bribery.

637
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,720
I underestimated this man.

638
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,530
I always thought he was a fool.

639
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,160
I never expected

640
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,050
he would have

641
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,960
the audacity for a deathbed struggle.

642
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,920
I took the liberty

643
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,570
of having this matter silenced.

644
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,530
The account book is destroyed.

645
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,090
As for Sun Ling,

646
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,480
he's already on death row.

647
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,960
Currently held in isolation

648
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,000
under strict guard.

649
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,680
There's no need to worry.

650
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,440
Excellent.

651
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,810
You're thorough.

652
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,290
By the way,

653
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,130
on my way here earlier, I heard

654
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,960
the owner of Ganming Pavilion

655
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,200
was arrested

656
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,440
for unknown reasons.

657
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:31,720
Master,

658
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,960
are you alright?

659
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,290
With Li Kuang's arrival,

660
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,680
the closure of the shop,

661
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,890
and Sun Ling's report,

662
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,160
he will make desperate moves.

663
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,640
Not enough yet.

664
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,290
We need one last spark.

665
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,240
But that spark

666
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,810
will soon ignite the flames.

667
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,080
Zilan,

668
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,000
your information network

669
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,560
is remarkably efficient.

670
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,290
Merely hearsay.

671
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,290
What a coincidence.

672
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,330
My passing by

673
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,040
wasn't accidental.

674
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,770
It was Pingting

675
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,400
who heard about their new tea

676
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,920
and dragged me to sample it,

677
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,690
preparing to buy it for you.

678
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,480
But unexpectedly,

679
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,850
the shop got into trouble.

680
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,210
If you have doubts,

681
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,480
simply ask Pingting

682
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,810
to verify the truth.

683
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:46,250
I was just asking.

684
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,170
Don't take it to heart.

685
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,440
Have some tea.

686
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,040
Master.

687
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,440
Chancellor,

688
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,120
I come bearing

689
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,040
His Majesty's decree.

690
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,440
By the imperial decree,

691
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,080
Wutuo insists on establishing the market

692
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,960
at our strategic stronghold

693
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,120
and demands equal profit splitting.

694
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,690
They show no flexibility

695
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,850
and lack sincerity.

696
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,040
Therefore,

697
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,730
further negotiations are pointless.

698
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,170
Yes,

699
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
Your Majesty.

700
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,290
Please.

701
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,250
Xu Jingfu must be

702
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,290
in disarray by now.

703
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,770
Mr. Chu is his prized student.

704
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:49,810
He'll surely

705
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,890
seek Mr. Chu's counsel.

706
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,690
The question is

707
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,690
what advice Mr. Chu will offer.

708
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,370
Here.

709
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,690
Take the white pieces.

710
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,730
Try to break this deadlock.

711
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Chu Zhao is Xu Jingfu's student,

712
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,690
so their methods align naturally.

713
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,120
They'll likely escalate tensions

714
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,560
to reap third-party benefits.

715
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,170
This approach harms you

716
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,370
without damaging the enemy.

717
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,890
Don't you want to solve this?

718
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,850
Only by burning our boats

719
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,770
can we break this deadlock.

720
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,000
Good.

721
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,000
Master,

722
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,690
General He is outside.

723
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:11,960
Let him in.

724
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,000
You have a visitor.

725
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,000
I shall take my leave.

726
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,080
Earlier,

727
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,120
Maningbu sent word again.

728
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,600
He says the banquet is the deadline.

729
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:34,890
Chancellor,

730
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,440
what should we do now?

731
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
If His Majesty agrees,

732
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,250
all will be well.

733
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,440
If he refuses,

734
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,040
we'll replace him
with someone compliant.

735
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,870
(Xiao Mansion)

736
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,290
Why is everyone here?

737
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,730
Waiting for me?

738
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,960
What can I do for you?

739
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,650
Just tell me.

740
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,370
Yan,

741
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,850
I can't offer much help,

742
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,250
but I'll await good news.

743
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,650
I don't know

744
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,810
what you're planning to do,

745
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,770
but I'm certain

746
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,560
you'll achieve your goal.

747
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,480
Don't you have

748
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,440
anything to tell me?

749
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,480
Return victorious.

750
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:26,960
Thank you all.

751
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,170
Tonight's banquet

752
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,370
will bring the final resolution.

753
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,400
