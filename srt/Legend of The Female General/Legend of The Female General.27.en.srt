=Episode 27=

23
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:46,472
By wearing that mask this time,

24
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,467
you've terrified the Wutuo forces.

25
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:51,547
He Rufei will certainly use this

26
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,267
to confirm your identity.

27
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:57,228
Since I've come to Rundu,

28
00:01:57,668 --> 00:01:58,948
I'm not afraid of him knowing.

29
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:01,028
When I return,

30
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:04,708
I'll stand before him
with my head held high.

31
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:06,827
I'll make sure he learns

32
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:11,868
who the real General Feihong is.

33
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:16,028
Speaking of which,

34
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:18,828
since He Rufei and Xu Jingfu

35
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:20,268
have been colluding for so long,

36
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:21,627
there must be evidence

37
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:23,347
of their collaboration.

38
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:24,828
And that evidence

39
00:02:25,268 --> 00:02:26,108
is in the capital.

40
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,070
That's why I want to return sooner

41
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:30,227
to investigate potential leads.

42
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:32,108
Alright.

43
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:33,347
I'll go with you.

44
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:45,228
Young Master.

45
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:46,988
What happened to you?

46
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,308
I thought you sent Miss He
medicine to restore her energy.

47
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:18,108
Yingxiang.

48
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:19,988
Tell me,

49
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:23,227
why do people yearn for light?

50
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:25,868
Because of its warmth.

51
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,548
But Young Master,

52
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:30,947
not everyone needs it.

53
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:41,747
Aren't you afraid

54
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:42,787
of fire anymore?

55
00:03:46,108 --> 00:03:47,548
I received warmth.

56
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:49,347
So the fear vanished.

57
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:53,308
Is it because of Miss He?

58
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,187
Temporary gains and losses mean little.

59
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:17,467
I've been maneuvering against Master

60
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:20,867
for so long to gain power and strength

61
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:23,467
to protect what I value.

62
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:25,427
Even so,

63
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,708
you shouldn't have risked your life

64
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,268
and come to such a dangerous place.

65
00:04:30,947 --> 00:04:33,188
You barely dispelled
Chancellor Xu's suspicions.

66
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:34,748
Then you came here recklessly.

67
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,307
Chancellor Xu may hold it against you.

68
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:39,388
It is dangerous here,

69
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,867
but an official can't

70
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:43,667
prioritize personal safety.

71
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:45,948
I'm obligated to come here.

72
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:49,148
And my decision proves to be right.

73
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:51,268
I defended Rundu

74
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:53,188
and protected its people.

75
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:55,268
And after this battle,

76
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,307
His Majesty will trust me more.

77
00:04:58,268 --> 00:04:59,347
Also, I came here

78
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:01,708
to verify something.

79
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:03,948
What is it?

80
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:06,307
Yingxiang.

81
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:07,588
How do you think

82
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,467
General Feihong
before the Mingshui Battle

83
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:12,307
is different from

84
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:13,468
the current one?

85
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,588
The former General Feihong

86
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,907
was valiant and strategically brilliant.

87
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:21,347
The current one,

88
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,867
as seen in the recent Huayuan Battle,

89
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:25,628
won the battle

90
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:28,068
by sacrificing seven warriors at once.

91
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:29,748
This hardly matches

92
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:30,948
his reputation.

93
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:33,388
And in the Rundu Battle,

94
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,148
though General Feihong

95
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:37,307
is said to treat his troops like family,

96
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:39,907
he completely ignored

97
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,307
Li Kuang's pleas for reinforcement.

98
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:45,588
This is nothing like what we've heard.

99
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:47,667
On the contrary,

100
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:49,428
back in Jiyang,

101
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:51,148
He Yan reacted weirdly

102
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,467
when she heard that He Rufei

103
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:53,867
made Chai Anxi withhold

104
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:55,588
Xiao Zhongwu's plea for help.

105
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:58,188
And after she heard that seven out of

106
00:05:58,268 --> 00:05:59,588
the Eight Warriors died,

107
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:01,708
she wielded her whip all night.

108
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:04,107
Only deep bonds could cause

109
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:05,467
such a reaction.

110
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,427
She then rushed to Rundu overnight
to help Li Kuang

111
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,867
defend the city.

112
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,507
And Li Kuang

113
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:14,188
is one of He Rufei's Eight Warriors.

114
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:16,427
Connecting the dots,

115
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:18,148
the coincidences pile up.

116
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:22,347
Are you suggesting

117
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:25,708
the current General Feihong
is an impostor

118
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,307
and Miss He is...?

119
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:28,147
That's right.

120
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,227
That's my second reason for coming here.

121
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:33,708
Only in Rundu

122
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:35,347
can I unravel these doubts.

123
00:06:35,987 --> 00:06:37,107
And it's proven

124
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:38,188
that I'm right.

125
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:39,987
She knows about

126
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:41,268
the secret tunnel,

127
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,708
masters He Rufei's martial skills.

128
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:45,427
and even impersonates

129
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:47,028
General Feihong perfectly.

130
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:49,748
All these clues point to her,

131
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,548
proving

132
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:53,788
that she

133
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:56,508
is the true General Feihong.

134
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:58,307
Young Master.

135
00:06:58,427 --> 00:06:59,628
You can report this

136
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,588
to Chancellor Xu once we return.

137
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:03,867
Tell him that you came

138
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:04,948
to investigate.

139
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:06,588
In that case,

140
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:08,867
he won't blame you

141
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:10,347
for coming here without permission.

142
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:12,708
From Chai Anxi's account,

143
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,148
Master had contacted
the current He Rufei

144
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:17,427
even before the Mingshui Battle.

145
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,307
This isn't merely He Rufei's secret.

146
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:23,227
It's also Master's secret.

147
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:25,467
Given his trust issue,

148
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:27,148
I can't tell him that

149
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,188
I've learned his secrets.

150
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:31,227
So how will you

151
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:33,588
explain it to Chancellor Xu?

152
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:35,588
He Rufei has caused so much trouble.

153
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:37,068
Xiao Jue and He Yan

154
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:38,427
won't let this go easily.

155
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:40,268
He Rufei is in deep trouble.

156
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,028
Master lacks capable aides.

157
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:43,188
He'll need me.

158
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,388
And his past misdeeds

159
00:07:45,828 --> 00:07:46,948
will inevitably surface.

160
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,987
He'll reap what he's sown.

161
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:52,068
Though a mentor is to be

162
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:53,427
revered as a father,

163
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:55,948
when it comes to Wei,

164
00:07:56,828 --> 00:07:58,028
I have my principles.

165
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,227
I can't feign ignorance

166
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:02,028
of his treason

167
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:05,028
just because he's my master.

168
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:08,588
Yingxiang.

169
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:09,947
Make preparations.

170
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:11,667
We'll head back tomorrow.

171
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:12,947
Understood.

172
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:23,667
Mr. He, Commander Xiao.

173
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:26,868
Mr. Chu.

174
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:33,468
I'm heading back today

175
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:34,947
and came to say goodbye.

176
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,188
Today?

177
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:39,907
We will return soon.

178
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:42,427
Won't you join us
to look after each other?

179
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:45,787
To be honest,

180
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:47,268
I came here

181
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:48,707
without Master's permission.

182
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:51,508
So I must return earlier

183
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:52,707
to ask for forgiveness.

184
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:55,907
Mr. Chu.

185
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:57,188
Take a seat.

186
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:03,988
Mr. Chu.

187
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,667
About what happened
in Jiyang, Huayuan, and Rundu,

188
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,707
have you suspected

189
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:10,268
that these battles

190
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:11,748
weren't coincidental?

191
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:15,228
These battles were indeed suspicious.

192
00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:16,827
Back in Jiyang,

193
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,988
we found Wutuo spies in the city.

194
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,187
As for Huayuan and Rundu,

195
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:24,108
Wutuo forces

196
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:27,628
couldn't have besieged them
so effortlessly without informants.

197
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:29,228
Rundu especially.

198
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:31,028
Commander Li mentioned

199
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:32,868
that the city's defenses

200
00:09:33,628 --> 00:09:35,707
were utterly useless during the siege.

201
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:37,228
It proves that

202
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:38,707
the enemies

203
00:09:38,707 --> 00:09:41,148
obtained Rundu's defense layouts
long beforehand.

204
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,588
Mr. Chu.

205
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:44,868
As smart as you are,

206
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,268
you must have realized

207
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,468
that all the traces

208
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:50,547
point to one person.

209
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,508
Yet even so,

210
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:56,067
won't you rein in your path?

211
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,228
Everything points

212
00:10:01,587 --> 00:10:02,787
directly to my master.

213
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:06,148
But these are speculations.

214
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,667
Even with Chai Anxi's testimony,

215
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:09,667
there's no proof.

216
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,427
I owe everything to my master.

217
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:13,628
I can't sever my ties with him
until I find

218
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:14,708
solid evidence.

219
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:17,108
Even if there is evidence,

220
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:19,068
you wouldn't

221
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:20,988
forsake your master, would you?

222
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:23,148
After all, you learned the way

223
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:25,148
of doing things from him.

224
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:29,787
Please elaborate.

225
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:31,748
After the Battle of Que City,

226
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:34,187
all sorts of rumors ran rampant.

227
00:10:34,587 --> 00:10:35,427
Our investigation

228
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:37,348
suggested it was your doing.

229
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:39,588
In Yezhou,

230
00:10:39,988 --> 00:10:41,348
Feinu fought a masked woman

231
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:43,228
while retrieving the tax ledgers.

232
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:44,707
Her physique

233
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,748
and mannerisms

234
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,667
closely resembled your maid.

235
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:54,348
Coincidentally,

236
00:10:55,307 --> 00:10:56,707
that same maid was absent

237
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:58,748
from your side at the time.

238
00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:02,268
Later, Sun Xiangfu was assassinated.

239
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:04,588
All these events

240
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:06,667
seem

241
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:09,348
connected to you.

242
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:10,787
Commander Xiao,

243
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:14,228
you yourself used the word "seem".

244
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,748
Baseless claims aren't worth mentioning.

245
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:20,747
However,

246
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:22,587
I've found something else

247
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:25,028
rather intriguing.

248
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:27,988
While investigating
the assassins who killed Chai Anxi

249
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:29,628
in Jiyang,

250
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,468
someone secretly helped us,

251
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:35,228
making the inquiry remarkably smooth,

252
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:38,067
which saved us a lot of time.

253
00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:41,187
You were the only other person aware

254
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,787
of Chancellor Xu's collusion with Wutuo.

255
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,988
Since the assassins were Wutuo agents,

256
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:49,787
naturally, we suspected Chancellor Xu.

257
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,988
In Jiyang and Rundu,

258
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:55,587
you defied Chancellor Xu's orders

259
00:11:55,988 --> 00:11:57,787
and defended against Wutuo forces

260
00:11:58,148 --> 00:11:59,187
with us.

261
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,028
As Chancellor Xu's disciple,

262
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,108
why did you

263
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:05,707
do that?

264
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:09,547
You know well, Commander Xiao,

265
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,988
officials often act against their will.

266
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,108
Different stances
dictate different actions.

267
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:16,748
But everything I've done

268
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:18,348
follows the natural course.

269
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:21,907
I will never
cross the ethical boundaries.

270
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,028
I believe that

271
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,787
you have principles.

272
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:28,028
But above those principles,

273
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,988
right and wrong exist.

274
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:31,388
I hope you won't

275
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,707
have to face so many helpless situations

276
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:34,988
or feel powerless.

277
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:41,068
Thank you
for your kindness and blessings.

278
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:47,388
I'll take my leave now.

279
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:48,828
Farewell.

280
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,108
I hope you don't blame me

281
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,468
for not telling you those earlier.

282
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:05,747
Of course not.

283
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,067
But Commander,

284
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:10,547
Mr. Chu isn't truly evil.

285
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:14,028
Perhaps, we could work with him one day.

286
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,028
She's just a masked impostor,

287
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:30,228
hiding behind others' prestige.

288
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,388
Yet they praise her false heroism

289
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:35,547
for lifting Rundu's siege.

290
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:39,348
I am the true General Feihong.

291
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:42,468
That's me.

292
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,108
My dear sister.

293
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:57,468
The soul-calming lantern
in Yuhua Temple couldn't suppress you.

294
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:01,067
The trap in Rundu couldn't kill you.

295
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:04,587
You are truly

296
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:07,628
relentless as a lingering ghost.

297
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:12,028
(General He.)

298
00:14:12,988 --> 00:14:15,508
Mr. Maningbu sent you a message.

299
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:18,947
Wutuo sincerely seeks cooperation.

300
00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:21,108
We agreed

301
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:23,907
to help you kill the seven warriors

302
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,868
in exchange for Rundu.

303
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:28,468
But

304
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,707
where did that fake
General Feihong come from?

305
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:35,468
And why was General Fengyun in Rundu?

306
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:36,988
The Rundu battle

307
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:39,947
cost Wutuo significant forces.

308
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,587
And in Jiyang,

309
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,827
those two people ruined

310
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,748
Wutuo's plan.

311
00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:47,587
Could it be

312
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:50,587
that Chancellor Xu changed strategies?

313
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:55,108
Have you reconciled
and colluded with Xiao Jue

314
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,947
to fool Mr. Maningbu

315
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,427
and mock Wutuo?

316
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:04,267
This time,

317
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:06,827
I was truly outplayed.

318
00:15:09,427 --> 00:15:10,267
However,

319
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:12,148
I genuinely wish

320
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:13,988
to cooperate with Mr. Maningbu.

321
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,907
Please convey

322
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:21,228
my deepest apologies to Mr. Maningbu.

323
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,907
Since you put it this way,

324
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:27,388
we naturally believe you.

325
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:31,508
But Wutuo has suffered huge losses.

326
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:32,588
General He.

327
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:33,988
When you meet Chancellor Xu,

328
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:35,988
please tell him

329
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:39,388
that Wutuo won't
accept such humiliation.

330
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:44,707
We expect Chancellor Xu
to provide a reasonable explanation.

331
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:57,547
Chancellor.

332
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,628
His Majesty has allowed Xiao Jue
to return and report

333
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,228
on the Rundu Battle.

334
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:05,067
He knew I wanted to kill him in Rundu.

335
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:06,628
Now he's coming back for revenge.

336
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:09,148
And the Mingshui Battle, Chancellor.

337
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,427
They will never let this go.

338
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:12,747
Chancellor.

339
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:14,028
Please help me.

340
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:16,268
Were you trying

341
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:19,187
to kill Xiao Jue in the Rundu battle?

342
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:24,707
At this point,

343
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,268
are you still hiding the truth?

344
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:33,067
Who is that masked
young general in Rundu?

345
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:35,307
Can anyone just

346
00:16:35,468 --> 00:16:38,547
impersonate General Feihong at will?

347
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:40,508
He Rufei.

348
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:43,787
How dare you keep me in the dark

349
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:45,348
about this!

350
00:16:46,748 --> 00:16:47,588
I apologize.

351
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:49,388
Please forgive me.

352
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:50,948
Chancellor.

353
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:53,388
I wasn't sure
whether my sister was alive.

354
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,748
That's why I used
the Rundu Battle as bait.

355
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,067
I planned to kill her in Rundu
even if she was alive.

356
00:16:58,468 --> 00:16:59,388
But I didn't expect

357
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:01,468
that she would be so hard to kill.

358
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,587
Hard to kill?

359
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,508
Had you disclosed this earlier,

360
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,627
you wouldn't be
kneeling before me in disgrace.

361
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:11,948
You barely won

362
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:14,147
the Huayuan Battle,

363
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,708
losing seven top warriors.

364
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:19,948
Someone disguised
as General Feihong in Rundu

365
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:22,228
to intimidate the Wutuo Army,

366
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:23,827
while the real General Feihong

367
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:26,067
failed to provide timely reinforcement.

368
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:28,468
His Majesty has heard about all this.

369
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:34,067
Both Huayuan and Rundu battles

370
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:36,827
bear a striking resemblance
to Mingshui Battle.

371
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:39,147
People will inevitably draw connections.

372
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:43,107
Xiao Jue and your sister
will pursue this relentlessly.

373
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:46,908
His Majesty will also order
a full investigation.

374
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:50,268
They might even reopen
the Mingshui Battle investigation.

375
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:55,668
He Rufei.

376
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:58,067
Your concealment

377
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:00,748
has put us both in deep trouble.

378
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:03,948
The Wutuo people
won't let us off, either.

379
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:07,308
That's right.

380
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:08,268
Chancellor.

381
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:09,787
You're right.

382
00:18:10,428 --> 00:18:11,587
Rest assured, Chancellor.

383
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:15,108
I will never
keep anything from you again.

384
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,908
Chancellor, please get me out of this.

385
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,668
Chancellor, please save me this time.

386
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:22,587
Please!

387
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:23,748
No more secrets ever again.

388
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:27,827
Good that you've come
to this realization.

389
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:33,468
Absolute transparency
is the key to our collaboration.

390
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,187
That's enough.

391
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:36,468
I will find a way

392
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,787
to pacify the Wutuo people.

393
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:40,587
And I will emphasize

394
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,988
your contributions

395
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:45,508
to His Majesty,

396
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:46,708
while shifting blame

397
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:49,268
onto the enemies.

398
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,988
As for Xiao Jue and your sister,

399
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:54,107
if my predictions hold,

400
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:57,147
they're planning to use the scandal

401
00:18:57,188 --> 00:18:59,028
of your family swapping your identities

402
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:00,347
as leverage.

403
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:03,387
Now that they had finally
found a chance,

404
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:05,587
they requested permission to return.

405
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:08,268
They'll use you to get what they want.

406
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:13,908
We can't

407
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:17,107
let them come back alive.

408
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:19,467
Commander Li.

409
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,827
Open this letter

410
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,428
after we leave.

411
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:31,187
General Fengyun, Attendant Wu'an,
General Yan. Safe travels.

412
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:32,508
I'll drink with you

413
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,748
in the capital

414
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,708
after the Mid-Autumn Festival.

415
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:41,348
Wait.

416
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:48,787
Attendant Wu'an, a moment please.

417
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:54,828
Attendant Wu'an.

418
00:19:55,147 --> 00:19:56,107
We will never

419
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,147
forget what you said to us.

420
00:19:58,627 --> 00:19:59,988
We'll do our best to live on.

421
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,188
We've set up a textile workshop,

422
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:05,107
making a living on our own.

423
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:08,187
Though we can't fight enemies as you do,

424
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,587
we can make minor contributions.

425
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:13,627
We'll bring Rundu's
brocade weaving to greater heights

426
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:15,028
across the entire Wei.

427
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:17,352
No job is superior or inferior.

428
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,268
Everything improves

429
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,028
through gradual efforts.

430
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:22,708
Change will come

431
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:24,147
as long as you take action.

432
00:20:24,827 --> 00:20:25,668
Then I'll wait

433
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:27,347
to see Rundu's brocade

434
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:28,547
known throughout Wei.

435
00:20:29,307 --> 00:20:30,147
Alright.

436
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:32,387
You are indeed popular.

437
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:34,307
But I don't envy you at all.

438
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:36,068
I'm leaving, He Yan.

439
00:20:36,627 --> 00:20:38,188
My wife is waiting at home.

440
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:39,668
Got it.

441
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:41,508
Only you have a wife, huh?

442
00:20:42,587 --> 00:20:44,268
Attendant Wu'an inspires people

443
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:46,428
with the resilience he possesses.

444
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,187
Many people may
show consideration for others,

445
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:52,308
but

446
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:53,748
those who would

447
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:55,147
sacrifice themselves

448
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,107
for other people at critical moments

449
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:00,147
are exceedingly rare.

450
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:02,107
(He truly resembles)

451
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:03,268
(General Feihong back then.)

452
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:16,948
Your Majesty.

453
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:18,748
During the Rundu Battle,

454
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:21,667
He Yan led the locals
in unwavering defense,

455
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:24,308
while Xiao Jue
offered timely reinforcements.

456
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:25,908
Together, they defended Rundu

457
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:27,307
against the Wutuo army.

458
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:28,908
It was a great contribution.

459
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:31,188
I'm well aware of Xiao Jue's

460
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:32,428
military prowess.

461
00:21:32,988 --> 00:21:33,988
But He Yan

462
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:35,827
used to be relatively unknown,

463
00:21:36,107 --> 00:21:38,787
but recently
he's been showing his talent.

464
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:40,827
He's a real talent.

465
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:42,387
Your Majesty.

466
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,508
In my humble opinion,

467
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:44,868
Attendant Wu'an

468
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:46,387
has the potential

469
00:21:46,668 --> 00:21:47,508
to be a general.

470
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:49,067
Most remarkably,

471
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:51,347
his heart beats with patriotic bravery

472
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:52,988
and unyielding resolve.

473
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,908
On the contrary, He Rufei,

474
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,228
once considered capable,

475
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:02,188
has proven utterly incompetent.

476
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:03,668
He lost

477
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:06,787
seven of our top warriors in Huayuan.

478
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:09,427
Your Majesty.

479
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:10,627
The Huayuan Battle

480
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:12,347
was a costly victory.

481
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,667
But our enemies are well-equipped,

482
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:16,468
and they far outnumber us.

483
00:22:17,147 --> 00:22:17,987
I believe

484
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:19,187
that General He

485
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:21,827
may have done his utmost.

486
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:25,028
"May have?"

487
00:22:31,787 --> 00:22:32,627
Enough.

488
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:33,868
Forget about them.

489
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:35,707
Mr. Chu,

490
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:38,627
you put yourself at risk
and defended Rundu.

491
00:22:39,147 --> 00:22:40,428
It deserves recognition.

492
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:42,228
Why didn't you bring it up?

493
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:44,827
My minor contributions
aren't worth mentioning.

494
00:22:48,228 --> 00:22:50,387
Last time, you asked for rewards.

495
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,188
Why are you declining them now?

496
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,428
Your previous rewards

497
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:57,788
allowed me to take action in Rundu.

498
00:22:58,228 --> 00:23:00,188
I merely wanted to serve Your Majesty.

499
00:23:00,468 --> 00:23:02,147
Thus, I need no further rewards.

500
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:05,547
Xiao Jue and Chancellor Xu
don't get along.

501
00:23:05,988 --> 00:23:08,067
As Chancellor Xu's prized disciple,

502
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:10,307
it's commendable that you're speaking

503
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:12,347
in favor of Xiao Jue.

504
00:23:14,028 --> 00:23:16,508
Ministers may differ politically,

505
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,028
but we stand united in loyalty

506
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:21,147
to Your Majesty.

507
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:25,468
Pass on my decree.

508
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:28,228
Director Chu Zhao

509
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:30,107
of the Ministry of War

510
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:33,708
is a true pillar of Wei,
having shouldered my burdens repeatedly.

511
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:34,987
I hereby

512
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:36,787
appoint Chu Zhao

513
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,948
as Fourth-Rank Vice Minister of War.

514
00:23:40,228 --> 00:23:41,188
Yes, Your Majesty.

515
00:23:44,827 --> 00:23:47,067
I humbly thank Your Majesty.

516
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:03,547
Master, I went to Rundu on my own

517
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:06,028
against your instructions.
Please forgive me.

518
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:20,147
His Majesty thinks highly of you
and has given you

519
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,587
another promotion.

520
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:26,268
You don't need to apologize.

521
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:31,547
You flatter me.

522
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:32,947
I'm ashamed.

523
00:24:33,387 --> 00:24:37,307
You've risen in such a short time,

524
00:24:37,908 --> 00:24:42,268
soon to become
His Majesty's right-hand man

525
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,627
and a pillar of Wei.

526
00:24:45,988 --> 00:24:46,988
You are truly

527
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:49,988
my most accomplished disciple.

528
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:52,787
I had no choice.

529
00:24:53,428 --> 00:24:54,948
The circumstances forced my hand.

530
00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:01,827
Xiao Jue and He Yan

531
00:25:01,908 --> 00:25:04,428
are about to return for rewards.

532
00:25:04,748 --> 00:25:06,988
Is this what you mean by "no choice"?

533
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:11,028
They kept distinguishing themselves.

534
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,787
I grew anxious, thinking

535
00:25:12,988 --> 00:25:14,508
that I couldn't just let them be.

536
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:17,108
So I rushed to Rundu
without seeking permission.

537
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:23,988
The entire court knows

538
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:25,468
that I'm your disciple.

539
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:28,107
His Majesty may have promoted me,

540
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:29,508
but in reality,

541
00:25:30,147 --> 00:25:31,387
he was honoring you.

542
00:25:32,508 --> 00:25:33,348
Moreover,

543
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:34,588
the higher I climb,

544
00:25:35,307 --> 00:25:37,387
the more useful I can be to you.

545
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:46,468
Since you wish to share my burdens,

546
00:25:46,908 --> 00:25:48,547
you should know

547
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:52,147
my greatest concern at hand

548
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:54,147
is He Rufei.

549
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:57,347
You just returned from court.

550
00:25:57,787 --> 00:25:58,988
What is His Majesty

551
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:01,547
thinking about him?

552
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:03,627
His Majesty is indeed displeased

553
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:06,227
with He Rufei's performance at Huayuan.

554
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:08,508
But I've pleaded his case

555
00:26:08,587 --> 00:26:09,508
by explaining that

556
00:26:10,188 --> 00:26:11,748
our enemies outnumbered us,

557
00:26:12,347 --> 00:26:14,948
and He Rufei may have done his best.

558
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,147
Do you truly believe that?

559
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:24,908
In my opinion,

560
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:27,307
it's fishy that the seven warriors

561
00:26:27,547 --> 00:26:28,827
died in an ambush.

562
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,908
But after the Rundu Battle,

563
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:32,428
I figured it all out.

564
00:26:33,228 --> 00:26:35,988
The Rundu Battle was a trap
He Rufei set for Xiao Jue.

565
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,067
He Rufei needed

566
00:26:38,428 --> 00:26:41,468
huge losses in Huayuan
to avoid reinforcing Rundu.

567
00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:43,067
That's how the trap

568
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:44,508
would work.

569
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:46,308
However,

570
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:49,067
Xiao Jue summoned Yan He

571
00:26:49,387 --> 00:26:50,627
and defended Rundu.

572
00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:52,508
He Rufei

573
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:54,748
miscalculated and lost.

574
00:26:57,468 --> 00:26:58,308
Alright.

575
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,908
It seems

576
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:01,988
that you have indeed

577
00:27:02,268 --> 00:27:03,988
exerted great effort.

578
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:09,307
I heard Zilan came.

579
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:10,827
I knew he'd be here.

580
00:27:12,188 --> 00:27:13,508
Why haven't you come to see me?

581
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:15,268
Alright.

582
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:17,867
My business here concludes.

583
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:20,587
Pingting keeps mentioning you.

584
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:21,948
Keep her company.

585
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,787
You must be busy, Master.
Don't let me disrupt you.

586
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:31,627
Sorry.

587
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:32,908
I have things

588
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,067
to attend to today.

589
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:36,587
What about tomorrow?

590
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:37,827
I have other jobs.

591
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:39,068
The day after?

592
00:27:40,228 --> 00:27:41,188
And beyond?

593
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,872
(Chu Mansion)

594
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:51,708
- Is the banquet ready?
- All set.

595
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,627
Don't make any mistakes.

596
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:54,467
Rest assured.

597
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:55,428
It's an important day.

598
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:58,347
- We must please him.
- Mr. Chu.

599
00:27:58,347 --> 00:27:59,347
Rest assured.

600
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:07,827
Zilan.

601
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:09,028
You're finally back.

602
00:28:09,508 --> 00:28:11,107
We've been waiting

603
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:12,748
to welcome you with a feast.

604
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:14,187
That's right.

605
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:15,708
Sorry I've kept you waiting.

606
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:17,387
I went to report

607
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:18,587
to His Majesty first

608
00:28:19,547 --> 00:28:21,147
and paid respects to my master.

609
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:22,868
That's why I'm late.

610
00:28:23,228 --> 00:28:24,068
It's alright.

611
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:25,868
No problem.

612
00:28:26,347 --> 00:28:28,748
His Majesty thinks highly of you.

613
00:28:29,228 --> 00:28:31,547
Official duties take precedence.

614
00:28:35,428 --> 00:28:36,268
Yeah.

615
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:37,627
Focus on your work.

616
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:40,587
Leave trivial matters
to your uncle and me.

617
00:28:41,268 --> 00:28:42,347
Let me know

618
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:43,827
if you need anything.

619
00:28:44,268 --> 00:28:46,787
We'll arrange everything.

620
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:48,147
Actually, there is

621
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:49,147
nothing

622
00:28:49,147 --> 00:28:49,987
I need.

623
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:52,028
But one thing has weighed on me

624
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:53,787
for years.

625
00:29:00,147 --> 00:29:01,307
What's troubling you?

626
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:03,147
Tell us.

627
00:29:05,387 --> 00:29:06,827
Don't you want your

628
00:29:06,908 --> 00:29:07,827
scandalous mother,

629
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:09,547
who gave birth unwed,

630
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,107
to enter the Chu ancestral hall?

631
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:13,428
Then rise

632
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,107
to prominence quickly.

633
00:29:17,908 --> 00:29:19,147
My deepest wish

634
00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:21,428
is only for my mother

635
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:24,188
to find eternal peace.

636
00:29:35,188 --> 00:29:36,668
So, you still don't think

637
00:29:36,947 --> 00:29:37,787
my mother...

638
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:38,627
You got us wrong.

639
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:39,627
You got us wrong.

640
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:42,867
My sister was virtuous and dignified.

641
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:44,867
She deserves to be enshrined

642
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:46,587
in the ancestral hall.

643
00:29:50,268 --> 00:29:51,108
Zilan,

644
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:53,708
your mother...

645
00:29:56,908 --> 00:29:58,228
Your aunt was

646
00:29:58,627 --> 00:30:00,547
not good with words.

647
00:30:01,188 --> 00:30:02,668
Please don't take

648
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:05,107
her gibberish to heart.

649
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,508
I was stupid and often misspoke.

650
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:11,708
P-Please forgive me.

651
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:15,387
In that case,

652
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:17,827
I truly appreciate it.

653
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:19,348
Our pleasure.

654
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:20,627
Our pleasure.

655
00:30:31,803 --> 00:30:33,928
(Late Mother, Chu Mingfang)

656
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:35,348
Mother,

657
00:30:36,228 --> 00:30:37,428
I'm bringing you home.

658
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:40,468
From now on,

659
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:42,708
no one will speak ill of you

660
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:44,748
ever again.

661
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:53,268
My dear, poor sister.

662
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:55,908
I've wronged you.

663
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:57,028
But rest assured.

664
00:30:57,268 --> 00:30:58,147
From now on,

665
00:30:58,228 --> 00:30:59,188
I won't let you

666
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:00,988
suffer any humiliation again.

667
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,347
You have acknowledged your mistakes.

668
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:16,228
Mother's spirit must find this

669
00:31:17,228 --> 00:31:18,268
comforting.

670
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:20,547
All these years,

671
00:31:20,988 --> 00:31:22,228
only I've been coming

672
00:31:22,468 --> 00:31:23,908
to visit my mother.

673
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:27,748
In fact, she always enjoyed company.

674
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:30,387
If you don't mind it,

675
00:31:31,228 --> 00:31:32,307
please come more often

676
00:31:32,988 --> 00:31:34,708
and offer my mother some incense.

677
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:37,147
Should we come often?

678
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:38,387
Silence.

679
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:41,907
Absolutely.

680
00:31:42,587 --> 00:31:43,427
Absolutely.

681
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:45,708
We will.

683
