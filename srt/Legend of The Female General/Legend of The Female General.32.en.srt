Offer incense.

25
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,290
Present jade and silk.

Bow thrice.

32
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,130
Rise.

33
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,170
Get up.

34
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,690
The winter sacrificial ceremony
is concluded.

35
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,610
Officials,

36
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,650
please proceed to Longtai Hall.

37
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:23,890
Yan He.

38
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,370
When did you arrive?

39
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,970
I always thought
you were short and thin,

40
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,610
but never expected you were a woman.

41
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,770
Well...

42
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,610
Do you look down on me

43
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,570
and disdain being friends with me

44
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,410
because I'm a woman now?

45
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,130
Do you think

46
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,490
I am that kind of base person?

47
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,810
I'm angry because

48
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,250
you and Xiao Jue hid this from me.

49
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,930
We had to.

50
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,170
I didn't want to either.

51
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,530
By the way,

52
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,810
how is your wife recently?

53
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,210
She's quite well.

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,650
The baby

55
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,850
has behaved.

56
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,970
But the Huayuan battle
turned out like this,

57
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,210
how dare He Rufei show his face here?

58
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,850
Excellent.

59
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,210
Everyone is here.

60
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,730
Let's go.

61
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,970
Greetings, Your Majesty.

62
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,250
Rise, everyone.

63
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,690
I am Maningbu,

64
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,890
greetings to Emperor Wei.

65
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,090
You have traveled far,

66
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:53,970
must be weary.

67
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,810
As a foreign envoy,

68
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,450
I've heard of

69
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,650
your ear for talent

70
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,850
and prudent governance.

71
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,530
What a model ruler of our age.

72
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,970
I deeply respect you.

73
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,610
Today,

74
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,890
I want to offer you a toast.

75
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,130
Your words

76
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,970
are really flattering me.

77
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,730
Your generous hospitality

78
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,290
really moves me.

79
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,850
Wei and Wutuo are neighbors,

80
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,570
so we should share brotherly bonds

81
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,170
as we do now in harmony.

82
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,370
With this opportunity,

83
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,450
Wutuo wishes to ally with Wei,

84
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,650
bonding our relationship,

85
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,290
and ending all conflicts.

86
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,010
If we can truly cease the war,

87
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,290
nothing could be better.

88
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,770
After our alliance is sealed

89
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,810
and establish trade markets,

90
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,770
I'm sure we can

91
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,090
get peace and benefits.

92
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,410
Regarding the trade markets,

93
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,250
details to be confirmed.

94
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,570
Please be more patient.

95
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,530
It seems Wei

96
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,610
lacks sincerity in facilitating

97
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,930
the alliance.

98
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,450
What?

99
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,130
We must let Wutuo gain all advantages

100
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,770
to prove our sincerity?

101
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,570
Marquis Wu'an.

102
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,530
You are

103
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,170
being too arrogant.

104
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,250
Whether the trade markets open

105
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,970
is not

106
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,850
for you to decide.

107
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,210
You fought Wutuo several times,

108
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,850
yet now you speak

109
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,010
for Wutuo.

110
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,570
Have their blows made you

111
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,330
a turncoat now?

112
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:18,890
Your Majesty,

113
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,890
when I led the Fuyue Army

114
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,930
to quell rebellions,

115
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,450
my goal

116
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,490
was the Wei's prosperity and peace.

117
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,890
My lifelong wish

118
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,970
is to safeguard

119
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,530
the Wei's land for you.

120
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,490
Apart from that,

121
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,410
there's nothing more.

122
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,010
Your Majesty, please trust

123
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,650
my loyalty.

124
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,690
General Feihong is a loyal,

125
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,970
peerless warrior unmatched

126
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,250
by a thousand.

127
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,530
He would never

128
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,690
commit acts of treason.

129
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,770
But the question remains:

130
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,810
Are you General Feihong?

131
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,490
Nonsense.

132
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,330
Your Majesty,

133
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:16,810
I have

134
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,210
to accuse He Rufei
of three major crimes.

135
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,650
Three major crimes?

136
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,250
What do you mean?

137
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,250
First crime:

138
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,049
Substitution fraud

139
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,130
by stealing General Feihong's identity.

140
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,850
- What?
- What?

141
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,530
Is this true?

142
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,090
Please summon a witness.

143
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,010
This person can verify

144
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,330
the truth of my claim.

145
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:56,850
Summon!

146
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,330
By the imperial decree,

147
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,890
summon him!

148
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,130
Commander of Rundu Li Kuang.

149
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,570
Greetings, Your Majesty.

150
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,650
So you're the Commander of Rundu

151
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,290
Li Kuang.

152
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,490
In the Rundu battle,

153
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,930
you deserve recognition.

154
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:25,930
Please rise.

155
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,290
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

156
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,210
(Commander,)

157
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:37,970
it's been days.

158
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:39,930
You are...

159
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,210
He Yan?

160
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,610
I'm He Yan

161
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,610
who fought

162
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,130
with you at Rundu.

163
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:49,970
I am Li Kuang.

164
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,770
Greetings, General Feihong.

165
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,050
Commander Li.

166
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,050
You'd read

167
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,690
this letter after we leave.

168
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,130
Jujube and turtle...

169
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,330
Come back soon.

170
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,410
We Eight Warriors

171
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,610
were born into poverty.

172
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,930
Most were illiterate,

173
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,610
so we devised

174
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:26,890
such a crude method

175
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,850
for communication.

176
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,450
These codes are

177
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,570
known only to us eight

178
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,090
and General Feihong.

179
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,970
Now seven were gone,

180
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,650
leaving only

181
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,650
me and

182
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,810
General Feihong.

183
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,530
Rise.

184
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,170
I

185
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,930
am late.

186
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,970
Sorry, General.

187
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,970
Rise.

188
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,290
You're not late,

189
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,330
but arrive in time.

190
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:11,970
I

191
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,890
dare not claim merit.

192
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,050
If not for General Fengyun

193
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,770
and General Feihong's

194
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,690
timely aid,

195
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,130
Rundu's people

196
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,370
would've been killed

197
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,050
by Wutuo.

198
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,970
Li, explain yourself.

199
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,970
The ones who saved Rundu

200
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:32,970
were General Fengyun

201
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,010
and Marquis Wu'an.

202
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,170
Why mentioned General Feihong?

203
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,570
Because

204
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,010
Marquis Wu'an

205
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,170
is the genuine General Feihong!

206
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,410
General He,

207
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,570
what do you have to say?

208
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,650
Your Majesty,

209
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,770
this man conspires with He Yan

210
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,890
in a vile scheme

211
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,410
to frame me!

212
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,250
That's strange.

213
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,450
Li Kuang served as your deputy,

214
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,170
sharing life-and-death struggles

215
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,290
and fighting with you.

216
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,450
Why would he frame you now?

217
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,810
Perhaps in the Rundu Battle,

218
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,850
my late reinforcements

219
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,330
angered him,

220
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,970
making him He Yan's pawn.

221
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,010
He Rufei.

222
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,690
Why didn't you save

223
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,570
your former deputy?

224
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,650
His statements
are full of inconsistencies.

225
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,370
He's deliberately slandering me.

226
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,290
I'm innocent!

227
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,930
Please judge fairly.

228
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,130
It seems you deny

229
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,570
the first crime charge.

230
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,410
Marquis Wu'an.

231
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,650
Second one.

232
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,370
Second crime:

233
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,570
To conceal his false identity,

234
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,210
he eliminated

235
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,690
his comrades!

236
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,130
I have evidence

237
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,730
to present.

238
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,530
Get it to me.

239
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,290
Yes.

240
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,000
(To Xiao Jue)

241
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,810
(Assassination, in Chonghuai)

242
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,050
The assassins outside Chonghuai.

243
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,570
General He,

244
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,450
have you forgotten them?

245
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,170
My lord,

246
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,690
we discovered

247
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,650
tattooed markings on

248
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,570
one assassin's body.

249
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,170
He might be a former prisoner.

250
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,410
By tracing these markings,

251
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,730
we can determine

252
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,050
when and where he was imprisoned,

253
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,090
thus,

254
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,210
we can know his real name

255
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,690
and background.

256
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,610
Yang Mingzhi has replied.

257
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,050
He found the assassins' origins.

258
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,170
They're linked to He Rufei.

259
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,450
So,

260
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,490
that tattooed assassin was

261
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,050
a distant relative
of He Mansion's steward.

262
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,730
They did everything

263
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,290
to eliminate me.

264
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:43,970
You thought

265
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,930
that dead men

266
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,770
could tell nothing.

267
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,050
But traces can't be erased.

268
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,210
Dead men still tell us something.

269
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,290
I don't know

270
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,730
what you're talking about.

271
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,130
Your steward

272
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,650
acted so recklessly,

273
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,090
yet you know nothing?

274
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,490
I failed to supervise him.

275
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,130
Your Majesty, forgive me.

276
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,410
Besides repeated attempts to kill me,

277
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,890
in the Huayuan Battle,

278
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,610
the Fuyue Army's Seven Tiger Generals

279
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,890
were ambushed and killed together.

280
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,850
It's another scheme

281
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,610
by He Rufei!

282
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,370
Things change in the battlefields.

283
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,890
We have

284
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,210
to be flexible.

285
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:36,970
He Rufei.

286
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,130
I don't care who you are.

287
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,410
But you fought in

288
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,250
the Huayuan Battle.

289
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,050
Just tell me,

290
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,170
did you truly abandon

291
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,490
thousands of soldiers

292
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,690
for personal gain?

293
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,850
Punish He Rufei severely, Your Majesty!

294
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,650
Avenge the unjustly slain

295
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,930
from the Huayuan Battle!

296
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,450
Punish He Rufei severely, Your Majesty!

297
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,370
Avenge the unjustly slain

298
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,050
from the Huayuan Battle!

299
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,970
Third crime:

300
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,290
Colluding with Wutuo,

301
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,490
and treason against Wei!

302
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,450
False accusations!

303
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:42,970
He Yan.

304
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,690
You have no evidence

305
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,210
at all.

306
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,170
I do!

307
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,930
- It's her!
- Indeed.

308
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:21,849
(Why is she here?)

309
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,770
Your Majesty,

310
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,210
these letters

311
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,530
are secretly hidden by He Rufei.

312
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,250
And I stole them.

313
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,090
They contain

314
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,330
evidence

315
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,890
of He Rufei's treason.

316
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,610
Get them to me.

317
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,530
A Madam He seeks audience

318
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,530
outside the hall.

319
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,610
Madam He?

320
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,650
Who's that?

321
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,490
Bring her in.

322
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:16,650
Yes.

323
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,810
I heard the Tianxing Platform

324
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,170
is about to hold a night banquet.

325
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,930
These letters

326
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:31,810
should prove helpful.

327
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,770
Thank you.

328
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,570
General Fengyun.

329
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,610
I have a favor to ask.

330
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,490
Please help me enter the palace,

331
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,810
so I can present these letters myself.

332
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,170
No way.

333
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,130
It'd be dangerous.

334
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:47,650
Madam He.

335
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,250
Don't get involved in it.

336
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,450
Madam He, you don't need to.

337
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,610
General.

338
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,810
I'm doing this for Yan.

339
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,890
I know Rufei resents her.

340
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,810
I watched them

341
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,930
harmed her once,

342
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,330
and I must stop them now.

343
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,290
Please help me, General.

344
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:13,730
Alright.

345
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,330
I'll help you.

346
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,610
Regarding the evidence,

347
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,450
please inform Yan

348
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,450
to reassure her.

349
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,850
But don't tell her that I'd present

350
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,810
the evidence myself.

351
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,250
Your Majesty.

352
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,890
I can testify

353
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,530
that my stepson He Rufei

354
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,530
is not General Feihong at all.

355
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,930
I'm the descendant of a scholar,

356
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,850
living at home with my young daughter.

357
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,370
He Yuansheng coveted
my family's reputation.

358
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,930
Since my family had declined,

359
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,290
he forced me into the He Mansion.

360
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,450
Unexpectedly, soon after,

361
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,610
He Rufei fell gravely ill.

362
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,530
Physicians predicted he'd die early.

363
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,290
He Yuansheng feared losing his title,

364
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,250
yet couldn't bear to abandon his son.

365
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,050
He thought adopting a boy

366
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,090
might let him breed evil ambition,

367
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,170
and be hard to control.

368
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,090
So he made my daughter
disguised as a man

369
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,330
and swap identities with He Rufei.

370
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,970
My daughter has been clever

371
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:18,980
and favors martial arts.

372
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,450
She joined the army early

373
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,970
and risked her life in battlefields,

374
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,570
earning the title General Feihong.

375
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,690
When she returned,

376
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,530
Rufei had recovered fully.

377
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,810
When Your Majesty awarded,

378
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,690
He Rufei was so greedy,

379
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,570
and He Yuansheng feared

380
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,970
He Yan would expose them,

381
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,450
so...

382
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:38,450
they...

383
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,490
So they poisoned

384
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,970
and blinded her.

385
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,050
Later,

386
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,290
they silenced her.

387
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,970
Your Majesty.

388
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,210
My daughter He Yan

389
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,810
is the genuine General Feihong!

390
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,210
- This...
- What!

391
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,370
What's wrong?

392
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,570
Don't trust her!

393
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,490
Your Majesty.

394
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,850
This woman is too sick

395
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,210
to think clearly.

396
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,170
What she said

397
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,290
is completely nonsense.

398
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,130
I...

399
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,930
I was telling all the truth.

400
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,530
Your Majesty, please trust me.

401
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,130
I told no lies.

402
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,130
If I did,

403
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,570
may lightning strike me,

404
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,450
and I'd die horribly,

405
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,050
descend to the netherworld,

406
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,610
and never to escape.

407
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,290
Your Majesty, please trust me.

408
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,170
Hold justice for my daughter.

409
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,890
Your Majesty,

410
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,980
please summon physicians!

411
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,010
Go summon them!

412
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:44,730
Yes.

413
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,290
Imperial physician!

414
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,530
Your Majesty, please trust me.

415
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,130
I was telling all the truth.

416
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,810
I'll stake my life

417
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,810
to prove it.

418
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,610
Why?

419
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,410
As a mother,

420
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,410
I tried to protect everything.

421
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,090
Yet in the end,

422
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,090
I failed to protect anything.

423
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,770
A shameless person

424
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,370
like me

425
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,370
doesn't deserve to live longer.

426
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,450
Rufei,

427
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,690
repent your sins.

428
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,450
Rufei.

429
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,410
Rufei.

430
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,210
Repent your sins.

431
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,330
Ingrate!

432
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,090
Madam.

433
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,810
You're sick.

434
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,090
Really sick!

435
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,370
Your Majesty,

436
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,650
the poison has spread,

437
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,210
and she is beyond cure.

438
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:36,930
Don't cry.

439
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,530
I'm not worth your tears.

440
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,610
Mother.

441
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,010
I...

442
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,410
I finally heard

443
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,170
you call me Mother.

444
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,890
Wonderful.

445
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,330
Cloaked in lotus splendor,

446
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,690
yet adrift without anchor.

447
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,770
Yan.

448
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,170
Live...

449
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,650
Live

450
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,770
well.

451
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,530
Mother!

452
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,770
Monster!

453
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,370
Mother.

454
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,890
Take Madam He away first.

455
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,050
Let her rest in peace.

456
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,650
Mother.

457
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:31,690
He Yan.

458
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,530
He Rufei.

459
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,010
Though we're nominally siblings,

460
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,770
we're destined to fight.

461
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,850
He Rufei!

462
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,090
You deceived me,

463
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,490
falsely claimed official titles,

464
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,170
attempted to silence witnesses,

465
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,290
slaughtered your comrades,

466
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,530
and betrayed the Wei!

467
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,290
How heinous!

468
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,370
Unforgivable!

469
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,890
Now we have witnesses and evidence!

470
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,530
How dare you still deny it?

471
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,570
This matter isn't concluded yet.

472
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,730
Your Majesty shouldn't
convict General He

473
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,490
hastily.

474
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,210
Marquis Wu'an.

475
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,090
How dare you draw sword
before the Emperor?

476
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,290
This is great disrespect!

477
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:57,810
What?

478
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,170
Chancellor Xu, did you forget

479
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,450
that those letters

480
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,050
also implicate you?

481
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,850
Your Majesty.

482
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,530
He Rufei committed countless crimes,

483
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,450
but he's been

484
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,970
manipulated by Xu Jingfu.

485
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,090
Xu Jingfu is the true

486
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,050
mastermind

487
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,930
who's making trouble

488
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,530
and betraying the Wei!

489
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,090
- Nonsense!
- Nonsense!

490
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,410
Exactly.

491
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:41,890
Back in Mingshui,

492
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,610
you killed 30,000 Xiao Army soldiers

493
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,130
to eliminate political rivals.

494
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,610
Back in Yezhou,

495
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,410
you used someone

496
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,850
to kill Sun Xiangfu

497
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,730
to hide your embezzlement.

498
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:54,810
Back in Jiyang,

499
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,810
you colluded with Wutuo,

500
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,530
leading us to nearly lose Jiyang.

501
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,490
In Huayuan and Rundu,

502
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,290
you let He Rufei slaughter

503
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,850
the seven generals,

504
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,490
causing Rundu's siege.

505
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,580
And you secretly
negotiated peace with Wutuo.

506
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,450
Everything you've done

507
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,090
serves only your personal gain.

508
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,970
He corrupts the court,

509
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,530
threatens the peace,

510
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,210
and damages the people!

511
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,610
His guilt is heinous!

512
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:34,930
He Yan.

513
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,730
You said Chancellor Xu was behind this.

514
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,690
Where's your proof?

515
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,570
He Yan speaks the truth.

516
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,250
I am the witness!

517
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:10,930
I have

518
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,890
long been Chancellor Xu's disciple,

519
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,010
and always respected him.

520
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,210
But over time,

521
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,210
I realized he

522
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,250
wasn't a virtuous minister

523
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,250
I believed.

524
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,610
But he has shown me great kindness.

525
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,650
I struggled for a long time,

526
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,610
yet I couldn't watch him
keep making mistakes.

527
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,610
So yesterday,

528
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,610
I caught the Wutuo spy

529
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,530
who's disguised
as Ganming Pavilion's owner.

530
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,610
After the interrogation,

531
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,170
he gave me

532
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,450
a letter

533
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,410
from Chancellor Xu

534
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,770
to Wutuo envoy, Maningbu.

535
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,850
He promises Maningbu

536
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,850
to promote
the trade market establishment.

537
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:06,690
Get it to me.

538
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,570
Yes.

539
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,830
(To Maningbu)

540
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:36,660
(Trade Market Cooperation, Xu Jingfu)

541
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,010
Now,

542
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,770
I've taken that Wutuo spy

543
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,250
outside the hall.

544
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,490
He can confront against

545
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,690
Envoy Maningbu.

546
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,050
Bring him.

547
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,490
No need.

548
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,690
You dare defy the imperial decree?

549
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,770
You have aged.

550
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:17,970
- He...
- What...

551
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,090
What does he want?

552
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,330
You're deceived by traitors,

553
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,930
believing slanders,

554
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,730
wronging loyal ministers!

555
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,490
This grieves me deeply.

556
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,450
As

557
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,490
the Chancellor of Wei,

558
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,330
I bear the duty to purge the villains

559
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,810
and eliminate treacherous officials!

560
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,410
Guards!

561
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,890
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

562
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:51,970
Purge the villains!

563
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,410
- He's committing treason!
- He's committing treason!

564
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:20,970
Xu Jingfu!

565
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,130
How dare you commit treason!

566
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,730
Your Majesty,

567
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,370
I've done

568
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,050
all those things.

569
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,730
You trust villains and alienated

570
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,170
worthy ministers like me,

571
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,570
failing to be a wise emperor.

572
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:48,650
Naturally, I must step forward

573
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,090
to uphold justice!

574
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,730
You treacherous rebel!

575
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,090
How dare you say such words

576
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,370
and plot to usurp the throne!

577
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:02,930
Your Majesty,

578
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,450
don't get me wrong.

579
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,690
I've been loyal to the nation.

580
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,730
Once you

581
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,850
issue a penitential edict

582
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,170
and abdicates,

583
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,050
I shall

584
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,970
enthrone the young prince,

585
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,130
purge the court,

586
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,010
and restore the governance!

587
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,770
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

588
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,890
Purge the villains!

589
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,450
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

590
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,370
Purge the villains!

591
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,810
Fuyue Army, heed my command!

592
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,650
Purge the villains!

593
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:07,650
You...

594
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,290
His Majesty has

595
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,050
asked the Nine Banners Battalion
to stand by

596
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,370
to subdue the rebels!

597
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,449
Nine Banners Battalion, heed my command!

598
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:14,969
Capture the traitors!

599
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:15,850
Yes!

600
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:16,489
Yes!

601
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,210
Nine Banners Battalion?

602
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,850
Why are they here?

603
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,090
Useless!

604
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,090
The rebels

605
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,530
have been suppressed.

606
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:44,690
He Rufei.

607
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,489
Most Fuyue Army soldiers

608
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,210
fought alongside me

609
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,730
through life and death.

610
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,290
He Rufei.

611
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,330
How could they

612
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,130
obey an impostor like you?

613
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,650
Great!

614
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,050
So Your Majesty

615
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,410
collaborated with Commander Xiao

616
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,970
in this deception!

617
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,410
Well played!

618
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,730
You have schemed thoroughly,

619
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,210
but overlooked your own arrogance.

620
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:36,650
Master,

621
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,650
you often taught me

622
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,290
to serve the emperor

623
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,210
and help the people.

624
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,610
Yet what you've done

625
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,290
threatens

626
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,530
the nation

627
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,890
and damages the people.

628
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,250
I beg you,

629
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,010
please stop.

630
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,450
Zilan,

631
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,370
I've treated you well.

632
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,650
How dare you join forces with them

633
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,170
to conspire against me!

634
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,650
What benefits

635
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,050
did they promise you

636
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,890
to make you

637
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,370
act so ungratefully

638
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,810
regardless my kindness to you?

639
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,290
You ingrate!

640
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,650
You preach benevolence,

641
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,690
but in my view,

642
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,410
you're just exploiting favors for gain.

643
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,810
National interests
outweigh personal favors.

644
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,090
As the Chancellor,

645
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,490
don't you know

646
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,410
such a basic idea?

647
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,370
Master,

648
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,210
just surrender.

649
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,530
Am I wrong?

650
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,930
Everything I've done

651
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,770
was for the Wei's

652
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,570
future!

653
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,610
You military officials

654
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,890
only resort to wars.

655
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,570
Aren't the soldiers who die in battle

656
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,010
the Wei's citizens?

657
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,170
Aren't the vast military funds

658
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,370
spent year after year

659
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,730
the hard-earned money of Wei's people?

660
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,690
You military officials

661
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,170
chase military glory,

662
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,690
while ignoring the people's suffering!

663
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,930
You're the true criminals of Wei!

664
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:43,850
Nonsense!

665
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,410
You were the one who started the war!

666
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,690
Our army surged
with unstoppable momentum

667
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,290
and crushed the Wutuo forces.

668
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,170
If we won

669
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,530
the Mingshui Battle,

670
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,730
the war would be concluded

671
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,010
and peace would come.

672
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,410
But you're blinded by personal ambition.

673
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,250
To eliminate dissidents,

674
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,810
you conspired with enemies,

675
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,970
sacrificing thousands

676
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,490
of Xiao Army soldiers!

677
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,530
Yet you didn't repent.

678
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,690
To cover your crimes,

679
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,970
you aided Wutuo, our enemy,

680
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,050
and exposed the Wei's people

681
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,690
to endless warfare!

682
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,410
Xu Jingfu.

683
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,770
You said what you've done

684
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,450
was for the Wei's future,

685
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,930
yet what you've done

686
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,570
serves only your personal gains.

687
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,850
Xiao Jue.

688
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,210
Don't you understand?

689
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,050
Military officials secure,
while civil officials govern.

690
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,850
What strategies

691
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,970
do you military officials

692
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,330
have, except for warfare?

693
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,410
Everything I've done

694
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,170
was for the Wei!

695
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,330
Your Majesty,

696
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,450
my loyalty is

697
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,850
beyond question!

698
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,850
If everyone had

699
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,330
such loyalty as yours,

700
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,810
then the nation

701
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,370
would be doomed.

702
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,210
Yan He.

703
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,250
Li Kuang.

704
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:26,730
Yes!

705
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,890
Take Xu Jingfu and He Rufei

706
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,050
into custody.

707
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,050
After the joint trial,

708
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,450
execute them.

709
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:35,770
Yes!

710
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,930
I'll walk myself.

711
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,370
Mr. Xiao.

712
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,650
How should we

713
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,810
deal with

714
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,130
this Envoy Maningbu?

715
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:30,690
Your Majesty,

716
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,130
since Maningbu represents Wutuo

717
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,490
as the envoy,

718
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,810
we should

719
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,810
detain him at the embassy,

720
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,010
and write to the King of Wutuo,

721
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,490
stating his crimes.

722
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,090
His disposition rests solely

723
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,330
on the King of Wutuo's response.

724
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,690
Move!

725
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:55,930
Marquis Wu'an.

726
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,210
Technically, you're from the He family.

727
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:00,570
The He family

728
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,090
disguised a daughter,

729
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,170
deceiving the Emperor.

730
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,730
