=Episode 33=

23
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,870
Your Majesty,

24
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,190
Maningbu

25
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,470
is an envoy of Wutuo.

26
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,670
I suggest we

27
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,070
detain him

28
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,030
at the embassy

29
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,390
and write to the King of Wutuo,

30
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,870
stating his crimes.

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,390
His disposition rests solely

32
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,670
on the King of Wutuo's response.

33
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,210
Go.

34
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,150
Strip the He family

35
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,990
of their noble titles.

36
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,150
He Yuansheng

37
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,790
will be exiled to the border.

38
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,550
Marquis Wu'an.

39
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,870
Technically, you're from the He family.

40
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,630
Your family

41
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,950
disguised you as a son.

42
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,829
You've also committed

43
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:17,990
a capital crime.

44
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,950
Your Majesty,

45
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,590
He Yan never had

46
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,630
the right to choose.

47
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,430
She didn't mean to deceive

48
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,030
Your Majesty.

49
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,870
Your Majesty,

50
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,470
Commander Xiao is right.

51
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,710
Besides, Marquis Wu'an

52
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,150
is an exceptional talent

53
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,870
who has repeatedly

54
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,710
defeated Wutuo's armies

55
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,110
and defended the nation.

56
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,230
I implore Your Majesty's mercy.

57
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,150
But even so,

58
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,510
she wasn't entirely

59
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,110
ignorant about this matter.

60
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,910
Instead of behaving,

61
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,470
she chose to enlist.

62
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,110
Doesn't she know

63
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,829
this compounds her crimes?

64
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,550
Don't tell me

65
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,910
you joined the army

66
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,110
solely out of patriotism.

67
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,990
Not entirely.

68
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,310
Your Majesty.

69
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,830
One day,

70
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,590
I overheard my father

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,830
arranging a marriage for me.

72
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,150
So I fled home.

73
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,910
Meanwhile, becoming a great general

74
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,510
had always been my aspiration.

75
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,230
So I went straight to enlist

76
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,630
without hesitation.

77
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,310
Why did you enlist again

78
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,630
after you survived death?

79
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,590
Were you waiting for this day

80
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,230
to seek revenge?

81
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:20,950
Your Majesty,

82
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,510
she never intended that.

83
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,750
Let her speak for herself.

84
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,150
Your Majesty,

85
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,750
I do

86
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,550
resent their cruelty,

87
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,750
but after all,

88
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,870
they raised me for many years.

89
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,829
I'm no longer in debt

90
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,110
after what has happened to me.

91
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,710
I don't want revenge.

92
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,829
Besides,

93
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,190
what would revenge accomplish?

94
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,630
I only wanted

95
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,070
to reclaim my true identity.

96
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,790
That's why I rejoined the army.

97
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,990
If I hadn't

98
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,110
uncovered

99
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,110
the conspiracy

100
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,630
and decided

101
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,829
to seek justice for my deceased

102
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,870
fellow soldiers,

103
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,470
I would have remained

104
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,230
as He Yan of Yezhou Garrison,

105
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,550
who would

106
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,990
eventually die

107
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,470
as Female General He Yan of Wei.

108
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:11,870
Your Majesty,

109
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,150
He Yan's merits outweigh

110
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,790
her minor mistakes.

111
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,230
She defended our borders

112
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,829
and martial dignity

113
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,589
at the Fuyue Army.

114
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,149
At Yezhou Garrison,

115
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,390
she went around

116
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,590
to defend our territory.

117
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,870
It proves that

118
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,390
her military resolve has never wavered.

119
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,070
Her loyalty to Wei

120
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,310
remains steadfast.

121
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,950
Your Majesty,

122
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,190
given her unwavering loyalty to you

123
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,510
and her dedication

124
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,790
to serving Wei,

125
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,830
please show mercy.

126
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,670
Your Majesty,

127
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,150
Commander Xiao is right.

128
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,390
Marquis Wu'an

129
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,510
helped Your Majesty

130
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,070
purge corrupt officials

131
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,190
today in court.

132
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,310
Why not offset merits against faults

133
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,270
to demonstrate

134
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,670
your appreciation for talent

135
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,630
and your wisdom

136
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,870
in just rewards and punishments?

137
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,790
What do you say, my ministers?

138
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,030
Your Majesty,

139
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,670
I believe

140
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,390
that General Fengyun and Mr. Chu

141
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,510
make valid arguments.

142
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,670
Marquis Wu'an

143
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,470
is truly an exceptional general.

144
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,150
Now that the truth is revealed,

145
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,950
General He should be reinstated

146
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,390
to revive the Fuyue Army.

147
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,470
Moreover,

148
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,470
with the truth revealed,

149
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,830
I propose

150
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,670
rehabilitating the Xiao family

151
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,310
to stabilize military morale.

152
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,030
You've rushed

153
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,870
to say all the good things.

154
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,750
Rest assured.

155
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,430
I was merely jesting.

156
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,140
Of course,

157
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,470
I won't let my loyal ministers down.

158
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,870
Mr. Xiao,

159
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,310
I will draft an edict shortly

160
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,470
to rehabilitate
the Xiao family and the Xiao Army.

161
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,830
Thank you, Your Majesty.

162
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,870
Marquis Wu'an,

163
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,070
you are no less capable than any man.

164
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,870
Resume your title as General Feihong.

165
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,790
I hope you

166
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,150
could uphold Wei's military honor,

167
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,670
guard our borders,

168
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,190
and protect our people.

169
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,350
Understood.

170
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,590
Thank you,

171
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,670
Your Majesty.

172
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,510
Chu Zhao,

173
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,190
you helped the generals

174
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,710
with Xu Jingfu's case.

175
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,910
You did a good job.

176
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,230
I hereby make you

177
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,190
Vice Director of the Secretariat.

178
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,110
Thank you, Your Majesty.

179
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,430
Let me go.

180
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,950
You can't arrest me.

181
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,760
(General Feihong's Mansion)
My son is General Feihong.

182
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,430
Hurry!

183
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,470
Let me go!

184
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,070
My daughter is Marquis Wu'an!

185
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,030
Master.

186
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,630
You can't take me.

187

Department of State Affairs)

188

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,450
(Sealed by Wei's

190
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,760
Move.

191

Hurry up.

192
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,470
Go.

193
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,030
How dare you!

194
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,380
My father is the Chancellor.

195
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,630
Show some respect.

196
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,230
Do you know who I am?

197
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,950
All of you, get out!

198
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,230
Step aside.

199
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,390
That's my chest.

200
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,790
Get lost.

201
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,390
You... My maids.

202
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,990
Let them go.

203
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,510
Move aside.

204
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,430
Miss.

205
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,150
Don't take that.

206
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,550
Those are my father's favorites.

207
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,330
Let go.

208
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,830
Listen, Miss Xu.

209
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,670
Let go.

210
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,270
Xu Jingfu's been thrown into prison,

211
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,350
and your property is confiscated.

212
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,909
Do you still think

213
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,790
you're the chancellor's daughter?

214
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,750
He used to

215
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,430
boss us around.

216
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,430
Meanwhile,

217
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,510
he conspired with enemies.

218
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,870
He deserves no chancellor title.

219
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,310
Nonsense.

220
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,830
My father will punish you.

221
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,190
Miss Xu,

222
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,630
if Mr. Chu hadn't been kind enough

223
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,470
to plead your case to His Majesty,

224
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,910
do you think

225
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,070
you'd still be bossing us around?

226
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,630
You would've been sent to a brothel.

227
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,110
Nonsense.

228
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,670
You...

229
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,340
You...

230
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,630
Stay away from me.

231
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,390
Stay away from me.

232
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,020
Miss.

233
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,230
Mr. Chu.

234
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,990
Mr. Chu, I apologize.

235
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,830
I apologize.

236
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,110
I apologize.

237
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:48,910
Hurry.

238
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,110
Arrest them all.

239
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,470
Punish them!

240
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,430
Why aren't you speaking?

241
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,750
Could it be...?

242
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,870
Could it be that what they said...

243
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,230
is true?

244
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,030
No way.

245
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,630
No way.

246
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,550
They...

247
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,630
They framed my father.

248
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,590
I'll kill them.

249
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,110
I'll kill them.

250
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,310
Pingting.

251
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,550
Calm down, Pingting.

252
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,270
Kill them for me.

253
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,790
Your father would be worried.

254
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,310
Why are you still here?

255
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,510
Get my father out now.

256
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,950
Alright, I promise you.

257
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:28,870
Don't worry.

258
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,670
I'll bring

259
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,590
your father back.

260
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,150
They're here for work.

261
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,630
Come with me first.

262
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,270
Alright?

263
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,190
Why should I leave?

264
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,070
This is my home.

265
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,190
Make them...

266
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,110
Make them...

267
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,750
Make them get out of here.

268
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,670
I'm worried about you.

269
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,310
Your father isn't here.

270
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,470
You're alone.

271
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,870
I couldn't be at ease.

272
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,030
Then I couldn't focus on

273
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,390
getting Master out.

274
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,590
Come with me.

275
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,390
Okay?

276
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,110
Alright.

277
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,070
I... I'll go with you.

278
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,350
I... I won't distract you.

279
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,310
Please,

280
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,070
bring my father back.

281
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,950
Alright.

282
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,310
Sorry for the trouble.

283
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,950
I'll take her away.

284
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,830
- Understood.
- Understood.

285
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:15,950
Let's go.

286
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,040
(Chu Mansion)

287
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,030
Miss Xu.

288
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,230
This is the guest room for you.

289
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,550
If you need

290
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,430
anything,

291
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,150
feel free to tell me.

292
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,390
Arrest all those

293
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,230
who framed

294
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,070
my father

295
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,310
and bring my father back.

296
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,030
Once he's out,

297
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,070
we can start

298
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,150
planning our wedding.

299
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,950
Don't worry.

300
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,150
I'll find a way to save your father.

301
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,390
Pingting.

302
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,430
Settle in for now.

303
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,310
Miss Xu.

304
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,710
Please go ahead.

305
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,710
Alright.

306
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,030
Your Majesty.

307
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,870
My master shows no remorse

308
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:29,990
for his crimes.

309
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,870
Please allow me

310
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,430
to visit the prison

311
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,990
and bid him farewell

312
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,190
after the final trial.

313
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,230
And my master's daughter Xu Pingting

314
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,350
knows nothing about his deeds.

315
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,270
Please show mercy, Your Majesty.

316
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,230
You never liked Miss Xu.

317
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,190
Why did you plead for her?

318
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,790
You're inviting trouble.

319
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,470
Master is arrested,

320
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,190
awaiting trials.

321
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,310
His followers will surely

322
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,630
stir things up

323
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,790
in the court.

324
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,550
I am protecting

325
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,870
Xu Pingting

326
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,030
to keep those people calm.

327
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,030
They'll remain compliant

328
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,430
for their own sake.

329
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,670
Besides,

330
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,670
my mother died in despair

331
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,750
because no one offered her help.

332
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,630

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,110
we'll pack immediately

392
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,790
and join you.

393
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,670
They're my comrades.

394
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,710
Be nice.

395
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,510
They're also

396
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,670
my soldiers.

397
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,670
Anyway,

398
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,590
thank you.

399
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,750
W-We are...

400
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,310
- Buddies.
- Buddies.

401
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,950
You're buddies.

402
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,710
Are we excluded?

403
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,790
So you had it all planned

404
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,349
and didn't tell me.

405
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,550
Luckily, I recognized Feinu.

406
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,710
Otherwise,

407
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,430
I would've been fooled.

408
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,990
You couldn't tell?

409
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,750
So you're truly a fool.

410
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,830
Xiao Jue.

411
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,710
You haven't changed at all.

412
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,150
Keep defending her.

413
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,110
You were kept in the dark too.

414
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,950
Say something.

415
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,310
The Fuyue Army

416
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,150
will always fulfill

417
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:41,950
the orders

418
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,950
of General Feihong.

419
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,470
You are magnanimous, General Yan.

420
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,630
Please forgive us.

421
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,740
Forget it.

422
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,110
I am magnanimous.

423
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,030
Give me 10 jin of prenatal tonic

424
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,350
for Xiu.

425
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,630
Then we're cool.

426
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,150
Ten jin?

427
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,500
Yeah.

428
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,670
I can keep

429
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,350
the leftovers for next time.

430
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,070
Ten jin it is.

431
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,230
Consider it done.

432
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,270
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

433
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,870
Yan.

434
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,110
Why would you ask him?

435
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,070
I got this.

436
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:21,950
Yan.

437
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,750
So you're General Feihong.

438
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,150
I truly admire you.

439
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,680
Commander.

440
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,310
The edict came.

441
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,870
(Imperial Edict)
His Majesty

442
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:37,910
decrees

443
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,030
that Xiao Zhongwu,
commander of the Xiao Army,

444
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,830
demonstrated loyalty

445
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,430
and diligence.

446
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,350
He dedicated himself to the nation

447
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,030
until his last breath.

448
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,150
Yet he was framed
by treacherous officials

449
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,670
and suffered injustice.

450
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,510
With the villain brought to justice,

451
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,070
his name is cleared.

452
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,230
I hereby confer

453
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,230
Xiao Zhongwu the title of
Loyal and Valiant General.

454
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,350
A proper reburial rite
shall be conducted to honor him.

455
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,470
Furthermore,

456
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,790
General Fengyun, Xiao Jue,
shall be promoted

457
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,790
as commander of the Xiao Army

458
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,030
to restore its military prestige.

459
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,870
By Imperial Decree.

460
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,710
- We thank His Majesty.
- We thank His Majesty.

461
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,070
Today, the world will learn about

462
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,350
the injustice you've suffered.

463
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,990
This edict was scheduled to be delivered

464
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,910
by the Chief Eunuch in person.

465
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,630
But I thought you'd be

466
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,990
anticipating.

467
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,070
So I asked for permission
to expedite delivery.

468
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,750
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

469
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,870
I lacked judgment

470
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,670
and became Xu Jingfu's blade in the end.

471
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,430
To think...

472
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,830
I let the souls of loyal men

473
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,710
be wronged.

474
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,110
Farewell.

475
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,290
(Late Father Xiao Zhongwu,
Late Mother Song Wan)

476
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,440
(Xiao Family Ancestral Hall)

477
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,670
Ancestors of the Xiao family,

478
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,270
the villain has been brought to justice.

479
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,630
The grievances we have suffered

480
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,750
are finally redressed.

481
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,030
May all you heroic spirits

482
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,470
rest in peace.

483
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,990
Ancestors of the Xiao family,

484
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,670
from now on, we will

485
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,630
unite our efforts

486
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,630
to uphold the family honor.

487
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,550
And revitalize the Xiao Army.

488
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,110
I once said

489
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,430
that I had found

490
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,590
my soulmate

491
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,950
and promised to bring her here.

492
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,990
(Late Father Xiao Zhongwu,
Late Mother Song Wan)

493
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,310
I brought her here.

494
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,470
She's standing right next to me.

495
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,750
Her name is He Yan.

496
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,670
General Xiao.

497
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,070
(Late Father Xiao Zhongwu)
You gave me the Qinglang Sword

498
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,950
at Xianchang Academy.

499
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,470
Your inspiring words

500
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,990
still echo in my ears.

501
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,030
We've achieved our goal.

502
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,350
And we will

503
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,510
stay true to our aspirations.

504
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,110
(Late Father, Late Mother)
General Xiao. Madam.

505
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,910
Rest assured.

506
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,630
I will take care of Huaijin.

507
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,790
After the storm comes sunshine.

508
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,390
It seems we'll celebrate a wedding soon.

509
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,310
He impersonated General Feihong.

510
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,550
Such audacity!

511
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,630
(Notice: Treason)
They must die.

512
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,510
Execute them.

513
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,670
Deserved it!

514
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,560
(Notice: He Rufei and Xu Jingfu's
Treason Charges)

515
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,430
Sister, you came to see me?

516
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,230
Are you here to mock my downfall?

517
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,870
How dare you

518
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,870
laugh at me, the general?

519
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,710
He Yan.

520
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,430
I ended up like this

521
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,750
all because of you.

522
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,030
Why is everyone

523
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,830
outraged on your behalf?

524
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,430
What about me?

525
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,470
What about me?

526
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,510
You stole my identity

527
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,750
to go to the academy, join the army,

528
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,910
and earn glory.

529
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,750
If you weren't

530
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,590
known as the He family's
legitimate heir,

531
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,310
who would've recognized you?

532
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,670
A caged canary from the inner chambers

533
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,310
could never accomplish anything.

534
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,150
But I

535
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,310
am He Rufei.

536
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,750
I am

537
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,350
General Feihong.

538
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,350
Why deceive yourself?

539
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,110
He Yan got enlisted twice,

540
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,750
starting as a rookie every time.

541
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,670
She earned

542
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,470
her glory through

543
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,110
relentless training.

544
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,710
She earned

545
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,190
her glory

546
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,910
by risking her life on the battlefield.

547
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,430
You think she stole your thunder?

548
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,870
Weren't you going about

549
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,590
in the camp and court

550
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,070
in that domineering manner

551
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,910
thanks to her achievements?

552
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,990
Nonsense!

553
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,030
Who is she?

554
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,030
She's just my substitute.

555
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,630
Everything she possesses now

556
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,270
rightfully belongs to me!

557
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,350
Really?

558
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,190
Then why don't you prove yourself

559
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,710
and start over?

560
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,550
Because you stole my life.

561
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,790
You stole my identity.

562
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,150
I've lost all chances.

563
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,110
No.

564
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,350
It's because you dare not.

565
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,230
Nonsense.

566
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,430
You don't have the guts.

567
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,230
But I do.

568
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,430
You keep saying that

569
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,590
I've achieved everything

570
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,870
by posing

571
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,190
as He Rufei.

572
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,350
But after that poisoned tea,

573
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,270
the course of fate changed.

574
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,870
My presence here today

575
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,030
is the ultimate proof.

576
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,710
Whether as He Rufei

577
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,750
or He Yan,

578
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,350
I'm here

579
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,550
to tell you that

580
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,990
regardless of my name

581
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,430
or gender,

582
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,110
I would always

583
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,110
become General Feihong.

584
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:53,910
Stop!

585
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,790
Come back!

586
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,430
Why are you leaving? Come back!

587
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,150
Don't you want to kill me?

588
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,910
Aren't you here to kill me?

589
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,790
Do it!

590
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,150
You're unworthy.

591
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,390
You'll pay for your crimes.

592
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,710
You will

593
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,950
be executed in public

594
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,670
and be condemned

595
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,710
by all the Wei people.

596
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,310
In the afterworld,

597
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,510
countless fallen souls

598
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,510
of Wei soldiers

599
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,550
and the Xiao Army's warriors

600
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,270
will deliver your final judgment.

601
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,950
You think I'm scared?

602
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,910
Get back here.

603
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,430
That's my life.

604
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,910
You owe me.

605
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,830
They owe me!

606
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,150
I am General Feihong.

607
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,670
I am General Feihong.

608
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,750
I am General Feihong!

609
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,110
I am General Feihong.

610
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,590
I am General Feihong.

611
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,950
I am General Feihong.

612
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,270
I am General Feihong. I...

613
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,620
(Court of Judicial Review)

614
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,670
Commander.

615
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,670
Ambushing isn't honorable.

616
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,590
All's fair in war.

617
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,030
To me,

618
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,630
you are just you.

619
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,350
Beyond titles

620
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,230
or names.

621
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,870
That's how I feel about you, too.

622
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,190
Miss He.

623
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,510
Mr. Chu.

624
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:02,950
Miss He.

625
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,630
Why are you here?

626
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,510
To visit an acquaintance.

627
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,390
And why are you here, Mr. Chu?

628
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,070
To see my master.

629
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:02,990
Master,

630
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,590
I'm here to visit.

631
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,950
Zilan.

632
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,510
All these years,

633
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,430
I've been guiding you wholeheartedly

634
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,670
and pouring resources

635
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,070
into your career.

636
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,550
How could you repay kindness

637
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,550
with betrayal?

638
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,950
You are mistaken.

639
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,950
You have been nothing but nice to me.

640
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,870
But when it comes

641
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,590
to the interest of our nation,

642
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,630
we both know

643
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,270
what weighs more.

644
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,910
You taught me to be loyal

645
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,350
and to care for the people.

646
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,910
And what happened?

647
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,470
You have forgotten

648
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,270
what you once

649
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,550
taught me.

650
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,750
As the Chancellor of Wei,

651
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,270
you plotted treason
and framed loyal officials

652
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,230
for personal gain.

653
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,110
Therefore, I had no choice

654
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,230
but to prioritize justice
over personal bonds.

655
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,430
You ungrateful wretch

656
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,710
and villainous traitor.

657
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,230
How dare you frame

658
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:29,390
such hypocrisy as noble speech?

659
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,590
I shouldn't have

660
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,470
dragged you out of your messy family

661
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,470
just because you were talented.

662
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,360
The truth has been revealed.

663
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,910
Master,

664
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,310
must you persist in your mistakes,

665
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,470
plunging yourself

666
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,070
into an abyss of ruin?

667
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,030
Alright.

668
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,990
You're truly my outstanding disciple,

669
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,710
prioritizing self-preservation.

670
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,670
The disciple surpasses the master.

671
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,670
As your disciple,

672
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,910
I've never sought

673
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,870
to surpass you.

674
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,590
I merely strive for

675
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,510
a clear conscience.

676
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,310
But between gratitude and my duties,

677
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,310
for the nation

678
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,710
and the people,

679
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,350
I had no choice

680
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,750
but to betray your nurturing grace.

681
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,270
Enough.

682
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,870
There is no turning back now.

683
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,710
Zilan,

684
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,030
I ask only one thing.

685
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,870
Be nice to my daughter.

686
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,390
Pingting

687
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:16,150
genuinely likes you.

688
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,870
Miss Xu may like me,

689
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,510
but I've never returned her affections.

690
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,590
But rest assured,

691
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,590
I won't implicate the innocent.

692
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,370
(Chu Mansion)

693
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,110
Having known warmth,

694
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,830
who would willingly let it go?

695
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,790
They say

696
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,190
you turned

697
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,070
against my father in court.

698
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,030
It's a lie.

699
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,620
Right?

700
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,110
It's true.

701
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,430
That day,

702
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,910
when you

703
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,550
promised to save my father,

704
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,830
were you lying to me?

705
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,550
Chu Zhao.

706
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,110
My father treated you so well.

707
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,830
He was your master.

708
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,550
How could you betray him?

709
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,390
You imprudent maid!

710
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,270
Miss Xu,

711
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,350
you'd better behave.

712
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,510
Or I wouldn't mind being more imprudent.

713
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,830
How did I betray him?

714
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,030
Pingting,

715
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,590
he may have been

716
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,910
a devoted father to you.

717
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,110
But to Wei,

718
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,910
he was an irredeemable traitor.

719
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,230
Aiding him

720
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,110
would make me a real traitor.

721
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,510
Pingting,

722
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,030
guard your words from now on

723
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,950
lest you bring disaster.

724
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,750
Nonsense.

725
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,710
Now I get it.

726
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,510
Now I get it.

727
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,750
You never loved me.

728
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,310
I was stupid enough to think

729
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,590
my sincerity had touched you.

730
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,910
Chu Zhao,

731
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,030
have you ever spoken an honest sentence?

732
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,470
You are simply

733
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,230
an ungrateful wretch!

734
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:09,550
Pingting,

735
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,510
I promised your father

736
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,510
to care for you.

737
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,350
Rest assured and stay here.

738
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,550
Who wants your pity?

739
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,950
Escort Miss Xu back.

740
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,710
Understood.

741
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,390
Mr. Chu, you're truly talented,

742
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,710
clearly chancellor material.

743
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,910
You flatter me.

744
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,150
Mr. Wei, you overestimate my worth.

745
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,950
Appearance indeed transforms people.

746
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,190
Not long ago,

747
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,670
she was a soldier in Yezhou Garrison.

748
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,750
Now, suddenly,

749
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,070
she's become a general.

750
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,550
With General Fengyun's help,

751
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,470
her future is truly promising.

752
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,710
She was always a general.

753
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,550
As a gem obscured by dust,

754
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,310
she needs no one's help.

755
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,430
General Feihong.

756
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,070
General Fengyun.

757
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,190
I forgot to congratulate you.

758
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,510
Let me make up now.

759
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,710
To make up,

760
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,430
empty words won't suffice.

761
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,870
Your salary exceeds mine.

762
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,950
You should treat me to a fine meal.

763
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,550
You've made the request.

764
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,870
We certainly shouldn't be stingy.

765
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,030
The traitors were brought

766
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,390
to justice largely with your help.

767
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,470
Let us

768
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,150
treat you to a feast someday.

769
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,790
To dine with General Feihong

770
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,350
and General Fengyun

771
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,070
would be the greatest honor.

772
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,510
The court assembly is about to start.

773
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,270
Let's hurry to the hall.

774
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,870
We're sending Maningbu away today.

775
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,470
Let's show him

776
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,150
the morale of us Wei officials.

777
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,950
I received

778
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,470
the alliance proposal
of the King of Wutuo.

779
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,870
Since Wutuo shows such sincerity,

780
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,990
we won't

781
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,910
hold grudges against you.

782
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,190
I will discuss with my ministers

783
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,630
where to set up trade markets.

784
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,590
Meanwhile, profits

785
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,070
follow the agreed terms.

786
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,790
Wei takes 70 percent,

787
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,510
Wutuo 30.

788
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,670
You may

789
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,990
return assured, Envoy.

790
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

791
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,830
Wutuo spared no expense

792
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,390
to save Maningbu.

793
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,470
His Majesty

794
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,790
did that to dampen

795
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,710
Wutuo's arrogance.

796
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,230
Courtesy before force.

797
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,070
As long as Wutuo doesn't invade,

798
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,790
our army and people can take a break.

799
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,910
Our people

800
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,470
can live peacefully.

801
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,110
But the Wutuo troops are cunning.

802
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,630
We mustn't relax

803
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,110
our military defenses.

804
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,070
Stay prepared for all changes.

805
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,950
Under war's shadow,

806
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,310
people always suffer the most.

807
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,710
If peace reigns,

808
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,510
I'd gladly retire.

809
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,190
But I intend to be a great general.

810
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:40,670
How about this?

811
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,030
I'll support you.
